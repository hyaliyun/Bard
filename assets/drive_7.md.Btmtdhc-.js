Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: According to the passage, how has the concept of Yiddishkeit evolved from its traditional roots to its modern interpretation among Ashkenazi Jews?  This question prompts students to understand the shift in Yiddishkeit's definition and practices, from strictly observing Jewish Law and engaging in Torah and Talmud study to a broader range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions that help maintain a sense of Jewishness in various aspects of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

James II and VII (14 October 1633 – 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland.  The second surviving son of Charles I, he ascended the throne upon the death of his brother, Charles II. Members of Britain's Protestant political elite increasingly suspected him of being pro-French and pro-Catholic and of having designs on becoming an absolute monarch. When he produced a Catholic heir, a son called James Francis Edward, leading nobles called on his Protestant son-in-law and nephew William III of Orange to land an invasion army from the Dutch Republic, which he did in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. James fled England (and thus was held to have abdicated). He was replaced by his eldest, Protestant daughter Mary II and her husband, William III. James made one serious attempt to recover his crowns from William and Mary when he landed in Ireland in 1689.

If The resort sits on the east side of the wide bay, with the cruise port on the west., can we conclude that \\"The resort is positioned on the eastern area of the broad bay. \\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"The resort is positioned on the eastern area of the broad bay.\\" The given statement \\"The resort sits on the east side of the wide bay, with the cruise port on the west\\" provides sufficient information to infer the position of the resort.  To break down the original statement and its implications, let us first analyze it in parts: 1. \\"The resort sits on the east side of the wide bay\\": This part tells us that the resort is located at the eastern edge of the bay, which is described as \\"wide.\\" This suggests that the bay has a considerable expanse or size, further reinforcing the notion of the resort's positioning towards the eastern part of it. 2. \\"With the cruise port on the west\\": This component informs us that there is a cruise port located on the west side of the bay. The fact that the cruise port is situated on the opposite end of the resort indicates that the resort is not close to the cruise port, and by logical extension, the resort's distance from the eastern edge of the bay is significant. Integrating these two observations allows us to conclusively determine that the resort is positioned on the eastern area of the broad bay. The statement indirectly highlights certain features of the bay – namely, its size (broad or wide) and the geographical distance between the resort and the cruise port (east and west, respectively). In summary, by analyzing the original statement and its implications, we can confidently conclude that \\"The resort is positioned on the eastern area of the broad bay,\\" as it is consistent with the information given. This positioning also creates a mental image of the resort and the cruise port occupying opposite ends of the bay, highlighting their geographical separation based on the features of the bay and surrounding area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Bloomberg said he fears a scenario where his candidacy leads to Donald Trump or Ted Cruz being elected. | Getty Michael Bloomberg won't mount a presidential bid The former mayor says the math doesn't add up for him, while bashing Trump and Cruz as dangerous for America.      Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced on Monday that he will not mount a presidential run this year, saying he doesn't want to pave the way for Donald Trump or Ted Cruz to win the White House.      Bloomberg's decision to back away from an independent bid is a relief for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who could have seen support bleed over to Bloomberg in a three-way race.      Story Continued Below      In an editorial he posted on Monday, Bloomberg said that if he had run, it was unlikely that any candidate would win a majority of electoral votes and that the responsibility of choosing the next president would be kicked to Congress.      \\"As the race stands now, with Republicans in charge of both Houses, there is a good chance that my candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. That is not a risk I can take in good conscience,\\" Bloomberg said.      \\"We cannot 'make America great again' by turning our backs on the values that made us the world’s greatest nation in the first place. I love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future -- and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States.\\"      Bloomberg, who served as mayor from 2002 through 2013, confirmed in early February that he was flirting with a presidential bid because he was unhappy with the extremes that had emerged this election cycle.      On Monday, he said he was not ready to endorse, but that he would remain involved in this political season.      \\"I will continue urging all voters to reject divisive appeals and demanding that candidates offer intelligent, specific and realistic ideas for bridging divides, solving problems, and giving us the honest and capable government we deserve,\\" Bloomberg said.      Bloomberg, who has evolved from a Democrat to a Republican to an Independent, has staked out his more recent political posture by focusing on gun control through his advocacy group.      He said he was motivated to consider an independent bid not only because of Trump and Cruz but also because of Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who has pledged to break up Wall Street banks — a direct threat to his financial data and media empire.      Sanders said Monday that it was good another billionaire wasn't entering the race. \\"I think it's a bad idea for American democracy that the only people who feel in many ways that they can run for president are people who have so much money,\\" he said during a Fox News town hall.      Clinton, also speaking at Fox's town hall, said she has the \\"greatest respect\\" for Bloomberg. \\"He has to make his own decisions,\\" she said. \\"I look forward to continuing to work with him, and finding ways he can show leadership as he has done so well.\\"      The former mayor and business titan was considering throwing 1 billion toward a presidential run and had set a March deadline for himself. The New York Times reported on Monday that Bloomberg was strongly considering Michael Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as his running mate before ultimately deciding there was no path for him. The window was also closing for Bloomberg to appear on the ballot in many states.      A recent analysis by veteran pollster Jan van Lohuizen concluded that an independent candidate would be “unlikely” to win the White House unless he or she was able to completely run the table in November.      Early polling also showed that Bloomberg suffered from a public perception problem. An Iowa poll conducted for Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register in January found that just 17 percent of Democrats and only 9 percent of Republicans had a “favorable” view of the former mayor.      Howard Wolfson, a Democratic political strategist and counselor to Bloomberg, said on MSNBC on Monday afternoon that it's now clear Clinton will likely be the nominee and that while Bloomberg is a compelling candidate, he is \\"not compelling enough given the structural impediments against a third-party candidate.”      Bloomberg himself said that the math just didn’t add up for him.      “But when I look at the data, it’s clear to me that if I entered the race, I could not win. I believe I could win a number of diverse states -- but not enough to win the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the presidency,” he said.      Bloomberg did not mention Sanders in his editorial, but he took plenty of shots at Trump and Cruz.      “I have known Mr. Trump casually for many years, and we have always been on friendly terms. I even agreed to appear on ‘The Apprentice’ -- twice. But he has run the most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign I can remember, preying on people’s prejudices and fears,” Bloomberg said. “Abraham Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party, appealed to our ‘better angels.’ Trump appeals to our worst impulses.”      He added Cruz isn’t much better.      “Senator Cruz’s pandering on immigration may lack Trump’s rhetorical excess, but it is no less extreme. His refusal to oppose banning foreigners based on their religion may be less bombastic than Trump’s position, but it is no less divisive,” he said.      Eliza Collins contributed to this report.      Authors: ||||| They covertly assembled several dozen strategists and staff members, conducted polling in 22 states, drafted a website, produced television ads and set up campaign offices in Texas and North Carolina, where the process of gathering petitions to put Mr. Bloomberg’s name on the ballot would have begun in days.      Mr. Bloomberg held extensive talks with Michael G. Mullen, the retired admiral and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about forming an independent ticket. Lawyers for Mr. Bloomberg had completed the process of vetting Mr. Mullen, and all that remained was for Mr. Bloomberg to ask formally that Mr. Mullen serve as his running mate.      Torn between his aspiration and a mountain of data showing that the path for an independent campaign aimed at the political center was slim and narrowing, Mr. Bloomberg, 74, ultimately abandoned what would probably have been his last chance to run for the White House.      Had both Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont appeared headed toward victory in the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries, Mr. Bloomberg was determined to run, according to his advisers, several of whom insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about confidential discussions.      But Mr. Bloomberg balked at the prospect of a race against Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, who has established a dominant lead over Mr. Sanders on the Democratic side. In his column, Mr. Bloomberg said he could not in good conscience enter a race that could lead to a deadlock in the Electoral College — and to the election of Mr. Trump, or perhaps Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. ||||| Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. He is the UN secretary-general’s special envoy for cities and climate change.      Americans today face a profound challenge to preserve our common values and national promise.      Wage stagnation at home and our declining influence abroad have left Americans angry and frustrated. And yet Washington, D.C., offers nothing but gridlock and partisan finger-pointing.      Worse, the current presidential candidates are offering scapegoats instead of solutions, and they are promising results that they can’t possibly deliver. Rather than explaining how they will break the fever of partisanship that is crippling Washington, they are doubling down on dysfunction.      Over the course of American history, both parties have tended to nominate presidential candidates who stay close to and build from the center. But that tradition may be breaking down. Extremism is on the march, and unless we stop it, our problems at home and abroad will grow worse.      Many Americans are understandably dismayed by this, and I share their concerns. The leading Democratic candidates have attacked policies that spurred growth and opportunity under President Bill Clinton -- support for trade, charter schools, deficit reduction and the financial sector. Meanwhile, the leading Republican candidates have attacked policies that spurred growth and opportunity under President Ronald Reagan, including immigration reform, compromise on taxes and entitlement reform, and support for bipartisan budgets. Both presidents were problem-solvers, not ideological purists. And both moved the country forward in important ways.      Over the last several months, many Americans have urged me to run for president as an independent, and some who don’t like the current candidates have said it is my patriotic duty to do so. I appreciate their appeals, and I have given the question serious consideration. The deadline to answer it is now, because of ballot access requirements.      My parents taught me about the importance of giving back, and public service has been an important part of my life. After 12 years as mayor of New York City, I know the personal sacrifices that campaigns and elected office require, and I would gladly make them again in order to help the country I love.      I’ve always been drawn to impossible challenges, and none today is greater or more important than ending the partisan war in Washington and making government work for the American people -- not lobbyists and campaign donors. Bringing about this change will require electing leaders who are more focused on getting results than winning re-election, who have experience building small businesses and creating jobs, who know how to balance budgets and manage large organizations, who aren’t beholden to special interests -- and who are honest with the public at every turn. I’m flattered that some think I could provide this kind of leadership.      But when I look at the data, it’s clear to me that if I entered the race, I could not win. I believe I could win a number of diverse states -- but not enough to win the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the presidency.      In a three-way race, it’s unlikely any candidate would win a majority of electoral votes, and then the power to choose the president would be taken out of the hands of the American people and thrown to Congress. The fact is, even if I were to receive the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, victory would be highly unlikely, because most members of Congress would vote for their party’s nominee. Party loyalists in Congress -- not the American people or the Electoral College -- would determine the next president.      As the race stands now, with Republicans in charge of both Houses, there is a good chance that my candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. That is not a risk I can take in good conscience.      I have known Mr. Trump casually for many years, and we have always been on friendly terms. I even agreed to appear on “The Apprentice” -- twice. But he has run the most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign I can remember, preying on people’s prejudices and fears. Abraham Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party, appealed to our “better angels.” Trump appeals to our worst impulses.      Threatening to bar foreign Muslims from entering the country is a direct assault on two of the core values that gave rise to our nation: religious tolerance and the separation of church and state. Attacking and promising to deport millions of Mexicans, feigning ignorance of white supremacists, and threatening China and Japan with a trade war are all dangerously wrong, too. These moves would divide us at home and compromise our moral leadership around the world. The end result would be to embolden our enemies, threaten the security of our allies, and put our own men and women in uniform at greater risk.      Senator Cruz’s pandering on immigration may lack Trump’s rhetorical excess, but it is no less extreme. His refusal to oppose banning foreigners based on their religion may be less bombastic than Trump’s position, but it is no less divisive.      We cannot “make America great again” by turning our backs on the values that made us the world’s greatest nation in the first place. I love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future -- and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States.      However, nor will I stay silent about the threat that partisan extremism poses to our nation. I am not ready to endorse any candidate, but I will continue urging all voters to reject divisive appeals and demanding that candidates offer intelligent, specific and realistic ideas for bridging divides, solving problems, and giving us the honest and capable government we deserve.      For most Americans, citizenship requires little more than paying taxes. But many have given their lives to defend our nation -- and all of us have an obligation as voters to stand up on behalf of ideas and principles that, as Lincoln said, represent “the last best hope of earth.” I hope and pray I’m doing that.

Jerilee, though doubtful about the intentions, takes up the job to achieve her dream. The middle part of the plot is about struggle, success, doubt, and personal alliances in her new job.  Step 4: Climax However, after some time, Jerilee finds Vincent exploiting his new writers. This causes a rift between the two, leading to an explosive confrontation. Jerilee quits her job and exposes Vincent's wrongdoings. Step 5: Conclusion The plot then concludes with Jerilee, using her experience and the skills she learned while working with Vincent, opening her own publishing house. She makes sure to give new writers the treatment they deserve. In the end, Jerilee proves that those who devote themselves to others' dreams shouldn't forget about their own. Justification: This plot uses the starting point of Jerilee as a waitress serving Vincent and her journey reaching a point where she becomes his competitor. It encapsulates all the essential points of an engaging story: introduction, character development, conflict, climax, resolution, and conclusion. Each step builds upon the previous one, organically taking the story forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Review: I read probably over a hundred reviews on a lot of different playmats. There wasn't one playmat that didn't have a negative review but this one seemed to have a lot of positive ones. I finally decided to order this one and am soo happy I did. My daughter is 16 weeks old today and loves it! We probably had her under it around 9 weeks since it took me so long to decide which one to get. The music is good(not annoying at all) and I like the option of the rainforest sounds too when I want something different. She loves everything especially the giraffe and the monkey and she talks to them a lot. The reviews that say the mirror isn't facing the correct way are true but I just turn the mirror a bit and it usually stays in place so that it faces her.

Macy Golong peeked into Mallie Mae's room and was not surprised to see her sleeping. Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah.

Here are possible answers to this question: - receptionist - the sun - office building - business plan - large building  I believe the correct choice is \\"receptionist\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"receptionist,\\" and here's why: A receptionist is a person employed in an office or another establishment to receive or greet any visitors, patients, or clients and answer telephone calls. They usually work in the lobby or front office desk of an organization or a specific department and provide assistance with various administrative tasks. In the context of the question, if the man is seeking directions in the lobby, it's most appropriate for him to speak with the receptionist. The receptionist typically has extensive knowledge of the premises, as well as information on the businesses or offices located within the building. They will be able to provide clear and accurate directions or other assistance that the man may require.  Now, let's analyze the other possible answers: 1. The sun: The sun is a celestial body and has nothing to do with providing directions inside a building. 2. Office building: This term refers to the structure which houses offices and does not represent a person who can provide directions. 3. Business plan: A business plan is a strategic document outlining the objectives and ways to achieve them for a company. It cannot offer directions within a building. 4. Large building: Similar to \\"office building,\\" it refers to the structure and is not a person who can guide the man seeking directions.

Movie title: Legends of the Fall Movie plot: This is a wonderful yet heartrending period piece, as told by an elderly Native American through a collection of family letters he accumulated and saved over time.The right and proper Colonel William Ludlow, (Anthony Hopkins), a veteran of the Native American wars that took place in the late 19th century, has grown tired of the carnage and futility of war. Moreover, he detests the governments and their greed that propagated the battles he has fought. In the opening sequence, the teepees have been struck, the fires, billowing white smoke as they symbolically die out, along with the hope and freedom of \\"the People.\\"At first glance, the viewer might believe he is observing the remnants of the Colonel's last battle. Then a child is seen by his side, and the mood changes as the realization that the look in his eyes is not one of the victor, but that of sadness as he has come to know and respect the People, and forcing them from their home has brought him to his breaking point. He tosses his saber and sheath into the ground in disgust, viewing his humbled former enemy, and turns his back to the camera, and on his former life. The scene is similar to \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" in that the Native Americans, those who survived, are seen defeated and disheartened, abandoning what was once their home. The look on the \\"victorious\\" Colonel's face as he views his one time enemies says it all.Hopkins takes his wife, (Cristina Pickles) three sons, (Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas), and trusted Cree guide, One Stab, (excellent perfomance by Gordon Tootoosis, who also narrates), and his family on a quest to \\"lose the madness over the mountains and begin again.\\" Although filmed almost entirely in British Columbia, the setting for the film is the mountains near Helena, Montana. The scenery alone is reason enough to let yourself become lost in this film; temporarily lost from the madness.The story unfolds as the boys are still in their teens, and the youngest of the three, Samuel, (Thomas), is constantly watched over...

So we are left with: -4 * o = 4 Now, we need to find out how many \\"o\\" cookies we have. To do that, we will divide both sides by -4 (our cookie monster): (-4 * o) / -4 = 4 / -4 On the left side, dividing by -4 cancels the -4, so now we have just \\"o\\": o = 4 / -4 Finally, we'll do the math on the right side.

A:","output":"A: The fourth in line for the U.S. presidential succession, in the event of the President's death, is the Secretary of State, according to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. This act establishes the order in which officials would assume the role of the President in case of death, resignation, removal from office, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office.  To understand the full context, let's take a closer look at the line of succession: 1. Vice President: The first in line to succeed the President in any of these circumstances is the Vice President. The U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 6) initially established this order, and the 25th Amendment further clarified it in 1967. 2. Speaker of the House of Representatives: The second in line for presidential succession is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Speaker is an elected officer of the House and is chosen by the majority party. In case of assuming the presidency, the Speaker must resign from the position and the House. 3. President Pro Tempore of the Senate: The President Pro Tempore, usually the most senior member of the majority party in the Senate, stands third in line for succession. Though the Vice President is the official presiding officer of the Senate, in practice, the President Pro Tempore fulfills this role during the Vice President's absence. 4. Secretary of State: Fourth in line, as mentioned, is the Secretary of State. As the chief diplomat of the United States, the Secretary plays a crucial role in foreign policy, negotiates treaties, manages diplomatic relations with other countries, and oversees the State Department. Historically, the Secretary of State was the first Cabinet officer in order of precedence; however, the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 altered the order. Following the Secretary of State, other Cabinet members, in order of the department's creation, continue the line of succession: 5. Secretary of the Treasury 6. Secretary of Defense 7. Attorney General 8. Secretary of the Interior 9. Secretary of Agriculture 10. Secretary of Commerce 11. Secretary of Labor 12. Secretary of Health and Human Services 13. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 14. Secretary of Transportation 15. Secretary of Energy 16. Secretary of Education 17. Secretary of Veterans Affairs 18. Secretary of Homeland Security It's essential to note that, according to the U.S. Constitution, only a \\"natural-born Citizen\\" may assume the presidency. Additionally, the person in line must meet the age and residency requirements and cannot be disqualified by impeachment or any other constitutionally outlined barrier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.","output":"Title: The Evolution of Plebeian Political Power in Ancient Rome"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  and the situation: Blue island and Red island were two big sister islands situated 100 miles from each other. People on Blue island used gas powered vehicles, while people on Red island used electrical vehicles. The people on Blue island presented more respiratory problems.  Answer the following question: Which island released more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere? The answer to this question is:","output":"Blue island released more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. Step 1: Identify the different types of vehicles on each island. Blue island uses gasoline-powered vehicles, and Red island uses electric vehicles. Step 2: Analyze the emissions of each type of vehicle. Gasoline-powered vehicles produce emissions such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons, which contribute to air pollution and smog. Electric vehicles do not produce these emissions directly, as they do not rely on internal combustion engines. Step 3: Consider the presence of catalytic converters in gasoline-powered vehicles. While catalytic converters can help reduce the harmful emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles, they do not eliminate them completely. Step 4: Evaluate the prevalence of respiratory issues on Blue island. The higher prevalence of respiratory problems on Blue island is an indicator of poorer air quality, likely due to the higher emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles. Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the information gathered. Given that Blue island has gasoline-powered vehicles, which produce carbon monoxide, and Red island has electric vehicles, which do not produce these emissions directly, it can be concluded that Blue island released more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However London's Chinese community remained very small for many years: at the start of the 20thcentury, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain. After the Second World War, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs and came to London. As Limhouse had been almost destroyed during the war, they settled  in different area--a part of central London near Leicester Square. This area is now what Londoners call Chinatown. At first, the new immigrants   found it difficult to get jobs. In the 1950s, however, a small Chinese restaurant opened in London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful! Suddenly, Chinese restaurants and take-aways started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much! They worked as cooks, managers or waiters. Most of them enjoyed their lives and arranged their friends and relatives to join them from overseas. As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful.

The 6.5-magnitude quake struck in the sparsely-populated north of Sichuan, the US Geological Survey said. Some reports suggest the death toll could be much higher. The epicentre was close to an area popular with tourists. Sichuan province is prone to earthquakes. More than 70,000 people were killed in a quake in 2008. The quake struck at around 21:20 (13:20 GMT) some 300km (180 miles) north of the provincial capital Chengdu, and was 10km deep. Photos showed damage to buildings, including a hotel, in Jiuzhaigou, home to one of China's most famous nature reserves and a Unesco World Heritage site. A restaurant owner in the town said this quake felt stronger than the 2008 tremor, though there is no suggestion yet that the death toll could reach anywhere near the levels caused by that disaster. Tang Sesheng told the AFP news agency that many people had fled buildings in Jiuzhaigou county - which includes a national park - and were taking refuge in the main square. \\"People didn't dare grab anything like money or clothes - we just all ran outside right away,\\" she said. Gwendolyn Pang of the Red Cross Society of China said it would take time to learn the extent of the damage and number of casualties. \\"Communications lines and electricity are disrupted and people are no doubt shocked and scared,\\" she said. China's National Commission for Disaster Reduction, quoted by AFP news agency, said as many as 100 people may have been killed and 130,000 homes damaged. Some reports in the Chinese media said tourists were among the dead and injured. President Xi Jinping called for \\"all-out efforts to rapidly organise relief work and rescue the injured people\\", state news agency Xinhua reports, and fire officers and soldiers were being deployed from nearby areas. Shaking was felt in Chengdu and in Xian, home to the Terracotta Warriors, some 700km (430 miles) away.

This recent quake surfaced around 21:20 (13:20 GMT), some 300km (180 miles) north of the provincial capital Chengdu, with a depth of 10km. Significant damage to various buildings, including a hotel in Jiuzhaigou, was reported. Jiuzhaigou is renowned for being one of China's famous nature reserve and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The quake's severity had some local residents, such as a restaurant owner, asserting that its impact felt stronger than the 2008 quake. Amid the chaos, many people abandoned their belongings to seek safety in open spaces such as the main square in Jiuzhaigou county. Due to disrupted communication lines and electricity, the Red Cross Society of China mentioned that it might take some time to determine the extent of the damage and the casualty figure. China's National Commission for Disaster Reduction speculated that the quake may have resulted in up to 100 deaths and damage to around 130,000 homes. Chinese media reported some tourists amongst the dead and injured. In response, President Xi Jinping has called for rapid relief efforts and rescue operations.

The Slaters of Wolverhampton are plagued with Mrs. Slater's chronic debilitating asthma and her cooking limited to what comes in canned goods that she can heat in boiling water. Mr. Alan Slater is sick with worry and has a cantankerous personality. Nigel longs for a life that is more than a succession of canned-food dinners made from what can be heated in boiling water. When dinner is burnt, the standard substitute of toast is always served. He loves toast, with the crunchy outside giving way to buttery softness inside. Despite her infrequent forays into cooking meals from scratch, his mother's attempts to improve her cooking change nothing before or after her death. His father continues in widowhood with the same cooking style and frequent dinners of toast. The experience brings Nigel to conclude that he is not liked. Nigel learns from a friend that the way in which he could attempt a better relationship with his father is to cook a meal for him. His cooking efforts are thwarted by the new housekeeper, the married and \\"common\\" Mrs. Joan Potter, who seduces Alan with her apple pie and array of gourmet meals. The two start to spend time together: at one point, she exiting her council house through an upstairs window so as not to be found out by her husband. Without announcement, the Slaters move to the Herefordshire countryside along with Mrs. Potter. Nigel co-exists with her but never accepts her. She makes a competition of cooking when the teenaged Nigel's shows an emerging interest in developing his skills at school home economics class cookery lessons.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Deformation of the ionic crystal causes one plane of atoms to slide along another. The resulting repulsive interactions between ions with like charges cause the layers to separate. Crystals tend to have relatively sharp, well-defined melting points because all the component atoms, molecules, or ions are the same distance from the same number and type of neighbors; that is, the regularity of the crystalline lattice creates local environments that are the same. Thus the intermolecular forces holding the solid together are uniform, and the same amount of thermal energy is needed to break every interaction simultaneously. Amorphous solids have two characteristic properties. When cleaved or broken, they produce fragments with irregular, often curved surfaces; and they have poorly defined patterns when exposed to x-rays because their components are not arranged in a regular array. An amorphous, translucent solid is called a glass. Almost any substance can solidify.   Q: Why do crystals have relatively sharp and well-defined melting points?

Answer the following question: Information:  - Maurice Bavaud ( January 15 , 1916 in Neuchâtel -- May 14 , 1941 in Berlin - Plötzensee ) was a Swiss theology student who in 1938 attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler .  - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.  - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920.   - The Chancellor of Germany is the head of government of Germany. The official title in German is \\"Bundeskanzler(in)\\" (literally, Federal Chancellor), sometimes shortened to \\"Kanzler(in)\\". The term, dating from the early Middle Ages, is derived from the Latin term \\"cancellarius\\".  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Lake Neuchâtel is a lake primarily in Romandy, Switzerland (French-speaking Switzerland). The lake lies mainly in the canton of Neuchâtel, but is also shared by the cantons of Vaud, of Fribourg, and of Bern. With a surface of , it is the largest lake entirely in Switzerland and the 59th largest lake in Europe. Lake Neuchâtel lies approximately at coordinates . It is long and no more than wide. Its surface is above sea level, with a maximum depth of . The total water volume is . The lake's drainage area is approximately and its culminating point is Le Chasseron at . The lake receives the Orbe River (called \\"Thielle or Thièle\\" from the city of Orbe onwards), the Arnon, the Areuse (which traverses the Val de Travers), Seyon (flowing through the Val de Ruz), the \\"canal de la Sauge\\" (which drains Lake Murten and receives the Broye River), and the Mentue (at Yvonand). The \\"canal of Thielle\\" (or \\"Zihlkanal\\" in German) drains the lake into Lake Biel-Bienne and is part of regulation system for the lakes and the rivers of the Seeland region. Lake Neuchâtel was the home of the now extinct species of deepwater trout \\"Salvelinus neocomensis\\".  - Neuchâtel; (\\"new\\" and \\"chatel\\" \\"castle\\" ) is the capital of the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel on Lake Neuchâtel.  - The Invasion of Poland, also known as the September Campaign, or the 1939 Defensive War in Poland (or \\"Wojna obronna 1939 roku\\"), and alternatively the Poland Campaign or \\"Fall Weiss\\" in Germany (Case White), was a joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Free City of Danzig, the Soviet Union, and a small Slovak contingent, that marked the beginning of World War II in Europe. The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact, while the Soviet invasion commenced on 17 September following the Molotov-Tg agreement that terminated the Russian and Japanese hostilities in the east on 16 September. The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty.  - Führer (spelled Fuehrer when the umlaut is not available) is a German word meaning \\"leader\\" or \\"guide\\". As a political title it is most associated with the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler was the only person to hold the position of Führer. The word Führer in the sense of \\"guide\\" remains common in German, and it is used in numerous compound words. However, because of its strong association with Nazi Germany, the isolated word may come with some stigma and negative connotations when used with the meaning of \\"leader\\", especially in political contexts. The word \\"Führer\\" has cognates in the Scandinavian languages, spelled \\"fører\\" which have the same meaning and use as the German word, but without political connotations.

Here's a detailed and long answer the listener might provide: \\"Hey, I understand that physics can be a challenging subject and it's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed at times. Don't worry, we've all been there. I remember when I was trying to solve some complex physics problems, and I felt like I was hitting a brick wall. It can be tough, but the good news is, there are ways to work through it. First off, let's take a step back and maybe identify the specific areas or concepts that you're struggling with. Are there particular chapters or topics that you find more difficult than others? Alternatively, you might be able to pinpoint specific types of problems that give you trouble. Once we know which areas you need help with, we can start breaking things down and focus on improving your understanding. Physics problems often boil down to a few key principles that you can apply, so by focusing on those principles, many problems will become more manageable. Another tip is to not hesitate to ask for help. Physics isn't a subject to tackle alone, and there's no shame in seeking assistance. Your teachers and classmates are valuable resources, and even I would be more than happy to help you out when I can. Sometimes, just discussing the problem with someone else can shed new light on the solution. Moreover, it's essential to practice regularly. Physics, like any other skill, gets better with consistent practice. The more problems you solve, the more your confidence will grow, and the better you'll understand the concepts. It can also be helpful to learn and remember the formulas and relationships that are frequently used in physics problems, as these can be essential tools when solving complex questions. Lastly, don't forget to take breaks and give yourself some time to relax and recharge during your study sessions. It's important not to overwork your brain, as it can lead to more frustration and stress, which ultimately hinders your progress. I hope these suggestions can help you in your physics journey. Remember, it's okay to struggle, and it's perfectly normal to need help. We're all here to support you, and I'm confident that you'll overcome these challenges. So, let's start by identifying the specific areas you're struggling with, and we'll take it from there. Together, I'm sure we can get through this.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu. Frances Mayes likens it to spinach, but notes that it is so much more, “While agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy...

Does the term draw mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"No, the term \\"draw\\" does not mean the same thing in both of these sentences.  In the first sentence, \\"At the start of their turn, each player must draw a card,\\" the term \\"draw\\" is used in the context of selecting a card, presumably from a deck, pile or hand of cards in some type of game. This action does not typically involve the creation of anything new, but simply the removal of a card from one location to be held or viewed by a player. The result of this action can affect the player's strategies or capabilities in the game. \\"Draw\\" in this context is often random and involves an element of chance.  Meanwhile in the second sentence, \\"She drew an elephant,\\" the term \\"draw\\" is used in the context of creating a visual representation or image - in this case, an image of an elephant. This use of \\"draw\\" typically involves manual skill, such as using a pencil, pen, brush, or other instrument to apply lines, shapes, and shading on a surface like paper or canvas. The result of this action is a new piece of art or a visual representation of something. Thus, while both uses of \\"draw\\" involve an action resulting in a new situation or product (a game state or a piece of art), the processes, skills, and outcomes involved are different. The two uses of \\"draw\\" are homonyms - words that are spelled and pronounced the same, but have different meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: On the saddle are leather straps called the girth (or the belly band). Feed the leather strap into the buckle, and secure it so the girth is tight. You should be able to fit your fingers underneath the strap. The girth stops the shafts from going backward if the cart or carriage gets unbalanced. Take the leather straps of the traces, and place each of them behind the leather straps of the belly band. They should sit on top of the saddle’s leather strap (behind the horse’s front legs). The bridle will easily fit over their head. Then, place the bit inside the horse’s mouth so their tongue lies underneath. Attach the curb chain to the hook on both sides of the bit so the bridle stays put on their head. The bit is a slightly curved metal piece that sits in the horse’s mouth. This helps control the horse. Connected to the bit is a curb chain and 2 rings for the reins. After the bit and curb chain are in place, strap the reins to both of the rings on the bit. You can use the lower loop for more control over the horse. Run the reins through the rein tariffs on the harness and buckle up the ends.  More control of the horse is helpful if you are driving on roads with traffic, for example. The rein tariffs keep the reins straight and tangle-free. Inspect each buckle and ring to ensure each strap is properly fastened. They should fit snugly around the horse, and you should be able to fit your fingers underneath. Tighten or loosen the straps as needed.","output":"This article is about putting a special horse outfit called a saddle on a horse.

The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads 'KUSHIATA KYOTO, JAPAN 1840'. A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori (Toshiya Maruyama) walks up the winding path to the house, inside waits Otami (Mako Hattori) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband, Shugoro's (Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki) back who happens to be Masanori's teacher. Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other. His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide. Over a century later and Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura (Susan George) and their young daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their close friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay, you don't need me to you where! He jokingly says it's going so cheap because it's haunted, to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts, at least for the time being that is. Almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode. Lights turn on and off by themselves, Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk (Henry Mitowa) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore, of course. The spirits of Otami, Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches (Tsuyako Olajima) curse put upon them. But there may be a way they can break the curse, unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage, daughter and possibly even their very lives.  Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film, OK to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it. Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either. The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by-the-numbers, a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things. There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter, Noriko (Mayumi Umeda). And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in, however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in, some exorcism! One more thing, I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this, try his hand at Kung-Fu and oriental sword fighting! George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure, although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present. Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there's no blood, gore or violence to speak about. The 'transparent' ghost effects are OK but they ain't going to impress many people these days.

Yet American's friendliness and helpfulness is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of distraction, and brought news of the outside world. The tough realities of the border also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest settler agent. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or only a charitable impulse   on the part of the settlers. It reflected the hardship of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation. Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the exhausted traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist routes. \\"I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner, amazing.\\" Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly.

We took this as a sign that we needed to book our Vancouver seaplane flight, to really explore the azure harbour waters and take in an eagle-eyed view of this city. I suppose it was ok… oh, who am I kidding, the harbour is spectacular. Let me also point out that none of these images are touched by editing. Like 99% of my images in this blog (the other 1% is cropping and making slight adjustments), these are entirely un-doctored. We began as all good things do, by hanging out in their airport lounge, offered a mini-pastry and a hot beverage – I adventurously went for an ‘English Mist’, an Earl-Grey Latte to make myself feel a little more soothed boarding a tiny propeller plane (note: it didn’t work.) With a slightly chaotic boarding process (more noticeable after such a serene start) we were too busy sorting out the seats to realise that we had hopped on board, and within in seconds it seemed, our pilot had lifted off smoothly in a flurry of water foam. As we began to watch the world turn into a Lilliput version of itself, we barely blinked for watching beautiful vistas unfold. From tiny little islands (the above Passage Island technically belongs to West Vancouver, known as the Hollywood suburb of the city, and a couple of the homes are allegedly owned by celebrities) where the residents enjoy views of downtown Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus, Vancouver Island, and the snow-capped mountains of Howe Sound – to the fjords all the way along the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

Politicians, journalists, academics and activists have been among those held. The Houthis, who control the capital Sanaa, are waging a war against Yemen's government and a Saudi-led coalition. At least 6,200 people, half of them civilians, have been killed and almost three million others have been displaced since March 2015. The conflict has also pushed the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of famine and left 82% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance. A year that has set Yemen back decades No end in sight to war in Yemen Practising medicine under fire in Yemen A young girl and a city struggling for life Amnesty's report documented what it described as a \\"chilling campaign to quash dissent\\" in areas of Yemen under the control of the Houthis and allied security forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh since December 2014. Those held had frequently been tortured and denied access to a lawyer or their family, with some detentions lasting for up to 18 months, it said. Many had been kept in secret, makeshift detention centres, including private homes, and then transferred multiple times between locations, it added. In the vast majority of cases no reason for arrests were given. Eighteen individuals featured in the report are still being held, including 21-year-old student Abdul Ilah Saylan, who was arrested outside a Sanaa cafe last August.

Three other guards joined in and we watched... as the four guards beat him viciously,\\" one relative was quoted as saying. \\"They dragged him back inside when he fainted and told us to go home.\\" Earlier this month, Houthi officials told Amnesty that people had been detained \\"because they gave GPS co-ordinates to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition\\". The UN said in March that the coalition was responsible for twice as many civilian casualties as any other party to the conflict, virtually all as a result of air strikes. But Amnesty said it had obtained documents showing that prosecuting authorities in Sanaa had found that the detention of dozens of those held was without legal basis and had ordered their release. \\"Instead of incarcerating opponents for weeks or months on end, the Houthi armed group should release anyone who has been arbitrarily detained, implement safeguards to ensure detainees are treated humanely, and issue clear instructions that anyone under their command committing abuses will be held accountable,\\" said Amnesty's Middle East deputy director James Lynch.

Article: In 1644, René Descartes theorized that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain, a development that transformed the perception of pain from a spiritual, mystical experience to a physical, mechanical sensation[citation needed]. Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as \\"a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses\\". Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact. Question: What state does the intensive theory conceive pain as being?","output":"The intensive theory conceives pain as being an emotional state, rather than a unique sensory modality. According to this theory, pain is not a specific sensation with its own sensory apparatus, as the specificity theory suggests, but rather a result of exposure to stronger than normal stimuli, such as intense light, pressure, or temperature. This perspective views pain as a byproduct of our emotional response to these heightened stimuli, emphasizing the emotional and psychological aspects of the pain experience rather than its physical or mechanical nature. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this theory was primarily supported by psychologists, while the specificity theory was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians. However, by the end of the 19th century, after a series of clinical observations and experiments, the majority of psychologists shifted their support to the specificity theory, leading to its widespread acceptance and incorporation in textbooks on physiology and psychology as fact."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. John Holmes is so famous, he's infamous (as the Three Amigos would say). This is a Rashomon-like story about the events surrounding the Wonderland Murders of the early 1980's, in Los Angeles. The story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants. There is story from the friend's perspective, namely David Lind (played by Dylan McDermott). He is a participant in the robbery assault at Eddie Nash's place (Eddie Nash is a infamous drug dealer - and is the suppose to be the same character Alfred Molina played in Boogie Nights) and is heavily into the drug scene. There is John Holmes' perspective (played by Val Kilmer), which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings (with a severe case of cocaine cravings). There is also the patchwork recollections of John's wife (Sharon - played by Lisa Kudrow) and his girlfriend (Dawn - played by Kate Bosworth) that fill in the spaces between the two stories. It is basically the same time frame that we are looking at, just each character's version. The only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people.  Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights portrays John Holmes as a slightly heroic character, with a tragic yet comedic karma. He is a caricature of a real person. He was more of less, a mixed up kid that got what he got through his \\"large\\" endowment. Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John's life into a nightmare for all of us watching. The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie. Val Kilmer took what he learned of Jim Morrison, from the Doors, enhanced the performance for the Salton Sea, and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of John Holmes through cocaine. All of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayal's of cocaine junkies. Josh Lucas' performance stands out as one of the best in the movie. He plays Ron Launius (I think this character is suppose to be the same as the Thomas Jane character from Boogie Nights). Ron was the leader of the gang, loved having John Holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood. The cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think. Did they really use Splenda ??  Where Boogie Nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it (lots of color and 70's nostalgia), Wonderland is dark. The action is fast and furious, with a lot of jumps. It is twitchy and grainy. There is no comedy, just a never ending pace, as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous, fast paced, edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling. This is a graphic movie. It has one of the most intensely violent scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It actually shows the murders themselves (through the eyes of John Holmes at first and then from a third person perspective). It is so graphic, it looks like police evidence of a crime. I had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie. This movie is definitely not recommended for everyone. I recommend it as a good alternative to Boogie Nights, for those interested in the other sides of John Holmes. -Celluloid Rehab Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie, highlighting the realistic portrayals of the characters, the intense and immersive atmosphere, and praising the acting performances.

Helming the director's chair, visionary filmmaker, Christopher Lumière, has sculpted a narrative that takes us on a whirlwind journey of healing, forgiveness, and learning to embrace life's many obstacles. Like a maestro creating a soul-stirring composition, Lumière conducts a flawless orchestra of talent that flawlessly synchronizes breathtaking visuals, profound storytelling, and poignant performances. On center stage, we have Catherine Fleur, a thespian who truly transcends the term 'performance' by breathing life into the troubled yet fierce protagonist, Seraphina Rose. Fleur's portrayal of the character is a masterclass in the art of acting. Through every tear, smile, and fiery outburst, she delivers a heart-stopping display of vulnerability and strength intertwined in a seamless dance. As her tale of adversity unfolds, we are privileged to witness the raw essence of a soul emerging from the darkness. One cannot mention Fleur's remarkable performance without acknowledging the phenomenal ensemble cast. Each character is intricately layered, with every actor delivering astounding depth, injecting palpable energy, and embodying the spirit of their roles. John Francis, in particular, shines brightly as the enigmatic and wise stranger that guides Seraphina through her metamorphosis. Complementing the two leads, the supporting cast weaves an emotionally intense tapestry that serves as the backbone of this powerful narrative. Cinematographer, Henry Caldwell, captures the elegance of this journey through his kaleidoscopic lens. With panoramic vistas that sweep across breathtaking landscapes to intimate close-ups that plunge us into the depths of the characters' souls, Caldwell's visual storytelling transports us into an alternate realm where the magnificence of nature mirrors the turmoil and ultimate triumph of the human spirit. In tandem with the visuals, we are swept away by the soul-shattering musical score from renowned composer, Amelia Wells. With each note, Wells' composition adds a delicate nuance to the narrative, guiding us through a vivid emotional spectrum from enchanting serenity to the turmoil of inner demons. This sonic symbiosis with the storytelling encapsulates the audience in a mesmerizing cocoon of texture and emotion unparalleled in contemporary cinema. \\"A Symphony of Life's Beauty\\" is not just a film; it is a testament to the indomitable will within each of us to conquer our fears, face our monsters, and ultimately find love and meaning in the chaos of existence.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was the plan? Context: An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion. The answer to this question is:","output":"The plan was to publish \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" as the first book of a trilogy, followed by a shorter connecting novel, and then \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" as the last book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person being very unfit can have an indirect effect on the process of oxygen reaching the lungs. When a person is unfit, their respiratory system may not function as efficiently due to reduced lung capacity or decreased muscle strength around the diaphragm and chest wall. This may lead to shorter and shallower breaths, resulting in less air and oxygen being inhaled and reaching the lungs. Additionally, an unfit person may experience increased heart rate, which could lead to a higher demand for oxygen by the body, further exacerbating the issue.

Given the background: If only 1.0 mL of 0.10 M hydrochloric acid is added to 1.0 L of pure water the pH drops drastically from 7.0 to 4.0. This is a 1000-fold increase in the acidity of the solution. For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them. Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH.

What type of thing is the question \\"How many colored squares are there on a Rubik 's Cube ?\\" asking about?","output":"The question \\"How many colored squares are there on a Rubik's Cube?\\" is asking about the structure and specific elements of a well-known 3D puzzle, the Rubik’s Cube. To answer this question, one must have a good understanding of the Rubik’s Cube, its design and structural elements. Each face of the cube is made up of multiple smaller squares, which are typically colored. Therefore, the question centers on the total count of these squares across all faces of the cube. The Rubik’s Cube is recognized for its colorful and multi-dimensional mechanical design which was initially meant to help individuals understand 3D geometry. This colored aspect of the Rubik’s Cube is primarily what the question is centred around. Each of these colored squares is a fundamental part of solving the puzzle, as the typical goal of using a Rubik’s cube is to rearrange these squares so that every face of the cube is a single, uniform color. From a broader perspective, this question is querying specific characteristics of real-world objects and involves numerical data related to that object. In the domain of learning, it falls into the category of observation, quantitative reasoning, and spatial awareness. It ignites critical thinking by stimulating the need to visualize the Rubik's Cube, count its individual elements, and combine these facts to answer the question.  Further, this question indirectly touches on history and cultural context. The Rubik’s Cube is an iconic puzzle that was invented in 1974 by a Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik. Since then, it became a worldwide craze and remains popular to this day, with numerous competitions held to solve it in the quickest time. Moreover, the type and nature of this query could be used in different fields such as mathematics and geometry (as an example to explain concepts), art (discussions about color patterns), and even in psychology (exploring aspects of problem-solving, patience, spatial intelligence).

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What was restored by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989? from the following article ?  The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured. The vase was next restored by J. W. R. Axtell in 1948–1949, and then by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who is often described as looking at herself on the mirror in the work? ?  The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or  La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.  Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.

Deveraux finds his leader Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), who has gone insane, with a string of severed ears and holding a young boy and girl hostage. Devereaux, who is near the end of his tour of duty, tries to reason with Scott, who shoots the boy and orders Devereaux to shoot the girl to prove his loyalty. Deveraux refuses and tries to save the girl, but Scott kills her with a grenade. The two soldiers shoot each other to death. Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second squad and cryo-genically frozen, their deaths covered up as \\"missing in action\\". Deveraux and Scott are revived without memories of their previous lives and are selected for the \\"Universal Soldier\\" program, an elite counter terrorism unit, and are deployed via an Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy to the Hoover Dam to resolve a hostage situation.

Unlike other trekking routes in Nepal, there were no hotels, guest houses, begging, or souvenir sales. Instead, the locals stared at us unstrained, especially at the camps. These unsullied places were a stark contrast to the regularly frequented paths most travelers take through Nepal. These villages, nestled amid the verdant foliage, were home to the indigenous Rai and Limbu tribes. A unique and interesting cultural experience, it was a window into Nepal's rich tribal history. Travelers here got the chance to witness a way of life preserved from the influx of modernity and tourism. The Rai and Limbu tribes are two ethnic groups native to Nepal. They have been living in these areas for centuries, following a rural lifestyle where they rely mainly on agriculture. The Rai tribe is known for their distinct dance forms, social organization and religious rituals. The Limbu tribe, on the other hand, is recognized for their significant contribution to the Gorkha Regiments of the Indian Army, British Army, and Nepalese Army. Both tribes share similarities in language and culture, despite their distinct identities. Unlike other trekking routes in Nepal which are teeming with hotels, guesthouses, and establishments catering to tourists, this relatively less explored area had none of that. There were no haggling for souvenirs, no one begging, and most notably, no bustling hotels or guesthouses to accommodate the trekkers. Existence and livelihood here were simpler, stripped down to the more basic necessities in life. The absence of these commercial establishments contributed to the genuine unspoilt beauty of these villages. Furthermore, the behavior of the locals was unique. As opposed to the often-intrusive curiosity from locals that travelers sometimes encounter, the residents of these Rai and Limbu villages were reserved yet attentive. They stared unstrained at the trekkers - a silent show of interest, a subtle mark of their hospitality. There was a welcoming vibe to their gaze, putting the trekkers at ease. This spectacle was enhanced at the camps, heightened by the serene setting as the last rays of the sun vanished behind the landscape, instilling a sense of tranquility amongst the hills, forests, and valleys. The existence of these tribal villages along the trekking route was a fascinating blend of untouched natural beauty and preserved cultural heritage. These elements, combined with the locals' welcoming demeanor, altogether made the journey an authentic and memorable experience for any traveler, providing a unique glimpse of the real Nepal away from the frenetic buzz of the more established tourist routes. Whether it's the physical demand of the trek or the cultural immersion in these villages, the journey provides an extraordinary opportunity to connect with the country's diverse environment and its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell.

Write a title for this article: The United States is no longer considered among the safest financial risks in the world after Standard & Poors downgraded the U.S. credit rating, but the head of the team that made the change says entitlement reform would go a long way to restoring the country's status. David Beers, global head of sovereign and international public finance ratings at S&P, told \\"Fox News Sunday\\" that governments and Congresses come and go, but spending on entitlements persistently drags U.S. debt further into the red. \\"The key thing is, yes, entitlement reform is important because entitlements are the biggest component of spending, and the part of spending where the cost pressures are greatest,\\" Beers said. Beers said he faults both Congress and the Obama administration for \\"the difficulty of all sides in finding a consensus around fiscal policy choices,\\" but any agreement must command the support from both political parties in order to be durable. S&P lowered the U.S. outlook on Friday evening, saying that political gridlock has prevented the U.S. from reaching a plausible solution to getting its financial house in order. It remarked that the agreement last week to reduce the nation's debt by at least 2.1 trillion over the next 10 years \\"fell well short\\" of comprehensive reforms that some had advocated. It added that it foresees the select congressional committee to be organized to find additional savings will likely avoid raising taxes or doing any significant entitlement reform. \\"It appears that for now, new revenues have dropped down on the menu of policy options. In addition, the plan envisions only minor policy changes on Medicare and little change in other entitlements, the containment of which we and most other independent observers regard as key to long-term fiscal sustainability,\\" the announcement reads. Though the announcement noted that S&P \\"takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures that Congress and the administration might conclude is appropriate for putting the U.S.'s finances on a sustainable footing,\\" the credit ratings group suggested that tax hikes may be necessary to reduce the overall debt burden needed to improve the long-term outlook. Beers drew no such conclusion on Sunday, though John Chambers, managing director of S&P, told ABC's \\"This Week\\" that President Obama's fiscal commission last year \\"had plenty of sensible recommendations\\" for reducing U.S. debt. Those recommendations, which included cutting spending and increasing revenues on a 3-1 ratio, were ignored. \\"It was a pity that those really weren't followed through on,\\" Chambers said. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he's not surprised by S&P's decision since even with the select committee's recommendations, the debt will continue to climb. Ryan added that he's willing to discuss tax reforms in a way that would promote economic growth and job creation, including addressing \\"special interest-driven loopholes,\\" but qualified any reforms by adding, \\"if you're just raising revenues to chase ever high spending, that's not good policy.\\" Ryan said ultimately the U.S. has to fix its entitlement system. \\"The president just created two brand new health care entitlements, expanded Medicaid, a third, and then put this new rationing board in charge of Medicare,\\" Ryan told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"So they're unwilling to open up and restructure these entitlements, which according to S&P are the primary drivers of this debt.\\" Bill Miller of Legg Mason Capital Management, who appeared with Ryan, said the markets are looking to see a \\"reduction in uncertainty,\\" which means both fundamental tax reform and changes to the entitlement structure. \\"Discretionary spending doesn't matter at all in this thing except that it'll be a little bit of a drag on the economy. It's pro-growth policies and fundamental entitlement reform, especially on health care, that are the key things for to our long-term fiscal health and therefore the long-term confidence in the markets toward our country,\\" Miller said.","output":"Title: Entitlement Reform: The Key to Restoring the United States' Financial Reputation and Stability Amid Credit Rating Downgrade"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and John Densmore on drums. The band got its name, at Morrison's suggestion from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, which itself was a reference to a quote made by William Blake, \\"If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.\\" They were unique and among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. Despite Morrison's conviction and the fallout from their appearance in New Orleans, The Doors set out to reclaim their status as a premier act with L.A. Woman in 1971. The album included rhythm guitarist Marc Benno on several tracks and prominently featured bassist Jerry Scheff, best known for his work in Elvis Presley's TCB Band. Despite a comparatively low Billboard chart peak at #9, L.A. Woman contained two Top 20 hits and went on to be their second best-selling studio album, surpassed in sales only by their debut. The album explored their R&B roots, although during rehearsals they had a falling-out with Paul Rothchild, who was dissatisfied with the band's effort. Denouncing \\"Love Her Madly\\" as \\"cocktail lounge music\\", he quit and handed the production to Bruce Botnick and the Doors.  The title track and two singles (\\"Love Her Madly\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm\\") remain mainstays of rock radio programming, with the last of these being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its special significance to recorded music. In the song \\"L.A. Woman\\", Jim Morrison scrambles the letters of his own name to chant \\"Mr. Mojo Risin\\". During the sessions, a short clip of the band performing \\"Crawling King Snake\\" was filmed. As far as is known, this is the last clip of the Doors performing with Morrison.  On March 13, 1971, following the recording of L.A. Woman, Morrison took a leave of absence from the Doors and moved to Paris with Pamela Courson. He had visited the city the previous summer and was interested in moving there to become a writer in exile.","output":"This text is about the American rock band, The Doors.

What is the answer: The most famous symbol of what people of North Africa is the Tagelmust, an indigo blue-colored veil that gives them the name 'People of the Veil'?","output":"The most famous symbol of the people of North Africa, known as the Tagelmust, is an indigo blue-colored veil that represents the Tuareg people. This iconic and culturally significant piece of clothing has earned them the name \\"People of the Veil.\\"  The Tuareg people are a large Berber ethnic group that inhabits a vast area across North and West Africa, primarily in the Sahara and Sahel regions. This includes countries like Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria, and Libya. They speak a Berber language known as Tamacheq and have a unique and distinct culture that sets them apart from the other groups in the region. The Tagelmust represents a crucial aspect of their identity, with men in particular wearing this traditional garment as they go about their daily activities. The Tagelmust is a combination of a headscarf and a turban, which are made from cotton, and are dyed in indigo, a natural dye obtained from plants. The deep indigo blue color has an important cultural significance and is often regarded as the color of wisdom and eternity. The color ultimately symbolizes the vast Saharan sky and represents the Tuareg's connection with their environment. Additionally, since the Tuareg people traditionally have a noble, warrior societal structure, the indigo blue color also signifies strength and nobility. The practical function of the Tagelmust is to protect the wearer from the harsh desert elements, such as the sun, wind, and sand. When wrapped around the head and face, it effectively shields the individual from these environmental factors, making it easier for them to navigate their surroundings. The Tuareg people also believe that wearing the Tagelmust preserves moisture in the breathing passages and prevents dryness and dehydration. On a cultural and spiritual level, the Tagelmust plays an essential role in the Tuareg society. It is primarily worn by adult men, and it signifies that they have reached the age of maturity and responsibility. It is also considered a sign of modesty and respect, as the Tagelmust covers the lower half of the wearer's face when in the presence of those outside their immediate family or other men. The Tagelmust is an important aspect of the Tuareg's traditional attire, and beyond its practical use, it carries a deep cultural and spiritual meaning. As such, the Tagelmust is a symbol of the Tuareg people's rich history, unique way of life, and their strong connection to the natural environment. It plays a crucial role in the group's identity and is a recognizable symbol of the Tuareg people throughout North Africa and the world."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What state claimed their independence on 5 October 1908? , can you please find it?   The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

Given the question: Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of\\" a new world\\".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum  consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed  feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum. We can learn from the passage that   _  . A) an abnormal eel's average score is the highest in all subjects B) the squirrel met frustration before practicing climbing C) the rabbit liked to make up in water so she failed at last D) in fact,the duck behaved better than any other animal in class The answer is:","output":"A) an abnormal eel's average score is the highest in all subjects. The passage describes a school where animals are taught various subjects according to a standardized curriculum that includes running, climbing, swimming, and flying. Each animal faces challenges in the areas they are not naturally good at, leading to various struggles, such as the duck's webbed feet getting worn out from practicing running, the rabbit's nervous breakdown from too much make-up work in swimming, the squirrel's frustration in flying class, and the eagle's disciplinary issues. However, an abnormal eel, who can swim very well and also run, climb, and fly a little, achieves the highest average score in all subjects and is chosen to give the good-bye speech. This demonstrates that the eel's overall performance across the subjects is the best among all the animals in the school, even though some animals may excel in specific areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention  of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim  position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.  Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.  In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.  In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test. Answer this question \\"What does this mean for the police\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"This means that the police were not prepared for such a big investigation and had trouble managing and organizing all the information they had. Because of this, they made mistakes, focused on the wrong leads, and didn't catch the criminal as quickly as they could have. This led to changes in how police handle big investigations, like using computers to help them, and also caused people to protest for women's safety.

Q:What is the first name of the person that calls Laurence to brag?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded? , can you please find it?   Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance \\"a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible\\". A:","output":"The last name of the person who was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded is Holst. The passage states that \\"Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; 'He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose'.\\" This suggests that composer Gustav Holst was the individual not afraid of being obvious and straightforward in his musical compositions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

The","output":"ensuing chaos was both overwhelming and heart-wrenching, as people nearby rushed to her aid, attempting to provide any assistance they could. Onlookers gasped and murmured worriedly among themselves, wondering about the severity of the young woman's injury and how it might impact her future. A few individuals whipped out their smartphones, ready to call for medical help or capture the commotion unfolding before them. Within moments, a kind-hearted passer-by, with some basic first aid knowledge, made his way through the agitated crowd and approached the fallen girl. Kneeling beside her, he attempted to assess the damage, gingerly examining her foot and inquiring about the pain she was experiencing. The young woman, flushed with a mix of embarrassment, fear, and pain, managed to stutter out a few disjointed words, expressing her gratitude towards the efforts being made to help her. The crowd continued to grow, as more and more people found themselves drawn to the scene of the accident, either out of concern, curiosity, or the desire to lend a helping hand. The tension in the air was palpable, as the girl's broken heel served as a jarring reminder of our collective vulnerability and how quickly a seemingly ordinary day can be marred by misfortune. Shortly after, a woman emerged from the nearby store, carrying a first aid kit and a look of determination on her face. She had overheard the commotion while browsing the shop, and as a trained nurse, she instinctively knew she needed to help. Swiftly, and with practiced precision, she set about stabilizing the girl's injured foot, providing temporary relief before any further medical assistance could arrive. With emergency services on their way, the crowd began to disperse, each person processing what they had just witnessed in their own way. Some stood in shock, unable to pry their eyes away from the girl; others stirred with renewed empathy and compassion, inspired to help their fellow humans whenever possible. For the girl, the pain and shattered heel had become a symbol of human connection, as the strangers who had rushed to her aid proved that even in moments of hardship and pain, we are never truly alone. As the ambulance pulled up to the scene, the girl offered a gracious thanks to those who had shown her kindness in her time of need. The paramedics worked quickly and efficiently, transferring her onto a stretcher and examining her foot once more. With the echoes of reassurances, well-wishes, and words of encouragement, the girl disappeared into the sterile interior of the vehicle, her body shaking from relief and gratitude. That day, a simple slip and fall led not only to a broken heel, but to a lesson in the power of human compassion, the strength of community, and the unwavering ability we have to change the course of someone's life for the better, one good deed at a time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters.  - Korla, Kurla, or Kuerle ( lit. Krorain) is a mid-sized city in central Xinjiang, and is, administratively, a county-level city and the seat of the Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, which is larger than Great Britain and is the largest Chinese prefecture. Korla is known for its \\"fragrant\\" pears.  - In geography, an oasis (plural: oases) is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source, such as a pond or small lake. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames, and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara Desert.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Lop Nur or Lop Nor (from a Mongolian name meaning \\"Lop Lake\\") is a former salt lake in China, now largely dried-up, located between the Taklamakan and Kumtag deserts in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China. Administratively, the lake is in Lop Nur township (pinyin: Luóbùp zhèn, also known as Luozhong , pinyin: Lu zhng) of Ruoqiang County, which in its turn is part of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.  - Libya (\\"\\") is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. The three traditional parts of the country are Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world.  - Loulan , also called Krorän or Kroraina ( simplified Chinese :  ; traditional Chinese :  ; pinyin : Lóulán ; Uyghur :   , ULY : Kroran ) , and known to Russian archaeologists as Krorayina , was an ancient kingdom based around an important oasis city along the Silk Road already known in the 2nd century BCE on the north - eastern edge of the Lop Desert . The term Loulan is the Chinese transcription of the native name Krorän , and is used to refer to the city located near Lop Nur as well as the kingdom . The kingdom was renamed Shanshan (  ) after its king was assassinated by an envoy of the Han dynasty in 77 BCE ; however , the town at the northwestern corner of the brackish desert lake Lop Nur retained the name of Loulan . The kingdom included at various times settlements such as Niya , Charklik , Miran , and Qiemo . It was intermittently under Chinese control from the early Han dynasty until its abandonment centuries later . The ruins of Loulan are near the now desiccated Lop Nur in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture , Xinjiang , and are now completely surrounded by desert .  - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea.  - Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, often abbreviated to Bayingol (literally \\"rich river\\"), is an autonomous prefecture of the People's Republic of China, bordering Gansu to the east, Qinghai to the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the south. It is the largest prefecture-level division nationally, with an area of , even larger than its neighbouring province of Gansu. The prefectural capital is Korla.  - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market.  - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.  - Ruoqiang (Qarkilik) County (historically known as Charkliq, Chaqiliq, or Qakilik) is a county in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China under the administration of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. It covers an area of (about twice the size of Zhejiang province and similar to Kyrgyzstan or Senegal), making it the largest county-level division in the country.  - The Tarim Basin is an endorheic basin in northwest China occupying an area of about . Located in China's Xinjiang region, it is sometimes used synonymously to refer the southern half of the province, or Nanjiang. Its northern boundary is the Tian Shan mountain range and its southern boundary is the Kunlun Mountains on the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Taklamakan Desert dominates much of the basin. The historical Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr (), which means \\"six cities\\" in Uyghur.  - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\".  - The Lop Desert, or the Lop Depression, is a desert extending from Korla eastwards along the foot of the Kuruk-tagh (meaning Dry Mountain) to the formerly terminal Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. It is an almost perfectly flat expanse with no topographic relief. Lake Bosten in the northwest lies at an altitude of 1,030 m to 1,040 m (3,380 to 3,410 ft), while the Lop Nur in the southeast is only 250 m lower.  - Awjila (Berber: \\"Awilan\\", \\"Awjila\\", \\"Awgila\\" Latin: \\"Augila\\") is an oasis town in the Al Wahat District in the Cyrenaica region of northeastern Libya. Since classical times it has been known as a place where high quality dates are farmed. From the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Islam has played an important role in the community. The oasis is located on the east-west caravan route between Egypt and Tripoli, and on the north-south route between Benghazi and the Sahel between Lake Chad and Darfur, and in the past was an important trading center. It is the place after which the Awjila language, an Eastern Berber language, is named. The people cultivate small gardens using water from deep wells. Recently, the oil industry has become an increasingly important source of employment.  - Ghadames or Ghadamis (Berber: \\"ademis\\"; \\"admis\\", Libyan vernacular: \\"dms\\", Latin: \\"Cidamus, Cydamus\\") is an oasis Berber town in the Nalut District of the Tripolitania region in northwestern Libya.  - Kufra is a basin and oasis group in the Kufra District of southeastern Cyrenaica in Libya. At the end of nineteenth century Kufra became the center and holy place of the Senussi order. It also played a minor role in the Western Desert Campaign of World War II.

Information:  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Peter the Great, Peter I or Peter Alexeyevich (  ) ruled the Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire from 7 May (O.S. 27 April) 1682 until his death, jointly ruling before 1696 with his elder half-brother, Ivan V. Through a number of successful wars he expanded the Tsardom into a much larger empire that became a major European power. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, westernized, and based on The Enlightenment. Peter's reforms made a lasting impact on Russia and many institutions of Russian government trace their origins to his reign.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - Fyodor Isakovich Baykov ( Russian :    , c. 1612 - c. 1663 ) was the first Russian envoy to China ( 1658 ) . For background see History of Sino - Russian relations . Like many later Russian ambassadors to China ( Nicolae Milescu , Sava Vladislavich ) he left a detailed account of his journey . In 1654 Tsar Alexis sent Baykov to the court of the Shunzhi Emperor to negotiate a treaty establishing regular trade between Moscow and Beijing . ( The first Russian to reach Peking was probably Ivan Petlin in 1618 , but he was not properly an ambassador . ) At this time the Manchu Qing Dynasty had just been established and Russian adventurers had just entered the Amur River valley from the north , but the Manchus apparently did not understand that these barbarians from beyond Mongolia were the same as those who were raiding their northern frontier . The Russians of course knew the connection , but gave Baykov no instructions for dealing with the Amur problem . He was , however , instructed to make obeisance to no one but the emperor himself . Before leaving Tobolsk , he sent Setkul Ablin ahead as messenger . Ablin reached Peking in late 1655 , sold his trade goods and returned in the spring of 1656 , passing , but not meeting , Baykov 's party . After a long stay at Tobolsk Baykov 's mission set out in June or autumn of 1654 . He traveled up the Irtysh River across Dzungaria and Gobi Desert . In 1655 they reached Kalgan on the Great Wall . Here he was stopped by the Chinese who did not know who he was ( They thought Ablin had been the real ambassador ) . After receiving permission , he reached the Forbidden City on 3 March 1656 . He refused to kowtow at the city gate , but was admitted anyway and was housed by the Li - Fan Yuan . He insisted that his presents and credentials be presented to the emperor himself and in general did not behave with proper submissiveness to the great Chinese emperor . After several months of isolation , he was expelled from China 's capital ( in 1657 or 4 September 1656 ) and reached Moscow...  - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - Vladivostok (literally \\"ruler of the east\\") is a city and the administrative center of Primorsky Krai, Russia, located at the head of the Golden Horn Bay, not far from Russia's borders with China and North Korea. The population of the city as of 2016 is 606,653, up from 592,034 recorded in the 2010 Russian census. The city is the home port of the Russian Pacific Fleet and the largest Russian port on the Pacific Ocean.  - Prior to the 1600s China and Russia were on opposite ends of Siberia, which was populated by independent nomads. By about 1640 Russian settlers had conquered most of Siberia and founded settlements in the Amur River basin. From 1652 to 1689, China's armies drove the Russian settlers out, but after 1689 China and Russia made peace and established trade agreements. By the mid-1800s China's economy and military lagged far behind the colonial powers, so it signed unequal treaties with Western countries such as Russia, through which Russia annexed the Amur basin and Vladivostok. The Russian Empire and other powers exacted many other concessions from China, among which were indemnities for anti-Western riots, control over China's tariffs, and extraterritorial agreements including legal immunity for foreigners and foreign businesses. Many Chinese people felt humiliated by China's submission to these foreign interests, and this contributed to widespread hostility towards the emperor of China. In 1911 public anger led to a revolution, which marked the beginning of the Republic of China. However, China's new regime (known as the Beiyang government) was forced to sign further unequal treaties with Western countries, including Russia.  - The Beiyang government (), also sometimes spelled \\"Peiyang Government\\", refers to the government of the Republic of China, which was in place in the capital city Beijing from 1912 to 1928. It was internationally recognized as the legitimate Chinese government. The name derives from the Beiyang Army, which dominated its politics with the rise of Yuan Shikai, who was a general of the previous imperial Qing government. After his death the army fractured into competing factions. Although the government and the state were nominally under civilian control under a constitution, the Beiyang generals were effectively in charge of it, with various factions vying for power. The government however enjoyed legitimacy abroad along with diplomatic recognition, had access to the tax and customs revenue, and could apply for foreign financial loans.  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe.  - The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015). It also controls the world's largest armed force, the People's Liberation Army.   - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law.

As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both. Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death. As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past. The case involved a man named Kemper, former hypnotist and son of an infamous Satanist. Kemper had been using his skills to manipulate, abduct and kill children for over 25 years until he was apprehended by Neilson, tried and committed to a lunatic asylum.

Former shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn told activists they should \\"rise above the most vile abuse\\" being thrown at them by other members of the party. Mr Benn, whose sacking led to a wave of shadow cabinet resignations, said \\"now was the time for unity\\". And former leader Ed Miliband has said Labour should not be \\"written off\\". Speaking at the party conference in Liverpool, Mr Miliband urged MPs to get behind his successor. \\"The government is there for the taking. There is a real opportunity for us. All those who write off this party are wrong. They've written us off before and we always come back.\\" Several MPs have indicated they might return to serve under Mr Corbyn after his re-election although some have made the reinstatement of shadow cabinet elections a precondition of coming back into the fold after this summer's mass walkout in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership. Amid calls for openly critical MPs to pledge their loyalty to Mr Corbyn following his re-election, Unite boss Len McCluskey urged MPs to let him lead \\"without having to pluck knives out of his back\\". \\"Bar from a small rump of right-wing Lab MPs who will continue to try and rock the boat, I think the vast majority will come back,\\" he said. \\"We'll have a front bench that will effectively be of all of the talents, all sections of our party, and it will be a pretty impressive shadow cabinet.\\" Mr Benn, who was dismissed by Mr Corbyn after telling him that he had lost confidence in him after the EU referendum, told a Labour First rally at the party conference in Liverpool that the party must now come together and \\"rise above\\" any abuse. \\"We have won Labour parliamentary representation from Keir Hardie onwards and we do that by working together and those values have not changed and are alive and well in every single one of us in the party. \\"We should celebrate the fact that so many new members have joined the party, every single one of us is a guardian of those values. \\"But we have to treat each other with respect, and I know that is difficult when there is the most vile abuse from people who say they are members of the Labour party directed at other members of the Labour party.\\" Mr Benn, who is planning to stand as the new chair of the Commons Brexit committee, has said he will not be returning to the shadow cabinet but others have indicated they may consider doing so. Former Northern Ireland spokesman Vernon Coaker said shadow cabinet elections were \\"an olive branch that [Mr Corbyn] could use to reach out to other parts of the party\\". \\"Shadow cabinet elections would be a sign that he means what he says when he talks about wiping the slate clean and in terms of reaching out to all parts of the party while we come together to do what we all want to do which is win power for Labour.\\" Asked whether he would join Mr Corbyn's top team, if invited to do so, Mr Miliband said: \\"I decided a year ago to be a backbencher. That is what I anticipate still happening. \\"Look this is a matter for Jeremy but I don't anticipate that changing.\\" Labour leaders have handpicked their top team since elections were scrapped in 2011 but many see their return as a prerequisite for soothing tensions in the party over Mr Corbyn's leadership and accommodating different views. Labour's ruling body has held initial discussions about the issue although no decision is likely to be taken for several weeks amid calls from those close to Mr Corbyn for party members to have a say, not just MPs. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, said MPs who had quit the shadow cabinet would be welcome back because Labour was a \\"broad church\\" or could instead do \\"valuable work\\" from the backbenches. He said he was \\"open for discussion\\" as to who was able to vote in any future elections and confirmed the status quo would remain while discussions took place.

It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda.\\" Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as: ..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for \\"difficult\\" subjects in the past—Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in \\"Angel of Death\\" or Jeffrey Dahmer/Ed Gein's ghoulish proclivities in \\"213\\" and \\"Dead Skin Mask\\"—with great effect.

Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, \\"When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One possible question that could be asked from this paragraph is: What challenges did Matt Groening and Al Jean face in creating \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" while simultaneously producing the ongoing television show?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What country were the people in who then contributed to making sure the Scottish hopes would not come to be? Context: In 1695, the Scottish Parliament granted a charter to the Company of Scotland, which established a settlement in 1698 on the isthmus of Panama. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later. The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union, establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain. Answer:","output":"The country where the people were in who then contributed to making sure the Scottish hopes would not come to be is Spain. The context mentions that the Scottish settlement was besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada. This implies that the people from Spain, or specifically Spanish colonists, played a role in ensuring that the Scottish hopes would not come to be.

News article: Small Business - Entrepreneurs in Iraq Tangle in U.S. Red Tape - FORTUNE SMALL BUSINESS Iraq's economy probably won't grow on milk-and-cookie companies alone, but it's a start. That's the opinion of Sadik Hamra, whose 15-year-old Baghdad company, Hamra Cookies, employs 160 people. \\"Small companies like mine can do a lot for our country,\\" says Hamra. Until now he has sold only cookies, but he hopes to buy an adjacent dairy soon so that he can expand into the milk business (and hire another 100 Iraqis desperate for jobs). To make that happen, he says, he needs about 4 million. That amount would be hard to come by in any country, let alone Iraq. The few Baghdad banks now extending loans demand collateral of 200% to 800% of the amount requested. That is a deal breaker, even for relatively successful firms such as Hamra's. In short, he says, \\"My company needs America.\\" U.S. officials in charge of Iraq's reconstruction are realizing that they need Hamra tooand other entrepreneurs like him. Iraqi small businesses, they hope, could do for that country what small businesses have done in the U.S.: spur the economy and create jobs. \\"We can rebuild Iraq, one business at a time,\\" says Greg Wong, 43, the U.S. Department of Commerce's new senior commercial officer in Baghdad. Wong showed up in Baghdad this summer to coordinate the host of organizations now trying to help Iraqi companies get established and grow. The biggest is the U.S. Army's Operation Adam Smith, a multimillion-dollar plan to revitalize Baghdad's commercial districts and eventually build a business incubator at Baghdad University. The U.S. State and Commerce Departments are trying to establish U.S.-style chambers of commerce, first in Baghdad and later around the country. And more than a dozen nongovernment organizations, such as the Volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance and CHF International, are in Iraq, hoping to mentor entrepreneurs and distribute grants and loans. Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, they are offering loans of 100 to 5 million. Unfortunately, for all the money and all the energetic, well-meaning Americans being thrown at the problem, their efforts so far have produced few success stories. Lessons in writing business plans aren't of much use to Iraqi entrepreneurs whose shops and customers are threatened by shellfire and snipers and only occasionally have electricity. The roads over which supplies and finished goods must travel are preyed upon by bandits and kidnappers. Even picking up the phone is a hassle. Land lines are virtually useless; most Iraqis rely on cellphones. But the country has three wireless phone systems: Iraqis use one service, U.S. officials such as Wong make calls on another, and Middle Easterners from outside Iraq use a third. And the three systems do not connect with each other reliably. Some enterprising business owners, both American and Iraqi, have found ways to navigate the hostile environment. Secure Global Engineering, a Middletown, R.I., construction firm with 45 employees, had never ventured overseas until this year. But in March, CEO Stephen Johanson, 53, set up an operation in Baghdad, quickly secured some 5 million in reconstruction contracts, and now has as many as 700 Iraqis on his books. Rather than go it alone or hire an American private-security firm, Johanson partnered with a small Iraqi contractor who had political connections. Before a single shovel was dug into the ground, Johanson and his Iraqi partner (who asked not to be named) got the blessing of 54 of the area's tribal sheikhs. Says Johanson: \\"Finding local partners and settling security concerns is essential to doing business in Iraq.\\" Similarly, some Iraqi entrepreneurs are doing just fine, but they tend to own businesses catering to men and women in the U.S. military. Inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, where the majority of Americans live, is an army-built pedestrian mall of 35 stores. Set up in January as a convenience for U.S. soldiers, government workers, and civilian contractors, the market gives entrepreneurial-minded Iraqis a chance to earn some badly needed U.S. dollars. Here you can get everything from a stale 7 carton of Marlboros to 5 bootleg DVDs and sequined belly-dancing outfits for 20. The strip's most popular shop is Big John's. \\"We are like Wal-Mart,\\" says Jamal \\"Big John\\" Tayem, a burly, barrel-chested 45-year-old Iraqi who was a Russian-studies professor during Saddam's reign. Unemployed after the war, he says he saw the arrival of American soldiers more as an opportunity than an occupation. With a wink, Tayem says, \\"I knew I could work with Americanskis.\\" His English may be accented with an unusual mixture of Arabic and Russian tones, but his business sense is decidedly American. \\"We pay attention to customer service,\\" says Tayem, who prides himself on being on a first-name basis with his clientele of American servicepeople. Nearly twice the size of the other stores on the strip, at 300 square feet, and the only one to offer air conditioning, Big John's also has outdoor speakers playing everything from George Michael to OutKast. Tayem does a brisk business, and although he is vague on how much he nets each week, he makes change for customers from a thick wad of 20s and 50s.

Iraqi small businesses, such as Hamra Cookies, are looking to expand and create jobs, but face challenges in acquiring loans from local banks due to high collateral demands. 2.

Summarize this article: German President Christian Wulff resigned amid the threat of a legal probe into corruption allegations, delivering a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel that risks distracting her from the euro-region debt crisis.      Wulff is the second German president to quit in less than two years, forcing Merkel to find a fresh candidate with cross- party support for the largely ceremonial post. Merkel canceled a planned trip to Rome today as Wulff’s intentions became clear, and instead held a conference call on the crisis with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Lucas Papademos of Greece.      Wulff, 52, a former deputy leader of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, was picked by the chancellor to replace the previous incumbent, Horst Koehler, after Koehler’s surprise resignation in May 2010. Wulff was elected by a special national assembly on June 30 of that year.      His decision to quit “is a huge setback for Merkel,” Gerd Langguth, a Merkel biographer and political scientist at the University of Bonn, said in a phone interview. “No one could have imagined the extent of this. No one could have imagined that this would take on such dimensions.”      Merkel said that she will consult in the coming days with opposition political leaders to try and indentify a successor candidate to put to the assembly, which will meet within 30 days. She is due to discuss the presidential succession with her fellow coalition party leaders in Berlin tomorrow. Potential candidates mentioned in the German media include Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen and Bundestag President Norbert Lammert.      ‘Rule of Law’      Merkel said that she “deeply regrets” Wulff’s resignation, though respected the decision. The development shows “the strength of our rule of law that treats everybody equally, irrespective of position,” she told reporters.      The resignation is a diversion for Merkel as she seeks to steer Europe’s response to the debt crisis that China has said threatens to trigger systemic risks to the global economy. With a second Greek bailout hanging in the balance, Merkel, Monti and Papademos expressed optimism after their call that an agreement on Greece can be reached at a Feb. 20 meeting of euro-area finance ministers, Monti’s office said in an e-mailed statement.      The German president’s resignation is unlikely to affect the role of Europe’s biggest economy in the crisis, and might even result in “a small positive,” Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank in London said in a note.      ‘Additional Tools’      “The drive for a candidate supported by all major parties shows the current unity in German politics on major political questions,” Schulz said. “The centre-left opposition supports Merkel’s European crisis management and is even more open to additional tools including Eurobonds.”      Wulff’s role was largely confined to representing Germany abroad until allegations relating to a private home loan during his time as state prime minister of Lower Saxony were aired in Germany’s best-selling Bild newspaper on Dec. 13, then followed up in Der Spiegel magazine. Within days, he was facing growing scrutiny of his financial affairs including vacations at the homes of business people, and calls from the opposition to quit.      Prosecutors in Lower Saxony, which Wulff governed from 2003 to 2010, submitted a request to the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, to have the president’s immunity lifted. They want to open an official probe after finding “initial evidence to suppose” the acceptance of illicit favors, the prosecutor’s office in the state capital of Hanover said in a statement on its website today.      “Developments in past days and weeks have shown that this confidence and my ability to act are lastingly damaged,” Wulff told reporters at the presidential palace in Berlin today, as he announced his resignation.      ‘Legally Correct’      “As far as the upcoming legal procedures are concerned, I’m convinced that it will lead to a complete discharge. I’ve always been legally correct in my offices,” he said. “I have made mistakes but I have always been sincere.”      Pending the Federal Assembly convening, Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer, who holds the rotating chair of the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, will serve as interim president. Seehofer also leads Merkel’s Christian Social Union ally, one of three coalition parties together with her CDU and the Free Democratic Party, led by Economy Minister Philipp Roesler.      Merkel is now forced to devote her attention to lobbying for support for a fresh candidate among the 1,240-member Federal Assembly of lawmakers and state delegates that elects the president, having lost ground after regional election defeats throughout 2011 that she and other party officials blamed on the crisis.      Diminished Majority      The chancellor may struggle to push through a favored candidate compared with June 2010, when it unexpectedly took three votes to elect Wulff. The chancellor’s majority in the assembly has since narrowed to as little as two seats from 21 seats at the last vote, according to electoral website wahlrecht.de.      What’s more, the main opposition Social Democrats and Greens have indicated that they want to revive the candidacy of Joachim Gauck, a Protestant pastor and former East German dissident whom Wulff defeated for the presidency at the third ballot. Polls at the time showed Gauck to be the more popular candidate among the general public.      “If she picks a recognized personality she will survive this without damage,” Langguth said. “The question is what possibilities she has to replace” Wulff.      Island Vacation      Prosecutors have been looking into whether they need to question Wulff over payments by businessman David Gronewold in connection with a vacation on the German island of Sylt in 2007.      Last month, an office in the president’s Berlin residence was searched by prosecutors as part of a separate investigation of his former spokesman, Olaf Glaeseker. The workplace was raided because Glaeseker had left private material there that the president’s office couldn’t hand over.      German financial regulator Bafin is meanwhile reviewing whether Wulff violated capital market rules in the wake of Porsche SE’s failed bid to take over Volkswagen AG (VOW), Der Spiegel reported today. Wulff may have learned in February 2008 that Porsche was planning the bid and Bafin is reviewing whether he may have had to disclose that fact to the markets, the magazine reported, without saying where it got the information. As the prime minister of Volkswagen’s home state of Lower Saxony, he was a member of the carmaker’s supervisory board at the time.      Bafin spokeswoman Dominika Kula declined to comment, adding that the regulator has a rule not to comment on any of its investigative work. Wulff’s lawyer Gernot Lehr declined to comment when contacted by telephone today.      The resignation calls into question Merkel’s judgment, leaving her “somewhat diminished,” Sony Kapoor, managing director at Re-Define, a firm that advises governments on economic policy, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Maryam Nemazee.      Even so, Merkel is “still very much reigning as the queen of Europe for now,” Kapoor said. “There is no ready challenger to the German power play in the euro crisis today.”      To contact the reporters on this story: Patrick Donahue in Berlin at at pdonahue1@bloomberg.net; Karin Matussek in Berlin at kmatussek@bloomberg.net.      To contact the editors responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net; Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net ||||| Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's President Christian Wulff announced his resignation Friday following a series of scandals that prompted calls for him to step down.      The German presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but Wulff's resignation is seen as a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported his candidacy as president.      However, it is unlikely to impact Germany's handling of the eurozone debt crisis, Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING, told CNN.      In a brief televised statement, Merkel said she accepted Wulff's resignation with the \\"utmost respect and deepest personal regret.\\"      Wulff had put the interests of the general public to the fore in deciding to resign, Merkel said.      In a separate televised statement, Wulff said Germany \\"needs a president who can devote himself completely to national and international challenges\\" -- and one who commands the trust of a wide majority of citizens.      \\"The developments of the past days and weeks have shown that this trust and therefore confidence in my ability to serve have been adversely affected,\\" he said.      \\"For this reason, it is no longer possible for me to continue in my role as president.\\"      The scandal involves alleged political favors and financial impropriety while he was state premier of Lower Saxony.      The Hanover prosecutor's office called Thursday for the government to waive the president's immunity from prosecution, in light of the evidence it had gathered.      \\"Following extensive analyses of new documents and the evaluation of further media reports, the Hanover Public Prosecutor's Office now has sufficient factual evidence and therefore grounds for initial suspicion of receiving bribes or being granted advantages,\\" it said in a statement.      \\"(The Office) therefore proposes to the president of the German Parliament that immunity for the federal president be waived.\\"      The Hanover prosecutors are investigating David Groenewold, a German film producer, alongside Wulff.      At the center of the issue is a story -- first reported on by the German tabloid BILD in mid-December last year -- that Wulff received a low interest, €500,000 (649,000) private loan from the wife of a wealthy friend while still governor of Lower Saxony.      This was followed by intense criticism when it emerged that Wulff had attempted to prevent the paper from publishing the story. Trying to put a lid on any negative media coverage, Wulff left an angry message on the answering machine of BILD's editor-in-chief Kai Diekmann before it reported on the loan.      Although Wulff eventually apologized to Diekmann, the former president has always maintained that he did nothing wrong throughout the course of the scandals -- something he reiterated during his resignation speech.      \\"I have always behaved legally correctly in the offices I held,\\" he said. \\"I have made mistakes, but I was always honest.\\"      Merkel said Wulff's presidency would be remembered for his efforts to promote a modern, tolerant Germany.      She added: \\"With his resignation, President Wulff reiterated his conviction that he always behaved legally correctly in office and in service to the people of our country. I express my utmost respect for this position.\\"      The members of her governing coalition would now discuss who should stand for election in his place, she said, in consultation with other political parties.      Merkel had been due to meet Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti in Rome to discuss the eurozone crisis but canceled the trip amid the political storm over Wulff, who belongs to her party.      However, Brzeski said that Wulff's resignation should not have any direct impact on Germany's handling of the eurozone crisis in the short term, given his almost entirely ceremonial role.      \\"Even if it is the highest official office in Germany, he has no say at all in the government's policy toward the crisis,\\" Brzeski said.      However, in the medium term the Wulff affair could weaken Merkel's position in domestic politics, he said, which could affect her ability to win parliamentary votes on the eurozone's bailout fund, the EFSF, and a second bailout package for Greece.      Merkel has not had involvement in any of the scandals. But Wulff's departure comes within two years of the resignation of his predecessor, Horst Koehler, who was also backed by Merkel -- raises a question mark over her judgment, Brzeski added.      Merkel's decision to liaise with the Social Democrats and the Greens on finding a replacement for Wulff is a break from her earlier stance in 2010, when she insisted on Wulff as successor to Koehler, who resigned following controversial comments in which he suggested military deployments were vital to Germany's economic success.      The chairman of the Social Democrats (SPD), Sigmar Gabriel, said Wulff's decision had been long overdue.      \\"Germany needs a new beginning,\\" he said. \\"I'm assuming that the leaders of the CDU and Federal Chancellor Merkel won't for the third time be selecting a new candidate with purely partisan motives. They have to include all political parties in their discussions to find a consensus candidate.\\"      The Greens' parliamentary leaders, Renate Künast and Jürgen Trittin, said they were \\"relieved that Christian Wulff has finally unburdened the country from agonizing debate with his resignation.\\"      Wulff, who was the state premier of Lower Saxony for seven years, was one of Merkel's biggest rivals within the Christian Democrats before being elected to the presidency in 2010.      It took three rounds of voting in the Bundestag, or German parliament, before he won enough backing from lawmakers to assume the role. German presidents are elected by the Federal Convention, comprised of parliament members.      Wulff was born in Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, in June 1959 and went on to become a lawyer, according to the official website of the presidency.      He first entered local politics as a member of the CDU party in 1986 and was elected to Lower Saxony's parliament in 1994. He was chosen as state premiere by lawmakers in his party following elections in 2003.      He was the 10th president to serve in the Federal Republic of Germany. He has been married twice and has two children of his own and a stepson.      CNN's Christopher Cottrell, Laura Smith-Spark and Kendra Wates contributed to this report. |||||","output":"German President Christian Wulff resigned due to the threat of a legal probe into corruption allegations, causing a distraction for Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Slowly, painfully, organs shut down one by one as her muscles atrophy until, barley breathing. On January 12, the toddler's heart stops. The cause of death: hunger. Starvation is the Syrian government's newest and cruelest weapon against opposition neighborhoods leaving infants with swollen heads and distended bodies, their mothers dry of breast milk, and their elders skeletal and dehydrated, according to activists and doctors. In one of the earliest cases, 1-year-old Farah Atout arrived at the Maliha medical center weak and whimpering as doctors struggled to find veins to feed her intravenously. \\"I remember this child very well she was about a year old and she weighed only 4 kilograms,\\" said Dr. Mazin Ramadan, who treated Atout last November.

Established in 1957, Yarmouk, an unofficial refugee camp, has been home for decades to thousands of Palestinians displaced by Arab-Israeli wars. At National Hospital South of Damascus, near Yarmouk, 43 people have died of starvation, 22 of them children, the youngest just 23 days old, with most of the deaths occurring this past month, a dramatic increase, according to hospital staff. \\"Sometimes I get a case due to malnutrition or lack of medicine and, I feel utter desperation because I cannot help the child. We have reached a state where this is normal -- that every two to three days a child dies. It just feels like there is no nutrition. What can we do?\\" said a doctor at the hospital who did not wish to be identified out of fear of Syrian forces. Parents sometimes crumble in the face of despair and very few options. \\"I had a 2-year-old patient just a few days ago, and she was diagnosed with a life threatening condition and when her father found out he said 'OK. I will take her home to die.' Just like that -- without hesitation. He said 'What am I to do? There is no food and no medicine,' \\" the doctor said. Infants are particularly vulnerable. \\"The first 1000 days of life, from conception to 2 years are absolutely critical as far as nutrition and the developmental foundations of life are concerned. If the child in the womb of a pregnant mother, and the mother isn't getting the food she needs and there is this obstacle in the way of getting access to this kind of vital nutrients they need to grow. They are not going to recover. That is a real tragedy,\\" said Greg Barrow a spokesman for the United Nations World Food Programme. In a video widely viewed on YouTube of a skeletal 10-year-old named Bashar Kaboush in the eastern Ghouta town of Jisreen, a distraught man who CNN has confirmed is a relative of the child shouts: \\"Is this acceptable to God? Look at this child. Is this acceptable to world? Does the look like a human body? Is this the arm of a child? He is just 10 years old.\\" Mohammed Abu al Rgaa an activist in Jisreen told CNN that residents fear Kaboush and dozens of others may soon die of hunger. Rgaa shared with CNN the case of 8-month-old Mohamad Faissal from the same town who recently died from lack of infant milk and proper medical care. Shocking online video of Faissal's lifeless body bore the hallmarks of starvation such as a swollen abdomen and protruding ribs, doctors said. The cause of crisis is clear. The once thriving agriculture belt to the east of the capital and the collection of towns and neighborhoods to the south wilted under a government siege blocking food staples from those areas. Opposition-controlled farmland lies desolate after nearly two years of warfare that has destroyed crops and livestock, leaving little more than stores of grain for thousands trapped behind government tanks. Many say the blockades are used by the Syrian government as collective punishment against opposition areas. Hostilities make it difficult to gain a clear view of the scope and scale of malnutrition in the area, but the WFP estimates at least 800,000 civilians remain under siege. \\"This underlines exactly why humanitarian agencies like the WFP have been calling for more access. To really see with their eyes: What is the scale of the problem? Who is most vulnerable? What kind of assistance do they need? And how can we get it in fast? That is absolutely critical,\\" Barrow said. Amnesty International has been more direct: \\"The Syrian government is cruelly punishing civilians living in opposition-held areas. Starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime. The blockades must be lifted immediately and access to humanitarian aid must never be used to score military or political gains,\\" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director. Syrian officials failed to respond to CNN requests for comment on this story, but have said in general terms that \\"foreign-backed terrorists\\" catapulted the country into a spiral of violence that has triggered Syrian army efforts to expel opposition fighters from the Damascus suburbs. Perhaps most disturbingly, packed aid convoys ready and willing to deliver assistance to those in need are barred from doing so -- mainly by Syrian government troops. \\"The road to political stability and confidence building in Syria starts with an important step: ensuring no one dies because of a lack of food or medicine or from the cold when humanitarian workers are nearby but are not allowed in\\" said Ertharin Cousin, WFP's executive director. Geneva II peace talks secured an agreement for some aid to enter the Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp this week, but several hundred food parcels and limited medical evacuations are simply not enough to stave off malnutrition. \\"To make any progress in addressing these needs, UNRWA's presence and humanitarian assistance work must be permitted to continue and expand over a period of months, not days,\\" Chris Gunness, Spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said in a statement. \\"If the siege does not end, I expect even I will be dead,\\" Assaf said over a crackly Skype connection. \\"If the siege is not broken these cases will increase and there will be mass death. To be honest this is what I would expect: mass death.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1. Starvation has become the Syrian government's newest and cruelest weapon against opposition-controlled areas, leading to widespread malnutrition among infants, mothers, and elders in besieged Damascus suburbs. 2. Parents risk death by sniper fire in attempts to find food for their families, and doctors struggle with limited resources to treat the growing number of malnutrition cases. 3. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates at least 800,000 civilians remain under siege, highlighting the urgent need for humanitarian aid access in the affected areas. 4. Amnesty International has called for an end to the blockades, stating that starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime. 5. There is an urgent need for ongoing and expanded humanitarian assistance, as limited relief efforts are not enough to address the crisis caused by the ongoing siege."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Notably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products, which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty. In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States. Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985 by Australia in July 1992 and by Japan in June 1994.

To convert this to feet, we divide t by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot. The stripe is m miles long. To convert this to feet, we multiply m by 5280 because there are 5280 feet in a mile. The area of the stripe to be painted is then (t/12) feet by (m*5280) feet. Area is width times length, so the area of the stripe in square feet is (t/12) * (m*5280).

News article: DETROIT -- Detroit defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was ejected from the Lions' 27-15 loss to the unbeaten Green Bay Packers on Thursday after he stomped on an opposing offensive lineman.      Suh was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct and ejected early in the third quarter after the Lions thought they'd stopped the Packers on third down near the Detroit goal line. A replay showed Suh and Green Bay's Evan Dietrich-Smith scuffling on the ground briefly before the All-Pro defensive tackle first pushed Dietrich-Smith's head into the turf a few times, then stomped on the player's upper right arm.      \\"I want to apologize to my teammates, my coaches and my true fans for allowing the refs to have an opportunity to take me out of this game,\\" Suh said. \\"What I did was remove myself from the situation the best way I felt, with me being held down.\\"      Suh was quick to defend himself, saying he was trying to keep his balance while freeing himself from the brief scuffle.      \\"My intention was not to kick anybody, as I did not, removing myself,\\" he said. \\"I was on top of a guy, being pulled down, and trying to get up off the ground -- and why you see me pushing his helmet down, because I'm trying to remove myself from the situation, and as I'm getting up, I'm getting pushed, so I'm getting myself on balance.\\"      Dietrich-Smith wouldn't say it was a dirty play.      \\"Stuff happens,\\" he said.      Green Bay defensive end Ryan Pickett was more outspoken.      \\"There's no place for that,\\" Pickett said.      Ndamukong Suh was ejected after stomping Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith. Andrew Weber/US Presswire      In October 2006, then-Tennessee Titans defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth drew a five-game suspension for stomping on former Dallas Cowboys center Andre Gurode's head.      Mike Pereira, the former vice president of officiating for the NFL who now works for Fox as a rules analyst, said Thursday he expects Suh to be suspended multiple games.      \\"Stomping on a guy is way over the line. He's not a dirty player, he's a filthy player,\\" Pereira tweeted.      Suh's third-quarter dismissal helped turn a close game into a rout. It came on third down when the Lions appeared to have forced Green Bay to settle for a short field goal. Instead, the Packers scored a touchdown moments later, taking a 14-0 lead on John Kuhn's 1-yard run.      It was 24-0 at the start of the fourth, and although the Lions (7-4) scored a couple late touchdowns, they lost on Thanksgiving for the eighth straight time.      For Suh, it was another data point in the growing discussion about whether the 6-foot-4, 307-pounder plays dirty. In less than two seasons as a pro, Suh has established himself as one of the game's strongest and most athletic defensive linemen, but he's also received his share of fines.      Suh requested and received a meeting earlier this season with commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss his play. He said that dialogue was helpful, but now the league will have to decide whether more discipline -- be it a fine, a suspension or both -- is merited in this case.      \\"I can't speak on that,\\" Suh said. \\"I don't have a decision in that.\\"      In August, Suh was fined a third time for roughing up a quarterback after grabbing Cincinnati's Andy Dalton and throwing him to the turf after he had gotten rid of the ball in a preseason game. He was fined last season for hits on Chicago's Jay Cutler during the regular season and Cleveland's Jake Delhomme in the preseason.      Suh disputed the notion that he'd stepped on another player intentionally Thursday.      \\"Not by any means. I understand, in this world, because of the type of player and the type of person I am, all eyes are on me. So why would I do something to jeopardize myself and jeopardize my team, first and foremost?\\" Suh said. \\"I did push his helmet multiple times because he's holding on to me. He's grabbing me. That's the reason I'm on top of him and I'm not at the quarterback, because I'm being held down by him and so I'm pushing him off of me.\\"      The Packers had a player ejected in the first half, when Pat Lee appeared to take a swing at a Detroit player while covering a punt.      Late in the second quarter Thursday, Lee became entangled with a couple of Lions and appeared to take a swing at Detroit's Aaron Berry well after the play was over. It was part of a first half that included 12 penalties -- eight by the Lions.      The 27-year-old Lee was drafted in 2008 out of Auburn. He's started only one game in his NFL career.      Information from The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh is sorry for his third-quarter ejection for kicking Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith in the chest -- well, he's kind of sorry.      In an unrepentant and at times defiant postgame rant, Suh maintained that he did not intentionally kick the Packers' guard and declined to apologize to the offended party for his Thanksgiving Day tussle.      \\"What I did was remove myself from the situation the best way that I felt in me being held down in the situation that I was in,\\" Suh explained following the Lions' 27-15 loss. \\"My intentions were not to kick anybody, as I did not. (I was) removing myself, as you see, I'm walking away from the situation. And with that I apologize to my teammates, and my fans and my coaches for putting myself to be in position to be misinterpreted and taken out of the game.\\"      The altercation occurred after Suh was pulled to the ground by Dietrich-Smith following an Aaron Rodgers incompletion on third-and-goal. Suh could be seen on video repeatedly pushing Dietrich-Smith's head to the ground, and he then kicked the Packer as he was getting pulled from the pile.      An official immediately threw a flag, and Suh was ejected for unsportsmanlike conduct.      Suh said it was clear, from his perspective, that his actions were misinterpreted.      \\"I was on top of a guy being pulled down and trying to get up off the ground, which is why you see me pushing his helmet down,\\" Suh said. \\"As I'm getting up, I'm getting pushed so I'm getting myself unbalanced. ... With that a lot of people are going to interpret it as or create their own storylines, ... but I know what I did, and the man upstairs knows what I did.\\"      Suh added: \\"I understand in this world because of the type of player and type of person I am, all eyes are on me. So why would I do something to jeopardize myself, jeopardize my team, first and foremost? I don't do bad things. I have no intentions to hurt someone. If I want to hurt him, I'm going to hit his quarterback as I did throughout that game.      \\" ... If I see a guy stepping on somebody I feel like they're going to lean into it and forcefully step on that person or stand over that person. I'm going in the opposite direction to where he's at.\\"      Suh did not say if he expected to receive a suspension or fine from the NFL, and Lions coach Jim Schwartz just said, \\"We're worried about losing this game\\" when asked if he thought Suh might be suspended.      In 2006, then-Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth was suspended without pay for five games by the NFL for stomping on the face of Cowboys center Andre Gurode, who required 30 stitches following the incident. While Suh did not stomp on the exposed face of a player however, his fine and infraction history -- he has already been docked 42,000 this season -- likely won't be working in his favor when the NFL reviews the incident.      This latest incident certainly will give fodder to those who claim Suh is a dirty player. Lions running back Kevin Smith dodged the subject when asked by NFL Network's Albert Breer about Suh's not exactly golden reputation.      \\"The dirty player comment, I stay out of that,\\" Smith said, \\"But we need him on the field -- that's the bottom line.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Ndamukong Suh, a football player from the Detroit Lions team, got in trouble during a game against the Green Bay Packers.

When you want a drink you just; [+] Make a hole in the top of a butter dish and then pour your drink inside that dish so you can drink from that hole.;","output":"Option 1: Using a favorite mug To make a travel mug using a favorite mug, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: Choose a favorite coffee or tea mug that has a good size and shape for travel purposes, a plastic lid from a butter dish, fabric for creating a drawstring cover, a drawstring or ribbon for the cover, glue (such as hot glue or strong adhesive), a pair of scissors, a pen or pencil, and a needle and thread (optional). 2. Trace the top of the mug: Place the mug on the plastic lid from the butter dish, making sure it is centered. Trace around the top opening of the mug using the pen or pencil. 3. Cut the lid: Carefully cut out the traced circle from the plastic lid using the scissors. Make sure the cutout circle fits the top of the mug nicely. If necessary, trim any uneven edges for a snug fit. 4. Make a hole for sipping: Cut a small hole or slit in the center of the plastic circle. This will serve as the hole for drinking from the travel mug. If you prefer, you can create a small flap that can be lifted for sipping and closed back up to prevent spills. 5. Attach the lid to the mug: Apply glue around the edge of the plastic circle, and then press it onto the top of the mug, ensuring that it is properly aligned. Allow the glue to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6. Create the fabric cover: Measure the height and circumference of the mug. Cut a piece of fabric that is slightly taller than the height of the mug and long enough to wrap around it with an overlap. 7. Sew or glue the fabric: Following the measurements, fold the top part of the fabric over by about an inch (this will become the casing for the drawstring) and sew or glue this hem in place. Next, wrap the fabric around the mug and either sew or glue the two edges together to form a tube. 8. Insert the drawstring: Thread the drawstring or ribbon through the casing at the top of the fabric cover. You can use a safety pin or a bodkin to help thread the drawstring through the casing. 9. Secure the cover to the mug: Place the fabric cover over the mug and tighten the drawstring to secure it in place. Tie a bow or knot with the drawstring to keep it snug around the mug. Your travel mug is now ready for use. When you want a drink, simply untie the drawstring, lift the fabric cover, open the flap or lid, and enjoy your beverage. Close the flap and replace the cover when you're finished. Option 2: Using a butter dish To make a travel mug using a butter dish, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: Find a clean, empty butter dish with a plastic lid, a sharp knife, a drill, or a similar tool for making holes in plastic, adhesive or duct tape (optional), and a straw or reusable mouthpiece (optional). 2. Clean the dish: Ensure that the butter dish and the lid are thoroughly cleaned, and there's no residue inside them. 3. Make a hole in the lid: Carefully make a hole or opening in the center of the butter dish lid, large enough for drinking. You can use the knife, drill, or another appropriate tool to create the hole. 4. Smooth the edges: After creating the hole, make sure it has no sharp edges. If necessary, use a file or fine sandpaper to smoothen rough or sharp edges around the opening. 5. Reinforce the lid (optional): If you want, you may reinforce the edges of the hole with adhesive or duct tape to make it more secure and prevent leaks. 6. Attach a straw or mouthpiece (optional): To make it easier to drink, you can insert an (angled) straw or reusable mouthpiece into the hole in the lid. Make sure it fits tightly and doesn't leak. 7. Pour your drink: Fill the butter dish with your preferred beverage, taking care not to overfill, and then securely place the lid with the hole on top of the dish. Your makeshift travel mug is now ready for use. When you want a drink, simply lift the straw or mouthpiece and sip from the hole in the lid. Replace the straw or mouthpiece when you're finished to avoid spills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Which may sound odd coming from someone who ceaselessly praises love and sex, but it is true. I am not a fan. My mother and father were married in a small Baptist Church on Valentine’s Day in 1959. They are no longer together. They are still technically married but my father now lives in a residential care home for dementia patients and my mother lives alone. My father’s disease makes him angry and aggressive leaving my mother with blurred and fading memories of his kindness. It is a sad day for all those whose partners are transformed into strangers by illnesses. Some things aren’t fair. It is my step(ish) daughter’s birthday on Valentine’s Day (I am not married to my boyfriend so I can’t claim to be a step-mum and there is no other term for it). The end of my boyfriend’s marriage has put continents between him and his children. When he hangs up the phone after talking to his daughter, his eyes are dark with pain. It is a sad day for all those whose love is diluted by oceans. Some things can’t be changed. I remember the last Valentine’s Day I spent with my ex-husband. I was a couple of weeks away from moving out but I hadn’t told him yet. I felt sick and scared and heartbroken. My husband and I passed the entire day without speaking. As I stood on the edge of the cliff summoning up the courage to jump, I felt entirely alone. It is a sad day for all those whose love has withered away. Some things can’t be fixed. I want to believe that “love is all you need” because it feels as though it could almost be true, but then I remember, on days like this, that for as many hearts that sing, there are equally as many that struggle to beat.

What is this text about?","output":"The given text is about the scientific research and development of a novel device that aims to significantly enhance the quality of life for patients who undergo kidney dialysis treatments. Kidney dialysis, also known as hemodialysis, is a life-sustaining medical procedure commonly administered to patients suffering from chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. This treatment filters waste, salt, and excess fluid from the body by artificially replicating the functions of the kidneys in order to maintain the balance of chemicals within the blood. The process of kidney dialysis can be complex, time-consuming, and burdensome for patients due to the regular visits required to specialized clinics for treatment, which sometimes last for several hours at a time, multiple times per week. The physical and emotional toll of living with kidney disease and enduring the constraints of dialysis may also impact one's overall wellbeing, relationships and daily activities. Therefore, the development of a new device, with the potential to improve patients' lives, is of significant importance within the field of medical science. Innovations in technology and biomedical engineering can lead to groundbreaking advancements that directly benefit patients who undergo kidney dialysis. Such a device could potentially minimize the treatment duration or frequency, optimize the treatment's efficiency, reduce side effects, or address various complications associated with the procedure. For instance, it might take the form of a more efficient dialysis machine, a portable or wearable device, or an improvement in the filters and membranes used in the treatment process. In addition to the obvious benefits of faster, more effective and comfortable treatments, a new device could also offer enhanced accessibility, affordability, and convenience to patients who require regular dialysis. Furthermore, by improving patient outcomes and overall satisfaction, adherence to dialysis regimens might increase, which in turn could contribute to a reduced risk of complications and improved prognosis for patients with kidney disease. In conclusion, the text is about the ongoing efforts and scientific advancements in developing a device that could revolutionize the experience of kidney dialysis patients, ultimately improving their day-to-day lives and widening the prospects for better medical outcomes. The development of such a device would be a significant milestone for the medical community and patients alike, offering hope for a more manageable and fulfilling life for those affected by chronic kidney disease and kidney failure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's helped generateover a million downloads per day since Firefox went out of beta on Tuesday;registered over 25,000 volunteer marketers; encouraged about 100,000 Web sitesto display promotional buttons and banners; generated wall-to-wall coverage inthe blogosphere and mainstream media; and raised a quarter of a milliondollars for a full-page ad in The New York Times.\\"The  ...","output":"The Importance and Impact of the Spread Firefox Community on Internet Browsers and the Open-Source Movement The Spread Firefox (SFX) campaign was a groundbreaking community-driven effort that propelled Mozilla's Firefox internet browser to prominence and shifted the dynamics of internet browsing worldwide. In this answer, we will discuss the significance of the campaign, its various achievements, and the role it played in popularizing Firefox as well as the broader implications for the open-source movement. 1. Historical context and motivation for Spread Firefox At the time when the SFX campaign was launched in the early 2000s, Microsoft Internet Explorer dominated the market with more than 90% share. There was a growing feeling among tech enthusiasts that Internet Explorer offered limited innovation, user privacy concerns, and poor security against malware attacks. Consequently, there was a desire among the tech community to support an alternative, open-source browser like Firefox that prioritized these concerns. 2. Strategy and goals of the Spread Firefox campaign The primary goal of the SFX campaign was to create awareness and generate momentum for Mozilla's Firefox browser. Adopting a grassroots approach, the campaign aimed to build a large community of volunteers who would become active promoters of the browser among their family, friends, and online networks. Through this collaborative effort, SFX sought to challenge the dominance of Internet Explorer and promote the ideals of open-source software. 3. Remarkable achievements of the Spread Firefox campaign In less than two months, SFX made notable accomplishments, which included:    - A million downloads per day after Firefox went out of beta, starting a trend that would reach hundreds of millions of downloads in the coming years.    - Attracting over 25,000 volunteer marketers to create and share promotional content for the browser.    - Encouraging about 100,000 websites to display promotional buttons and banners, showcasing widespread support for the Firefox cause.    - Generating extensive coverage in the blogosphere and mainstream media, leading to increased visibility and credibility for the Firefox browser.    - Raising 250,000 through crowdfunding to sponsor a full-page ad in The New York Times, a significant achievement that highlighted community support for the project. 4. Lasting impact on the browser market and open-source movement The SFX campaign played an instrumental role in breaking Internet Explorer's market monopoly. As Firefox's popularity surged, it compelled Microsoft to innovate and improve the security and performance of its browser. Moreover, Firefox successfully established itself as a key player in the browser market, with its current market share of approximately 4% globally. The campaign also had broader ramifications for the open-source movement; it demonstrated the power of a united and passionate community in driving software adoption and challenging established commercial products. 5. Conclusion The Spread Firefox campaign served as a testament to the power of grassroots community mobilization and has become a defining moment in the history of interactive marketing. It not only led to the success of the Firefox browser but also left a lasting impact on internet browsing, competition among browsers, and the promotion of open-source software. As a result, the campaign continues to be seen as a seminal achievement, inspiring others to harness the collective strength of communities to effect significant change in various industries and fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Education: Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person whose music career began in Memphis in 1954, recording at Sun Records?

I'm making a new Ghostbusters & writing it with @katiedippold & yes, it will star hilarious women. \\"That's who I'm gonna call.\\" There had been rumours about a third instalment to the movie franchise for a while. As Paul Feig confirmed his involvement he also revealed he is working with Parks And Recreation writer Katie Dippold on a script. The original Ghostbusters in 1984, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, was a commercial success which earned nearly 300m (Â£385m) at the box office. The sequel movie, Ghostbusters 2 in 1989 wasn't quite as well received with mixed reviews and taking 215m (Â£132m). Paul Feig was the favourite to take-over directing the movie franchise since Ivan Reitman - who directed the first two Ghostbusters films - decided in March that he would not be involved. The first movie starred Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. They played three unemployed parapsychology professors who start a ghost removal service and end up having to save the world from an ancient god. Harold Ramis whose character was Dr Egon Spengler in the supernatural comedy, died in February at the age of 69. Dan Aykroyd, who starred as Dr Raymond Stantz is expected to be a producer on the new film. Whilst Murray, who played Dr Peter Venkman in the original, gave his backing to the idea of an all-female update to the series. He told the Toronto Star last month: \\"I'm fine with it. I would go to that movie, and they'd probably have better outfits too.\\" Murray tipped Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig - who worked with director Feig on Bridesmaids - The Amazing Spider-Man's Emma Stone and Linda Cardellini from Freaks And Geeks as possible stars.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians   are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate   tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most.

The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\"?

Q:Given the below context:  When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847. It was, according to author Steve Turner, a \\"marriage made in heaven ... The music behind 'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful. There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness.\\" Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about...

The sentence includes words like \\"Galerinin\\", \\"düzenlendiğinden\\", and \\"ziyaretçilerde\\", which have a typical Turkish structure, characterized by agglutination where parts are added to the root word to create longer words with more nuanced meanings. 3. The presence of words like \\"Partenon\\" which is a proper noun that exists in multiple languages, was not enough to definitively identify the language on its own.

By including this information in every message, you ensure the other person won't have to look it up before calling you back. State your name and number at least two times in a message. If the person does not know you personally, spell your name, so you’re sure they know who’s called them. Some voicemails garble messages, and you don’t want to miss an opportunity to talk just because your message was misunderstood. Repeat any important information to ensure it is received by the person you’re contacting. If they don’t know how long a call will last, people start to dread returning a phone call. Include an estimated call time in your message. Most importantly, stick to it. Don’t ask for ten minutes and take an hour. Make sure your estimate is accurate.  Consider saying something like, “I need 10 minutes of your time.” Ask for an amount of time, “When can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss our project?” Take the other person’s schedule into consideration, “Are you available to set aside thirty minutes to talk about this?” If there are specific questions or topics you need to answer on the call, email or text these to your coworker in advance. This allows her to feel better prepared for the conversation, and will keep the length of the call brief. Don’t assume your coworkers know your deadlines.

Additionally, it suggests providing the estimated length of the phone call you are requesting, essentially managing the recipient's expectations and allaying any potential anxieties over long or unexpected calls. To facilitate an efficient conversation, the sender is encouraged to offer a convenient time slot to the recipient considering their schedule and also to give them a heads-up regarding the topics or questions going to be discussed during the call.

Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation.  In which location the counter gas would be ionized, location B or location C? Answer:","output":"The counter gas would be ionized in location B. Step 1: Understanding the Geiger Counter mechanism:  A Geiger counter is an instrument used for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation. It works by filling a tube with a low-pressure gas. When ionizing radiation passes through the tube, it ionizes this gas. Step 2: Analyzing the information given: Keith tested the Geiger counter in three different locations: with high (A), low (B), and no radiation (C). Therefore, based on Geiger Counter's working principle, the gas in it will ionize in presence of any ionizing radiation. Step 3: Applying this information to the question: Between location B and location C, only location B has radiation (although low). Hence the Geiger counter's gas would ionize in the presence of this radiation at location B.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options: - one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them - not enough information - when one is able to acquire produce in bulk - after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","output":"one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayor Bloomberg's team picked the NV200, a small van currently in operation in Europe and Asia, as winner of the Taxi of Tomorrow competition, notes the New York Times. The Japanese automaker trumped offerings from Ford (current builder of current staple, the Crown Victoria) and Turkey's Karsan. The vehicles will start appearing in late 2013 and be phased in over five years. One potential headache: It's not wheelchair accessible, which could lead to lawsuits. Expand this summary.","output":"New York City has selected Nissan, the Japanese automaker, to manufacture the next generation of the city's 13,000 taxis as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The decision came after a competition known as the \\"Taxi of Tomorrow\\", spearheaded by the team of Mayor Bloomberg. The chosen model is the NV200, a small van that is currently in operation across Europe and Asia. Nissan's model was selected over offerings from Ford, the current provider of taxis in New York City with their popular Crown Victoria model, and Turkey's Karsan. With this selection, Nissan now boasts the prestigious opportunity of shaping the immediate future of New York City's taxi fleet.  However, the NV200 is planned to become the new standard gradually. The vehicles are expected to start appearing on the city's streets in late 2013, and their implementation will be phased out over a time span of five years, indicating a calculated approach by the authorities to transition smoothly from the older models to Nissan's NV200s. While there is a note of victory for Nissan, a potential hiccup does exist with the selected model. The NV200 is not wheelchair accessible, a feature which may lead to legal action. Despite the innovative designs and enhanced comfort provided by the NV200, the lack of accommodation for citizens with physical disabilities could instigate lawsuits against the city or Nissan. This would add another layer of complexity to the integration process of the new taxis and could potentially slow down or even halt their introduction to New York City's streets.  The choice of Nissan to build the next generation taxis of New York City is therefore an exciting development, albeit one laden with potential challenges. The choice reflects the global influence of the automotive industry, with a Japanese model replacing a traditional American one in one of the USA's most iconic cities. It will be interesting to see how this decision unfolds in the years ahead as the NV200 is phased in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select from the following. - worth trying - successful - useful - useless Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Every human being has a unique arrangement of the skin on his fingers and this arrangement is unchangeable. Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to \\"develop\\" them. Some of the marks found are incomplete but identification is possible if a print of a quarter of an inch square can be obtained. Question: It is   _  for a criminal to deny his crime when finger-prints are used to identify him. Answer: A:","output":"worth trying B: successful C: useful D: useless Step 1: Read and understand the article. The article explains how fingerprints are unique to each individual and can be used as a method of solving criminal cases. Fingerprints remain consistent over time and can still be identified even with surface injuries. Furthermore, the article states that a suspect's fingerprints can prove who they are, even if they try to deny their crime or their appearance changes. Step 2: Analyze the answer options in the context of the question: A: Worth trying implies that it might be a good idea for the criminal to deny the crime, but the given information about fingerprints' reliability in determining identity suggests that it is futile. B: Successful contradicts the article, which explains how fingerprints are a reliable way to prove a person's identity and thus hold them accountable for their crimes. C: Useful hints that denying the crime might help the criminal in some way, but, again, the evidence about the effectiveness of fingerprints contradicts this. D: Useless aligns with the information provided in the article, as the use of fingerprints to identify someone makes denying the crime pointless, given the accuracy and reliability of this method. Step 3: Choose the best answer based on context and analysis: The correct answer is D: useless. This is because, given the effectiveness of fingerprints in identifying criminals, it is pointless for a criminal to deny their crime when fingerprints are used as evidence."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Q:For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

His only solace comes from his trusted, long-time family lawyer, Bryan Sugarman. Unbeknownst to Charlie, his late wife, Lara, was involved in some shady business dealings with a ruthless criminal organization led by Viktor Romanov, who is determined to get his hands on Charlie's vast fortune. Lara had been secretly funneling money into Romanov's organization but decided to cut ties with them as she realized the damage her actions were causing. Romanov feels betrayed and sends his henchmen to collect the debt by any means necessary. Charlie, broken-hearted and mourning the loss of his beloved wife, becomes vulnerable to Romanov's manipulation and intimidation. Romanov convinces Charlie that the only way to protect himself and his fortune is to sign over control of his wealth to the criminal organization.

He sees the pain that Charlie is in and understands that he must do whatever it takes to protect Charlie's finances and bring Romanov to justice. Bryan embarks on a dangerous mission to uncover the truth behind Lara's death and Romanov's nefarious dealings. As Bryan investigates further, he discovers that Romanov has connections with corrupt officials within the city's legal system, making his task even more challenging.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Bacteria acquire resistance through several molecular mechanisms, such as mutations in their genetic material or by obtaining extra-chromosomal DNA.

Given the question: Information:  - The Passaic - class ironclad monitors of the U.S. Navy saw service in the U.S. Civil War and the Spanish -- American War . The last such monitor was stricken from the Navy List in 1937 . This highly successful class was an improved version of the Monitor equipped with a XV - inch Dahlgren gun in place of one of the XI - inchers .  - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history.  - John Adolphus Bernard Dahlgren (November 13, 1809  July 12, 1870) was a United States Navy officer who founded his service's Ordnance Department and launched major advances in gunnery.  - Dahlgren guns were muzzle-loading naval artillery designed by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren USN (November 13, 1809  July 12, 1870), mostly used in the period of the American Civil War. Dahlgren's design philosophy evolved from an accidental explosion in 1849 of a 32-pounder being tested for accuracy, killing a gunner. He believed a safer, more powerful naval cannon could be designed using more scientific design criteria. Dahlgren guns were designed with a smooth curved shape, equalizing strain and concentrating more weight of metal in the gun breech where the greatest pressure of expanding propellant gases needed to be met to keep the gun from bursting. Because of their rounded contours, Dahlgren guns were nicknamed \\"soda bottles\\", a shape which became their most identifiable characteristic.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'passaic-class monitor' with the relationship of 'operator'.  Choices: - southern  - united states navy The answer is:","output":"- United States Navy The Passaic-class ironclad monitors were operated by the U.S. Navy during the U.S. Civil War and the Spanish-American War. These were specifically designed naval ships that participated in significant warfare and military activities. They are not related to 'Southern' in terms of the term 'operator'. The term 'southern' references the eleven Southern states that seceded from the Union in the Civil War, but these entities did not operate the Passaic-class monitors. The U.S Navy, part of the U.S. Military, was the operator of these ironclad monitors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer the following question: Q: Which direction from the source do pollutants in an aquifer spread?    Choices:  - southward  - forward  - inward  - outward  A: A:","output":"The direction in which pollutants spread in an aquifer is not solely determined by any of the choices provided - southward, forward, inward, or outward. Rather, the movement of pollutants in an aquifer depends on various factors that influence the flow of groundwater, which include the characteristics of the aquifer, the properties of the pollutants, and external factors that affect the movement of water. An aquifer is a subsurface layer of permeable rock, sediment, or soil that holds and allows the movement of water. Groundwater in an aquifer generally moves in the direction of the hydraulic gradient, which is the slope of the water table or the pressure head. The hydraulic gradient is determined by factors such as the rate of recharge (infiltration of water into the aquifer), discharge (the extraction of water through wells), and the topography of the land surface. The groundwater flow velocity and direction are significantly influenced by aquifer permeability and porosity. Pollutant characteristics, like density and viscosity, can also affect their transport and spread in an aquifer. For instance, dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are denser than water and tend to sink vertically through the aquifer and accumulate at the bottom. In contrast, light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) are less dense than water and tend to float on the water table, spreading laterally in the direction of groundwater flow. External factors like climate, human activity, and the presence of confining layers in the aquifer can affect the movement and distribution of pollutants. For example, seasonal changes in the water table may cause pollutants to migrate in different directions throughout the year. Pumping of groundwater from nearby wells can also influence the flow pathways and cause pollutants to spread in unintended directions. In conclusion, pollutants in an aquifer do not spread in a predefined direction such as southward, forward, inward, or outward. Instead, they disperse primarily in the direction of groundwater flow, which depends on the factors mentioned above. The specific direction of pollutant spread in an aquifer will vary depending on local geology and conditions, and can only be determined through a detailed hydrogeological investigation."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations.

In the equation -6 = 2 * j, we want to isolate j so we know its value. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: (-6) / 2 = (2 * j) / 2 -3 = j So, the value of j is -3.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May is considering how to respond to the demand for a referendum. There has been speculation she will seek to delay the vote until after the Brexit process is complete. Speaking after the cabinet meeting in Edinburgh on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon said there should be no \\"blocking mechanisms\\". She said ministers had agreed that the referendum \\"must be for Scotland's national legislature to shape\\". She added: \\"It should be up to the Scottish Parliament to determine the referendum's timing, franchise and the question. \\"There should be no strings attached, no blocking mechanisms applied and no Downing Street diktat - Scotland's referendum must be made in Scotland. \\"That was the exact description the UK government themselves used ahead of the 2014 referendum, and the same principle should apply now.\\" Two important questions arise from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement that she will seek a second independence referendum. First, do voters in Scotland want a second referendum? And second, how might they vote if an independence referendum were to be held any time soon? During recent months a number of polls have asked people in a variety of different ways whether there should be a second independence referendum within the next couple of years. They have all obtained much the same answer. Around a half say there should not be, while between a third and two-fifths say there should. Read more from Prof Curtice Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mrs May said the UK government had been \\"working closely with the devolved administrations, including the Scottish government\\" on Brexit. She said: \\"This is not a moment to play politics and create uncertainty - it's a moment to bring our country together, to honour the will of the British people and shape for them a better Britain.\\" Ms Sturgeon will seek Holyrood's backing for her independence referendum plan at the end of a two-day debate in the Scottish parliament next week. The Scottish government said it would allow MSPs to debate the issue on Tuesday and Wednesday before putting it to a vote. Ms Sturgeon wants parliament to give her the authority to ask Westminster for the power to hold another referendum. A spokesman for the first minister said the Liberal Democrats had pressed for the second day of discussion. The Scottish parliament's business bureau - which agrees Holyrood's agenda - is expected to approve the timetable. The first minister said on Monday that she wanted a referendum to be held between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of the following year. The indyref2 campaign is already under way. Did it ever stop? Will it ever stop? The arguments now are political and constitutional. But what about the economic part of the debate? It mattered a lot last time. It will matter a lot if there's to be a next time. The sound of battle will be familiar, but significant parts of the weaponry have changed. If the combatants have any sense - by no means guaranteed - they'll have learned what worked in 2014, what risks being overworked, and what to avoid next time round. Read more from Douglas The BBC's Scotland editor, Sarah Smith, said the prime minister could refuse to allow another vote on independence before Brexit is completed in two years' time. That would allow the UK government to avoid having to fight on two fronts by negotiating a deal with the EU in the midst of an intense independence referendum campaign. Formal negotiations over the timing of any referendum will not begin until after the vote in the Scottish Parliament on asking the UK government to grant a Section 30 order. The order is needed for the result of the referendum to be legally binding. The minority SNP government is expected to win the vote with the support of the pro-independence Scottish Greens. On Monday, SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson had earlier said that the prime minister should not try to block plans for a referendum. He told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he did not want to \\"sit in the back of the Tory Brexit bus... and see the prime minister drive us off a Brexit cliff\\". The UK Parliament passed the Brexit bill on Monday evening, paving the way for the government to trigger Article 50, which will begin the formal process of leaving the European Union. The bill is expected to receive Royal Assent and become law on Tuesday, which leaves Mrs May free to push the button on withdrawal talks - now expected in the last week of March.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement.

Given the question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Q:I have a new situation: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection.  But I can use this background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend received fewer antiretroviral drugs? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it is Nigel who got infected with the HIV virus. Antiretroviral drugs are medications specifically used to treat HIV infection. Manny, on the other hand, contracted a bacterial infection, which will likely require antibiotic treatment rather than antiviral drugs. Therefore, Manny received fewer antiretroviral drugs compared to Nigel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Why didn't the patient get proper treatment?

Please answer the following question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Article: The expression \\"a thirst for knowledge\\" may soon have a new meaning for millions of people who have no way to get clean water. Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world. About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria. The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles   of silver. The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms   that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it. Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper. They are designed to be torn from the book. Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned. Ms. Dankovich, the inventor, says each page can treat up to 100 liters of water. She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book's pages. \\"The idea of classic texts--that's of interest maybe later. We have discussed a little bit more exciting text. But we really haven't had the time to go through _ \\" she says.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Lord Levy told BBC Newsnight he believed anti-Semitism existed across the political divide, but it seemed \\"more prominent\\" within Labour. It follows the party's decision to suspend MP Naz Shah from the party over comments about Israel on social media, pending an investigation. Ms Shah has made a \\"profound apology\\" in the Commons for her remarks. The MP for Bradford West has been widely criticised for Facebook posts she made before she became an MP, in which she suggested, among other things, that Israel should be moved to the United States. Lord Levy, who was Tony Blair's envoy and chief fundraiser, told the BBC her comments displayed \\"ignorance\\", and he was left \\"scratching his head with despair as to how people like this can enter our parliament with such a lack of knowledge, discretion and sensitivity\\". His comments were echoed by cross-bench peer Baroness Neuberger, who claimed Labour's problem of anti-Semitism was \\"attached to Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader\\", and added that it was \\"an issue with the hard left\\". Labour has faced claims of growing anti-Semitism in its ranks. Earlier this year a Labour Luton councillor was suspended from the party after claiming Hitler was the \\"greatest man in history\\". Jeremy Corbyn has insisted anti-Semitism will not be tolerated but some of his MPs say the party leadership is not doing enough to stamp it out. Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell, Ed Miliband's former chief of staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party \\"had to do more\\" to tackle anti-Semitism and MP Lisa Nandy said it had to be more \\"pro-active\\". But Ken Livingstone - the former London Mayor who is a close ally of Mr Corbyn - said Ms Shah's remarks were not anti-Semitic and the suspension was unnecessary. He told LBC Radio: \\"What we have at the moment is a lot of people making a big issue about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. In 47 years I have never heard anyone say anything anti-Semitic. \\"We expelled a couple of people from the Labour Party early on for saying things that could clearly be interpreted as anti-Semitic. \\"This is not that; this is an over-the-top comment about the horrendous conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\\" Lord Levy told BBC London Mr Livingstone was \\"living on another planet\\" and \\"well past his sell-by date\\" if he believed Ms Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic. Ms Shah was also defended by George Galloway, the former Respect MP who she defeated at the general election, who said in an article that her comments were \\"half-witted\\" but not anti-Semitic, and claims to the contrary were \\"just another stick to beat Corbyn out of office with\\". The former Labour MP said Mr Corbyn and his closest ally shadow chancellor John McDonnell were \\"lifelong campaigners for Palestinians\\" but he claimed there was an \\"establishment\\" conspiracy to falsely paint them as anti-Semitic. Initially, Mr Corbyn warned Ms Shah about what he described as her \\"offensive and unacceptable\\" posts - but he came under pressure to go further by David Cameron, at Prime Minister's Questions. Ms Shah, who has quit on Tuesday as an aide to Mr McDonnell, then told the Commons:  \\"Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relations between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none.\\" Labour later issued a statement saying Mr Corbyn and Ms Shah had agreed that she was \\"administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary\\", pending an investigation. \\"She is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed,\\" the statement added. In a 2014 Facebook post Ms Shah shared a graphic showing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline \\"Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States\\", with the comment \\"problem solved\\". The post suggested the US has \\"plenty of land\\" to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to \\"get their life and their land back\\". It added that Israeli people would be welcome and safe in the US, while the \\"transportation cost\\" would be less than three years' worth of Washington's support for Israeli defence spending. The post was brought to light by the Guido Fawkes political blogging website, which also highlighted a post in which she appeared to liken Israeli policies to those of Adolf Hitler. Naz Shah burst onto the political scene during the 2015 general election, where she ousted Respect MP George Galloway. Her selection as a candidate proved controversial, with divisions emerging in the local party. The candidate who was chosen first stood down four days later, before Ms Shah was imposed by the ruling National Executive Committee. A bitter campaign followed, with Mr Galloway sparking anger by questioning Ms Shah's account of her forced marriage. After her victory, she was celebrated locally and nationally for her unique background and life experiences. Growing up in poverty in Bradford, Ms Shah and her family were abandoned by her father who eloped with a neighbour's teenage daughter. She has spoken openly about her experience of surviving a forced marriage and domestic violence.

Question: Information:  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Styracocephalus platyrhynchus ( ' spike head ' ) is an extinct species of tapinocephalian therapsid that lived during the Guadalupian epoch . Styracocephalus ' head ornament meant that it could be recognised from a distance . The most striking feature of Styracocephalus are the large backward - protruding tabular horns . The crest stuck upwards and backwards , but there is some variation in its shape , and this suggests that it changed throughout life and that it may be sexually dimorphic . Styracocephalus was a herbivore that may have been fully terrestrial or partly aquatic like the modern hippopotamus . It may have evolved from the estemmenosuchids . Its remains are known from South Africa but it probably had a wider distribution . It was around 1.8 metres ( 5 ft 11 in ) in length , with a 42 centimetres ( 17 in ) long , 29 centimetres ( 11 in ) wide skull .  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.  - Tapinocephalus (\\"humble head\\") is a genus of large herbivorous dinocephalian that lived during the Middle Permian Period. These stocky, barrel-bodied animals were characterised by a massive bony skull roof and short weak snout. It is thought that, like the rest of the members of its family, the animals engaged in head-butting intraspecific behavior, possibly for territory or mates.  The fossil remains (skull and postcranial elements) of \\"Tapinocephalus\\" are known from the Lower, Middle, and Upper part of the \\"Tapinocephalus\\" Assemblage Zone (Capitanian age) of the Lower Beaufort Beds of the South African Karoo. Only the type species, \\"T. atherstonei\\" is now considered valid for this genus.  - Tapinocephalia is one of the major groups of dinocephalian therapsids and the major herbivorous group. Tapinocephalia is thought to consist of three clades: Styracocephalidae, Titanosuchidae, and the very successful Tapinocephalidae. Notable tapinocephalians include \\"Moschops\\", \\"Tapinocephalus\\", and \\"Titanosuchus\\".  - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian.     'styracocephalus' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'taxon rank'?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. More than half of Americans say it should be legal for gays and lesbians to marry, a first in nearly a decade of polls by ABC News and The Washington Post.      This milestone result caps a dramatic, long-term shift in public attitudes. From a low of 32 percent in a 2004 survey of registered voters, support for gay marriage has grown to 53 percent today. Forty-four percent are opposed, down 18 points from that 2004 survey.      The issue remains divisive; as many adults \\"strongly\\" oppose gay marriage as strongly support it, and opposition rises to more than 2-1 among Republicans and conservatives and 3-1 among evangelical white Protestants, a core conservative group. But opposition to gay marriage has weakened in these groups from its levels a few years ago, and support has grown sharply among others – notably, among Catholics, political moderates, people in their 30s and 40s and men.      The results reflect a changing albeit still polarized climate. Gay marriage has been legalized in five states and the District of Columbia, by court ruling or legislative action, since 2003, while many other states prohibit it. The Obama administration late last month said it would no longer defend the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law banning federal recognition of gay marriages.      GROUPS – While younger adults and liberals remain at the forefront of support for gay marriage, the new results underscore its expansion. In an ABC/Post poll five and a half years ago, for example, under-30s were the sole age group to give majority support to gay marriage, at 57 percent. Today it's 68 percent in that group – but also 65 percent among people in their 30s, up a remarkable 23 points from the 2005 level; and 52 percent among those in their 40s, up 17 points.      Adults 50 and older remain more skeptical, but even that's seen change. Most notably, 33 percent of seniors now say gay marriage should be legal, up from 18 percent five years ago.      Trends among other groups are equally striking. Compared with five years ago support for gay marriage has grown by 10 points among women, but by 18 points among men; it's now at parity. Support has grown by 17 points among Democrats, but also by 13 points among independents, to a clear majority, 58 percent, in the crucial political center. And it's 63 percent among moderates, up 21 points.      The poll has an insufficient sample size to evaluate individual racial minority groups reliably. However, support for gay marriage is essentially identical among whites, 53 percent, and nonwhites, 54 percent. That's up by 13 points among whites – and by 20 among nonwhites.      Support is up by a striking 23 points among white Catholics, often a swing group and one that's been ready, in many cases, to disregard church positions on political or social issues. But they have company: Fifty-seven percent of non-evangelical white Protestants now also support gay marriage, up 16 points from its level five years ago. Evangelicals, as noted, remain very broadly opposed. But even in their ranks, support for gay marriage is up by a double-digit margin.      METHODOLOGY – This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone March 10-13, 2011, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents. The results from the full survey have a 3.5-point error margin. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, with sampling, data collection and tabulation by TNS of Horsham, PA.

Implicit in his argument was an endorsement of monogamy, which, he wrote, \\"seems to redirect male motivations in ways that generate lower crime rates, greater GDP per capita, and better outcomes for children.\\" His interest isn't in the individual, emotional experience of sexual and romantic exclusivity so much as the evolution of cultural norms and how they impact society.      One of the best arguments for monogamy is an argument against polygamy. That is, if you ask Joseph Henrich, whose expertise was called upon last year during a Canadian Supreme Court's reconsideration of a ban on plural marriage.      Last week, I spoke with an expert who explained why monogamy makes biological sense. This time around, I spoke with Henrich about the evolutionary basis for monogamy.      You've argued that there's a connection between monogamy and democracy. What's the link there?      That's not a link I'd want to make too strongly, but it has been argued by historians that monogamy precedes, and then seems to go along with, the emergence of democratic ideals. In the Western tradition, the earliest we can trace laws about monogamy is actually to Athens when the first notions of democracy began to be instituted. The argument is that it's meant to create equality among citizens so that, essentially, there'll be wives available to all Athenian men, rather than having all the rich men take many wives. Although, men were still allowed to have slave concubines just so as long as they were non-Athenian women.      You can think of it as a first kind of effort to level the playing field. By saying that both the king and the peasant can only have one wife each, it's the first step toward saying that all men were created equal.      Open marriage has been on the cultural radar recently, but it isn't actually a new idea, right?      In many small-scale societies, there's an institution that looks like marriage, where people \\"pair bond,\\" but there's philandering on the side by both men and women. They'll often just cycle to another pair bond. It's not uncommon for hunter gatherers to have three, four or five pair bonds in the course of their life, while getting children from each one.      There are these groups in South America where people believe that the fetus is formed by ejaculations from multiple males, so the kids can have multiple fathers. You improve the survival of your child by getting him or her a second father. So when women first get pregnant, they'll seek out sexual liaisons with other men because then those men believe they have a fatherly responsibility to the child. Social norms in this case say that the husband, the primary father, cannot get upset about it, that it's perfectly OK for the woman to go out and seek these other mates -- but the ethnography suggests that these guys are really grumpy about it. You have an innate jealous reaction that's stamped down by local social norms.      What's the argument in favor of outlawing polygamy?      The core of the argument is that polygyny -- when men marry multiple wives -- takes up all the women and creates an underclass of men that have no access to partners, and those guys cause trouble. They commit crimes and engage in substance abuse.      There is also less equality for women and more strife in the home. Women are in short supply, which increases male competition, and so men use violence against women to control the household. Also, if you have one male with lots of wives, there are all sorts of stepmothers and unrelated adults in the same household as children, and that increases the likelihood of violence. The biggest risk factor for spouses killing each other is a large age difference, and in polygamous households you inevitably end up with a large age difference between at least some of the spouses.      We also have other natural experiments. The one-child policy in China creates the same kind of surplus of men because of the preference for sons [and the use of sex-selective abortion and infanticide.] You can see 18 years after you implement the one-child policy, you get extra men and that predicts extra crime. You can see the same thing in India as well. There's a Stanford economist who argues that when men can't invest in getting another wife, they then invest more in their own production. Rather than basically saving up in order to get a second wife or a third wife, they invest more in the children of the one wife they have, and in other types of economic production.      So marriage functions as a social control.      Right, and we even have some idea of the hormonal mechanisms. There's research that looks at men before and after they get married and before and after they have children. The early evidence suggests that males have two testosterone drops during those periods, and it's high testosterone levels that lead to a high level of mate-seeking and risk-taking.      Interestingly, one study was done in a polygynous society that found males don't suffer the same testosterone drop. That makes good sense because if you get married in a polygynous society, you're still on the mating market. Think of testosterone as a mating hormone: It doesn't go down because you're still looking around -- or you're looking less than you would be otherwise, if for no other reason than people are watching and expecting you to not be looking.      Which goes back to the element of social control.      One of the keys to understanding marriage is third parties. Marriage is not only a contract between two people, because there are all these outside parties with expectations about how two married people are supposed to behave. Failure to live up to that has reputational consequences.      It seems there are comparisons that can be made between, on the one hand, human marriage and infidelity and, on the other hand, socially monogamous, pair-bonding animals that sexually stray.      Here's the crucial difference: There's no evidence, at least not that I know of, of animals policing each other. In voles, the uninvolved third parties don't get upset at the vole who strays.      What do we know about mistresses and the impact affairs have in terms of diverting resources?      There seems to be at least anecdotal evidence that wealthy, high-status males not only marry serially but also have mistresses that they divert large funds to. That would be an interesting question to investigate -- I don't actually know of empirical data on that.      Clearly our system of monogamous marriage is supported by particular romantic ideals. How do concepts of romantic love differ in polygamous societies?      The best anthropology can tell us is that there's romantic love everywhere. It's not some strange Western cultural notion; the idea that it should be linked to marriage is the more unusual part. Marriage is about building households and this involves linking up kinship groups, so lots of societies by cultural evolution have decided to take away the responsibility from the young couple in deciding who should mate because there are bigger things at play.      In the smaller scale human societies, it still seems that pair bonds are created by romantic love, but these pair bonds aren't that durable. It seems that social norms are actually what make the pair bond more durable. ||||| A slim majority of Americans now support gay marriage, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.      The results underscore the nation’s increasingly tolerant views about homosexuals, and parallel a string of recent legal and legislative victories for gay rights advocates.      Five years ago, at 36 percent, support for gay marriage barely topped a third of all Americans. Now, 53 percent say gay marriage should be legal, marking the first time in Post-ABC polling that a majority has said so.      “This is very consistent with a lot of other polling data we’ve seen and the general momentum we’ve seen over the past year and a half,” said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, a leading pro-gay-marriage group. “As people have come to understand this is about loving, committed families dealing, like everyone, with tough times, they understand how unfair it is to treat them differently.”      Opponents of same-sex marriage took issue with the poll, which asks respondents: “Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?” Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, argued that the term “illegal” could be inferred to mean that violators could be imprisoned, which most Americans would consider harsh.      Brown, whose group is a prominent anti-gay-marriage group, noted that all 31 states that have put same-sex marriage on the ballot voted to ban it.      “The only poll that counts is a free and fair vote on the part of the people,” he said. “We’ve seen these biased polls time and time again — right before votes in which same-sex marriage is rejected. It’s absurd. The people of this country have not changed their opinion about marriage.”      Post-ABC News polls have used the same “legal or illegal” wording in every poll about same-sex marriage since 2003. Other surveys by the Pew Research Center, the Associated Press and CNN show similar trends.      In the new Post-ABC poll, the shift has been driven by several political and demographic groups whose support for such unions jumped sharply. Men, who previously were less supportive of same-sex marriage than women, now back it at the same rate. Support among college-educated whites, political independents and people who do not consider themselves religious also rose substantially.      Republicans, conservatives and white evangelical Christians remain the groups most opposed to legalizing gay marriage.      The survey also shows a shift in how intensely people feel on this issue. In the past, the number of Americans who felt strongly that gay marriage should be banned far outnumbered those who were passionate in their belief that it should be legal. That has balanced out, with 35 percent strongly against legal gay marriage and 36 percent strongly in favor.      Passionate opposition to gay marriage last year in part led voters in Iowa to oust three state Supreme Court justices who had joined in the unanimous decision to legalize same-sex unions in the state. Minnesota, Indiana, Pennsylvania and North Carolina are considering steps that would ban same-sex marriage in their states.      But those victories for opponents of same-sex marriage have lately been overshadowed by several defeats.      Last March, the District joined five states in allowing same-sex couples to marry. Later in California, a federal judge struck down that state’s voter-approved ban on same-sex unions. The issue is now before an appeals court and is likely to end up at the Supreme Court.      In the summer, a federal judge in Massachusetts struck down the federal government’s ban on recognition of same-sex marriages under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. This issue, too, will probably end up before the nation’s high court. In a major victory for supporters of gay marriage, the Obama administration announced earlier this month that it would no longer defend the statute in court.      Congressional Republicans have vowed to defend the law themselves and criticized Obama for elevating such a divisive social issue at a time the focus ought to be on the economy and jobs. This week, Democrats introduced bills to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and noted how the tables have turned.      “What do I say to the idea that this is a wedge issue? I say ‘Hallelujah,’ ” Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who is gay, told reporters, according to the liberal Web site Talking Points Memo. “The fact that we’ve now evolved to the point where the Republicans are complaining about the fact that we introduced this bill because it causes them political problems is a great sign of progress. It used to be the other way around.”      The telephone poll was conducted March 10 to 13, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults. Results from the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The majority of Americans now support gay and lesbian marriage, with a significant shift in public opinion from 32% in a 2004 survey to 53% today.

Here is a news article: While some might say the digital age is making infidelity simpler, here's one reason why smartphones may be bad news for wandering spouses.      A man from Côte d'Azur in the south of France claims a problem in the app meant that his wife received notifications on her phone whenever he took an Uber ride, and that she was able to see his pick up points, destinations and times.      And he says it all began when he borrowed his wife's phone and logged in to Uber.      Despite logging out of the app, notifications of his journeys continued to roll in to her phone, revealing what she suspected was evidence of his extra-marital encounters and leading to the couple's divorce.      The man is now suing Uber for €45 million, reported Le Figaro newspaper.      The technical fault is thought to be that after you log in to Uber on another device, it can keep information on you as a user and continues to give updates on that phone.      So whoever was kind enough to lend you their phone could be privy to your future rides.      Philanderous Android users should be safe however, as the problem seems to be limited to the iPhone iOS versions of the app updated after the 16th of December 2016.      Uber’s spokesperson declined to speak to Le Figaro on the matter, saying “Uber doesn’t publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure”.      An initial hearing for the case is expected next month. And with its high-profile status, we could see more similar complaints coming from Uber’s 40 million monthly active users soon.      This isn’t the first run-in Uber has had with the French either. In December Paris Uber driver’s blockaded French airports in protest over pay and in 2015 a French version of the app Le Taxi launched to rival Uber's dominance.      Will this case be another blow for Uber's popularity in France?      READ ALSO: Protesting Uber drivers blockade access to Paris airports      By Rose Trigg ||||| A French businessman is suing Uber for 45 million after a bug in the ride-hailing app led to his divorce.      A glitch in the Uber app allegedly allowed the man’s wife to keep tabs on his location, and determine he’d been cheating on her, according to the French newspaper Le Figaro. The man had previously used his wife’s iPhone to hail an Uber, but the device continued receiving notifications even after he logged out.      Those notifications led his ex to believe he had been cheating on her.      And the man now wants Uber to pay for it.      He is suing for a hefty 45 million in damages, claiming the app (not the whole cheating thing) led to his divorce.      Le Figaro was able to replicate the incident on iPhones (Android users, you’re probably safe), and says it is possible to obtain the information on an Uber passenger’s location without needing a password.      Uber, understandably, doesn’t want anything to do with all this. The company told the newspaper, “Uber doesn’t publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure.”      Ouch.      The case will have an initial hearing in late February.      H/T the Next Web ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Even after he stopped using her phone, it still showed her messages about where he was going with Uber cars.

While they agree that they need to stand up for Sam, they have different approaches. Clyde, who is sensitive and a bit of an outsider himself within the group, is more sympathetic and passive. Marty, who has issues with anger and trauma stemming from his father's suicide, his mother's apathy and his older brother's abuse, favors a more righteous form of revenge.Eventually, they hatch a plan with Sam to invite George on a fake birthday party for Sam, which George all-too eagerly accepts.

The slight difference in the sentence structures does not alter the overall meaning of the statements. In the first sentence, \\"The tower house, built in the 9th and 10th centuries, was expanded in the Middle Ages into a castle,\\" the emphasis is slightly more on the time period (the Middle Ages) when the tower house was expanded into a castle.

All theme parks in Britain have cafes, restaurants, picnic areas and gift shops, so you'll still have plenty to see and do when you and the kids have been on enough rides. There are usually smaller \\"funfair\\" rides and games as well, so younger children won't get bored. Several theme parks also have other attractions next to them, e.g. water parks often open all year round, unlike the theme parks. Wherever you are in Britain, there's likely to be a theme park within one or two hours' drive, bus ride or train journey. Several theme parks even have accommodation  so you can stay for a day or two if you want to make a trip into a short holiday. Prices for UK theme parks vary considerably; some have an entrance price which allows you to go on all the rides, while in others you have to pay for every ride individually. It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year! If you're thinking of visiting a UK theme park, it's worth having a look for special offers on tickets.

Cars were still young when it happened. The accident took place in New York City in May 1896. A man from Massachusetts was visiting the city in his new car. At that time, bicycle riders were still trying to get used to the new set of wheels on the road. No one was sure who was to blame for it. Anyway, the bike and the car hit each other hard. The man on the bike was injured. The driver of the car had to stay in jail and wait for the hospital report on the bicycle rider. Luckily, the rider was not killed. Three years later, another car accident took place. It was again in New York City. A man named Henry Bliss stepped off a streetcar . He was hit by a passing car. Once again, no one was sure just how it happened or whose fault it was. The driver of the car was put in prison. Poor Mr. Bliss became the first person to die in a car accident. Question: In both accidents the drivers of the cars   _  . - could not drive their cars very well - had to stay in prison for a while - tried to run away after the accidents took place - knew it was their fault A:","output":"In both accidents the drivers of the cars had to stay in prison for a while."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: People can't survive for more than three or four days without fresh water. Go inland and try to find a water source from a stream or waterfall on the island. If it's completely barren, then you'll need to create a solar still and take advantage of rainfall when it occurs.  A solar still uses the sun to create condensation. Dig a hole in the ground and put a container at the bottom. Surround the hole with wet leaves, then put a large piece of plastic down over the hole and weigh it down. Condensation will collect in your container and you'll be able to drink it.  When it rains, make sure that you are filling up containers to catch the fresh water to keep you hydrated for the long run. Boil the water before you drink it. Check for water at the base of leaves or cacti, inside of caves, hollowed trees, or undercut banks.  You can also get water from coconuts, cacti, or other plants and fruits.  Collect rainwater in buckets, plastic containers, bins, or garbage cans. Heating the water above 185° F (85° C) for three minutes will kill all pathogens in your water.  Severe dehydration could cause low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, delirium, or unconsciousness.  Do not drink salt water from the ocean because it will dehydrate you. While your body is capable of surviving one to three weeks without any food, not eating will weaken you, and it will make it harder to do other things that are required to survive on a desert island. Eat fruits and vegetables that you know not to be poisonous like coconuts, bananas, and seaweed. Avoid potentially poisonous, unknown berries. Scurvy is a serious condition that occurs when you don't have a balanced diet. Symptoms include fatigue, anemia, and infections and is caused by a vitamin C deficiency. Eating fresh citrus fruits like lemons and oranges can help prevent the condition. The protein and nutrients from meat and fish will give you energy. Mollusks, clams, oysters, crabs, muscles, and fish are all things that you may be able to find in the shallow waters surrounding or on an island.  You can sharpen sticks and hunt small reptiles, fish, or birds in the isle as well.  If you're having trouble catching or trapping bigger game, locate slower moving insects that you can eat that live in the desert like beetles, spiders, and centipedes.  Cook shellfish thoroughly before consuming it. Bacteria could cause you to become ill. If you cannot create a makeshift fishing pole, then sharpen a long branch or stick to make spears that you can use to go spearfishing. If you've never eaten the fruit that you find on the island, test it for poison by rubbing it on a sensitive part of your skin, like your wrist. Wait 45 minutes. If there is no adverse reaction, rub some of the food on your lips. If you form a rash, or there is burning or irritation, then the food is most likely poisonous. Never eat large amounts of any unknown food. Eat a small amount, wait an hour or two to see if you feel sick, then eat the rest of it. Beware of fruit that smells like peaches or almonds as it could be poisonous. Do not waste anything, even if you have an overabundance of it. Store away your excess food and water and stick to strict rationing.  The body requires 32 ounces of water a day and 200-1500 calories of food for an average person. Try to ration as much as possible without becoming dehydrated or malnourished. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To survive on a desert island, it's crucial to find a fresh water source or collect rainwater using a solar still, as people can't survive more than a few days without water. Avoid drinking salt water as it will dehydrate you.

To answer the question, let's look at some of the notable stadiums in New Haven that have continued to host minor sport leagues: 1. Yale Bowl: Over its long history, the Yale Bowl has hosted numerous events, including minor league and international sporting events. Recently, it has been the primary venue for the Yale Bulldogs football team, which competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). 2. Veterans Memorial Coliseum: Although the Veterans Memorial Coliseum was demolished in 2007, it formerly hosted minor league hockey teams such as the New Haven Nighthawks, New Haven Senators, and the Beast of New Haven. As of now, there is no active replacement facility in the city. 3. Palmer Field: Palmer Field, located in the nearby town of Middletown, Connecticut, is a regional baseball field that continues to host CIAC high school championships games, American Legion Baseball, and other regional and local baseball events. 4. Reese Stadium: Reese Stadium is home to Yale's men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams. While not a minor league stadium, it serves as a venue for collegiate sports and other athletic competitions, contributing to the local sports scene. 5. Bennett Rink: This ice hockey rink is home to Southern Connecticut State University's club hockey team and the Amity, Woodbridge, and Bethany co-op high school team. While it is not a professional stadium, it provides an opportunity for amateur hockey players to participate in regional events, contributing to New Haven's sports legacy. In summary, while the original sentence provided historical context about New Haven's professional sports history, it did not answer the question about stadiums that continue to host minor sport leagues in modern times. By providing details on the Yale Bowl, Palmer Field, Reese Stadium, and Bennett Rink, we have shared some stadiums and venues in the New Haven area that host both minor league and amateur sporting events in modern day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But this was no debate: The candidates appeared in turn to take questions from moderators and audience members. Some highlights, per the Hill, CNN, the Washington Post, the Des Moines Register, and Politico: Hillary Clinton \\"Sorry President Obama, sorry Bill—Abraham Lincoln,\\" Clinton said when asked who her favorite president was.

He indeed plays the piano in the movie, and the actor performed all those piano sequences himself. Gosling spent a significant amount of time learning the instrument in preparation for his role in La La Land. The film features numerous long shots of Ryan Gosling performing the piano parts, without any cuts or edits which would indicate the possible use of a double or digital enhancement. This demonstrates his abilities as an accomplished pianist. Answer 2: Yes, Ryan Gosling did learn to play the piano for his role in La La Land. Gosling trained intensively for about three months before the start of the film production. He worked with a jazz pianist to help him develop the skills necessary for him to portray the character convincingly. During this time, he would practice for up to four hours a day, and as a result, he was able to play various pieces without the use of a piano double. The answer to both questions is fundamentally the same, in the sense that they both focus on the fact that Ryan Gosling played the piano in La La Land. However, the first question asks specifically whether he played any of the instruments, while the second question is asking if he learned to play piano for the film.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Consider the perturbation hypothesis and its relation to the process of breathing and oxygen distribution. The perturbation hypothesis states that changes in weather conditions may cause less mushroom growth. Now, let's examine if this has any direct or indirect effect on the process of converting air into oxygen in the lungs. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between mushrooms and the breathing process. Mushrooms are fungi and are not directly involved in the process of breathing or oxygen distribution in the human body. Their growth is influenced by weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Step 3: Examine any possible indirect effects on the breathing process. The only possible indirect effect of less mushroom growth on the breathing process would be if it altered the atmospheric composition, specifically, the concentration of oxygen in the air. However, this scenario is highly unlikely, as mushrooms do not significantly contribute to oxygen production. Photosynthesis in plants is the primary source of oxygen production. Step 4: Determine the impact of the perturbation hypothesis on the process. After analyzing the perturbation hypothesis and its relation to breathing and oxygen distribution, it is clear that the hypothesis has no direct or indirect effect on the process. The growth of mushrooms due to changes in weather conditions is unrelated to the conversion of air into oxygen in the lungs, and the distribution of oxygen through red blood cells in the body."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12]  and the situation: The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which  had shallow water was a surfer's heaven.  Answer the following question: Which beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing? Answer:","output":"The Coral beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing. This is because it had deeper water which does not produce the high and steep waves preferred by surfers. On the other hand, Surfer beach with its shallow water was more suitable as it creates higher and shorter waves ideal for surfing and windsurfing when waves approach shore."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: A new study contends having a child can mar parents' happiness more than divorce, unemployment and even the death of a partner.      According to biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, having a child in today's society is often coupled with social isolation -- the main culprit behind that emotional dip.      \\"You get some presents from various friends, and then they just leave you alone because they figure you're too tired and too busy,\\" Fisher said Wednesday on \\"CBS This Morning.\\"      That reaction is a stark contrast to the swarm of support from friends and family in situations usually perceived to be more distressing.      \\"People simply assume that when you are getting a divorce -- they're piling in to help you, they pile in to help you when you've lost your job, they really pile in to help you when you've lost your partner. But they don't pile in when you've had a child. They figure you're happy,\\" Fisher said.      But according to the study published in Demography, happiness is often not the emotion many parents feel.      Researchers Rachel Margolis and Mikko Myrskylä, examining how the experience of becoming a first-child parent affects the likelihood of having additional children, found that 73 percent of participants expressed decreased happiness after their first child, compared to 27 percent who reported no change or an increase in happiness.      Margolis and Myrskylä examined data of 2,301 German parents from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study between 1984 to 2010.      They found respondents who had a second child -- and thus reported higher life satisfaction during their transition to parenthood -- were more likely to have had their first child at a younger age, to have been partnered when their first child was conceived and to have been immigrants.      That third data point could be key to further understanding why having a first child in a modernized culture can unfavorably affect parents' emotions.      Fisher pointed out that today's society is experiencing a momentous shift away from our instinctual needs.      \\"We used to live in large communities, and our allegiance was to God and to community and larger family. Now it's to one person, and when one that system begins to break down with the exhaustion, etc., then you're losing almost everything,\\" she said.      Perhaps those immigrants who continued to have children adhere to more community-oriented customs and thus don't experience the depression, domestic isolation or breakdown in relationships as reported by other parents.      The study also found women were more likely to have experienced a difficult transition into parenthood.      \\"I jog in Central Park in the mornings, and I see these groups of mothers with their little baby carriages with tiny babies in it, and they're building that local community that the human animal needs, but they will all go home alone; they will all spend the rest of the day pretty much by themselves,\\" Fisher said. ||||| A standing puzzle in demography is why fertility in many developed countries is so far below replacement level. Recent answers focus on fecundity impairments brought on by postponement of fertility, the high opportunity cost of childbearing, and partnership dissolution (Bongaarts 2001; Morgan and Rackin 2010; Quesnel-Vallée and Morgan 2003). From the purely demographic perspective, progression to parity 2 is critical because differences in fertility across developed countries are largely driven by differences in the probability of having a second child (Van Bavel and Różańska-Putek 2010). Our analysis addresses the crucial question of why those who have one do not go on to have another. We highlight how parents’ experience of a first birth shapes whether they go on to have another child. Analyzing data from Germany, a country that has had period total fertility rate below 1.5 since 1983, we find that people whose subjective well-being drops after the birth of a child are less likely to have another child than those whose subjective well-being stays at the pre-birth level. The experience during transition to parenthood is an important and understudied factor in determining completed family size. Policy-makers concerned about low fertility should pay attention to factors that influence the well-being of new parents and that might inhibit further parity progression.      Fertility research can benefit from incorporating an element of learning about parenthood. Prior research has used the macro perspective to analyze how childbearing spreads within a population (Myrskylä and Goldstein 2013); our analysis focuses on learning at the individual level. Before having children, potential parents do not know firsthand what is involved with parenting or how it will be for them. Prior research has postulated the potential importance of the psychosocial experience of parenting in fertility behavior (Newman 2008; Presser 2001). We show that the size of the drop in well-being around a first birth varies greatly; furthermore, this drop has important repercussions for completed family size, net of other factors, such as age at first birth, family resources, and partnership status. Progression to second birth within five years was 0.6 for those with no drop in well-being at first birth compared with 0.5 for those with a large drop, net of other factors.      Subjective well-being changes after a first birth may also be important for the TFR. We used parity progression rates for the 1959 birth cohort in Germany (Kreyenfeld 2002) to simulate how much the TFR would increase if those who experienced a drop in subjective well-being after the first birth, and consequently decreased parity progression, would have had the same progression to parity 2 as those who did not experience a drop in subjective well-being. The resulting increase in national-level TFR would be 0.05 children. In the German context, with TFR hovering below 1.4, this is an important change and similar in size to the effects of the recent recession on fertility (Goldstein et al. 2013).      How relevant are these findings for other low-fertility countries? In part, this depends on the size of the childless population, which dictates the proportion of the population at risk of the transition from parity 1 to 2. Childlessness among German women increased from 11 % of the 1935–1939 birth cohort to 22 % for the 1965–1969 birth cohort, the latest for which childlessness can be calculated without forecasting (Kreyenfeld and Konietzka forthcoming).4 Thus, approximately four-fifths of the German population will be represented by our data. This number would likely be higher in most other European countries, where the contribution of childlessness to low fertility is much lower than in Germany (Billari and Kohler 2004; Sobotka 2004, 2008). A second demographic component, which dictates how relevant this research is for other contexts, is the second birth rate. The proportion of mothers in Germany with two or more children declined from 75 % for the 1935–1939 birth cohort to 68 % for the 1965–1969 birth cohort. Relative to other European countries, second birth rates for Germany are slightly below the median. Thus, from a demographic perspective, the importance of subjective well-being in determining progression from parity 1 to 2 would be even greater in many countries than the one studied here, which has lower proportions of childless people and lower second birth rates. From a conceptual perspective, we cannot say whether subjective well-being around the transition to parenthood will be as strong a predictor of having a second child in other contexts. However, earlier qualitative research on this topic focused on different populations (e.g., U.S. in Presser 2001; Australia in Newman 2008) and came to the same conclusions as this article. Although the well-being of parents is important for the progression to a second birth, the determinants of progression to other birth orders are likely to be different, and different analysis strategies are needed to understand them (Bloom and Trussell 1984; Keizer et al. 2008; Kreyenfeld 2004; Mencarini and Tanturri 2007).      In testing for heterogeneous effects of the transition to parenthood on fertility behavior, we found that the drop in well-being around the transition to parenthood was a stronger predictor of not having a second birth for highly educated parents and those who waited longer to have a first child. We propose four possible reasons for this finding. First, highly educated parents may not enjoy the mundane tasks of parenting (Newman 2008; Presser 2001). High-SES parents may be in careers that strongly discourage childbearing (Morgan and Rackin 2010), and these parents who have a difficult transition to parenthood feel that they cannot be successful at work and have another child. Third, having a child may disproportionately increase stress of high-SES workers because of higher demands of work while at home (Schieman et al. 2006), leading to a lower likelihood of parity progression. Last, high-SES parents who learn that parenting is harder than they expected may be more prone to revise their fertility intentions downward. Alternatively, even if there were no differences in how fertility intentions are revised, high-SES parents may be better at meeting their lower fertility preferences with contraceptives than their low-SES counterparts (Ranjit et al. 2001). It is possible that the factors influencing fertility of these subpopulations are particularly important for future fertility prospects because fertility is being postponed to increasingly higher ages—for example, mean age at first birth is already above 30 in Germany (OECD 2012)—and overall educational attainment is increasing.      This analysis has limitations. First, our analysis describes the predictors and consequences of changes in overall life satisfaction for parity progression, but it cannot speak to the underlying mechanisms that determine parents’ difficulty with the transition to parenthood. These factors, such as the ease of the birth experience, level of exhaustion during the first year, and relationship stress, are not available in our survey data and are better suited to qualitative work, such as that by Newman (2008). Therefore, this research should be read alongside qualitative work. Another potential mechanism is related to “time running out.” Older parents may be influenced particularly strongly by the arrival of the first child and the experiences and responsibilities surrounding that birth because they may be aware and concerned about getting closer to the end of their reproductive age span. We are not able to examine this possibility because of data limitations. Moreover, our data do not include information on fertility desires or intentions, so we cannot analyze this. Second, we are not able to capture fertility aspirations or intention status of births in our data. Therefore, we do not know whether the drop in well-being around the first birth and the subsequent lower probability of having a second child is due to lower fertility intentions or a less positive attitude toward childbearing in the first place or whether new parents are revising their fertility intentions. However, it is also a strength to focus on transition to second birth rather than on fertility intentions or desires because it is ultimately the reproductive behavior, not intentions, that directly shape population dynamics. Nevertheless, future research on work–family conflict, planning status of births, and instrumental support would be useful to further our understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying changes in well-being around the transition to parenthood. Third, our analysis is based on annual data that do not allow analyzing changes in subjective well-being within the years before and after a birth. Prior research indicates that the risk of perinatal and postnatal depression may vary in the years before and after the birth (Banti et al. 2010), suggesting that a more nuanced analyses of the within-year changes might provide further insights into how changes in subjective well-being around the birth influence future fertility. Fourth, our measure of parental well-being is based on a distal measure of positive well-being. We capture other important factors that also matter in this analysis, but we cannot wholly exclude unmeasured factors that also contribute to changes in well-being other than having a child. Last, we examine whether the importance of changes in subjective well-being around the first birth for parity progression vary by three key demographic characteristics—sex, age, and education—but we do not analyze other potential factors. Many other factors may also be important determinants of the well-being pattern—for example, sibship size or birth order (because having had younger siblings may help anticipate the challenges of parenthood), and access to affordable childcare. Analyzing the factors determining the pattern of changes in well-being around first birth is beyond the scope of this study, but some of these factors have been analyzed in other research (Myrskylä and Margolis 2014). However, given the importance of well-being trajectories, it would be important in future studies to analyze the factors that influence the well-being trajectory around the transition to parenthood.      Despite these limitations, this article presents evidence that parents’ subjective experience of a first birth is an important and understudied factor in determining final family size. An immediate follow-up question stemming from our results is whether policy could influence the subjective well-being of new parents. In 2007, Germany implemented several new policies that were aimed at supporting new parents, and preliminary evidence suggests that these policies may have positively influenced parental well-being (Myrskylä and Margolis 2013). Further research on low fertility should address the ways in which parenting experiences throughout the life course affect fertility behavior upward or downward. After all, having children is a choice in most contexts, and adults can revise their plans as they learn firsthand about what being a parent is like. ||||| Life has its ups and downs, but parenthood is supposed to be among the most joyous. At least that's what the movies and Target ads tell us.      In reality, it turns out that having a child can have a pretty strong negative impact on a person's happiness, according to a new study published in the journal Demography. In fact, on average, the effect of a new baby on a person's life in the first year is devastatingly bad — worse than divorce, worse than unemployment and worse even than the death of a partner.      Researchers Rachel Margolis and Mikko Myrskylä followed 2,016 Germans who were childless at the time the study began until at least two years after the birth of their first child. Respondents were asked to rate their happiness from 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied) in response to the question, \\"How satisfied are you with your life, all things considered?\\"      [Maternal exposure to anti-depressant SSRIs linked to autism in children]      \\"Although this measure does not capture respondents' overall experience of having a child, it is preferable to direct questions about childbearing because it is considered taboo for new parents to say negative things about a new child,\\" they wrote.      The study's goal was to try to gain insights into a longstanding contradiction in fertility in many developed countries between how many children people say they want and how many they actually have. In Germany, most couples say in surveys that they want two children. Yet the birthrate in the country has remained stubbornly low — 1.5 children per woman — for 40 years.      Margolis, a sociology researcher at the University of Western Ontario, and Myrskylä, director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, found that most couples in their study started out pretty happy when they set out to have their first child. In the year prior to the birth, their life satisfaction ticked up even more, perhaps due to the pregnancy and anticipation of the baby.      [Anti-vax mom changes her tune as all 7 of her children come down with whooping cough]      It was only after birth that the parents' experiences diverged.      About 30 percent remained at about the same state of happiness or better once they had the baby, according to self-reported measures of well-being. The rest said their happiness decreased during the first and second year after the birth.      Of those new mothers and fathers whose happiness went down, 37 percent (742) reported a one-unit drop, 19 percent (383) a two-unit drop and 17 percent (341) a three-unit drop.      [How parents create narcissistic children]      On average, new parenthood led to a 1.4 unit drop in happiness. That's considered very severe.      To put things in perspective, previous studies have quantified the impact of other major life events on the same happiness scale in this way: divorce, the equivalent of a 0.6 \\"happiness unit\\" drop; unemployment, a one-unit drop; and the death of a partner a one-unit drop.      The consequence of the negative experiences was that many of the parents stopped having children after their first.      The data showed the larger the loss in well-being, the lower the likelihood of a second baby. The effect was especially strong in mothers and fathers who are older than age 30 and with higher education.      Surprisingly, gender was not a factor.      [95 percent of parents think their overweight children are ‘just right’]      \\"Fertility is a choice for most people in the developed world … [I]f the transition to parenthood is very difficult or more difficult than expected, then people may choose to remain at parity,\\" the researchers wrote.      Margolis and Myrskyla wrote that challenges of new parents that impacted their decision to have another fell into three categories. The first two had to do with health. Mothers reported physical pain and nausea conflicted with their desire to work. Fathers expressed concern about the medical issues of their partner. Second, complications during the birth also appeared to shape their decision to not \\"go through it again.\\"      The third category was the most significant and was about \\"the continuous and intense nature of childrearing.\\" Parents reported exhaustion due to trouble breast-feeding, sleep deprivation, depression, domestic isolation and relationship breakdown.      The findings are likely to be eye-opening for some policymakers who are concerned about low fertility rates in their countries and suggest that governments should consider giving additional support to new parents.

Information:  - Spirogyra (common names include water silk, mermaid's tresses, and blanket weed) is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae of the order Zygnematales, named for the helical or spiral arrangement of the chloroplasts that is diagnostic of the genus. It is commonly found in freshwater areas, and there are more than 400 species of \\"Spirogyra\\" in the world. \\"Spirogyra\\" measures approximately 10 to 100 m in width and may grow to several centimeters in length.  - In vascular plants, phloem is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis (known as photosynthate), in particular the sugar sucrose, to all parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word (\\"phloios\\") meaning \\"bark\\".  - Chlamydomonas is a genus of green algae consisting of unicellular flagellates, found in stagnant water and on damp soil, in freshwater, seawater, and even in snow as \\"snow algae\\" \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is used as a model organism for molecular biology, especially studies of flagellar motility and chloroplast dynamics, biogeneses, and genetics. One of the many striking features of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is that it contains ion channels, (channelrhodopsins), that are directly activated by light. Some regulatory systems of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" are more complex than their homologs in Gymnosperms, with evolutionarily related regulatory proteins being larger and containing additional domains.  - In taxonomy, the Volvocales, also known as Chlamydomonadales, are an order of flagellate or pseudociliate green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. Volvocales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from \\"Gonium\\" (4 to 32 cells) up to \\"Volvox\\" (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to \\"Chlamydomonas\\", with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination.  - Kelps are large seaweeds (algae) belonging to the brown algae (Phaeophyceae) in the order Laminariales. There are about 30 different genera.  - Gonium is a genus of colonial algae , a member of the order Volvocales . Typical colonies have 4 to 16 cells , all the same size , arranged in a flat plate , with no anterior - posterior differentiation . In a colony of 16 cells , four are in the center , and the other 12 are on the four sides , three each . A description by G.M. Smith ( 1920 , p. 94 ) : Gonium Mueller 1773 : Colonies of 4 - 8 - 16 cells arranged in a flat quadrangular plate and embedded in a common gelatinous matrix or connected by broad gelatinous strands . Cells ovoid to pyriform , with a single cup - shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid . Each cell with two cilia of equal length , contractile vacuoles at the base of the cilia , and an eyespot . Four - and eight - celled colonies with the cilia on the same side ; sixteencelled colonies with the four central cells having their cilia on the same side and the twelve marginal cells with radially arranged cilia . Asexual reproduction by simultaneous division of all cells in the colony to form autocolonies , or by a formation of 2 - 4 zoospores in each cell .  - A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. The word \\"flagellate\\" also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many protists (eukaryotic organisms) and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \\"flagellate\\" is included in other terms (such as \\"dinoflagellate\\" and \\"choanoflagellata\\") which are more formally characterized.  - The Chlorophyceae are one of the classes of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology. For example, the chlorophycean CW clade, and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their flagella. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a \\"clockwise\\" (CW, 17 o'clock) direction e.g. Chlamydomonadales. Members of the DO clade have flagella that are \\"directly opposed\\" (DO, 126 o'clock) e.g. Sphaeropleales. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The chloroplast may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectose.  - Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 m in diameter, and is without flagella. \\"Chlorella\\" contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.  - Charophyta is a division of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. In some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagellae are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in stoneworts (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil stoneworts of Devonian age that are similar to those of the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other. The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to shoots and leaves, but it also transports some nutrients. The word \\"xylem\\" is derived from the Greek word  (\\"xylon\\"), meaning \\"wood\\"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout the plant.  - Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae. It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. \\"Volvox\\" diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately .    What is the relationship between 'gonium' and 'volvocaceae'?","output":"The relationship between Gonium and Volvocaceae is that Gonium is a genus of colonial green algae, and it belongs to the family Volvocaceae. The Volvocaceae family is a group of green algae that form colonies of different sizes and complexities. Both Gonium and Volvox, another genus in the Volvocaceae family, share similarities in their colonial structure and flagella arrangement. Gonium typically forms colonies of 4 to 16 cells arranged in a flat plate without anterior-posterior differentiation. Each cell in a Gonium colony is similar in size and shape and possesses two flagella, which move in coordination throughout the colony. On the other hand, Volvox forms spherical colonies consisting of up to 50,000 cells. Despite the differences in colony size and shape, the cells of both Gonium and Volvox have two flagella, allowing them to move and function as a coordinated unit. In summary, Gonium and Volvocaceae are related because Gonium is a genus within the Volvocaceae family, which also includes the Volvox genus. Both genera are known for their colonial organization and coordinated flagella movement among their cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:-  Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process after the remaining oxygen enters the body is the distribution and utilization of the oxygen by the body's cells for various metabolic processes. Here is a detailed explanation of this final step: 6. Oxygen transportation to body cells: As the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs flows into the pulmonary veins and returns to the heart, the left atrium receives it and then transfers it into the left ventricle through the bicuspid or mitral valve. The left ventricle then contracts, pumping the oxygenated blood into the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. The aorta further branches into several smaller arteries, arterioles, and eventually, capillaries, which reach all parts of the body, including muscles, organs, and tissues. 7. Oxygen exchange in the capillaries: The oxygen carried in the blood by hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells (RBCs) is diffused across the thin walls of the capillaries and into the body's cells. This process occurs due to a concentration gradient, where the area with higher oxygen concentration (oxygenated blood in the capillaries) moves to an area with lower oxygen concentration (body cells). The oxygen transported is then used by the cells for various metabolic processes, including cellular respiration, which generates the energy necessary for crucial cellular functions. 8. Carbon dioxide formation and transportation: During cellular respiration, waste products are formed, including carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a by-product of the cells converting oxygen and nutrients into energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP). The CO2 produced in the cells then diffuses back into the capillaries due to another concentration gradient, where the area with higher CO2 concentration (body cells) moves to an area with lower CO2 concentration (deoxygenated blood in the capillaries). This deoxygenated blood consisting of CO2 is then carried by the capillaries back into the veins, which merge into larger veins, ultimately leading to the inferior and superior vena cava. 9. Carbon dioxide elimination: The deoxygenated blood carrying CO2 flows through the superior and inferior vena cava into the right atrium of the heart. It is then pumped into the right ventricle and sent via the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where the process of oxygenation began. In the lungs, CO2 diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, where it is expelled through exhalation. This completes the cycle of air intake, oxygen distribution and utilization, and carbon dioxide removal in the human respiratory system, ensuring the cells continue receiving the oxygen they need to function optimally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Passage: Monday marked the beginning of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, the King again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York, in charge of operations. James set up command posts round the perimeter of the fire, press-ganging into teams of well-paid and well-fed firemen any men of the lower classes found in the streets. Three courtiers were put in charge of each post, with authority from Charles himself to order demolitions. This visible gesture of solidarity from the Crown was intended to cut through the citizens' misgivings about being held financially responsible for pulling down houses. James and his life guards rode up and down the streets all Monday, rescuing foreigners from the mob and attempting to keep order. \\"The Duke of York hath won the hearts of the people with his continual and indefatigable pains day and night in helping to quench the Fire,\\" wrote a witness in a letter on 8 September.On Monday evening, hopes were dashed that the massive stone walls of Baynard's Castle, Blackfriars would stay the course of the flames, the western counterpart of the Tower of London. This historic royal palace was completely consumed, burning all night.A contemporary account said that King Charles in person worked manually, that day or later, to help throw water on flames and to help demolish buildings to make a firebreak.

After a Frustrating Season, Dubinsky Is Ready for a New Chapter GREENBURGH, N.Y.— Forward Brandon Dubinsky used the word nightmare here Monday to describe his part of the regular season just past. It was part of a remarkable self-analysis that Dubinsky conducted for reporters after the Rangers’ first practice ahead of Thursday’s playoff opener against Ottawa. “You have expectations for yourself,” Dubinsky said. “When you don’t meet those expectations, it weighs and it kind of builds — it continues to build and build and build. It’s tough. But this is a great opportunity for me, and it’s a clean slate.” His feeling is understandable. Coming off a 2010-11 campaign in which he scored a team-high 24 goals and 54 points, this season he notched only 10 goals and 34 points. But worse was the sheer visibility of his struggles. After starting the season on the second line, he dropped down to the third and occasionally even the fourth line. In February his name repeatedly came up as the one player the Rangers would be willing to trade away to get Columbus’s Rick Nash. “It always seems to be me,” Dubinsky said the day before the deadline, commenting on the frequency of the rumors of his departure. After the deadline he was often called out for taking bad penalties by Coach John Tortorella, who in March said he would have scratched Dubinsky if other forwards had not been injured. “We need Duby, but I’m not going to watch the same mistakes all the time,” Tortorella said. It is true that Dubinsky’s scoring fell off in 2011-12, but he was actually quite good in other areas. His plus-16 mark was the fourth highest on the team, and he recorded it while logging a fair amount of ice time against the opponent’s top six forwards. And certainly no one questioned his willingness to be physical; he was fourth on the team in hits, and he fought six times on a team that led the league in fighting. Nevertheless, Dubinsky was disappointed with his regular-season performance and looking forward to a fresh start in the playoffs, where, he said, everyone’s stats are “all zeroes,” and “right now I’m tied for first” in scoring. “In all reality it’s been a nightmare of a year for me,” Dubinsky said. “But that being said, the guys around me have picked me up and have played well enough to put us in a great position to have home-ice advantage. That gives me a little extra motivation to come out and make an impact.” Dubinsky said he knew how he could do that. “I think for me the playoffs are kind of tailored toward the way I play,” he said. “They’re hard, they’re physical, they’re gritty. The goals aren’t pretty like they are during the regular season — they’re ugly. There’s no small plays, so you’ve got to be responsible. I feel like I’m a pretty responsible player out there. “But more important, it’s important for me to understand the opportunity that I have and understand how big this is for the team. Hopefully I can rise to the occasion.” Tortorella said he saw improvement in Dubinsky’s game over the last 10 games or so, but his analysis was not entirely kind to the fifth-year forward. “Again, his game isn’t dead-on, but he’s beginning to show signs,” Tortorella said. “But now I think a lot of people wipe it clean now, whether it be a good or a bad year, because this is a new beginning. Especially for a young guy that’s had a struggle this year. I think it’s a real good mind-set change for him. I know he’s preparing to do that. “This is an important time for him, because Dubie cares. I think he really wants to try to help the team. He’s a type of player in the playoffs that can get us to the next level.” Dubinsky described the process he is trying to use to get out of the emotional rut. “It’s frustration when you don’t play your best because you’re not prepared, or you’re not into it or whatever that is,” Dubinsky said. “But you can’t be frustrated when you do everything you can in order to be successful. I think that’s the biggest thing.” He continued to give what amounted to a pep talk to himself. “And if you do all the little things that make yourself successful – for me, it’s being physical and moving my feet and being in the right places — success kind of follows,” he said. “You don’t necessarily think of the end goal, you just think of the process to get to the end goal.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"After a frustrating regular season, New York Rangers forward Brandon Dubinsky is looking forward to a fresh start in the playoffs. Despite a drop in his scoring, Dubinsky exhibited strong performance in other areas of his game, such as maintaining a plus-16 mark and demonstrating willingness to be physical on the ice. Coach John Tortorella noted signs of improvement in Dubinsky's game in the final stretch of the regular season and emphasized the importance of the playoffs as a new beginning for the young player. Dubinsky plans to focus on doing all the little things that contribute to success as he prepares for the playoffs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Information:  - A papal bull is a particular type of public decree, letters patent, or charter issued by a pope of the Roman Catholic Church. It is named after the lead seal (\\"bulla\\") that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it.  - The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks, but its history is divided into two distinct periods. The sometimes so-called First Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted from 1099 to 1187, when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin. After the subsequent Third Crusade, the kingdom was re-established in Acre in 1192, and lasted until that city's destruction in 1291. This second kingdom is sometimes called the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem or the Kingdom of Acre, after its new capital.  - An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (/ ALA-LC: \\"al ad-Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb\\"; / ALC-LC: \\"Selahedînê Eyûbî\\"), known as Saladin (1137  4 March 1193), was the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem , Kingdom of Jerusalem , whose care became its original purpose , named after patron saint Lazarus . It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as hospitaller and military order of chivalry under the rule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255 . The titular seat was successively situated at Jerusalem , Saint - Jean - d'Acre and - after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - the Château Royal de Boigny - sur - Bionne in France . After several centuries , the order went into decline and ceased to perform its original functions after the French Revolution . In 1489 , Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the order and its land holdings with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . This was resisted by the order in most countries where it still retained its premises . In 1572 , the Order of Saint Lazarus in Italy was merged with the Order of Saint Maurice under the Royal House of Savoy to form the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus , which still exists until today . In 1609 , King Henry IV of France linked it administratively to the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to form the Royal Military and Hospitaller Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem united , which remained listed as of royal protection in the French Royal Almanac until 1830 . Its last living member admitted before the turmoil of the French Revolution died in 1856 . Notwithstanding , the revived Order of Saint Lazarus ( statuted 1910 ) claims legacy from the suppressed French branch under spiritual protection of the Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , disputed by officials of the Roman Catholic Church .  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.   - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions). Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents.  - Mamluk (Arabic: \\"mamlk\\" (singular), \\"mamlk\\" (plural), meaning \\"property\\" , also transliterated as \\"mamlouk\\", \\"mamluq\\", \\"mamluke\\", \\"mameluk\\", \\"mameluke\\", \\"mamaluke\\" or \\"marmeluke\\") is an Arabic designation for slaves. The term is most commonly used to refer to Muslim slave soldiers and Muslim rulers of slave origin.  - Abraham (Avraham), originally Abram, is the first of the three patriarchs of Judaism. His story features in the holy texts of all the Abrahamic religions and Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  - A patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person. Catholics believe that patron saints, having already transcended to the metaphysical, are able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges.

Question 2: It's like setting up the same toy cars race, but this time, you have different paths with different numbers of narrow parts, or resistances. You still add all the 'slow downs' together, but you might need to combine them in a special way. If the paths are all in a row (series), just add them up. If paths are side by side (parallel), you use a special trick: 1/total_slow_down = 1/slow_down1 + 1/slow_down2 +...

Bomb plots targeting the New York Stock Exchange and the city's subway were among more than 50 terrorist acts worldwide thwarted by top-secret surveillance programs since the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States, security officials said Tuesday. The startling details disclosed at a House intelligence committee hearing reflected a unified effort by the Obama administration and legislators to defend the telephone and e-mail surveillance made public this month by classified leaks to newspapers. Testimony by Gen. Keith Alexander, the National Security Agency director, as well as officials from the FBI, Department of Justice and the Director of National Intelligence office called the programs created under the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks a vital tool against terrorist plots. Joined by panel Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers and other legislators, they condemned the document leaks by former government contractor Edward Snowden as harmful to the United States and its allies. The leaks also led to what officials called widespread public misinformation about the surveillance programs that necessitated the relatively rare open hearing by the intelligence panel, where they detailed previously classified information in order to set the record straight. It was the most comprehensive and specific defense of the surveillance methods that have come under ferocious criticism from civil liberties groups, some members of Congress and others concerned about the reach of government into the private lives of citizens. National security and law enforcement officials repeated that the programs are tightly run with significant regulation and oversight by federal judges and Congress. Addressing the most basic questions that have emerged, Rogers asked Alexander if intelligence workers have the ability to simply \\"flip a switch\\" in order to listen to phone calls or read the emails of Americans. When Alexander replied \\"no,\\" Rogers asked again to reinforce the message for anyone listening. \\"So the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the NSA to flip a switch to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails?\\" he repeated. \\"That is correct,\\" Alexander answered. He and others also asserted that the leaks were egregious and carry huge consequences for national security. \\"I think it was irreversible and significant damage to this nation,\\" Alexander said when questioned by Rep. Michele Bachmann. \\"Has this helped America's enemies?\\" the conservative Minnesota Republican asked. \\"I believe it has and I believe it will hurt us and our allies,\\" Alexander said. President Barack Obama has defended the programs as necessary in an era of terror. In an interview with PBS' Charlie Rose broadcast on Monday night, Obama said the situation requires a national debate on the balance between security and privacy. Obama bristles at suggestion he's shifted on snooping. Alexander told a Senate committee last week that the surveillance programs helped stop dozens of terror plots, but he was unable then to provide classified details. Under pressure from Rogers and other legislators, Alexander joined law enforcement officials Tuesday in making public some declassified details of the Patriot Act provisions. In recent years, Alexander said, information \\"gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world.\\" Details of most of the thwarted terrorism acts remain secret, but national security officials said they were working on declassifying more information and could have a report to Congress as early as this week. Sean Joyce, the deputy FBI director, detailed how email surveillance of foreigners under one program helped authorities discover the two New York City plots. In the fall of 2009, Joyce said, the NSA intercepted an e-mail from a suspected terrorist in Pakistan. That person was talking with someone in the United States \\"about perfecting a recipe for explosives,\\" he said. Authorities identified Afghan-born Najibullah Zazi of Denver. The FBI followed him to New York and eventually broke up planning to attack the city's subway system. Zazi pleaded guilty and is currently in prison. Snowden claims online Obama expanded 'abusive' security. In the other New York case, the NSA was monitoring a \\"known extremist\\" in Yemen who was in contact with a person in the United States, Joyce said. The FBI detected \\"nascent plotting\\" to bomb the stock exchange, long considered a target of terrorists, and the plotters were later convicted, according to Joyce. He also said e-mail surveillance disrupted an effort to attack the office of a Danish newspaper that was threatened for publishing a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in 2006. The plot involved David Headley, a U.S citizen living in Chicago. The FBI received intelligence at the time regarding his possible involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack that killed 164 people, Joyce said. The NSA, through surveillance of an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist, found that Headley was working on a plot to bomb the newspaper. Headley later confessed to conducting surveillance and was convicted. He also pleaded guilty to conducting surveillance in the Mumbai case. In a fourth case, secret surveillance \\"tipped us off\\" to a person who had indirect contacts with a known terrorist group overseas, Joyce said. \\"We were able to reopen this investigation, identify additional individuals through the legal process and were able to disrupt this terrorist activity,\\" Joyce said. In an exchange with Joyce, Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas said the case involved someone financing a designated terrorist group in Somalia. Rogers, who scheduled the hearing in recent days after Alexander pledged to declassify information on terror plots thwarted by the secret programs, said it was necessary to clear up public confusion caused by misinformation. \\"If half the things I read in blog and other places were true, I wouldn't support it,\\" the Michigan Republican said, later adding that skeptics \\"have no understanding\\" of what is going on. In particular, he said Snowden disclosed only a sliver of information about the programs without knowing the full extent of what they did and the strict regulation and oversight of them. \\"None of the things he talked about were accurate,\\" Rogers said of Snowden. The hearing came one day after Snowden defended his actions in leaking classified documents to Britain's Guardian newpaper and the Washington Post. In a series of blog posts on the Guardian website, the 29-year-old Snowden said he disclosed the information because Obama worsened \\"abusive\\" surveillance practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a presidential candidate. The former NSA contractor insisted that U.S. authorities have access to phone calls, e-mails and other communications far beyond constitutional bounds. While he said legal restrictions can be easily skirted by analysts at the NSA, FBI and CIA, Snowden stopped short of accusing authorities of violating specific laws. Instead, he said toothless regulations and policies were to blame for what he called \\"suspicionless surveillance,\\" and he warned that policies can be changed to allow further abuses. At Tuesday's hearing, officials detailed how the programs operate and the judicial and legislative oversight involved, repeating several times how access to the content of e-mails or telephone calls -- or even the names of people involved -- required authorization. Deputy Attorney General James Cole noted that basic phone records collected under Section 215 of the Patriot Act were not protected by Fourth Amendment rights to privacy, citing a 1979 Supreme Court ruling. In the case, Smith v. Maryland, the justices ruled that information about telephone calls -- such as their time and duration -- was different from the content of the calls and therefore not protected under the Fourth Amendment. Cole also provided a detailed description of the legal framework of the programs, noting that the anti-terrorism surveillance effort is not \\"off the books\\" or \\"hidden away.\\" \\"This is part of what government puts together and discusses,\\" he said. \\"Statutes are passed. It is overseen by three branches of our government -- the Legislature, the Judiciary, and the Executive Branch.\\" He described the U.S. phone records collected under Section 215 as basic information \\"just like what you would get in your own phone bill.\\" \\"It is the number that was dialed from, the number that was dialed to, the date and the length of time. That's all we get,\\" he said. \\"We do not get the identity of any of the parties to this phone call. We don't get any cell site or location information as to where any of these phones were located. And, most importantly, and you're probably going to hear this about 100 times today, we don't get any content under this. We don't listen in on anybody's calls under this program at all.\\" Tech companies jockey to seem the most transparent. Instead, it takes permission from a special court to get access to further information, based on a verifiable link to a terrorism investigation, Cole explained. Such links have mostly come from another surveillance program that collects communications information of foreign terrorism suspects living overseas. Critics question the need to store the vast amount of U.S. phone records, saying it creates a database prone to abuses and provides little return for the risk and privacy concerns. Alexander said Tuesday the phone database played a role in stopping 10 terrorist acts since the 9/11 attacks. At the same time, he and other officials said there were no cases they knew of in which anyone willfully misused the system to access information. \\"If you're looking for the needle in a haystack,\\" Cole said, \\"you have to have the haystack.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about how secret surveillance programs helped prevent more than 50 terrorist acts around the world after the 2001 al Qaeda attacks. Some of these prevented attacks included bomb plots targeting the New York Stock Exchange and the city's subway.

However, some people are worried about the government invading people's private lives.

During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \\"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\\"In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors, respectively, of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi. In mid-1969, he produced the single \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as \\"my friend ... my master\\" and \\"a perfect example of everything he preached\\". Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly japa-yoga chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.Regarding other faiths he once remarked: \\"All religions are..., what would be the answer ?

Answer:","output":"The Admiral's Men, also known as the \\"Earl of Nottingham's Men\\" after their patron Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham, was a prominent and influential acting company during the English Renaissance period. They had a significant impact on the development and growth of English theatre, performing professional dramas for the entertainment of both public and court audiences, spanning from the late 16th century to the early 17th century. The main occupation of The Admiral's Men was that of actors, stage performers, and theatre professionals who entertained the public by presenting plays and other theatrical productions. In addition to actors, the company would also consist of playwrights, technicians, stagehands, and managers to organize and facilitate the performances. Members of the company were responsible for developing and presenting new works, as well as reviving and reinterpreting classic plays from previous generations. As one of the leading acting companies of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, The Admiral's Men contributed immensely to the artistic and cultural growth of English theatre. They performed at various playhouses around London, including The Theatre, The Rose, and the Fortune Theatre. Their work as theatre professionals included outdoor performances at amphitheatres, indoor performances at court, and private performances across the country for aristocracy and gentry. The Admiral's Men were known for their close collaboration with some of the most talented playwrights and other theatre practitioners of the era. This includes renowned dramatist and playwright Christopher Marlowe, who penned popular plays like \\"Doctor Faustus,\\" \\"Tamburlaine the Great,\\" and \\"The Jew of Malta.\\" In fact, The Admiral's Men premiered several plays penned by Marlowe, right up until his untimely demise in 1593. After Marlowe's passing, they continued to work with other notable playwrights, such as Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, and later on, Thomas Heywood. Another remarkable aspect of their occupation was the fostering of managerial and organizational developments within the theatre industry. The Admiral's Men were pioneers in establishing permanent acting companies, having their own playhouses, and developing long-term relationships with playwrights. This was an innovative departure from the previous model of temporary acting troupes who would come together to stage a few plays and then disband. Apart from presenting popular entertainments, The Admiral's Men were also involved in influencing people's perception of society and politics, as many of their plays contained social and political commentary. They functioned not just as actors but as active contributors to the intellectual and cultural landscape of Renaissance England. In conclusion, the occupation of The Admiral's Men encompassed a broad range of creative and logistical roles within the English theatre industry. They were actors, stage performers, theatre professionals, and influential visionaries who shaped the landscape of theatre during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. Their work, in conjunction with that of various playwrights and theatrical collaborators, enriched the cultural fabric of English society and left an indelible mark on the history of English drama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood.

With city populations growing rapidly, it has become imperative for the government to take proactive measures to ensure adequate space and resources are available for all citizens. The Malaysian government recognizes that urban congestion is detrimental to overall quality of life, as it affects transportation infrastructure, increases air pollution, and causes excessive strain on public facilities. Therefore, the decision to develop suburbs is well-founded and timely, aiming to create a more efficient and better-functioning metropolitan landscape. At the heart of this new initiative is the plan to provide a variety of housing options, along with necessary amenities like schools, hospitals, and community centers within the suburban areas. By providing these essential services, the Malaysian government hopes to encourage urban residents to consider relocating or settling in the suburbs. This will not only help to address the issue of urban overcrowding, but also foster the growth of these suburban areas, resulting in more balanced regional development. Furthermore, the development of suburbs will be complemented by efficient transit systems, ensuring seamless connectivity between urban and suburban communities. This will allow residents to enjoy the peaceful lifestyle associated with suburban living while still being able to commute efficiently to work and other activities in the urban areas. Additionally, improving transportation infrastructure should reduce traffic-related air pollution and cut down on commuting times, enhancing the overall quality of life for Malaysian citizens. The Malaysian government's decision to develop suburbs as a means of addressing urban congestion showcases a strong commitment to sustainable growth and the wellbeing of its citizens. By providing a higher quality of life, ample resources, and seamless transportation options, this initiative is expected to reduce the strain on urban centers and help the nation accommodate its growing population with ease. In conclusion, Malaysia's move to develop suburbs to ease urban congestion is a forward-thinking approach to manage its rapidly growing city populations. By addressing issues related to transportation, pollution, and overburdened urban centers, this initiative holds the potential to create a more sustainable and interconnected Malaysia that benefits everyone."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about santino ferrucci  can be gathered from the following bio?

Translate to German","output":"Die obere Felllage entwickelt sich eher langsam und ist bei Kätzchen kaum zu erkennen. Here is a detailed and long answer in English, as well as the German translation: The development of the upper coat, also known as the guard hairs, in kittens is a gradual process that may be difficult to observe during the early stages of their growth. This layer of fur serves as protection against environmental factors and helps regulate the body temperature of the animal. In contrast to the soft downy undercoat, the upper coat consists of thicker, longer hairs that provide a waterproof shield. Throughout the initial weeks of a kitten's life, most of their fur consists of soft, fine hairs that make up the undercoat. These hairs provide insulation, keeping the kitten warm in colder temperatures. As the kitten matures and grows, the upper coat begins to develop. However, the subtle transition from the undercoat to the emergence of the guard hairs can be challenging to notice. The color and pattern of the coat also change as the kitten ages. In some breeds, the variations in color and markings can become more distinct and vibrant, while others may experience a slight fading as their fur comes in fully. It is not until the kitten is several months old that their final coat color can be determined with certainty. In summary, the development of the upper coat in kittens is a slow and often unnoticeable process. However, as they mature and grow their unique and protective layer of fur will gradually form, adapting to their needs and environment. German translation: Die Entwicklung des oberen Fells, auch bekannt als Deckhaare, bei Kätzchen ist ein allmählicher Prozess, der in den frühen Wachstumsphasen möglicherweise schwer zu beobachten ist. Diese Felllage dient dem Schutz vor Umwelteinflüssen und hilft bei der Regulierung der Körpertemperatur des Tieres. Im Gegensatz zum weichen, flaumigen Unterfell besteht das obere Fell aus dickeren, längeren Haaren, die einen wasserdichten Schutz bieten. Während der ersten Lebenswochen eines Kätzchens besteht der Großteil ihres Fells aus weichen, feinen Haaren, die das Unterfell bilden. Diese Haare isolieren und halten das Kätzchen in kälteren Temperaturen warm. Wenn das Kätzchen heranwächst und größer wird, beginnt sich das obere Fell zu entwickeln. Der Übergang vom Unterfell zum Erscheinen der Deckhaare kann jedoch schwer zu bemerken sein. Die Farbe und das Muster des Fells ändern sich auch, wenn das Kätzchen älter wird. Bei einigen Rassen können die Variationen in Farbe und Zeichnung deutlicher und prächtiger werden, während andere eine leichte Verblassen erfahren, wenn ihr Fell vollständig nachwächst. Erst wenn das Kätzchen mehrere Monate alt ist, kann die endgültige Fellfarbe mit Sicherheit festgestellt werden. Zusammenfassend ist die Entwicklung des oberen Fells bei Kätzchen ein langsamer und oft unbemerkter Prozess. Wenn sie jedoch heranwachsen und größer werden, wird sich ihre einzigartige und schützende Felllage allmählich bilden und sich an ihre Bedürfnisse und Umgebung anpassen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Londonderry, New Hampshire (CNN) -- A new CNN/ORC poll shows a statistical dead heat between New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her GOP opponent Scott Brown, with Shaheen at 49%, Brown at 47%, and a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4%. Perhaps even more telling is another politician's approval rating, and he's not even in the Granite State. President Barack Obama has only a 39% approval rating in New Hampshire, the new poll shows. Fifty-seven percent of voters say they disapprove of the way he is handling his job. That's a far fall for a president who beat his Republican opponents here in the Granite State overwhelmingly in both 2008 and just two years ago in 2012. \\"This race is not between the President and","output":"me, it's between me and Scott Brown,\\" Shaheen said in a recent interview. \\"New Hampshire voters are independent-minded, and they will make their decision based on who they believe can best represent them in the Senate.\\" Brown, on the other hand, has been trying to capitalize on the President's lack of popularity in the state, tying Shaheen to some of Obama's more controversial policies and decisions. \\"Voters are frustrated with the direction the country is headed, and they're looking for someone who can bring real change to Washington,\\" Brown commented during a campaign stop. As Election Day draws near, both campaigns are ramping up their efforts to sway undecided voters. Shaheen's campaign has focused on her record as a bipartisan senator who has consistently worked across the aisle to get things done for New Hampshire. Meanwhile, Brown has been highlighting his past experience as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and his commitment to be a strong advocate for the people of New Hampshire. Political analysts are closely watching the race, noting that it could have broader implications for control of the Senate. The battle for Senate majority has been hotly contested this election season, with Democrats and Republicans both vying for dominance. A win for either party in New Hampshire could tip the balance of power, making this race even more crucial. In the final days leading up to the election, both Shaheen and Brown are making their final pitches to voters, hoping that their respective messages resonate with the people of New Hampshire. With the race this close, each vote will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome and possibly the future of the U.S. Senate. As New Hampshire prepares to make its choice, the nation watches with bated breath, eagerly anticipating the results of this closely fought contest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. Question: What happened before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written?

Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

Arundhati Roy was born in Shillong, Meghalaya, India, to Mary Roy, a Malayali Syrian Christian women's rights activist from Kerala and Rajib Roy, a Bengali Hindu tea plantation manager from Calcutta. When she was two, her parents divorced and she returned to Kerala with her mother and brother. For a time, the family lived with Roy's maternal grandfather in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. When she was five, the family moved back to Kerala, where her mother started a school. Roy began writing her first novel, The God of Small Things, in 1992, completing it in 1996. The book is semi-autobiographical and a major part captures her childhood experiences in Aymanam.  The publication of The God of Small Things catapulted Roy to international fame. It received the 1997 Booker Prize for Fiction and was listed as one of the New York Times Notable Books of the Year for 1997. It reached fourth position on the New York Times Bestsellers list for Independent Fiction. From the beginning, the book was also a commercial success: Roy received half a million pounds as an advance. It was published in May, and the book had been sold in eighteen countries by the end of June.  The God of Small Things received stellar reviews in major American newspapers such as The New York Times (a \\"dazzling first novel,\\" \\"extraordinary\\", \\"at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple\\") and the Los Angeles Times (\\"a novel of poignancy and considerable sweep\\"), and in Canadian publications such as the Toronto Star (\\"a lush, magical novel\\"). By the end of the year, it had become one of the five best books of 1997 by Time. Critical response in the United Kingdom was less positive, and the awarding of the Booker Prize caused controversy; Carmen Callil, a 1996 Booker Prize judge, called the novel \\"execrable\\", and The Guardian called the context \\"profoundly depressing\\". In India, the book was criticised especially for its unrestrained description of sexuality by E. K.

The stories give life and color to our imagination: as he checks the crime scene, we join him and become detectives too, looking out for hidden clues. Yet Holmes is no Superman. He cannot fly, or turn invisible  . But his powers are within all of us: reason, logical thinking and paying attention to detail. While an artist's painting is his art, Sherlock's art is his intelligence  . He is human, and this is what makes Holmes a true hero for all of us.

Question: suppose The owls hearing doesn't allow them to locate prey happens, how will it affect If more sunlight is gathered by the plant.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In order to answer the question, let's break it down step by step: Step 1: Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily. This is true, as the green pigment chlorophyll in plants helps in gathering sunlight for photosynthesis. Step 2: Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant. Yes, the leaves of the plant gather sunlight by using their chlorophyll content. Step 3: The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis. Correctly, photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Step 4: The glucose travels the plant. That is accurate, the glucose produced acts as food for the plant and travels through its entire system. Step 5: The plant uses glucose as energy to grow. Yes, plants use the glucose produced during photosynthesis as a source of energy for growth and other functions. Now, let's examine the question: Suppose the owls' hearing doesn't allow them to locate prey, how will it affect if more sunlight is gathered by the plant? How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned? The effect of owls' hearing on the gathering of sunlight by plants is not directly related. The owls' ability to locate prey is a separate ecological factor that generally would not influence the photosynthesis process in plants. Therefore, the supposed perturbation would have no effect on the second effect (more sunlight gathered by the plant), as the two processes are not directly linked.

Despite literally having Vegas all around you, from the minute you enter the hotel, you feel like you are being transported someplace else that is quiet, secluded, and exclusive.  I didn't see a single douchebag, or affliction tshirt.  In fact, my ultimate recommendation is to skip the restaurant, and go get a drink in the bar that's on the same floor, and has the same decor and same views.  Everything else - meh. The food was just OK despite an eye-opening price tag.  Most of the \\"innovative\\" combinations and preparations just didn't work together, no matter how attractive they were.  We observed lots of diners trying to let the \\"experience\\" drive their enjoyment, rather than the taste of the food.  Sort of like how your buddies who joined the fraternity where you have to carry a marshmallow in your ass to get in convinced themselves that it was TOTALLY WORTH IT, bro, cuz it was AWESOME!!  The \\"formal\\" service was merely stiff.  Tons of extra employees hanging around; one to serve you the food, another to explain what it is, etc.  At the same time, lots of unexplained gaps in communication and service.  They all just disappear at various times.  I realize this review goes against the grain of the numerous 4 and 5 star reviews - how to explain it?  It's the reasons I gave above - it was TOTALLY WORTH IT, bro, cuz it was AWESOME!!","output":"So, the person who wrote this review thinks that the hotel and restaurant look very beautiful, and they feel special when they're there because it's high up and has pretty views. But, they didn't really like the food very much, even though it was very expensive. They saw other people pretending to be happy with the food just because the place looked fancy. The person also thinks that there were too many workers who didn't do their job well. So, they suggest going to the bar on the same floor instead of the restaurant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Es ist allerdings eine Schande, dass namentlich der Europäische Rat nicht seinen Verpflichtungen nachkommt. Translate this to English?","output":"Indeed, it is a shame that, in particular, the European Council is not fulfilling its obligations. Here's a detailed and long answer explaining the possible reasons and contexts behind this statement: In the grand scheme of political and economic unions, the European Council, an essential component of the European Union, is known for playing a significant role in creating guidelines and making decisions that ultimately shape the trajectory of the union. However, the statement you provided criticizes the European Council for not living up to its duties, with a specific emphasis on its lack of commitment to obligations. Such a remark can be multifaceted, depending on the context in which it is made. Several factors could lead to such criticism: 1. Slow decision-making: This issue often arises when multiple stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process. Since the European Council is composed of leaders from its 27 member countries, reaching an agreeable consensus can be a challenging and time-consuming process, and in some situations, essential decisions may not be made promptly. 2. Ineffective policies: The institution may be criticized for not having sufficient effectiveness in addressing specific issues, which might contradict their outlined objectives and result in discontent with the European Council's performance. 3. Lack of transparency: Trust is a vital ingredient in any political or economic union, and transparency is one way of building and maintaining it. If the European Council fails to uphold transparency in its activities and decision-making processes, it may be accused of not fulfilling its obligations to EU citizens and the member countries. 4. Economic inequality: The European Council is responsible for providing guidance on critical economic policies. However, if these policies widen the gap between rich and poor countries in the EU or fail to distribute wealth and resources equitably, critics might argue that the institution is not living up to its role as a promoter of economic unity and solidarity. 5. Challenges in addressing crises: Whether it is the management of refugees, pandemics, or financial crises, the European Council is expected to take charge in coordinating unified responses among its member countries. If the institution is unable to do so effectively, it might be construed as not meeting its obligations. 6. Influence of larger member states: Sometimes, the European Council's decisions may be perceived as disproportionately influenced by the larger and more powerful member states, giving them more control over the decision-making process. Such imbalances might make it seem like the institution is not fulfilling its commitments to all members equally. Overall, the statement underlines that the European Council is not living up to its essential obligations, which might impact the European Union's effectiveness and integrity. However, to derive more specific conclusions, one must consider the context in which this statement was made."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (310 metres or 1,020 feet), Kings Avenue Bridge (270 metres or 890 feet) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony. Menzies called it \\"the finest building in the national capital\\". Answer:","output":"Kings Avenue Bridge"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Who helps Brent and Nova escape the gorillas ?s Movie title: Beneath the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future.

Write some highlights for the following article: An unemployed security guard from Ecuador is Spain's top snoozer. Pedro Soria Lopez, 62, was able to nap for 17 minutes and register a 70-decibel snore while sprawled out on a couch in the middle of a crowded shopping mall in what's been billed as the first-ever Spanish National Siesta Championship, CNN sister network CNN Plus reported. The grand siesta champ won the first cash prize of 1,000 euros (about 1,400) in credit to purchase goods at the shopping center in Madrid. The competitors started off by lying down on blue sofas, some in pajamas. Each got to eat a lunch ahead of time, then had twenty minutes to get as much z's as they could squeeze in. Hundreds of contestants took part in the siesta championship which began October 14 and ended Saturday. The intricate rules award points to contestants depending on how long they sleep during the 20-minute competition time, any unusual positions they sleep in, eye-catching pajamas they might be wearing, and yes, a lot of extra points for snoring. The sponsors say it's meant to raise eyes to the problem of a country that's become so fast-paced that many say the traditional siesta is at risk. \\"The modern life is a danger that we feel is against the siesta. When you sleep la siesta everyone has the image that your life is calm, you have a good life. And then, the modern life is a direct attack,\\" said Daniel Blanco, president of the National Association of Friends of the Siesta earlier in the competition. His group, which includes about 50 of his friends across Spain, persuaded a shopping center, Islazul, to host and pay prize money for the siesta competition. In the competition, the siesta is limited to 20 minutes, a duration which the organizers and some doctors say is optimal; a quick nap after lunch to get refreshed, without entering a deep sleep cycle. But the traditional siesta in Spain often lasts an hour or more. The bustling shopping center where the siesta championship is being held is a prime example of the changing times in Spain. The stores don't close at lunchtime -- which is what used to happen with Spanish shops -- so instead of sleeping the siesta, people are working or shopping. Siesta lovers complain that Spain's frenetic push to compete in the global economy means longer, more pressure-package workdays, even if some Spanish workers still get a two-hour lunch break. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.

One big group of foods that is commonly linked to post-meal sleepiness is refined carbohydrates. These foods should be avoided or eaten in small quantities to avoid that afternoon sleepy feeling. Can we draw the following conclusion? Carbohydrates are an excellent way to stay alert. OPTIONS: [A]. Yes. [B]. It's impossible to say. [C]. No.","output":"C. No. You cannot draw the conclusion that carbohydrates are an excellent way to stay alert from the information provided. The statement specifically refers to avoiding foods that contain refined carbohydrates as they are commonly linked to post-meal sleepiness. However, this does not imply that all carbohydrates inherently have this effect. It is important to differentiate between refined carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates. Refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks, are processed and stripped of their nutrients and fiber content. Consuming these can cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar, followed by a quick drop, which can lead to feelings of drowsiness. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates, found in whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, provide a slower and steadier release of energy. They can help maintain alertness and sustain energy levels throughout the day, as they don't cause the same rapid blood sugar spike and crash experienced with refined carbohydrates. Thus, while refined carbohydrates should be avoided or limited to prevent drowsiness, consuming complex carbohydrates can contribute to steady energy levels and alertness. So, it would be more accurate to say that complex carbohydrates can be a good source of energy for staying alert, rather than claiming that carbohydrates, in general, are an excellent way to stay alert."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Goyband Context: Fading from the spotlight of his late 90's mega-fame, boy-band icon Bobby Starr (Adam Pascal) is clinging to days gone by and begging his agent Murray to land him a decent gig. What Murray does land for Bobby is a full week headlining the grand opening of the world's first Glatt Kosher hotel-casino, Mazel Hotel. As it turns out, the real force behind Bobby Starr's curious invitation to this \\"Orthodox otherworld\\" is the hotel owner's persuasive daughter Rebekka Hershenfeld (Amy Davidson), who has harbored a huge crush on Bobby since childhood. Rebekka's world is guided by her arranged betrothal to Haim (Benjamin Bauman), the son of Grand Rabbi Sheinman (Joel Leffert), who is supposed to issue the casino's all-important \\"Kosher certificate.\\" Rebekka's only release from the pressures of preparing to be a future Rebitsin (Rabbi's wife) comes from singing along to Bobby's songs with her best friends Hani and Fani (Natasha Lyonne). They keep their practice session a secret, since their religion bars them from singing in public. From the moment Bobby arrives at the Mazel hotel, he goes through culture shock: his TV goes dark at sundown, his beloved cell phone is confiscated during the Sabbath, and his Grey Goose Vodka is replaced with Manischewitz. All of this is set against the backdrop of an alien world where \\"Kosher enforcers\\" drag gamblers from their slot machines at prayer time; late-night \\"treyf smugglers\\" sneak non-Kosher contraband like cheeseburgers and fried shrimp into the hotel; and where slot machines display Shofars, Menorahs and David Stars instead of lemons, cherries and dollar signs, and chime \\"Hava Nagila\\" for lucky winners.

What is the best way to: Home made shoe polish.","output":"The best way to make homemade shoe polish is by using natural and easily accessible ingredients. This DIY shoe polish is cost-effective, eco-friendly, and ensures that your leather shoes stay in top condition. Here's a detailed guide on how to make homemade shoe polish: Ingredients: 1. Beeswax: Beeswax provides a protective layer, seals in the natural oils, and repels water to keep your shoes in the best condition. 2. Coconut oil or olive oil: These natural oils moisturize and condition the leather to help prevent it from cracking. 3. Cocoa butter or shea butter (optional): These butters can also help condition and protect the leather while giving your polish a more spreadable consistency. 4. Essential oil (optional): A few drops of essential oil, such as lemon or lavender, can add a pleasant scent to your shoe polish. 5. A small tin or container: To store your homemade shoe polish. Instructions: 1. Measure the ingredients: To make the shoe polish, follow this ratio - two parts oil, one part beeswax, and half a part of cocoa or shea butter. The actual measurements can be adjusted according to the quantity you plan to make. For example, you can measure using tablespoons or ounces - 4 tablespoons coconut oil, 2 tablespoons beeswax, and 1 tablespoon cocoa butter. 2. Melt beeswax and butter: Use a double boiler to melt the beeswax and cocoa/shea butter together. If you don't have a double boiler, place the ingredients in a heatproof bowl on top of a pot with a small amount of water in it. Heat the water over low to medium heat, ensuring the water doesn't touch the bowl. Continuously stir the mixture until the beeswax and butter have melted and combined. 3. Add oil and essential oils: Remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool slightly. Then, add the coconut or olive oil to the mixture and stir. If you want to add a scent, incorporate a few drops of essential oil of your choice. 4. Pour into the container: Before the mixture solidifies, carefully pour it into your chosen tin or container. Allow it to cool and set completely at room temperature. 5. Store and usage: Store your homemade shoe polish in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent melting. When it's time to polish your shoes, take a small amount using a soft polishing cloth or an old brush, apply it to the shoe surface in a circular motion, covering the entire leather surface. Allow the shoe polish to sit for a few minutes, then buff it out with a clean, dry cloth or brush for a beautiful shine. By following these steps to make homemade shoe polish, you'll not only save money but also make a more sustainable and eco-friendly choice in maintaining your leather shoes. Plus, you'll have the satisfaction of creating a useful product at home!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For the third integer: -638, the nearest tens place is -640, because -638 is closer to -640 than -630.  4. For the fourth integer: 927, the nearest tens place will be 930, as 927 is closer to 930 than 920.  5. For the fifth integer: -940, the nearest tens place will be -940 itself, because it is already a multiple of 10. 6.

First, let's break down the premise: 1. People try to come in over the weekend intending to use the TexTeller machine. 2. They said \\"no\\" to these people. The fact that people are coming to use the TexTeller machine indicates that there is a demand for this device or service, which suggests that a TexTeller machine may indeed exist. It is important to understand why \\"they\\" (possibly the establishment's staff) have said \\"no.\\" There could be various reasons for this response, which might or might not support the hypothesis in question. Possible explanations for \\"no\\" response: 1. The TexTeller machine is temporarily out of order, which does not support the hypothesis that there is no TexTeller machine to speak of. 2. The facility may have limited hours of operation or specific usage policies (e.g., not available on weekends), which also does not support the hypothesis. 3. People are confusing the location or establishment and there is no TexTeller machine in the given place, but it might exist elsewhere. In this case, the hypothesis could be considered true in this particular location but not in general. 4. The TexTeller machine has been removed or is no longer available at this location. In this scenario, the hypothesis is true for this location; however, it does not confirm that the TexTeller machine does not exist at all. To conclude whether the hypothesis is true or not, we need more information and context surrounding the situation. The premise we have implies that there could be a TexTeller machine in existence since people are specifically seeking it out for usage. However, the given premise alone is insufficient to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis \\"There is no TexTeller machine to speak of.\\" A more thorough investigation, including gathering additional details and verifying facts, would be necessary to provide a clear answer to the hypothesis. This could include: a. Visiting the location and verifying the presence or absence of the TexTeller machine. b. Acquiring information from the establishment's staff or management regarding the TexTeller machine. c. Researching other locations or businesses that might have a TexTeller machine available for use. Only by analyzing this additional information can we draw a well-founded conclusion about the existence of the TexTeller machine and determine if the hypothesis is true or false."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We can use a loop to iterate through the given list of integers and check if each number is even. If a number is even, we keep it in our result list. Otherwise, we skip it. Once we have checked all the numbers in the input list, we return the result list containing only the even numbers. Here's the step-by-step process: 1.

Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss.

They allow the organisms to navigate through their environment and locate the conditions necessary for survival, reproduction, and feeding. Step 4: Combine the information and formulate the answer Considering the information about Giardia and the function of flagella in protozoa, the answer to the question can be formulated. Answer: Giardia is an example of a protozoa that uses flagella for the purpose of movement and motility."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution? Solve 0 = 131*i - 73*i - 170*i + 2352 for i.","output":"Ok, kiddo. So imagine you have a big jar with all your candy in it, alright? Each candy you put in the jar or take out is your 'i'.  So first, you have 131 pieces of candy in your jar. Then you take out 73, so fewer candies now. More so, you remember you owe your friend 170 pieces because you borrowed some last week, so those go from your jar too. Now you only have a few candies before you started, right?  But then, you realize that you have been saving money all along, and you can buy 2352 candies from the candy shop. So you run and buy them really quickly and put them all in your jar. Yummy! So now, how many candies do you end up with?  First, let's see how many you had after borrowing some to your friend: 131 candies (initial)- 73 candies (taken out) - 170 candies (borrowed for your friend) = -112 candies. Oh no! You owe 112 candies! But then you went to the candy shop and buy a lot more, remember? So: -112 candies (owed) + 2352 candies (bought) = 2240 candies.  So, if you have 2240 candies in your jar, this means that's the value of your 'i' or 'candies'. So in this case, i equals 2240. So, i = 2240. That's it! Now, wouldn't you want your candy jar (i) to always be this full, buddy?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: Young d'Artagnan leaves his parents and travels from his native Gascony to the capital of France because he wants to prove himself an excellent fencer and to become a musketeer. He is told by his father he must not avoid any duel. On his way to Paris, d'Artagnan feels that his honour is besmirched because he overhears how his horse is derided by a sinister nobleman. He can't help but demand immediate satisfaction. Unfortunately, of all men he finds he has challenged the Count de Rochefort, a shifty character to whom Cardinal Richelieu frequently entrusts covert operations. Rochefort's henchmen take care of d'Artagnan and steal from him. The enraged d'Artagnan is determined to take revenge and will eventually have the chance to do so, for the Queen has given a present to her secret admirer the Duke of Buckingham, and d'Artagnan must retrieve it from him, although he is now already back in England. If he fails her, Cardinal Richelieu is going to disclose Queen Anne's infidelity to King Louis XIII, in order to force a war against England upon him. The Cardinal and Count de Rochefort will do everything in their power if only they can put paid to d'Artagnan's mission. But with help from his three new friends d'Artagnan prevails. My question: Who else shows up at the Ruins?","output":"At the ruins, a critical turning point in the movie, various characters that hold significant importance to the story show up. These characters include: 1. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis: The titular Three Musketeers, who ultimately become d'Artagnan's closest friends and allies. Throughout the movie, they unite to help d'Artagnan in his endeavors, including his mission to retrieve the Queen's present. 2. Milady de Winter: A mysterious and cunning agent of Cardinal Richelieu, Milady de Winter becomes a pivotal antagonist in the story. She is responsible for trying to foil d'Artagnan's plans and works closely with Count de Rochefort. Her presence at the ruins adds an element of peril or intrigue to the scene. 3. Constance Bonacieux: A close confidante of Queen Anne, Constance plays a crucial role in helping d'Artagnan on his journey. She secretly supports and aids the musketeers, and her presence at the ruins could signify a crucial exchange of information or a moment of suspense in the storyline. 4. The Duke of Buckingham: Given his connection to the Queen, it's possible for the Duke to make an appearance at the ruins, perhaps as part of a covert meeting. The Duke's presence may further complicate d'Artagnan's mission or result in a tense standoff between the different factions present. 5. Cardinal Richelieu: It would not be surprising if Cardinal Richelieu himself made a surprise appearance at the ruins, working behind the scenes to orchestrate events to his advantage. His presence would heighten the stakes and tension in the scene. These characters' presence in the ruins scene can significantly impact the storyline, creating opportunities for confrontation, plot twists, and the development of alliances. Developing this scene with a mix of these characters will keep the audience on their toes and drive the plot forward."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Damien Gayle. PUBLISHED:. 14:32 EST, 11 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 14:32 EST, 11 April 2012. Crushed to death: Gary Whiting, 51, died immediately when a co-worker switched on a machine he was inside. Arms maker BAE Systems is facing a fine of at least £100,000 after admitting responsibility for the death of a worker crushed to death in a metal press. Gary Whiting, 51, died immediately from his injuries when a fellow worker switched on the press at BAE's Brough plant in East Yorkshire without realising he was still inside. Mr Whiting, who lived with wife Jacqueline in nearby east Hull, had worked at the company for 21 years. He was due to retire the following year. At Hull Crown Court yesterday, BAE Operations Limited admitted health and safety breaches led to the maintenance man's death on November 10, 2008. In court, a specialist inspector from the Health and Safety Executive condemned the firm for failing to implement measures that could have avoided the tragedy. In particular, investigators were concerned that the press could be turned on while a person was inside. At the time of the tragedy, Mr Whiting had been working as part of a four-strong maintenance team, tasked with servicing the machine. The jury at the inquest was told the recognised 'safe system' of working involved checking if anyone was in the machine, and shouting to one another, before turning it on. However, John Moutrie, a specialist HSE inspector, criticised the system that was in place for workers using the machine. He explained that a safer system of working would be using ISO Locks, where each member of the team has a padlock to place on the machine if they are going inside. This would eliminate the risk of a worker turning on a machine, not knowing a colleague is inside, he said. Richard Lissack QC, representing BAE, said: 'The company accepts it failed to take all reasonable and practical steps to care for the safety of this man who died in this awful accident.' He added that the company accepted they could have had 'physical control methods' that could have been used to avoid Mr Whiting’s death. Entrance to BAe Brough Plant: This entrance is situated on Saltgrounds Road. The QC extended BAE's condolences to the Whiting family, saying: 'Mr Whiting was a valued and popular workman and highly experienced. 'His death was truly shocking, in the truest sense of the word, to those who knew and liked him for many years.' Mr Whiting was a member of both East Hull Harriers and Athletics Club and Holderness Bowling Club and loved his job, according to his family. Speaking after the inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death, they said they did not believe Mr Whiting was at fault as he was not told the machine was about to be turned on. They also made clear they do not hold Alan Abbott, who turned the machine on, to blame. In a statement, they said: 'The family do not hold the operator of the press, nor indeed any other individual, personally responsible for Gary’s death.' Judge Michael Mettyear adjourned sentencing until a date in June. Earlier this year BAE announced it was shutting down its Brough plant, ending more than 100 years of manufacturing at the site.

The press was turned on by another worker who didn't know that Gary was still inside.

Six members of this expedition died . At the same time , another independent Japanese expedition ( called The Japanese Mount Everest Expedition 1970 ) undertook a combined ascent of ( a ) the normal route ( including Naomi Uemura who made the summit ) and ( b ) the first attempt at the South - West Face ( this is the tall black face on the movie poster with the Y - shaped snowy gully ) .

Title: Greg Dawson, Orlando Sentinel Review: \\"We don't have Kafka to do justice to HMOs, but we do have Michael Freeny, a most timely novel about the creepy world of managed care.\\" Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","output":"Positive. To determine whether the given review is positive or negative, I will analyze the content of the review. In this review, the comparison to Kafka and the use of the word \\"creepy\\" might seem negative, but the context is essential to understanding the intention of the reviewer. Step 1: Analyzing the comparison to Kafka Although Kafka's work generally has a dark and eerie tone, the mention of Kafka in this review is intended as a compliment to the author Michael Freeny. By comparing the author's work to Kafka, the reviewer is acknowledging the skill of the writer in tackling complex and dark subjects like the world of managed care. Step 2: Understanding the mention of a \\"timely novel\\" The reviewer calls the novel \\"a most timely novel,\\" which indicates that the book is relevant and important at the time it is being reviewed. This suggests that the reviewer sees value in the novel's content and theme, which is a positive remark. Step 3: Analyzing the mention of the \\"creepy world of managed care\\" While \\"creepy\\" may be seen as a negative term, it serves here as a descriptor of managed care rather than a criticism of the book itself. By characterizing managed care this way, the reviewer is essentially praising the author for their ability to portray this \\"creepy world\\" accurately and engagingly. Based on these steps and the context of the review, we can conclude that the review is positive as it commends the author's skill and the novel's relevance to the current state of managed care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Usually, many of the major mechanical systems such as the engine and transmission are sourced from donor vehicles or purchased new from other vendors. Kits vary in completeness, consisting of as little as a book of plans, or as much as a complete set with all components included.  - An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat, which then creates a force. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.  - Kingswinford is a suburban area of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the West Midlands, England.

(February 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino), a defense attorney in Baltimore, is in jail on a contempt of court charge after punching Judge Henry T. Fleming (John Forsythe) while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh (Thomas G. Waites). McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offence, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and has already spent a year and a half in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses McCullaugh's appeal due to its late submission and leaves him in prison. After being released, Arthur takes another case, that of a transgender Ralph Agee (Robert Christian), arrested for small crime and becoming a victim of the legal system. Arthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam (Lee Strasberg) in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer (Christine Lahti). Arthur has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford (Jack Warden), who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while a terrified Arthur begs him to land. Rayford, a veteran of the Korean War, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse, a 1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times, and eats his lunch on the ledge outside his office window, four stories up.

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, lobbying and education. IUCN's mission is to \\"influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\\"  - Pirkanmaa (also known as Tampere Region in government documents), is a region of Finland. It borders on the regions of Satakunta, Tavastia Proper, Päijät-Häme, Southern Ostrobothnia, Central Finland and Southwest Finland.  - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".  - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas.  - A swamp is a wetland that is forested. Many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations. Other swamps occur on the shores of large lakes. Some swamps have hammocks, or dry-land protrusions, covered by aquatic vegetation, or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation. The two main types of swamp are \\"true\\" or swamp forests and \\"transitional\\" or shrub swamps. In the boreal regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a bog or muskeg. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water or seawater. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the Amazon, the Mississippi, and the Congo.  - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.  - A park is an area of natural, semi-natural, or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - An esker, eskar, eschar, or os, sometimes called an \\"asar\\", \\"osar\\", or \\"serpent kame\\", is a long, winding ridge of stratified sand and gravel, examples of which occur in glaciated and formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America. Eskers are frequently several kilometres long and, because of their peculiar uniform shape, are somewhat like railway embankments.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - A drainage divide, water divide, divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting, or (in Canada) height of land, is the line that separates neighbouring drainage basins. In hilly country, the divide lies along topographical ridges, and may be in the form of a single range of hills or mountains, known as a \\"dividing range\\". In flat countryespecially where the ground is marshythe divide may be harder to discern.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - The Finnish forest reindeer \\"(Rangifer tarandus fennicus)\\" (Finnish:\\" metsäpeura\\", Russian: \\"  \\") is a rare and threatened subspecies of reindeer native to Finland and northwestern Russia. They are found primarily in Russian Karelia, and the provinces of North Karelia, Savonia and Kainuu in Finland, though some range into central south Finland. They are distinct from the semi-domesticated Northern reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus tarandus\\") in their larger size and preference for dense boreal forest habitat, where they are rarely seen by humans, over the open tundra. They migrate seasonally back and forth across the long Russo-Finnish border.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Seitseminen National Park ( Finnish : Seitsemisen kansallispuisto ) is located in the municipalities of Ikaalinen and Ylöjärvi in Finland . The national park was established in 1982 and later expanded in 1989 . It now covers 45.5 square kilometres ( 17.6 sq mi ) . The park is a typical mix of upland and lowland coniferous boreal forests of the Suomenselkä watershed region . Upland areas are dominated by closed productive stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine while lowland areas are covered by sphagnum swamp and bog areas that also contain stunted ( Scots pine ) and shrublike ( Norway spruce ) . These swamp and bog areas appear to be barren due to the sparse tree densities . Parts of the park contain some of the most ancient and oldest forests that are accessible to public in Finland . The Kovero Farm ( Finnish : Koveron kruununmetsätorppa ) , a tenant farm established in 1859 , is part of the cultural heritage area of the park . Seitseminen National Park received the European Diploma of Protected Areas on June 19 , 1996 . It was valid until June 2011 .  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Ikaalinen is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Pirkanmaa region. The town has a population of  () and covers an area of of which  is water. The population density is  - The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.  - The World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) is one of six commissions of the IUCN (World Conservation Union). WCPA is the world's premier network of protected area expertise. It is administered by IUCN's Global Protected Areas Programme and has over 2,400 members, spanning 140 countries.  - Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term.  - The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.  - Tampere (Swedish: \\"Tammerfors\\" ) is a city in Pirkanmaa, southern Finland. It is the most populous inland city in any of the Nordic countries.  - Suomenselkä is a drainage divide in western Finland. Roughly long and wide, it is marked by an ensemble of northeast-southwest oriented moraines parallel to the Bothnian coastline. Rivers flowing west from Suomenselkä drain to the Gulf of Bothnia and the lakes in the east drain to the Gulf of Finland. Historically, this very sparsely populated region separated Ostrobothnia from the southern and eastern lake regions of Finland. The landscape is marked by moraines, eskers, swamps and forests and is difficult to cultivate or settle in. Because it contains some of the few remaining patches of old-growth forest in southern Finland, it is one of the few remaining habitats for Finnish Forest Reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus fennica\\").  - A moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (soil and rock) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute glacial flour. Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines, till-covered areas with irregular topography, and medial moraines which are formed where two glaciers meet.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - An old-growth forest  also termed primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or (in Britain) ancient woodland  is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community. Old-growth features include diverse tree-related structures that provide diverse wildlife habitat that increases the bio-diversity of the forested ecosystem. The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps, greatly varying tree heights and diameters, and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris.  - Ylöjärvi is a town and a municipality in Western Finland, west of Tampere and north of Finlands capital city Helsinki.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Paul Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London, targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins. After meeting her at an ice hockey match, he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. However, the judge makes an example of the uncooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane, one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. Almost immediately, things begin to go wrong. Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead – accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth – they refuse to offer him any assistance, as he is now too \\"hot\\". With the manhunt rapidly closing in, he tries to escape with the help of Bridget Howard, a disillusioned ex-débutante and niece of a Chief Constable. She drives Gregory to a deserted cottage near her family's home in rural Wales. While in hiding, he witnesses the police arrive to question Bridget, assumes the worst, and flees again. Attempting to steal a farmer's bicycle, he is shot in the shoulder. He drives away in a stolen truck but crashes and passes out, where he is found by another farmer. Bridget tells the police nothing. She waits in vain for Gregory at the cottage, then walks into the distance.

He executed the sale without her knowledge or consent, secretly stashing the proceeds in a safe deposit box to collect after serving a planned short prison sentence. Unfortunately for him, the judge sentenced him to a longer term than he anticipated, setting off a series of events that resulted in his quest to retrieve the money while avoiding arrest and dealing with threats from his associates."},{"instruction":"What is the full name of the Beatles band member that had a son Zak?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\".

Plot title: Reign Over Me Movie plot: Mike Binder wrote and directed this melodrama about two men who meet after a long break in their friendship and struggle to help each other rebuild their lives. Don Cheadle is Alan Johnson, a dentist who feels smothered and unfulfilled by his comfortable life or beautiful wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), when chance brings him across his former college roommate, Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler). Fineman lost his entire family on 9/11 and in the years that have ensued, he has completely isolated himself in a child-like existence. Refusing to acknowledge his past or the tragedy that is too horrible to even think about, Charlie is constantly listening to music, playing video games, watching movies, and banging on his drums. Alan finds himself beginning to enjoy life again in Charlie's child-like presence, but as he realizes the extent of the pain that ravages Charlie he starts to attempt to help Charlie face his past and return to the real world. Also woven into the story are the sensitive psychologist Angela Oakhurst (an excellent Liv Tyler) and a beautiful but confused woman named Donna Remar (Saffron Burows), who is struggling with her divorce. Binder himself stars in an excellent performance as Bryan Sugarman, a lawyer who was Charlie's friend before 9/11, and who Charlie now refuses to acknowledge or speak with. However, he has devoted himself to protecting Charlie's finances, living situation, and general peace-of mind.After working with Dr. Oakhurst, Charlie is able to begin to acknowledge the deaths of his wife and three daughters. However, the trauma of this memory nearly drives him to suicide, and after a brief stay at a mental hospital, his parents-in-law attempt to commit him permanently. Donald Sutherland and B.J. Novak appear for a courtroom scene, after which Charlie is allowed to be free and to attempt to continue slowly building a new life, with the aid of his friends and loved ones.

Danish companies must continue adjusting production to a smaller input of resources per unit produced to be successful in the global market, where scarcity of resources must be anticipated. It is imperative for Danish companies, along with businesses worldwide, to adapt their production models to promote sustainable use of natural resources. By doing this, they will not only contribute to the preservation of Earth's resources but will also stay competitive in an increasingly volatile global market shaped by resource constraints.  To achieve sustainability in resource consumption, companies need to incorporate efficient resource management strategies in their business models. This might include embracing a circular economy, which focuses on reducing waste and using resources in a closed-loop manner. Companies can invest in research and development to create eco-friendly products and production methodologies, and also involve themselves in clean technologies, green energy, and recycling. For Danish companies to remain successful globally, they must strive to become champions of sustainability. They can do so by reevaluating their supply chains, aiming to source raw materials in a responsible and environmentally friendly manner. Collaborative efforts, such as forming partnerships with sustainable suppliers, can ensure the efficient use of resources and make it feasible for these businesses to operate in a world facing resource constraints. Additionally, ensuring environmentally-friendly production processes and minimizing waste can help reduce the input of resources per unit produced. Implementing waste recycling systems and utilizing excess production materials in other products or components can significantly contribute to this objective. Educating employees on the necessity of resource conservation and integrating sustainability values in their corporate culture can also lead to better decision-making at all levels of the organization. By setting sustainability goals and constantly monitoring their progress, companies would ensure that they are on track to reach their resource-efficiency targets. The government plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable practices as well. Policymakers can incentivize businesses to adopt resource-efficient models by providing tax benefits, subsidies, and other forms of financial support. Additionally, setting stringent environmental regulations to curb resource wastage and pollution will help in raising industry standards and fostering sustainability. In conclusion, for Danish companies to succeed in a global market characterized by the anticipation of resource scarcity, a comprehensive shift toward sustainable management of resources is necessary. By adjusting production processes, focusing on environmentally-friendly practices, and fostering collaborations with sustainable suppliers, these businesses can contribute to the preservation of natural resources while also staying competitive in a resource-conscious world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Frustrated and determined, Julia decided to remove the obstruction that prevented her from placing her new bookshelf in its rightful place inside her living room. She headed to the garage to gather supplies, searching for the tools she would need for the project. As she rummaged through dusty bins and cluttered shelves, she found a handsaw, a hammer, a chisel, and some protective gloves and goggles. With confidence in her eyes and a ready stance, she strode back to the doorframe, ready to tackle the task at hand. First, she donned the goggles and gloves for safety, ensuring that her hands and eyes were protected from any splinters or debris that might fly off during the removal process. Then, carefully examining the wooden frame, she chose the right spot to make her initial cut. Julia wielded the handsaw, positioning it at a slight angle against the grain of the wood. With determination, she began to saw slowly through the frame, being cautious of the surrounding walls and paying close attention to the piece of wood she was attempting to remove. Sawdust and wood shavings settled to the ground as the blade bit into the material. Once she had made a clean incision, Julia then took up the chisel and hammer. She gently wedged the chisel into the cut that she had made with the saw. Grasping the hammer with confidence, she gave the chisel a firm tap, driving it further into the opening. With each strike, the wooden piece became gradually dislodged, as splinters and chips cascaded to the floor. Julia continued this process until she could finally see the wooden segment loosening enough to be removed by hand. With a proud grin, she grabbed hold of the frame and gave it a good yank. As the wood came free from the doorway with a gratifying snap, she couldn't help but feel a rush of triumph. Julia took a moment to brush the debris away from the area, ensuring that no hazards remained. She closely examined her work, making sure that the doorway's structural integrity remained intact and strong. Satisfied with her handiwork, she finally returned the tools to their places in the garage and began preparations to move her bookshelf into her living room. With the doorway now widened and rid of the troublesome wooden frame, Julia was able to position her bookshelf exactly where she envisioned it. As she placed her beloved books onto the new shelves, she took pride in her handiwork and the perseverance it took her to overcome this unexpected obstacle. Julia knew that she had not only managed to alter her doorway to fit her new furniture but had also grown as an individual. Through determination and resourcefulness, she had faced her problem head-on and welcomed the challenge presented before her. And in the process, she had discovered that she was capable of more than she initially thought. In removing the wood from the doorway, Julia had carved out a new and exciting chapter in her life, opening her heart and mind to the endless possibilities that she could conquer, one task at a time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Kara (Hangul: kara, Japanese: kara, often stylized as KARA) was a South Korean pop girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007. The group's final lineup was composed of Park Gyuri, Han Seungyeon, Goo Hara and Heo Youngji. Members Nicole Jung and Kang Ji-young officially departed from the group in 2014, while Kim Sung-hee left in 2008. The group's name comes from the Greek word \\"chara\\" (khara, lit. \\"joy\\"), which they interpreted to mean \\"sweet melody\\". The group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second album, however, member Kim Sung-hee suddenly announced that she would be leaving the group due to parental pressure because her participation in the group was contingent on the maintenance of her grades. In response, DSP stated that the second album that was recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members would join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung. The group made their return in the music industry as a quintet on July 24, 2008 with \\"Rock U\\" on M! Countdown. They made their comeback with the \\"cute\\" and \\"playful\\" image which was the complete opposite of the group's original image from their debut. In the same month, their first mini-album titled Rock U was also released. The second season of Kara Self Camera was premiered on August 18, 2008, which chronicled how the group was adapting to their two new members.  On November 29, 2008, DSP released a teaser video for their upcoming single, \\"Pretty Girl\\", which received over 40,000 hits within 12 hours. The full video was released on December 2, 2008 online and was positively received by the public. The EP, Pretty Girl, was released on December 4, embodying a \\"fun-party\\" concept. The group began its comeback on all major music shows on December 4, 2008, starting with M! Countdown. During their first national performance on KBS's Music Bank, member Goo Hara accidentally gasped \\"ah!\\" live on air due to slipping on falling confetti, and reportedly cried profusely afterwards. The incident became a hot issue to many viewers, but Goo Hara received comfort instead of criticism from the general public.  Park Gyuri attributed their popularity increase to their \\"pretty but natural\\" appeal, while media reports gave credit to the band for finally finding its own identity in the music industry since the group's debut and to older male fans, most notably singer Shin Hae Chul. Due to their increasingly hectic schedule as their popularity rose, a few of the group's members were taken to the hospital on December 19 after a Music Bank rehearsal for cold symptoms and exhaustion.

Write a text based on \\"chinese vice premier huang ju ally of ex-president dies after long illness\\" Text:","output":"Title: Remembering Huang Ju: A Loyal Ally of China's Ex-President Passes Away after Prolonged Illness In the ever-evolving political landscape of China, the news of the passing away of Huang Ju, former Chinese Vice Premier and a close ally of Ex-President Jiang Zemin, is a moment to reflect on the contributions and impact of this influential political figure. After a long battle with illness, Huang Ju's death signifies the end of a significant era in Chinese politics. A deeply committed administrator, a respected loyalist, and an astute strategist, Huang Ju's legacy in Chinese political realms will live on. Born on September 16, 1938, in Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, Huang Ju's upbringing and education laid the foundation for his future ascent to the upper echelons of Chinese politics. He studied electrical engineering at Tsinghua University and later earned a degree in economics from the Central Party School. His life as a Communist Party member began in 1966, after which he quickly climbed the ranks to hold several key provincial and city-level positions. Huang Ju's tenure in the Chinese government saw the country go through some major political and economic transformations, as China sought to find its place on the global stage. As a close ally of Ex-President Jiang Zemin, Huang Ju was instrumental in steering important reforms and decision-making processes that helped shape the China we know today. His leadership in Shanghai, the country's economic hub, amidst the city's rapid economic development in the 1990s, is often regarded as a prime example of his astute abilities to foresee strategic goals, formulate policies, and ensure efficient implementation. During his time with the government, Huang Ju also held key positions such as the Mayor of Shanghai (1991-1994), the Party Secretary of Shanghai (1994-2002), and the Executive Vice Premier of the State Council (2003-2006). His tenure as the Executive Vice Premier saw him in charge of various policy areas, including finance, state planning, and economic affairs. He was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in the Communist Party of China, cementing his position as an influential political figure with a crucial role in the country's trajectory. Furthermore, his close association with Jiang Zemin placed him in the center of the \\"Shanghai Clique,\\" an informal network of politicians that rose to prominence during the 1990s and early 2000s, reflecting the close-knit ties between governmental leaders. This deepened the influence and decision-making power of Huang Ju and the Jiang faction in the Chinese political landscape. While Huang Ju's contributions to Chinese politics and his role as a key administrator are indisputable, his tenure was not without controversies. His association with the Shanghai Pension Fund scandal in 2006 raised questions about his integrity and led to speculations that he may be implicated. However, he maintained a low profile and his illness deterred any significant investigation into the matter. Despite a life marred by illness in his later years, Huang Ju's role in shaping China's political landscape and his steadfast loyalty to his close ally, Ex-President Jiang Zemin, speak volumes about his unwavering commitment to the nation and its people. As we bid farewell to this important figure in Chinese history, we acknowledge the many ways he intricately influenced the country's journey in both domestic and international affairs. It is now upon the shoulders of the present and future leaders of China to ensure this legacy continues to propel the nation forward in an increasingly interconnected and complex world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Geronimo (Mescalero-Chiricahua: Goyaale [koja:le] \\"the one who yawns\\"; June 16, 1829 - February 17, 1909) was a prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe. Geronimo was raised with the traditional religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, he wrote in his 1905 autobiography,  As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death ... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.  In his later years Geronimo embraced Christianity, and stated  Since my life as a prisoner has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers ... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to live right.  He joined the Dutch Reformed Church in 1903, but four years later was expelled for gambling. To the end of his life, he seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings, telling the Christian missionaries at a summer camp meeting in 1908 that he wanted to start over, while at the same time telling his tribesmen that he held to the old Apache religion. What religion was Geronimo?","output":"Geronimo, a prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe, was initially raised with the traditional religious views of his tribe. The Apache religion centered around nature and its spiritual powers, with a belief in life after death. However, the Apache people did not have specific ideas about their relations and surroundings in the afterlife. In his later years, Geronimo embraced Christianity. He believed the teachings of the white man's religion to be better than the traditional Apache belief system in many respects. In 1903, Geronimo joined the Dutch Reformed Church, adopting the Christian faith and advising his people to study it as well. He considered this religion to be helpful in enabling one to live right. However, in 1907, Geronimo was expelled from the church due to gambling. Throughout his life, Geronimo seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings. While he became a Christian and expressed a desire to improve his life through Christianity, he also maintained connections to the traditional Apache religion, discussing it with his tribesmen.

Her brother, Ralph, goes to Paris to pursue his dream of being a painter, thus disappointing his father who expected him to remain in the family wallpaper business. Mrs. Thomas repeatedly tries to invoke guilt in both children for not being with her, especially after Mr. Thomas dies of a stroke. Eventually, Phyl marries her paramour and Ralph returns to New York, having failed as an artist. Mrs. Thomas dies shortly after Ralph's return. At the end of the film, Phyl, her twin infants, her husband Duff, and her brother Ralph are all living in the family home, with a newfound appreciation for the benefits of family life. In the film's last scene, Ralph and Duff are laughing together about how Phyl has evolved into a protective maternal figure, much like her own mother.

Plot title: The Italian Job Movie plot: John Bridger, a professional safecracker, has assembled a team to steal 35 million dollars worth of gold bullion from a safe held by Italian gangsters in Venice that had stolen it weeks earlier. The team includes Charlie Croker, a professional thief; Lyle, or Napster, a computer expert; Handsome Rob, their wheelman; Steve, their inside man; and Left Ear, their explosives expert. They successfully complete the theft by stealing the actual safe and stealing the gold from it after the safe lands underwater while the gangsters are occupied with a decoy led by Rob and Napster. After leaving the city, the team agrees to split up the gold and part ways once they return to the United States. However, Steve turns on them: in the Alps near Austrian border, he and his own men intercept their van on a bridge and take the gold. When John confronts him, Steve kills him. Rob drives the van into the lake off a bridge, where they keep themselves alive using oxygen tanks from the heist. Steve assumes they are dead and leaves with the gold. A year later, Charlie and the others have returned to the States and have located Steve under his new false identity, changing his last name to Frizelli, moving to Los Angeles and laundering the gold for money. Charlie goes to Philadelphia and meets with Stella Bridger, John's estranged daughter and also a skilled private safecracker working for the police, who is furious with him, believing that Charlie was responsible for the death of her father, but Charlie instead convinces her to help get revenge on Steve by helping with the heist to steal back the gold. The group monitor Steve's expensive mansion in Los Angeles, identifying the various security details. Charlie gets in contact with an associate, Skinny Pete, to obtain explosives for Left Ear, to blow the mansion gates, and Rob obtains three heavily modified Mini Coopers and calls in his friend Wrench, a car mechanic, to modify them so that they will be able to drive through the mansion and carry the gold out. Charlie guides Stella,... My question: who attempts to reach the gold?
