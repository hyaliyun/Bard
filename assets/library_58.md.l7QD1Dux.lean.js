The Marine battleship Abraxis is sent next. Despite the carnage of Dead Space, four survivors are found: Nicholas Kuttner, a security officer; Alejandro Borgas, an engineer; Nolan Stross, chief science officer; and Isabella Cho, chief medical officer. The survivors are imprisoned in a holding cell while the ship is en route to the Sprawl, a station built on a shard of Titan. The head interrogator is told by the Overseer he has seven hours to get information from the survivors. Kuttner is interrogated first and gives his account of the events: he, Cho, Borgas, and Stross are assigned by the O'Bannon's commanding officer to stabilize the gravity on Aegis VII. Assisting are soldiers Rin and Sergenko, along with two additional engineers, Borgas' cousins Noah and Omar, a Unitologist. Campbell secretly tasks Kuttner's crew to bring back pieces of the Marker, which are worth millions of credits per kilo. The group land on Aegis VII, which is now unstable. While the engineers work the gravity stabilizer, Kuttner's crew separate. Kuttner finds a Marker shard, which causes a horrifying hallucination, making him murderously unstable.

Based on the premise \\"The nucleus of classical Rome is around the Colosseum, with the Forum to the northwest and the Baths of Caracalla to the south.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"The nucleus of classical Rome is around the Colosseum, with the Forum to the northwest and the Baths of Caracalla to the south.\\", we can analyze the given information to determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" Firstly, let's examine the information at hand about Classical Rome: 1. The nucleus of classical Rome is around the Colosseum. 2. The Forum is situated to the northwest of this nucleus. 3. The Baths of Caracalla are located to the south of this nucleus. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" If the Forum is to the northwest of the nucleus of classical Rome (which is around the Colosseum), it indicates that the Colosseum is located to the southeast of the Forum. This assumption can be further analyzed with the available information: - Since the nucleus (Colosseum) is to the southeast of the Forum, it means that there's a diagonal relationship between the Colosseum and the Forum, with the Colosseum being located down and to the right from the Forum (when facing north).    - Additionally, the Baths of Caracalla are stated to be to the south of the nucleus, which forms a triangular relationship between the three points of interest: The Forum, the Colosseum, and the Baths of Caracalla. Furthermore, to confirm the given hypothesis we can refer to the actual layout of the historic sites in Rome. Historical maps and current geographical data both support the premise and the hypothesis. The Colosseum (also known as the Flavian Amphitheater) is in fact situated to the southeast of the Roman Forum, which was the center of political, economic, and religious activities in ancient Rome. Moreover, the Baths of Caracalla, a large public bathing complex, can be found further south to the Colosseum, aligning with the given information. In conclusion, based on the premise and by analyzing the relative positions of the Colosseum, the Forum, and the Baths of Caracalla, we can assert that the hypothesis \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" is indeed true. This claim is further supported by historical and geographical data of the actual locations of these landmarks in Rome."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jackson is taken to a U.S. Air Force installation, and told the project is classified information by its commander Special Operations Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a \\"stargate\\" which uses constellations as spatial coordinates. On this revelation, Jackson is shown that the base has this Stargate, also discovered by Langford's father. They use Jackson's coordinates to align the Stargate's metal ring with markings along its outside, and once all seven are locked in, a wormhole opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins O'Neil and other soldiers as they pass through the wormhole, though expresses concern at a nuclear bomb they brought as a last resort. On the arid desert planet, they find themselves in a pyramid-like structure. Jackson locates the Stargate and its controls, but lacks the coordinates to return home. O'Neil orders some men to stay behind to guard the Stargate. Nearby, they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral from the planet. Jackson is able to communicate with them as they speak a variation of Ancient Egyptian, and finds the tribe sees them as emissaries of their god Ra (Jaye Davidson).

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"The two questions you asked: \\"Does Kuwait support ISIS?\\" and \\"Does Iran support ISIS?\\" are not asking the same thing, though they touch on a similar theme. They are seeking information about whether two distinct countries, Kuwait and Iran, support the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a violent extremist organization. Given that these are different nations with their own distinct political structures, histories, and geopolitical contexts, the implications and answers will not be the same.  Now let's answer the questions: To clarify, the terrorist organization known as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), also known as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and Levant) or Daesh, has been categorically denounced by most nations worldwide, including Middle Eastern countries like Kuwait and Iran. First question: \\"Does Kuwait support ISIS?\\" Kuwait, a small monarchy on the Persian Gulf, does not officially support ISIS. The Kuwaiti government and the vast majority of its citizens strongly condemn all forms of terrorism. In fact, Kuwait has suffered from terrorist attacks by extremists, including those linked to ISIS, such as a suicide bombing in 2015 at a mosque which killed 27 people. The government of Kuwait, in cooperation with international anti-terrorism efforts, has also initiated programs to counter extremist teaching and promote a moderate and inclusive version of Islam. However, it is worth noting that in the early years of the Syrian civil war, some private citizens and organizations in Kuwait were accused of financially supporting various Syrian rebel groups, which may have included extremist elements. This does not reflect official government policy and has largely stopped after the government tightened controls on money transfers. Second question: \\"Does Iran support ISIS?\\" Iran has been one of the most active countries in fighting against ISIS, given both its regional interests and its non-Sunni (Shia) majority, which ISIS considers heretical. It has provided significant support to various anti-ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. This includes backing Shia militias in Iraq, and the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which has been fighting ISIS as part of the broader Syrian civil war. Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has directly fought ISIS in both countries. So, while these two questions are asking about the relationship two different countries have with the same entity, ISIS, the answers and implications are unique to each country."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Seven U.S. sailors died in the collision between the Fitzgerald and a Philippine-flagged cargo ship 64 miles south of Yokosuka Naval Base.      Cmdr. Bryce Benson, captain of the Navy ship, was injured in the collision when his cabin was crushed by the cargo ship's impact. He was rescued while hanging from the side of his ship, and was temporarily relieved of command Tuesday until he recovers from his unidentified injuries.      The Fitzgerald arrived at the Yokosuka naval base within hours after the collision, with a 12-by-17-foot hole ripped in its starboard side below the waterline. The impact crushed the ship's superstructure, twisted its hull and ruined tens of millions of dollars of electrical equipment aboard, the U.S. Naval Institute reported Wednesday.      Dry dock status, in which the ship is pulled completely from the water, will allow more complete evaluation of the extent of damage. The Navy will then determine if the ship should be repaired in Japan or in the United States. ||||| Story highlights The 10,000-ton USS Fitzgerald and the ACX Crystal collided last month      The Navy is carrying out an investigation into what happened      Washington (CNN) The US Navy released new photos showing the damage caused to the USS Fitzgerald after it collided with a cargo ship on June 17, causing the death of seven US sailors.

Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds. While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff.

That was the chief reaction to the double win Sunday night for the new Fox comedy “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” a lightly watched show that managed to knock off two network titans, “The Big Bang Theory” and “Modern Family,” and much buzzed-about cable entries like HBO’s “Girls.” Kevin Reilly, the chairman of entertainment for Fox, admitted being surprised at the “Nine-Nine” wins for best comedy and best leading comedy actor (Andy Samberg.) “I’m harkening back to the year ‘The Shield’ won as best drama, which was the first time for a basic cable show,” Mr. Reilly said in an interview here on Monday. (That was 2002.) “Now it’s becoming almost expected,” he said, that cable shows always win the big awards. With “Nine-Nine’s” win, it’s “Like, ‘oh it’s a major upsetting win’ for a broadcast network,” he added. One explanation for the surprise win of “Nine-Nine,” some said on Monday, is that Globes voters often like to get out ahead of what they perceive might be the next hot show. “It feels like ‘The Office’ to me,” said Mr. Reilly, who was an ardent advocate of that comedy when he was at NBC and helped keep it alive until it emerged as a hit. “It has the same vibe.” (One of the “Nine-Nine” creators, Michael Schur, wrote and produced for “The Office” and had a guest role as Dwight’s Amish cousin, Mose.) The show’s other creator is Dan Goor, who spent about a decade as a late-night comedy writer, for Jon Stewart and Conan O’Brien. Mr. Schur and Mr. Goor were looking to build a workplace comedy with the kind of offbeat and diverse cast of characters that populate Mr. Schur’s other NBC comedy, “Parks and Recreation.” They chose to set it in a police station in Brooklyn. For “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” winning at the Globes comes just before the show will be given the klieg-light treatment as one of two Fox comedies to play after the Super Bowl on Feb. 2. (The other is “New Girl.”) “It is the perfect timing,” said Mr. Reilly, who acknowledged the timing might also be right to announce a second season of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” “But I was tempted to do it before the Globes,” he said. The only impediment, he noted, was business on other shows he needed to conclude first. “I don’t think that’s going to be a big announcement,” Mr. Reilly said. “I would anticipate the show will be back.” “Nine-Nine” is likely to draw new viewers, thanks to the wealth of attention from the Globes, which was watched by more than five times as many people as typically tune in to that sitcom. Thanks to some strong movies and the pairing again of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as hosts, the broadcast of the Globes reached a 10-year high in audience figures, attracting just under 21 million viewers. It also scored well among those 18 to 49, the most important to advertisers. In that category, the show averaged a 6.5 rating, up 6 percent from last year.

Given those answer options, answer the question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. Air Force posted its own Afghanistan-related tweet that raised eyebrows — this one referencing a viral audio clip that has sparked a lighthearted online debate among those who hear the word \\"Laurel\\" and others who hear \\"Yanny.\\" \\"The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,\\" read the Air Force tweet. The Air Force has since apologized and deleted the tweet, saying it was sent in \\"poor taste.\\" The USFOR-A tweet remains. In a statement to VOA, a Pentagon spokesperson said the tweets do not represent a new social media strategy. \\"As with any other organization, the post was an attempt to bring awareness to a major/ongoing organizational activity by tying it to references or conversations already trending with their established audiences,\\" said Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner.

During the 1950s, Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen, nearly always against civilians, mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, leading to several Israeli counter-raids. In 1956, Great Britain and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal, which the Egyptians had nationalized (see the Suez Crisis). The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, together with the growing amount of Fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population, and recent Arab grave and threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt. Israel joined a secret alliance with Great Britain and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the United Nations in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights in the Red Sea via the Straits of Tiran and the Canal[citation needed].

Answer:","output":"Before selling land to settlers, the New Zealand Company, a private land investment company founded by Edward Gibbon Wakefield in the early 19th century, primarily purchased land from the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand. The New Zealand Company aimed to facilitate the systematic colonization of New Zealand by European settlers, by establishing settlements, organizing transportation, and promoting overseas immigration. Central to its plans was the acquisition of large tracts of land that would then be subdivided and sold to settlers at a profit, with the proceeds used to fund further settlement work. Initially, the Company attempted to negotiate land purchases directly with local Māori chiefs, employing agents to enter into agreements with local tribes. The Company believed that they could secure vast lands from the Māori people for relatively low prices, but relied heavily on the negotiation skills of their agents and the assumption that the Māori chiefs had a full understanding of the transactions. One of the most significant land purchases took place in 1839 when the Company agent, William Wakefield (the brother of the Company's founder), arrived in New Zealand and negotiated the purchase of approximately 20 million acres (around 8.1 million hectares) of land from the local Māori tribes. This acquisition became known as the \\"first and principal purchase\\" and encompassed large portions of present-day Wellington, Wanganui, and Taranaki. However, many of these land purchases were fraught with controversy and misunderstandings. The Māori people often had differing concepts of land ownership from the European settlers, and some believed they were only granting temporary rights to use the land, rather than transferring permanent ownership. These discrepancies led to numerous disputes and conflicts between Māori tribes and the New Zealand Company over the legitimacy of land purchases. Furthermore, the New Zealand government later disputed some of these agreements, as they contravened the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between representatives of the British Crown and over 500 Māori chiefs, which required that all land sales needed to go through the Crown. In response to these issues, the New Zealand government stepped in to establish a process for investigating and verifying land purchases, known as the Land Claims Commission, which was set up in 1840. The Commission scrutinized the land purchase agreements between the New Zealand Company and the Māori tribes and found that many of them were not valid. Despite these controversies, the New Zealand Company continued to play a vital role in the colonization of New Zealand, establishing several settlements and attracting thousands of settlers to the country. However, it faced numerous difficulties, including land disputes and financial troubles, which ultimately led to its dissolution in 1850. From that point on, the British Crown assumed direct responsibility for managing land purchases and the colonization process in New Zealand. In summary, the New Zealand Company mainly bought land from the indigenous Māori people before selling it to settlers, albeit through a process marred by misunderstandings and legal disputes. The role of the New Zealand Company, and its legacy, continues to be an important aspect of New Zealand's history, particularly in relation to Māori-European interactions and the development of modern landownership systems in the country."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state.

Legends arose of spirits and devils, now thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds (most likely the Bermuda petrel, or Cahow) and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs.

In retrospect, it's easy to think of Atkins picking jazz, but at the time it was still unusual for country artists to cross over. Those who know Homer & Jethro from their comedy records may be surprised by their top-notch guitar and mandolin playing. The material is a mix of pop and jazz, and the group (which included a changing line-up of session bassists, drummers and pianists, as well as fiddle player Dale Potter) gives most of these tunes a hillbilly twist. Haynes, Burns and Byrd each sing a few, but the real charm of these sessions is the high-spirited instrumental interplay.

These very small loans  , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15...

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he. What has been bothering the author?  A. Her marriage had to much fun  B. not enough information  C. Her marriage was very normal  D.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.  Now, I have a new situation: In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone.  Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Answer this question please: Was the water table in increased or decreased level in northeast Michigan during sixteenth century? A:","output":"In the sixteenth century, the state of Michigan was densely forested with an abundance of elm and oak trees. However, during the twentieth century, vegetation clearance and replacement of the wooded areas with farmlands significantly changed the landscape and ecosystem in northeast Michigan. Heavy irrigation became a common practice in these farmlands. The water table is influenced by various factors, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and human activities like irrigation and vegetation clearance. In the sixteenth century, northeast Michigan's landscape was dominated by forests, which play a crucial role in maintaining and regulating the water table. Forests, especially deep-rooted trees like elms and oaks, facilitate the process of evapotranspiration. This process, along with influxes of precipitation, helps to maintain a stable, deep water table, thus preventing the occurrence of shallow groundwater and salinization. However, the twentieth-century transformation of northeast Michigan witnessed an increase in human-induced changes to the landscape. Vegetation clearance for farmlands and heavy irrigation might have significantly altered the water table in the region. The removal of forests could have decreased the rate at which water is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. Coupled with this change, heavy irrigation in farmlands likely resulted in an increase in the local water table. Increased water table levels can lead to the mobilization of salts, which can have detrimental effects on the ecosystem, as mentioned in the background information. This process can result in increased soil salinization which reduces water uptake in plants and ultimately contributes to the decline of elm and oak populations in northeast Michigan. Therefore, while the actual data for water table levels from the sixteenth century in northeast Michigan might be unavailable, based on the potential change in the factors affecting the water table after the twentieth-century landscape changes, it is likely that the water table was at a more stable and deeper level in the sixteenth century than it was in the twentieth century following human-induced alterations like vegetation clearance and heavy irrigation practices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Another source of loanwords was Old Norse, which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the Danelaw from the late 9th century, and during the rule of Cnut and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many place-names in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the West Saxon dialect, away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in Middle English texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence. What language was a source for English loanwords that are still used today?","output":"A source for English loanwords that are still used today is Old Norse, a language from Scandinavian people like the Vikings who lived a long time ago.

General James H. \\"Jimmy\\" Doolittle was a prominent figure in U.S. military aviation history. He played a crucial role in organizing and leading the Doolittle Raid, which was America's first offensive air operation against the Japanese mainland. The Doolittle Raid took place on April 18, 1942, and it was in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The operation, also known as the Tokyo Raid, involved 16 U.S. Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers launched from the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Hornet. The bombers took off from the carrier about 650 miles away from Japan and targeted Tokyo and several other cities. Although the raid did not cause extensive damage to the Japanese cities, it served as an important morale booster for the United States and a shock to the Japanese, who believed their homeland was beyond the reach of American military forces. The attack had several significant strategic effects. It convinced the Japanese to divert resources to homeland defense, contributing to their eventual defeat in the Pacific War. Furthermore, it demonstrated the potential of long-range bomber attacks, which was a key component of American air power strategy throughout the 20th century. After the Doolittle Raid, General Jimmy Doolittle continued to serve in the U.S. military, rising to the rank of Lieutenant General.

The primary goal of these plans was to create Lebensraum, or living space, for German settlers in the occupied Eastern Europe, which included large parts of the Soviet Union.  Generalplan Ost aimed to eliminate, deport, or enslave the local Slavic and Jewish population to make room for German settlers. According to the plan, large numbers of people would be removed from their lands and homes, and their resources would be confiscated to support the German expansion.  The Nazi Hunger Plan was a part of this broader strategy, designed specifically to divert the conquered regions' food and agricultural resources to feed the German army and settlers. The plan called for the deliberate starvation of the civilian population in the occupied territories, particularly in urban areas and the Soviet Union's food-producing regions. This would be achieved by prioritizing food and resource allocation to Germans and ruthlessly exploiting the local agricultural production. The food supply would be systematically cut off from the occupied populations, causing widespread famine and resulting in the planned death of millions of people. Though never fully realized, as the war progressed, elements of the Generalplan Ost and Hunger Plan were implemented, leading to the deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war in the occupied territories, including the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"This product review conveys a mixed sentiment, leaning more towards positive with some minor reservations.  The review highlights several positive aspects of the hat that the customer's husband appreciates, such as: 1. The customer's husband loves this kind of hat, which implies that it suits his taste and preferences. 2. The hat is well-constructed and sturdy, indicating that it is of good quality and can potentially last a long time. 3. The colors of the hat are true to what they saw on their computer screen, demonstrating that the product's online representation was accurate, and the customer received what they expected in terms of appearance. However, there is a notable reservation that prevents the review from being entirely positive: 1. The hat runs big in size, meaning that it does not fit as well as the customer had hoped. This issue diminishes the likelihood of the hat being worn frequently at home and is something potential buyers should consider when purchasing the product. In conclusion, while the overall sentiment of the review is more positive as it praises the hat's quality and appearance, the sizing issue does introduce some negative sentiment. The reviewer shares this information as a warning for potential buyers to be mindful of the size when ordering, but it does not entirely overshadow the positive qualities of the hat. Therefore, the sentiment of the product review can be described as mixed, leaning more towards positive with some minor reservations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Demetrious is conducting chemical reactions for his community college chemistry laboratory course. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide.  and a hint : A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  Please answer this question : Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate? A:","output":"Reaction A, where sodium oxide is present in the form of small particles, will occur at a faster rate compared to reaction B, which uses sodium oxide in the form of large chunks. The reason for this difference in reaction rates lies in the surface area of the reactants. As the hint suggests, increasing the surface area of a reactant can increase the rate of a reaction. This is because a reactant with a larger surface area has more points of contact for other reactants, which allows for more frequent collisions between particles. More frequent collisions can lead to a higher probability of successful reactions. In reaction A, the small particles of sodium oxide provide a larger overall surface area than the large chunks used in reaction B. This means that there will be more opportunities for the sodium oxide particles to interact and react with other substances in the reaction mixture. Consequently, the increased surface area of the small particles allows reaction A to proceed more rapidly than reaction B. To further illustrate this concept, consider the example of burning wood. When you have a large log in a fire, it burns relatively slowly because the available surface area for combustion is limited. However, when you burn the same mass of wood in the form of small twigs, the combustion process is much faster because there is a greater surface area for the wood to interact with oxygen in the air. In conclusion, reaction A, which uses sodium oxide as small particles, will have a higher reaction rate due to the increased surface area, leading to more frequent and effective collisions between the reactant particles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Question: I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would  be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B.  Answer this question please: In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","output":"The particles would collide with greater force in reactant A.  Here's the reasoning step-by-step: 1. As described in the background information, at higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy. This energy tends to make them move faster.  2. This increased movement means they're more likely to bump into each other.  3. Moreover, when they do bump into each other, they're likely to do so with greater force because of their higher energy levels. 4. We know that Rob used warmer reactants for reactant A. Therefore, these reactants would be at a higher temperature compared to reactant B. 5. Given that temperature impacts the energy levels of the reactants and their resulting collisions, it follows that reactant A, being warmer, would result in particles colliding with greater force compared to reactant B. Thus, reasoning from the given background information and applying that to the specific scenario of Rob's tests, we conclude that the particles in reactant A would collide with greater force."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: To cut the brownies to resemble legos Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of cutting brownies to resemble legos, it would be best to follow these detailed steps: 1. Bake the Brownies: First, prepare the brownie batter following your favorite recipe or use a store-bought mix. Make sure the batter is poured into a rectangular baking pan, which will provide enough space to create the desired lego shapes.  2. Choose the Lego Block Dimensions: In order to create lego-like brownies, you'll need to decide on the size of the blocks. A standard size for lego blocks could be approximately 2 x 2 or 2 x 4, depending on the size of brownie pieces you prefer. 3. Cool the Brownies: After baking, allow the brownies to cool completely since warm brownies will crumble and make it harder to achieve precise cuts. It may be beneficial to refrigerate the brownies for an hour to ensure they are firm enough for cutting. 4. Remove the Brownies from the Pan: Carefully remove the brownies from the pan using a spatula. Place them on a cutting board with the bottom side up for easier cutting and to retain the original texture on top. 5. Measure and Mark: Using a ruler and a knife, measure and score the brownies according to the pre-selected lego block dimensions. Ensure that the lines are straight and the measurements are consistent to create uniform lego shapes. 6. Cut the Brownies: Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the brownies along the scored lines. To prevent crumbling, it may be helpful to clean the knife between each cut.  7. Create the Lego Studs: To mimic the lego studs, you can use round candies like M&Ms or Skittles, or make them out of frosting. If using frosting, prepare a small piping bag with a round tip. For candies, simply place the desired number of pieces in a small bowl. 8. Attach the Studs: If using candies, use a small dab of frosting as an adhesive. Apply the frosting to the bottom of each candy and press it gently onto the brownie blocks, mimicking the stud placement of real lego blocks. If using frosting for the studs, carefully pipe small, round dots evenly spaced on the top surface of each brownie block. 9. Double-check the Appearance: After attaching the studs, double-check that the brownie blocks resemble legos. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure uniformity in size and stud placement. 10. Allow the Frosting to Set: If you used frosting for the studs or as adhesive for the candies, allow some time for the frosting to set before serving. By following these steps, you can create brownies resembling legos in a consistent and visually appealing manner. This detailed process ensures the creation of a fun and unique dessert that is sure to impress guests or make for a delightful treat for children and lego enthusiasts alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A strategy-oriented game with an engaging, military-themed premise, Battleship is an excellent way to boost your tactical skills while enjoying quality time with family and friends. Although the game has been around since the 1930s, its modern, mass-produced form arrived in the 1960s, with updated rules and features. This article will guide you through the process of setting up and playing the classic game of Battleship, whether you are a beginner or a seasoned player looking for a refresher. Setting Up the Game 1. Give each player a battleship box: In the standard Battleship game, two players compete against each other. Each player receives a plastic box, known as the battleship box, which consists of two grid systems. The top half is used to record the players' strikes and misses, while the lower half is meant for arranging their fleets. The box also serves as a convenient shield to maintain privacy and promote strategic thinking. 2. Check that all the ship pieces are there: Each player's fleet consists of five ships in distinct sizes and shapes, including a carrier, a battleship, a cruiser, a submarine, and a destroyer. Before starting the game, both players should ensure that their ship pieces are complete and undamaged. The necessary pieces include:    a. Aircraft Carrier (5 grid spaces)    b. Battleship (4 grid spaces)    c. Cruiser (3 grid spaces)    d. Submarine (3 grid spaces)    e. Destroyer (2 grid spaces) 3. Have each player secretly arrange their ships: Players must strategically arrange their respective fleets on the bottom grid of their battleship boxes. This process is conducted in secrecy, with each player positioning their ships either horizontally or vertically, without touching one another or overlapping. The ships can be repositioned at any time before the game begins, allowing players to reconsider their strategy if desired. Some Battleship sets come equipped with small pegs to secure the ships in place on the grid, ensuring that they do not move throughout gameplay. 4. Decide who will play first: Before beginning the game, the players need to decide who will go first. This can be achieved through a coin toss, a game of rock-paper-scissors, or any mutually agreeable method. The first player assumes the role of the attacker, while the second player is the defender, waiting to retaliate once the initial move is made. Playing the Game 1. Call out the shot: With both players having positioned their fleets, the first player calls out a coordinate that corresponds to the square they wish to strike on their opponent's board. For example, \\"B5\\" denotes the intersection of the B column and the 5 row. 2. Determine if it's a hit or miss: The defender now checks the called coordinate on their grid to see if one of their ships occupies that square. If a ship is present, the defender announces a \\"hit.\\" The attacker inserts a red peg onto the corresponding square on their top grid as a record of the hit. If no ships occupy the targeted square, the defender calls out \\"miss,\\" and the attacker denotes this by inserting a white peg in that square. 3. Take turns: Following the initial move, players take turns attacking their opponents, calling out targeted coordinates and recording the outcomes on their grids. The defender is now able to counterattack, and this volley continues until one player's fleet is entirely sunk. 4. Winning the game: The objective of the Battleship game is to be the first player to sink all the opposing player's ships by successfully hitting each square that a ship occupies on their grid. A ship is considered sunk when all its grid spaces have been targeted by the opponent. The victorious player is the one who can annihilate their opponent's fleet before suffering the same fate. Conclusion Battleship is a timeless classic that has maintained its charm and appeal over several generations of board game enthusiasts. Its simple rules, engaging gameplay, and tactical depth make it an ideal choice for both casual and avid gamers alike. You can't go wrong with a round of Battleship to test your strategic thinking and, most importantly, enjoy some valuable recreational time with friends and family. So grab your ships, set sail, and may the best admiral win!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What is the best environment for fossils to form in? The best environment for fossils to form is in areas where the conditions promote rapid burial and preservation of remains, preventing decomposition and destruction by scavengers or natural elements. Several factors contribute to making an environment favorable for fossil formation. 1. Sedimentary rock: Fossils are primarily found within sedimentary rocks like shale, limestone, and sandstone. These rocks are formed when sediment accumulates in layers over time and eventually hardens into rock. Sedimentary environments, such as riverbeds, swamps, lakes, and shallow marine environments, provide ideal conditions for fossil formation. 2. Rapid burial: When an organism dies, it must be rapidly buried in sediment to prevent exposure to scavengers, bacteria, and weathering. Rapid burial helps preserve the organism's remains intact, increasing the chances of fossilization. 3. Anoxic conditions: Fossil formation is more likely in environments with low oxygen levels. A lack of oxygen slows down decomposition and discourages scavengers, preserving the remains. This can occur in deep marine environments or in waterlogged soils like those found in swamps or bogs. 4. Low-energy environments: Fossils are best preserved in low-energy environments where sediment is deposited gently without eroding or destroying the remains. In high-energy environments, like fast-moving rivers or areas with strong tidal forces, remains can be easily broken or scattered, decreasing the likelihood of fossil formation. 5. Mineral-rich water: The presence of mineral-rich groundwater can aid in fossil formation. Minerals can infiltrate the remains and aid in the hardening process, helping to create a more complete and durable fossil record. Question 2: What is the best model of watch in Fossil brands? Fossil is a well-known brand that offers a wide range of stylish and functional watches. The \\"best\\" model will depend on an individual's preferences, needs, and budget. Some popular Fossil watch models include: 1. Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch: Combining style and technology, this smartwatch offers heart rate tracking, GPS, smartphone notifications, and is compatible with Google Assistant and Google Pay. The Gen 5 is a good option for those who want a smartwatch with traditional watch aesthetics. 2. Fossil Grant Chronograph: The Grant Chronograph is a classic timepiece with a stainless steel case, Roman numeral markers, and three sub-dials displaying the chronograph functions. It is suitable for those looking for a traditional and elegant watch with added functionality. 3. Fossil Neutra Chronograph: This watch features a minimalist design with clean lines and a modern aesthetic. The Neutra Chronograph has a stainless steel case, a detailed chronograph functionality, and water resistance up to 50 meters. It appeals to individuals seeking a contemporary and versatile watch. 4. Fossil Carlie Mini: Designed for women, the Carlie Mini is a petite and feminine watch with a slim band and a smaller-sized face. It comes with a variety of band materials, including stainless steel and leather, and is embellished with crystals on the dial. This model is ideal for those in search of a dainty and fashionable timepiece. No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is related to the natural process of fossil formation in the context of paleontology and geology, while question 2 is about Fossil brand watches, which are a type of consumer product.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.  After reading the above, is \\"Telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Nashri's defiance led to what event?\\"? Choices: - no. - yes.","output":"yes.

B). None of the above choices .. C). The other team will stop the match .. D). The other team will go ahead ..","output":"D). The other team will go ahead. After the Quaffle grazed his fingers, the most plausible outcome would be that the other team carries on with the game while trying to take advantage of their opponents' potential weakness. This scenario fits the spirit of the sport, where competitiveness and quick reactions are crucial.  In the magical sport of Quidditch - as seen in the famous Harry Potter series - the game is fast-paced, with players continuously competing to outmaneuver each other. When the Quaffle grazed his fingers, it showed a momentary lapse in his ability to grasp the ball, which consequently led to the opposing team scoring. Given the highly competitive nature of Quidditch matches, the other team is unlikely to stop the match (option C) or get medical attention (option A) unless there is a genuine and serious injury. In this situation, the player did not appear to have sustained any significant harm but rather experienced a fleeting moment of inaccuracy. As such, it wouldn't warrant a pause in the game or any medical intervention. Based on the provided context, options A and C can be ruled out for the reasons stated above. Option B, \\"None of the above choices,\\" can also be dismissed as there is a viable choice among the given options. Finally, option D seems the most fitting and realistic choice, considering the sport's nature and the specific incident where the Quaffle grazed the player's hands.

The Robot can take picture of your room before the party. After the party, the robot will go around the room, and it will pick up bottles and trash. After that it will compare the room with the picture and put things back according to its original shape. Such robots are being studied in a lab at Stanford University. That sounds pretty cool!

On the one hand, it's really cool as a useful robot. It can actually clean your floor. Maybe not as fast or well as a person does, but it is a lot more fun cleaning the floor by the Roomba than cleaning the floor yourself. On the other hand, it shows the family life is very modern. What's the disadvantage  of the Roomba? A) It doesn't clean the floor as quietly as a person does. B) It doesn't clean the floor as clean as a person does. C) It doesn't clean the floor as fast or well as a person does. D) There is less fun using it. Answer:","output":"C) It doesn't clean the floor as fast or well as a person does. The Roomba, a popular robotic vacuum cleaner, has brought convenience in the cleaning realm, especially for those who have busy lifestyles or would rather allocate their time to other tasks. Although it has become a sought-after gadget for its incredible innovation, it is important to understand both the advantages and disadvantages associated with this device. As mentioned in the provided information, the Roomba is a fantastic gift for Mother's Day, as it showcases both modernity in family life and adds an element of fun to a typically monotonous household chore. The robot is designed to navigate a room and clean surfaces autonomously, minimizing the effort required in maintaining clean floors. However, despite its convenience, the Roomba has its limitations. The disadvantage is that it doesn't clean the floor as fast or well as a person does. This performance gap stems from a few factors: 1. Speed: The Roomba uses advanced algorithms and sensors to clean a room, but its movement is often slower compared to how quickly a human can clean the same space. This is because the robot might need to adjust its path, avoid obstacles, and go over certain spots multiple times to ensure thorough cleaning. 2. Precision: While the Roomba is designed to navigate around objects and avoid collisions, it may fail to reach tight spots or corners, leading to incomplete cleaning. A human cleaner can easily move objects like furniture or target specific areas that need extra attention. 3. Floor type: The Roomba is designed to work on different floor surfaces like hardwood, tile, or carpet. However, its efficiency varies depending on the type and texture of the floor. A human cleaner, on the other hand, can adjust their cleaning techniques according to the floor type and deliver more thorough results. 4. Cleaning stubborn dirt: The Roomba may struggle with deeply embedded dirt, grime, or stains, as its suction power and brushes may not be as effective as human cleaning using various tools and cleaning solutions. Despite the stated disadvantage, the Roomba still brings value and convenience to households, offering busy individuals a practical solution for maintaining a cleaner living space. However, it is essential to recognize its limitations and understand that occasional manual cleaning might be necessary for more thorough results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season. This would mark Urlacher's final game in a Bears' uniform. Urlacher was inactive for the final four games of the 2012 season, and he retired from the NFL on May 22, 2013.

A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.  - The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal.  - Herbert Spencer Gasser ( 5 July 1888 -- 11 May 1963 ) was an American physiologist , and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for his work with action potentials in nerve fibers while on the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis , awarded jointly with Joseph Erlanger .  - Joseph Erlanger (January 5, 1874  December 5, 1965) was an American physiologist who is best known for his contributions to the field of neuroscience. Together with Herbert Spencer Gasser, he identified several varieties of nerve fiber and established the relationship between action potential velocity and fiber diameter. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for these achievements.  - In physiology, an action potential is a short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a consistent trajectory. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell-to-cell communication by providing for (or assisting in, with regard to saltatory conduction) the propagation of signals along the neuron's axon towards boutons at the axon ends which can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. Action potentials in neurons are also known as \\"nerve impulses\\" or \\"spikes\\", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its \\"spike train\\". A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to \\"fire\\".  - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump Tops GOP Field in New Hampshire, Second in Iowa: Poll Donald Trump isn’t just the leading Republican candidate in the national polls – a barometer of name recognition – he is now looking strong in the early presidential nominating states where voters are paying attention. An NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday found the New York developer in first place among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and two percentage points behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in Iowa. Mr. Trump carries 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary electorate, a decisive lead over second-place Jeb Bush, who had 14%, the poll found. In Iowa, Mr. Trump is at 17%, with Mr. Walker at 19%. The poll found a strong early showing in New Hampshire for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who at 7% is in fourth place among GOP voters there. Mr. Kasich, who formally launched his presidential campaign Monday, has just 2% support in Iowa, good for 11th place among the 17 Republican candidates tested. Until now, Mr. Trump had been in the lead of national polling but Mr. Walker and Mr. Bush led opinion surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, home to the nation’s first two presidential nominating contests. Mr. Trump campaigned Saturday in Oskaloosa, Iowa, where he attacked the Wisconsin governor for the first time. Mr. Trump said “the gloves are off” after a fundraiser for Mr. Walker called Mr. Trump “DumbDumb” in an invitation to an event later this week. Mr. Trump’s polling rise comes as he seems to have weathered the initial public storm over his belittling of Sen. John McCain’s war record. The NBC/Marist poll was conducted before and after Mr. Trump said Mr. McCain “is not a war hero.” Mr. Trump’s standing in Iowa increased after he made the incendiary remark, though he lost ground in New Hampshire, according to the poll. Perhaps working in Mr. Trump’s favor is that twice as many Republican voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire said they’d prefer a GOP nominee who shares their positions on issues over one who has the best chance of retaking the White House for the party. The polling landmines for Mr. Trump are the same as they have been. Some 44% of the Iowa Republican electorate and 53% of the New Hampshire GOP voters have an unfavorable view of him, far more than the other leading candidates tested. Mr. Bush is next with about one-third of GOP voters in each early state viewing him unfavorably. Among Democratic presidential candidates the NBC/Marist poll found Hillary Clinton with a commanding percentage in Iowa (55%) over challengers Bernie Sanders (26%) and Martin O’Malley (4%). If Vice President Joe Biden was included, Mr. Sanders’s share dropped to just 7%. Mr. Biden hasn’t ruled out a presidential campaign but has done nothing to organize a run. Mrs. Clinton’s lead in New Hampshire is smaller – just 47% to 34% over Mr. Sanders. The NBC/Marist poll surveyed 919 registered voters in Iowa. The New Hampshire poll surveyed 910 registered voters. Each took place from July 14-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. ______________________________________________________ Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

If you really want to make a good impression, be open to letting your date pick the movie for the date. Let them choose what they want to see. They may see this as a sweet and accommodating gesture. For example, you may ask them, “Hey, Chuck, what do you want to see?” or “Any new movies out you really want to see?” If you'd like to have more of a say, have a discussion about which movie you go see. Throw out a few options to your date and then agree on the movie together. That way, you can both enjoy the movie.  Agreeing on the movie together can also show your date that you are willing to compromise, which can be an attractive quality in a romantic partner. For example, you may say, “Why don't we compromise and see a comedy?” or “What about going to see something we both like?” Going to the movies is generally considered a casual setting for a date. Do not over dress by wearing a party dress or a tie. Instead, wear clothing that makes you feel confident and comfortable. If you are really into your date and want to look sexy, you may take it up a notch by wearing heels, a dress, or a collared shirt. Once you have agreed on a movie, contact your date and confirm the meet up time by calling or texting them. Make sure you include a note about how excited you are for the date when you confirm the time. For example, you may text, \\"See you at the Westbrook theater at 7 pm. Looking forward to it :)\\" or call them and say, \\"Meet you outside the theater at 6:30. Can't wait!\\" Plan ahead so you arrive 5-10 minutes early for the movie. This can allow you to get any last minute jitters out and feel calm for the date. You may wait for your date in front of the theater or get their ticket for them while you are waiting, if you'd like. Another option is to arrange to meet with your date early at the theater so you can get snacks and good seats before the movie starts.

Canada earns 3 spots in men's road race at Rio Olympics Canada has qualified three spots in men's road race cycling for the 2016 Rio Olympics, giving it six months to prepare for what is expected to be a challenging event. Canada earned the spots after finishing second in the Union Cycliste International (UCI) America Tour as of Dec. 31. The three riders ultimately selected to fill the spots will join 142 other riders from 59 other nations and the Tripartite Commission. \\"Establishing our quotas early gives us time to work more collaboratively with our top athletes and their professional trade teams to ensure we get the right guys to Rio, with the right build-up race programs\\", said Kevin Field, Cycling Canada's men's elite road manager. The 256-kilometre race, on Aug. 6, starts and ends at Fort Copacabana, on the coast. Riders will have to make four laps of the Grumari National Park circuit before zooming along the Vista Chinesa circuit through the Tijuca forest —which includes an 8.9-kilometre climb with gradients as high as 10 per cent — and along Ipanema beach back to Copacabana. \\"Our riders are excited the courses will be challenging,\\" said Field. \\"We have guys who can be very competitive and the internal work is well under way to narrow our selections to our best three riders.\\" \\"Our job now will be to select the riders best suited to be competitive in both the men's road race and the time trial,\\" said Jacques Landry, Cycling Canada's high performance director. One of the riders will also compete in the individual time trial, which happens Aug. 10. Canada earned just one spot at the 2012 London Olympics after consistently qualifying three at previous Games. Cycling Canada credits support from organizations such as Global Relay's Bridge the Gap, a development program that provides coaching, resources and equipment to five of Canada's top up-and-coming cyclists. Top Canadian contenders include national team member Guillaume Boivin, who finished third at the 2015 Pan Am Games, and Hugo Houle, the top Canadian in the elite men individual time trial race at the UCI Road World Championships in September. Belgium, Colombia, Great Britain, Italy and Spain all qualified the full number of starters for the men's road events: five. The women's road race, and time trial, quota will be announced on June 1st by the UCI, after the May 31st qualification deadline.

Context: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" Question: What Nicolette thought about King's welfare? Answer: Answer:","output":"Nicolette thought that most people in the room, including the King's family and courtiers, were more worried about their own welfare than the King's. She felt irritated by their whispers and believed they were not doing much to alleviate the King's suffering. However, Nicolette herself was attending to the King and trying to make him as comfortable as possible, showing her genuine concern for his welfare."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Opening the enchanting table is your first step into a world of enchantments, where the impossible becomes possible. So, take a deep breath and embark on an adventure by right-clicking on the enchantment table in Minecraft.  Step Two: The Book of Magic The object that holds the magic spell is a book. An ordinary book turns into an imbibed manuscript filled with potent enchantments once it interacts with the enchanting table. Once you have opened the enchantment table, move the book into the table's slot. By doing this, you prepare the book to receive the magic that will eventually be stored within its pages. Step Three: Essence of Enchantment - Lapis Lazuli The enchantment process requires a special ingredient, lapis lazuli. This vibrant-blue mineral possesses the essence required to translate the abstract enchantment into a functional form within the book. This step is crucial, as without lapis lazuli, there can be no enchantment. To do this, simply place your lapis lazuli into the designated slot in the enchanting table. This will set the enchantment's power level. Step Four: Choosing Your Enchantment Now comes the most exciting part - choosing your enchantment. The enchantment options will appear once the book and lapis lazuli are in their rightful places. You will be presented with a selection of enchantments, each represented by hieroglyph-like symbols and ranging from simple to superior, depending on your enchantment table level. Your choice of enchantment depends largely on your character's requirements and the kind of power you want to equip them with. Select your enchantment by clicking on the glyphs representing the enchantment you desire. Remember, each enchantment has unique capabilities, and your choice will tailor your character's abilities in the Minecraft world. Step Five: Claim Your Enchanted Book Once you have selected your enchantment, the book will glow, indicating that it's now an enchanted book. It's time to move the enchanted book to your inventory. The enchanted book contains the magic you have selected, ready to be used when needed. Drag and drop the newly enchanted book into your inventory. Step Six: Repeat As Necessary  And there you have it! You've successfully enchanted a book. But mastering the art of enchanting doesn't stop here. Depending on your needs, you can repeat this process as often as necessary, giving you a wide range of enchanted books at your disposal. Each time you follow these steps, you'll find yourself delving deeper into the magical realm of Minecraft, equipping you to face every challenge that comes your way with an enchanted edge. In conclusion, enchanting in Minecraft opens up a world of unlimited possibilities. It adds depth to gameplay and molds a unique experience for every player.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: TOKYO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Japan’s Shionogi & Co said on Tuesday that it has applied to health regulators in the United States, Canada and Europe for approval of its HIV drug Dolutegravir. Shionogi developed Dolutegravir with a Viiv Healthcare, an AIDS drug joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, in exchange for its rights to the drug. Hypothesis: The United States along with Canada will approve of the HIV drug","output":"Based on the provided context, we can draw the following hypothesis: Hypothesis: The United States, Canada, and Europe's health regulators are currently considering the approval of Shionogi & Co's HIV drug, Dolutegravir, which was developed in partnership with Viiv Healthcare, a joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that the United States and Canada, or any of the mentioned health regulators, will approve the HIV drug just based on the information provided. The approval process usually consists of multiple stages, and the drug's safety and efficacy have to be evaluated thoroughly by the respective health authorities before a decision is made. At this stage, we can deduce that Shionogi & Co is seeking regulatory approval from health authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe. This implies that the company believes their drug might meet the requirements needed to get approved, which typically include passing through various clinical trials to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness and safety. Considering that Shionogi developed Dolutegravir in collaboration with Viiv Healthcare, which is a joint venture between two major pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, it's plausible that the drug candidate has been developed through rigorous research and development processes and has the potential for approval. These companies most likely have experience in gaining approval for similar drugs in the past, so they may have strategized and designed the drug development process accordingly. However, it is important to remember that the approval of a drug is not guaranteed, even if it comes from a collaboration between renowned pharmaceutical companies. The regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe have the responsibility to ensure public health and safety and will thus carefully evaluate the characteristics and performance of Dolutegravir in clinical trials. Therefore, only after assessing all the relevant data, including the drug's safety profile and effectiveness in treating HIV, will these regulatory bodies make their decision. In conclusion, it is not possible to confirm the hypothesis that the United States and Canada will approve Shionogi & Co's HIV drug solely based on the context provided. The hypothesis can only state that the company has applied for approval, not that approval will be granted. To know the outcome of the approval process, we would need information on the results of the clinical trials, feedback from the health regulatory agencies, and eventually, the official announcement of their decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose.

David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes.  Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion.  In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, answer the following question. After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Select from: [1]. Fans of macaroni and cheese.; [2]. Overweight or obese.; [3]. not enough information; [4]. University researchers.; Answer:","output":"[2].

In the early 1980s, McKenna began to speak publicly on the topic of psychedelic drugs, becoming one of the pioneers of the psychedelic movement. His main focus was on the plant-based psychedelics such as psilocybin mushrooms (which were the catalyst for his career), ayahuasca, cannabis, and the plant derivative DMT. He conducted lecture tours and workshops promoting natural psychedelics as a way to explore universal mysteries, stimulate the imagination, and re-establish a harmonious relationship with nature. Though associated with the New Age and Human Potential Movements, McKenna himself had little patience for New Age sensibilities. He repeatedly stressed the importance and primacy of the \\"felt presence of direct experience\\", as opposed to dogma.  In addition to psychedelic drugs, McKenna spoke on a wide array of subjects including; shamanism; metaphysics; alchemy; language; culture; self-empowerment; environmentalism, techno-paganism; artificial intelligence; evolution; extraterrestrials; science and scientism; the Web; virtual reality (which he saw as a way to artistically communicate the experience of psychedelics); and aesthetic theory, specifically about art/visual experience as information representing the significance of hallucinatory visions experienced under the influence of psychedelics.  McKenna soon became a fixture of popular counterculture with Timothy Leary once introducing him as \\"one of the five or six most important people on the planet\\" and with comedian Bill Hicks' referencing him in his stand-up act and building an entire routine around his ideas. McKenna also became a popular personality in the psychedelic rave/dance scene of the early 1990s, with frequent spoken word performances at raves and contributions to psychedelic and goa trance albums by The Shamen, Spacetime Continuum, Alien Project, Capsula, Entheogenic, Zuvuya, Shpongle, and Shakti Twins. In 1994 he appeared as a speaker at the Starwood Festival, documented in the book Tripping by Charles Hayes.  McKenna published several books in the early-to-mid-1990s including: The Archaic Revival; Food of the Gods; and True Hallucinations. Hundreds of hours of McKenna's public lectures were recorded either professionally or bootlegged and have been produced on cassette tape, CD and MP3. Segments of his talks have gone on to be sampled by many musicians and DJ's.  McKenna was a colleague and close friend of chaos mathematician Ralph Abraham, and author and biologist Rupert Sheldrake. He conducted several public and many private debates with them from 1982 until his death. These debates were known as trialogues and some of the discussions were later published in the books: Trialogues at the Edge of the West and The Evolutionary Mind.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.

Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races.  - The Commonwealth Games (known as the British Empire Games from 19301950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 19541966, and British Commonwealth Games from 19701974) is an international, multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then.  - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed.  The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old.  - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross.  - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.  - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom.  - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the premise of \`\` abandon '' holds promise ,","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"the premise of \`\`abandon'' holds promise,\\" can be interpreted as both positive and negative, depending on the context in which it is being used. Positive Interpretation: In this interpretation, the sentiment can be seen as positive because the sentence implies that the idea or concept of \\"abandon\\" can lead to promising outcomes. It suggests that there might be positivity or potential growth in letting go of certain things, ideas, or situations. This \\"abandon\\" may introduce new opportunities or a fresh start. Consequently, the underlying sentiment is one of hope and positive anticipation. An example of a positive interpretation might be a scenario where someone explores the idea of leaving their comfort zone to advance in life. Negative Interpretation: On the other hand, the sentiment might also be interpreted as negative. The word \\"abandon\\" inherently carries negative connotations, as it can imply losing something or giving up on something important. The sentence might be taken to suggest that the act of abandonment itself might be promising or even necessary, which can be seen as disheartening or saddening. An example of a negative interpretation may be a situation where a person has no choice but to leave something they cherish in order to move forward. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"the premise of \`\`abandon'' holds promise,\\" is subjective and could be perceived as both positive or negative, depending on the context and perception of the reader.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the couple that bought the two massive concrete chairs at the auction?  Discussion of damming the White River for flood control began in the 1930s, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) held hearings on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50 miles (80 km) long, and one arm would extend to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought land around the White River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold his land as well. The Federal Government required that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, and it was no easy task. In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed on the crest of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.The CoE mistakenly believed that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover the area of the large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been at the base of the amphitheater.

Article: We often see wind-horse flags in Tibetan areas. They are long cloths on which pictures of horses and scriptures are printed. People often put these flags on top of houses, or leave them where a vehicle accident happened. They prevent evil spirits from injuring people again. A wind-horse flag can be white, yellow, red, green or blue. These five colors symbolize the five elements that form the world; earth, water, fire, wind and sky. Another explanations that red is the sun, green is the grassland, yellow is the earth, blue is the sky, and white is the cloud. The wind-horse flag originated with a monk who obtained a scripture from India. When he crossed a river, he carelessly dropped the scripture into the water. He quickly saved the scripture and spread it out on a big rock to dry as he sat in meditation . Suddenly violent thunder sounded like drums. The monk felt liberated from all of his sadness, and when he opened his eyes he saw that the scripture had been blown into the sky by a strong wind. Finally, he went straight to heaven. In order to honor the spirit of the monk and the Buddhist scripture, people printed the scripture on a piece of cloth and hung it up between the sky and the earth as though the scripture was flying in the sky. We also know why people put the wind-horse flag on the top of mountains and houses. The Tibetan ancestors had a very great idea about chanting scripture. They thought people not only could chant scripture, but also the five elements. The wind-home flag is a good example of how they use the wind to blow the flag, which means that the wind also chants scripture.   Answer: The scripture was blown into the sky.","output":"Question: What happened to the scripture when the monk opened his eyes after hearing violent thunder while meditating?"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It was clear to Victoria that this excessive attachment was unhealthy, and she felt a growing concern for her friend's well-being.  Step 1: Assess the situation Searching for the right moment to bring up her concerns, Victoria spent more time with Katrina and Jake to properly assess their relationship. Her intent was not only to confirm her own perception but also to ensure her eventual advice would be helpful and appropriate. She paid attention to Jake's behavior patterns, Katrina's reactions, and the overall dynamics between the couple. Step 2: Offer support  In providing her unwavering support, Victoria would frequently join Katrina and Jake during their outings or events. This allowed for casual conversations and a friendly atmosphere making it easier to broach sensitive topics. Additionally, being consistently available as a friend gave Katrina a sense of security in knowing that she could count on Victoria when needed. Step 3: Give gentle advice One day, the three of them went out for coffee. While Jake briefly stepped away to use the restroom, Victoria brought up her concerns about how clingy Jake seemed. Speaking with kindness and care, Victoria asked Katrina how she truly felt about the situation, and invited her to share her own thoughts and feelings. Step 4: Encourage communication Upon hearing Katrina's mixed feelings regarding her relationship, Victoria encouraged her friend to have an open and honest conversation with Jake. She reminded Katrina that it was important for both partners to understand each other's needs in order to maintain a healthy relationship. Step 5: Be a listening ear In the days that followed, Victoria made it a point to be there for Katrina, providing a listening ear and empathetic presence. This allowed Katrina to process her feelings and explore ways to address the issue with Jake. Victoria's support gave Katrina the reassurance that she had someone rooting for her wellbeing. Step 6: Respect boundaries When Katrina finally decided to have a conversation with Jake about her concerns, Victoria kindly stepped back, allowing her friend to navigate those delicate discussions on her own. By respecting Katrina's autonomy, she kept a close eye on the situation and offered her guidance only when requested. Step 7: Offer further support if needed In the end, Katrina's conversation with Jake went better than expected. He assured her that he would actively work on becoming less clingy and more aware of their respective boundaries. As they both moved forward, Victoria remained a constant source of support for her friend and offered her assistance if either of them needed it down the road.

After a disappointing loss to the Miami Dolphins, the Patriots looked to bounce back against the lowly Vikings who were without Adrian Peterson who was suspended, but were led by ex-Patriot Matt Cassel at quarterback. The Vikings took the ball and marched right down the field 80 yards in just 7 plays, with Cassel finding Matt Asiata on a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead just over four minutes into game. This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety Devin McCourty intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, Stevan Ridley scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to Darrelle Revis at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17-7. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but Chandler Jones blocked Blair Walsh's field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24-7 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27-7. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30-7 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie Dominique Easley intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game. Brady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A cowboy riding alone in Utah witnesses a stampede of wild stallions, one of whom particularly catches his eye. He returns the horse to its rightful owner, Julie Richards, owner of the Rocking R Ranch, introducing himself as Clint Barkley and asking for a job. The wild horse, Smoky, slowly develops a relationship with Clint, but ranch foreman Jeff doesn't trust the new hired hand, who is vague and mysterious about his past. A stranger arrives named Frank and persuades a reluctant Clint to vouch for him to be hired as a wrangler. It turns out Clint took the blame for a crime Frank committed and served eight months behind bars. Frank begins causing trouble at the ranch, mistreating Smoky and the other horses. A gambler turns up, seeking Clint's payment for a 200 debt, discovering that Frank actually lost the money and forged Clint's name on the IOU. Frank rustles the horses and rides off. Jeff remains suspicious until Clint finally reveals that Frank is his brother. Smoky, abused again, fights off Frank and ends up killing him. Other cowboys discover the horse and sell him to a rodeo in Cheyenne. The horse's condition deteriorates and he ends up pulling a junk cart. One day Clint rides into town and Smoky recognizes him. They are reunited, and return to Julie and the ranch.

The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments.

Please answer the following question: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties.

The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull.

Pluto's icy north pole shines in this image It may have demoted to a dwarf planet but this image shows that Pluto continues to confound and surprise scientists. The image from the New Horizon spacecraft showcases icy canyon’s on Pluto’s north pole. The long canyons run vertically across the polar area—part of the informally named Lowell Regio, named for Percival Lowell, who founded Lowell Observatory and initiated the search that led to Pluto’s discovery. The widest of the canyons is about 45 miles wide and runs close to the north pole. Roughly parallel subsidiary canyons to the east and west are approximately 6 miles wide. Unlike the canyons on other parts of Pluto, the degraded walls of these canyons appear to be much older and may provide evidence of ancient period of tectonics on the planet. Related: NASA releases dramatic new Pluto images Along with the canyons, you can see a shallow, winding valley that runs the entire length of the canyon floor as well as large, irregularly-shaped pits that reach 45 miles across and 2.5 miles deep. These pits may be where subsurface ice has melted from below, causing the ground to collapse. Another unusual quality of this region is the color. High elevations show up in a distinctive yellow, something not seen elsewhere on Pluto. The yellowish terrain fades to a bluish gray at lower elevations and latitudes and coincides with New Horizons' infrared measurements indicating methane ice is abundant across Lowell Regio. Related: Cool NASA images reveal day in the life of Pluto “One possibility is that the yellow terrains may correspond to older methane deposits that have been more processed by solar radiation than the bluer terrain,” said Will Grundy, New Horizons composition team lead from Lowell Observatory said in a statement.

Write an article based on this \\"Avoid greasy meals and alcohol before trips. Eat frequent, light meals. Have bland, floury snacks in the car. Stay hydrated. Consume plenty of ginger. Keep a supply of mints and gum at hand.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Tips for Stress-Free Travel: How to Manage Nausea and Stay Comfortable During Long Trips Introduction: Traveling can be an exciting adventure, but it can also bring about a variety of unwanted symptoms like motion sickness, upset stomachs, and general discomfort. With a few simple adjustments to your pre-trip routine and some smart in-transit strategies, you can greatly reduce these symptoms and enjoy a smoother journey.  Step 1: Avoid greasy meals and alcohol before trips In the days leading up to a long trip, be mindful of your diet. Heavy, greasy meals and alcohol can exacerbate feelings of nausea and discomfort during travel. Instead, opt for lighter fare, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, which can help stabilize your stomach and prepare you for extended periods of motion. Step 2: Eat frequent, light meals When on the move, eating small, light meals throughout the day can help keep your stomach settled. Large meals can cause discomfort and even contribute to motion sickness, but by snacking regularly, your body will have a constant source of energy and maintain a steady balance. Step 3: Have bland, floury snacks in the car During travel, you should maintain a stock of bland, floury snacks in the car, such as crackers, cereal, or pretzels. These types of snacks can help absorb stomach acid and reduce feelings of nausea or discomfort. Additionally, they are easy to digest and unlikely to cause further upset. Step 4: Stay hydrated Staying hydrated is essential during travel, as dehydration can lead to headaches, fatigue, and irritability. Before and during your trip, ensure you are drinking plenty of water or natural electrolyte drinks. To avoid needing frequent restroom stops, try sipping small amounts of liquids consistently rather than gulping down large volumes. Step 5: Consume plenty of ginger Ginger has long been hailed as a natural remedy for many ailments, including motion sickness and nausea. Incorporate ginger into your pre-trip diet by adding it to meals or sipping on ginger tea. For a more portable option, purchase ginger candies or chews to bring with you during your trip. Consuming ginger regularly can help reduce nausea and keep your stomach calm. Step 6: Keep a supply of mints and gum at hand Sucking on mints or chewing gum can help alleviate feelings of nausea by stimulating saliva production, which aids in digestion and eases stomach discomfort. Additionally, the mild flavors of mint and other mild gums can refresh your palate and help mask any unpleasant tastes in your mouth that may contribute to nausea. Conclusion: A bit of thoughtful preparation and select items on hand can make all the difference in your travel experience. By following these tips, you can help prevent nausea, stay comfortable, and enjoy your well-deserved vacation to its fullest. By avoiding greasy meals and alcohol, eating light meals, packing the right snacks, staying hydrated, and utilizing ginger and mints, your next journey is sure to be a smooth ride."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Andrew Baines Bernard (born in 1973; Walter Bernard, Jr.) is a fictional character from the U.S. comedy television series, The Office. Andy is portrayed by Ed Helms. He has no counterpart in the original British version of the series. He is introduced as the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Stamford branch of paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin in the third-season premiere when Jim Halpert transfers, ultimately merging with the Scranton branch in the episode \\"The Merger\\" later in the season. Andy is introduced in the season 3 premiere as the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Stamford branch, where Jim has transferred to. Early season episodes reveal his anger issues, displayed when he finds his calculator encased in Jell-O and when he performs poorly due to Jim's inexperience at Call of Duty.  After the closure of Stamford and merger with Scranton, Andy attempts to gain favor with manager Michael Scott through his quoted tactics of \\"name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake\\". There is rivalry with Dwight Schrute over whether his title is higher than that of Dwight's Assistant Regional Manager, fueling an intense power struggle. However, Michael becomes agitated at Andy's sycophantic attitude and poor salesmanship, as does the office at his obnoxious singing. Jim hides Andy's mobile phone that rings with Andy's rendition of \\"Rockin' Robin\\" in the ceiling, enraging him into punching a hole in the office wall. A producer's cut of the episode explains Andy's departure from subsequent episodes as due to being sent to anger management training.  Andy returns a few months later to a short-lived \\"three-year\\" shunning courtesy of Dwight. He accompanies Jim to meet with clients from a local high school following an obscene watermark being vandalized onto Dunder Mifflin paper. This unexpected trip leads Andy to the discovery that his girlfriend is a high school student.  At the Beach Games, Andy captains a team alongside Jim, Dwight and Stanley Hudson in a competition for Michael's selection of the next Regional Manager of the Scranton branch, as Michael believes he is a shoo-in for a position at corporate. However, he falls plight to the sabotage of Angela Martin, who favors Dwight, and ends up in a sumo wrestler costume drifting away into Lake Scranton. However, when Dwight is pre-emptively named Regional Manager by Michael (who is confident that he will receive a promotion), Andy is named Assistant Regional Manager, although never actually becomes ARM as Michael does not receive the corporate promotion. Does Andy have any emotional problems at work?","output":"Yes, Andy Bernard has emotional problems at work, particularly related to anger issues. These issues are evident in early episodes of the show.

Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra.

The first sentence, while it mentions Gray Davis and a connection to Los Angeles Superior Court in April 2000, does not provide explicit details about the nature of this association. The first sentence merely forms a timeline of professional progress and achievements of the individual in question, Gray Davis. It outlines a sequence of job positions throughout his career, specifically mentioning his appointments with different law firms. The sentence starts with \\"Gray Davis to Los Angeles Superior Court, April 2000,\\" but the phrase does not give clear information about how Gray Davis was related to the court during that time. He could have been representing a case there, or he might have been appointed for a temporary service. Moreover, the information about him being a partner at Morrison & Foerster from 1991-2000, a partner at Hufstedler, Kaus & Ettinger (and predecessor firms) from 1983-91, and an associate at Beardsley, Hufstedler & Kemble (and related firms) from 1977-82 is given. It concludes with his law education detail, stating that he graduated from Harvard Law School at the age of 49.  However, nowhere does it signify his position or role in the Los Angeles Superior Court in April 2000 as suggested in the second sentence. So, we cannot definitely say that Gray Davis was associated with the court in April of 2000 based on the information given in the first sentence. For entailment to take place, the information in the first sentence must definitively affirm the information in the second sentence. Given this criterion, the second sentence is not necessarily entailed by the first sentence.

Sandra wants to go on vacation, and would like to go somewhere cold. Sandra will likely choose a place near the equator or near the poles? Answer:","output":"Sandra, who is seeking a cold vacation destination, would likely choose a place near the poles rather than near the equator. This decision is based on Earth's distribution of heat and the distinct temperature differences between equatorial and polar regions. At the equator, Earth's surface receives sunlight directly due to the planet's unique structure and rotational dynamics. As a result, the Sun's rays strike the equator at a near-perpendicular angle, causing the solar radiation to be more concentrated and the temperatures to be higher. Tropical rainforests, for instance, can be found around the equator, characterized by high temperatures and humidity levels. In contrast, the polar regions receive significantly less direct sunlight because Earth's curvature angles the Sun's rays away from these areas. Consequently, the solar radiation gets much more diffused, leading to lower temperatures and the formation of cold environments like ice caps, glaciers, and permafrost. Moreover, the nature of Earth's axial tilt contributes to the fluctuation of temperatures and seasonality in these regions. Due to this tilt, the polar regions experience continuous sunshine during summer months, while winter months are characterized by prolonged darkness and freezing conditions. The equatorial regions, on the other hand, experience little variation in temperature and daylight throughout the year. Given Sandra's preference for a cold destination, she should opt for a location near the poles. Examples of such destinations include Antarctica, Greenland, Northern parts of Canada, Alaska, or the Scandinavian countries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland, where temperatures are much lower than the equator. These regions also offer a variety of cold-weather activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, ice fishing, or simply enjoying the distinctive landscapes and observing the fascinating wildlife that is well-adapted to the cold conditions. In conclusion, Sandra would be better off choosing a vacation destination near the poles if she desires a cold environment. The Earth's structure and rotation dynamics contribute substantially to the considerable temperature differences between the equator and the poles, making polar regions perfect locations to experience colder temperatures and unique winter activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Woman magazine has a more direct focus on women's issues compared to Heat magazine. Although both publications are targeted at women, their content and approach to issues affecting women vary significantly. Woman is a leading women's lifestyle magazine that dates back to 1937. It primarily focuses on creating content that caters to women's interests, concerns, and needs. The magazine is known for providing its readers with a balanced mix of real-life stories, advice columns, fashion, beauty, health, and well-being tips, as well as essential discussions about relationships, family, work, and personal issues that affect women on a daily basis. The magazine also features celebrity interviews, but these are often centered around the personal lives and experiences of the celebrity from a woman's perspective. The articles and features in Woman magazine highlight the challenges and success stories of everyday women, empowering its readers by offering practical solutions, information, and inspiration. Woman takes a more sympathetic and understanding tone while touching on sensitive topics like mental health, body image, parenting, and women's rights. The magazine aims at building a community of like-minded women, connecting through shared experiences, and fostering a sense of solidarity and support among readers. Heat, on the other hand, is a British entertainment magazine that was first published in 1999. While it is primarily aimed at a female audience, its main focus is on celebrity gossip, television, and popular culture. The magazine's content includes news, interviews, and features about celebrities, along with articles on fashion, beauty, and lifestyle trends. Heat is known for its light-hearted, humorous, and sometimes sensational approach to journalism, with a penchant for capturing the latest scandals and showbiz stories. Although Heat does occasionally cover women's issues, it does so in a manner that is more superficial and entertainment-driven, rather than delving deep into the complex concerns that women face. Its primary goal is to keep its readers informed and entertained, rather than addressing serious issues or providing support to its female audience. In conclusion, Woman magazine has a more direct focus on women's issues, as it consistently prioritizes in-depth discussions, advice, and real-life stories that women can relate to and learn from. In contrast, Heat magazine is more invested in the world of celebrity news and entertainment, and while it touches on women's issues occasionally, it does so in a less comprehensive and profound manner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Peter Loew is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie, a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection, he wears dark sunglasses during the day, and, when his \\"fangs\\" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth. All the while, Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood. Shortly after, Loew experiences mood swings and calls Jackie back apologetically, asking to meet her at a bar.

There is no physical difference between a carrier and a subcarrier; the \\"sub\\" implies that it has been derived from a carrier, which has been amplitude modulated by a steady signal and has a constant frequency relation to it.  - A radio reading service or reading service for the blind is a service of many universities, community groups and public radio stations, where a narrator reads books, newspapers and magazines aloud for the benefit of the blind and vision-impaired. It is most often carried on a subcarrier, with radio receivers permanently tuned to a given station in the area, or an HD Radio subchannel of the offering station.

William Randolph Hearst Sr. (; April 29, 1863 - August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. As biographer Ben Proctor explains:  During the 1920s he became an avowed Jeffersonian Democrat, warning his fellow citizens against the dangers of big government, of unchecked federal power that could infringe on the individual rights of Americans, especially if a charismatic leader was in charge....[After supporting FDR in 1932] Hearst soon became highly critical of the New Deal. With increasing frequency Hearst newspapers supported big business to the detriment of organized labor. With unabated vigor they condemned higher income tax legislation as a persecution of the \\"successful.\\"  Hearst broke with FDR in spring 1935 when the president vetoed the Patman Bonus Bill for veterans and tried to enter the World Court. Hearst's papers were his weapon. They carried the publisher's rambling, vitriolic, all-capital-letters editorials, but he no longer employed the energetic reporters, editors, and columnists who might have made a serious attack.

Key points of the debate include: 1. The prevalence of armed conflicts in poverty-stricken regions, particularly Africa, where a significant number of ongoing conflicts are taking place. 2. The notion that a poorly funded and trained military can pose a threat to a nation's stability through unprofessional behavior, criminal activities, or even attempting a coup to seize power. 3. The assertion that poverty enables rebellions, civil wars, and local warlords to thrive by preventing a state from having the resources necessary to maintain control and ensure security within its territory. 4.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Jerry and George are two roommates who have lived together since college. They have always gotten along well, have similar hobbies and even are the same height. They both enjoy watching sports and playing videogames, but Jerry also rides his bike several miles each week. George can't stand exercising. Instead, he prefers to lay around relaxing and driving his car if he needs to go somewhere.  and a hint : Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Please answer this question : Who has a higher risk of hypertension? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that George has a higher risk of hypertension. The reason for this assumption is that George has a more sedentary lifestyle compared to Jerry, as he prefers to lay around relaxing and avoids exercise. In contrast, Jerry rides his bike several miles each week, which indicates that he engages in regular physical activity. The hint provided mentions that any unused energy in food is stored as fat, and people who consistently consume more energy than they need may become obese. Obesity, with a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m² or greater, increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. As George has a more sedentary lifestyle, he is more likely to consume more energy than he burns, accumulating excess calories and increasing his risk of obesity. Consequently, his risk of hypertension would be higher compared to Jerry, who engages in regular physical activity and is more likely to maintain a healthier weight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Third Eye Blind is an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1993. The songwriting duo of Stephan Jenkins and Kevin Cadogan signed the band's first major label recording contract with Elektra Records in 1996, which was later reported as the largest publishing deal ever for an unsigned artist. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1997, with the band largely consisting of Jenkins (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Cadogan (lead guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), and Brad Hargreaves (drums). Shortly after the release of the band's second album in 1999, Blue, with the same line-up, Cadogan was released from the band under controversial circumstances. Context: A single, \\"Non-Dairy Creamer,\\" was released in November 2008 and was part of the internet exclusive digital EP Red Star.  Third Eye Blind's fourth studio album Ursa Major was released on August 18, 2009. The album had been anticipated since mid-2007 and was previously expected to be named The Hideous Strength. The album was released under their own label, Mega Collider Records. Third Eye Blind topped the Billboard Rock Albums chart, Top Alternative Albums chart, and Top Digital Albums chart with Ursa Major. The band released only one official single from the record, \\"Don't Believe a Word\\", on June 16, 2009; it was released to radio on July 7, 2009. \\"Bonfire\\" was also released as a radio-exclusive single. Neither charted on any radio formats.  The band toured in support of the album throughout the end of 2009. However, longtime guitarist Tony Fredianelli was fired from the band in early 2010. According to an article which quotes a lengthy letter of his, Fredianelli \\"is suing the band for apparently being denied songwriting credits and benefits that he allegedly was entitled to.\\" On February 23, 2011, it was revealed that Fredianelli had filed a federal lawsuit against Jenkins for over 8 million in damages for not giving him credit for past work with the band. On October 21, 2013, a California jury awarded Fredianelli more than 438,000. According to an article by The Hollywood Reporter, the jury also asked to award royalties to the guitarist, but the judge had previously ruled against it. Irish musician Kryz Reid replaced Fredianelli on guitar, while Third Eye Blind continued to tour in support the album in 2010, most notably co-headlining The Bamboozle Roadshow between May and June 2010.  The band entered the studio as early as 2010 to start work on a fifth album. Around the timeframe of Ursa Major's release, the band spoke of an Ursa Minor album that would have contained songs that were recorded over Ursa Major's recording sessions but ultimately were left off the album. While the band spoke of releasing them in close succession to each other, in a similar fashion to a double album, Ursa Minor was not released. Question: Who are Red Star and Ursa Major?.

It can be found ubiquitously in numerous environments across the world, ranging from soil, water, and air to plant and animal tissue. It is a common saprotroph, meaning it feeds on dead organic material, and can be isolated from decaying plant matter, compost piles, silage, and sewage. Furthermore, Geotrichum candidum has also been found to be part of the natural microbial flora on human skin, the nasal cavity, the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract, and the genital area. It is used in various industrial applications, such as the fermentation of milk, cheese, and yoghurt, providing specific taste, texture, and appearance properties. Some examples of cheese made with Geotrichum candidum include Camembert, Saint-Nectaire, and Munster. The fungus not only contributes to the flavor profile of these products, but it can also help prevent the growth of undesired microorganisms due to its ability to compete for the same nutrients. Although Geotrichum candidum has beneficial applications, it can cause infections known as geotrichosis in immunocompromised individuals. These infections may manifest as pulmonary, oral, or skin infections and are typically treated with antifungal medications such as caspofungin, micafungin, or fluconazole. In summary, Geotrichum candidum is a fungus that can be found in a wide variety of environments worldwide, and it serves various roles, from participating in natural decomposition processes to lending unique characteristics in fermented dairy products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What opens the musical? Movie title: Evita Movie plot: A movie version of the highly successful musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice, \\"Evita\\" is the story of Argentina's most controversial First Lady, Eva Perón (1919 - 1952.) Her awe-inspiring funeral, attended by seven million devoted followers, is the opening to the musical, with the narrator then brining the story back by over a decade, explaining how a B-movie actress became the object of such controversial devotion.Trapped and bored with her family in rural Argentina in the late 1930s, Eva Duarte (Madonna) convinces a womanising musician (Jimmy Nail) to take her with him, back to the capital city, Buenos Aires, where she is determined to become a star. After being abandoned by the musician, Eva endures humiliations and poverty before using her feminine wiles to climb the ladder of the city's entertainment scene, eventually becoming a well-paid radio and film actress.At a benefit to aid the victims of an earthquake she meets Colonel Juan Perón (Jonathan Pryce), an ambitious politician with designs on the presidency. They fall in love and Eva encourages his plans to become dictator of the country, even using her star power to get him released from prison when his enemies order his arrest. On February 24 1946, Perón is elected president with a huge majority, but it quickly becomes apparent that its his glamorous wife who's the focus of the people's love.Affectionately nicknamed 'Evita' by her millions of devoted followers, Eva founds a huge charity to alleviate the suffering of the nation's poor. Throughout it all, the beautiful first lady is dressed in the latest high fashion and she is accused of being a distraction for the people, rather than an aid, by the embittered and cynical narrator (Antonio Banderas.)

Leaders of the organization that calls itself ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have launched a sophisticated propaganda campaign that turns the most basic principles of public relations on their head. No PR executive would advise a client to shout to the world details of his most gruesome acts and the extent of his cruelty, but that is precisely what ISIS is doing, and doing so very deliberately. The images of mass executions, of men digging their own graves before being shot in the back of the head, are splashed on the world's newspapers, television news and social media. The organization had it start in Iraq, when its videotaped beheadings of hostages and its bombings of civilians in the streets proved too much even for OPTIONS: - Frida Ghitis. - Ghitis. - ISIS. - Iraq. - Iraqis. - Islamic. - Islamic State of Iraq. - PR. - Syria. - al Qaeda.","output":"the al Qaeda leadership, which disowned the group. Since then, ISIS has grown in strength and scope, evolving into a formidable force that seeks to create its own state, or caliphate, spanning Iraq and Syria. In order to achieve its goals and gain support, the group employs a multifaceted PR strategy that is both terrifying and effective. Step 1: Establish social media presence To spread its message globally, ISIS has established a strong presence on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. By doing this, the group can quickly share information, graphic images, and videos of its actions, gaining both notoriety and, in some cases, sympathy from its followers. Step 2: Frame the narrative ISIS's propaganda campaign is carefully crafted to present a specific narrative, one that seeks to justify its actions as a response to Western aggression and as a means of upholding Islamic principles. By framing its actions this way, the group hopes to garner support from both local populations and those living in the West who may be disillusioned with their own governments. Step 3: Employ shock tactics The use of graphic images and videos of mass executions, beheadings, and other acts of extreme violence is a calculated shock tactic employed by ISIS. By sharing these images on social media and ensuring they are seen by a global audience, the group aims to instill fear, provoke outrage, and ultimately, force the hand of Western governments to respond. Step 4: Recruit new members The shocking nature of ISIS's propaganda also serves as a recruitment tool. Potential recruits, particularly those who may feel marginalized or alienated in their own societies, may be drawn to the group's message of power and vengeance. The images of violence and brutality may also attract those who wish to commit such acts and feel a sense of purpose in doing so. Step 5: Establish credibility and gain legitimacy By showcasing its military successes and territorial gains, ISIS seeks to establish credibility as a formidable and successful fighting force. This can attract financial support from those who believe the group can successfully challenge its enemies and fulfill its stated goal of establishing an Islamic caliphate. In conclusion, ISIS has turned traditional PR on its head, using shocking images and its strategic narrative to spread fear, gain support, and recruit new members. While this approach has undoubtedly been effective in terms of gaining global attention and spreading fear, it remains to be seen whether it can ultimately achieve the group's long-term goals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 3: Reach a conclusion based on the analysis - After analyzing the tone of the key phrases, I find that the review has both negative and positive tones. Some phrases show appreciation and approval, while others criticize the product's lack of innovation and unappealing atmosphere. Answer: The product review contains both negative and positive tones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. San Juan County has not supported a Democrat for president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. However the county is slightly more competitive at the state level due to its high Native American population, who lean Democrat, and the comparatively small Mormon population which leans Republican, as well its economic distress. Notably, San Juan voted for the Democratic candidates in the 1988 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, both of which Republicans won. The area also votes less Republican than the rest of Utah in national elections. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush won 60.02% in San Juan County versus 71.54% in the state as a whole.Federally mandated commissioner districts put many Navajo voters in one district.  The San Juan County Board of Commissioners has been majority white for many years. In 2016, a Federal District Court decision found voting districts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution.

What is the answer: What infectious disease, caused by a virus, is characterised by the eruption of successive crops of blisters?","output":"The infectious disease, caused by a virus, that is characterized by the eruption of successive crops of blisters is called Chickenpox. Chickenpox is a highly contagious illness, typically affecting children but can also occur in adults who have never contracted the disease before. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is a member of the herpesvirus family. Transmission of chickenpox occurs mainly through respiratory droplets from an infected person's coughs or sneezes, as well as direct contact with the fluid from the broken blisters. The disease usually starts with a mild fever, fatigue, and overall discomfort, followed by the signature itchy rash and fluid-filled blisters. The blisters can appear on any part of the body, including the face, limbs, and even in the mouth or on the genitals. The rash usually progresses through three stages: red bumps (papules), fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), and scabs. These stages can occur simultaneously on different parts of the body. The blisters may be painful or unbearably itchy, but it is crucial not to scratch them, as this can cause secondary bacterial infections or scarring. Once a person has been infected with chickenpox, they will develop immunity to the disease. However, the virus can remain dormant in the body and reactivate later in life, causing a painful condition called shingles. Shingles is characterized by a localized rash, often accompanied by nerve pain, and can occur in individuals who had chickenpox earlier in their life. For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that resolves on its own within one to two weeks. However, for some individuals, complications can occur, such as bacterial infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain), or, more rarely, Reye's syndrome (a severe and potentially life-threatening disorder associated with aspirin use during viral illnesses in children). Treatment for chickenpox primarily involves managing symptoms and providing relief through over-the-counter medications like antihistamines for itchiness, pain relievers for fever, and calamine lotion for the skin. Medical interventions may be necessary if complications are suspected or in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women, newborns, and individuals with compromised immune systems. To prevent chickenpox, a vaccine is available and is typically administered in a two-dose schedule during childhood. The vaccine provides long-lasting protection against the disease, with studies showing that 9 out of 10 people who receive both doses will be protected from chickenpox. Apart from vaccination, practicing good hygiene, such as frequent hand washing and avoiding contact with infected individuals, helps reduce the spread of the virus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

By 1763, the war in Central Europe was essentially a stalemate. Frederick had retaken most of Silesia and Saxony but not the latter's capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible. British subsidies had been stopped by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute, and the Russian Emperor had been overthrown by his wife, Catherine, who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, something which greatly affected its offensive power. Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray. By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, the county of Glatz, and southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the Treaty of Hubertusburg, ending the war in central Europe. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In 1763 what was the status of Austria?","output":"In 1763, the status of Austria was that of a war-weary and financially strained nation. Despite being one of the major powers in Europe, the country was facing significant challenges due to its participation in the ongoing war. Austria had been involved in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), primarily fighting against Prussia in a bid to regain the territories it had lost earlier, particularly Silesia, which was a valuable and prosperous region. Despite some military successes, Austria had not achieved a decisive victory over Prussia. They still held onto some territories such as Dresden, southeastern parts of Saxony, the county of Glatz, and southern Silesia, but the prospect of achieving a complete victory had become dim, especially after the withdrawal of Russia as their ally. The continual war efforts had taken a considerable toll on Austria's economy and resources. The nation was facing a severe financial crisis, which forced them to reduce the size of their army, thus affecting their offensive power. The Austrian administration was in disarray, and the capability to sustain the war had significantly diminished. In this context, Austria was actively seeking a way to end the conflict and secure favorable terms in the peace agreement. The Treaty of Hubertusburg, signed in 1763, eventually brought an end to the war in central Europe, but it did not result in major territorial gains for Austria. The treaty reaffirmed the status quo ante bellum (the situation before the war) with Silesia remaining under Prussian control. Thus, the status of Austria in 1763 can be described as a war-weary nation with financial difficulties, struggling administration, and reduced military power. The end of the Seven Years' War did not significantly alter the Austrian position in Europe but allowed the nation to focus on internal matters and restore stability in the aftermath of the conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Emma V. Lee married Robert Kelley in 1893. 2. In 1893, Emma V. Lee Robert Kelley married. Both sentences describe the same event—Emma V. Lee's marriage to Robert Kelley—and the same time frame, 1893. However, the sentence structures differ in terms of how the information is presented. In the first sentence, the subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence structure is utilized, beginning with Emma V. Lee and followed by the action (married) and the object (Robert Kelley). Lastly, the adverbial phrase \\"in 1893\\" provides the contextual information regarding the time of the event. This structure is the most common and easy to understand format in English. In the second sentence, the adverbial phrase \\"In 1893\\" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, emphasizing the time frame of the event. Following this, the subject (Emma V. Lee) and the object (Robert Kelley) are placed next to each other, while the verb (married) is placed at the end. This alternative structure still communicates the same message, but it might be considered slightly less conventional or typical. In summary, despite the contrasting sentence structures, both options ultimately convey the same information and can be considered paraphrased versions of each other.

Write highlights for this article: A copy of the letter which was sent be Dennis Giemsch seeking the addresses of  Jews in town. A neo-Nazi party has demanded to know where all Jews in the city of Dortmund live in a chilling echo of the build-up to the Holocaust. Die Rechte – The Right – wrote to mayor Ullrich Sierau through one of its councillors, Dennis Giemsch, seeking to know how many Jews live in and around the town, and their addresses. He asked that the information be supplied at a meeting of the council in the town hall on Wednesday night. The demand was refused and the letter has been passed to the interior ministry of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is looking at ways to legally ban the party. Full-time computer student Giemsch said the information was 'relevant for our political work'. Die Rechte is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young. The echoes of the terror that was unleashed on Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933 is not lost on Jews everywhere in Germany because the Holocaust of six million began with their registration, their numbers and where they lived. Die Rechte has been under the watchful eye of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the domestic intelligence service, since it was founded two years ago from the rump of an old neo-Nazi party. It is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young. In the party programme it swears to protect the 'German identity,' ban English words in advertising, 'protect' German culture, limit immigration, kick out foreigners convicted of crimes, support 'German' families to have 'German' children, widen police powers of arrest and protect animals. Most of their manifesto can be found in a similar form from that of Hitler's National Socialists back in the 1920's. Jewish people in Dortmund have reacted with alarm to the demand of the party to know where they reside and how many of them there are. One told a local newspaper: 'This is how it all began before. I don't think it will come to that again but such things evoke terrible memories. I hope this will be used by the authorities as a building block in future legislation to ban them.' The echoes of the terror that was unleashed on Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933 is not lost on Jews everywhere in Germany because the Holocaust of six million began with the registration of where they lived. Highlights:","output":"1. Neo-Nazi party Die Rechte demanded a list of Jewish residents and their addresses in Dortmund, Germany, from Mayor Ullrich Sierau in a move reminiscent of the Holocaust. 2. Die Rechte councilor Dennis Giemsch sought the information, claiming it was \\"relevant for their political work.\\" 3.

Jewish residents in Dortmund are alarmed by the party's demand; one hopes it leads to future legislation to ban the party as such actions evoke painful memories."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Povenmire was born in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, and grew up in the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh conceived the series Phineas and Ferb, based on their similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. Povenmire spent 14-16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing \\"It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on.\\" Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: \\"Usually that means they throw it in the trash later,\\" Povenmire recalled. Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.  Instead of a conventional script, the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved the show for a 26-episode season. Povenmire left Family Guy to create the series.  Povenmire and Marsh wanted to incorporate into Phineas and Ferb the kind of humor they had developed in their work on Rocko's Modern Life. They included action sequences and, with Disney's encouragement, featured musical numbers in every episode subsequent to \\"Flop Starz\\". Povenmire described the songs as his and Marsh's \\"jab at immortality\\", but the pair have earned two Emmy nominations for Phineas and Ferb songs to-date. A third Emmy nomination, for the episode \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" (2008), pitted the show against SpongeBob SquarePants, although neither nominee received the award due to a technicality. In 2010, Povenmire was nominated amongst several other Phineas and Ferb crew members for the Daytime Emmy Award for both \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\" and \\"Outstanding Original Song - Children's and Animation\\" for their work on the show, winning for \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\".  The distinctive style of the animation legend Tex Avery influenced the show's artistic look. Like Avery, Povermire employed geometric shapes to build both the characters and the background. The style developed almost accidentally, with Povenmire's first sketch of title character, Phineas Flynn, which he produced while eating dinner with his family in a restaurant in South Pasadena, California. He doodled a triangle-shaped child on the butcher paper covering the table. He was so taken with sketch he tore it out, kept it, and used it as the prototype for Phineas and as the stylistic blueprint for the entire show.

He says that \\"recycling reduces the resources needed to make something\\" and \\"recycling saves resources and reduces pollution\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Options: + fossil fuels + pollution + Energy. + less water + power + energy + Heat energy + deforestation","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"recycling reduces what when making something?\\" would be a combination of options: 1. Energy (also referred to as \\"power\\") 2. Pollution 3. Fossil fuels 4. Deforestation To elaborate further, recycling can reduce the demand for new raw materials, thereby limiting deforestation by decreasing the need to extract timber and other resources from the forests. By reducing the extraction of raw materials, recycling helps to preserve natural habitats and maintain overall environmental balance. In addition, recycling can save energy. When manufacturing companies utilize recycled materials instead of utilizing virgin raw materials, the energy used during the production process is often decreased. This is because recycling can minimize the need to refine and process new resources, which are often energy-intensive procedures. As a result, power and energy consumption are significantly reduced. Moreover, through the process of recycling, we conserve fossil fuels as well. Since fewer raw materials need to be extracted, transported, and processed, there is a decrease in the utilization of fossil fuels required to power machinery and vehicles involved in these activities. Lastly, recycling helps reduce pollution, which can be in the form of air, soil, and water pollution. Reducing the need to manufacture new materials from virgin sources can lessen the amount of pollutants and greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Furthermore, recycling can reduce pollution by diverting waste away from landfills and incineration facilities, which can also cause pollution. Overall, the recycling process plays a crucial role in preserving natural resources and reducing environmental impact for a more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It is common for older people to forget things. Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds.

And I was wondering How would Jordan feel afterwards?","output":"Jordan's feelings after sleeping through their alarm and running late for school may range from a mix of emotions such as anxiety, frustration, embarrassment, and guilt. These emotions could be experienced in varying degrees depending on Jordan's personality, experiences, and expectations. Here is a more detailed description of how these emotions might manifest and influence Jordan's actions and thoughts: 1. Anxiety: Jordan could experience a surge of anxiety as they realize they have overslept and are running late for school. This emotion could cause Jordan to feel panicky and overwhelmed. Consequently, this anxiety might lead them to rush through their morning routine, possibly skipping breakfast or leaving essential belongings behind. Jordan may also worry about how their tardiness may impact their academic performance, such as missing important information during a class or incurring penalties for late attendance. 2. Frustration: Realizing they have slept through their alarm, Jordan might feel a sense of frustration with themselves, as well as with external factors that may have contributed to this situation. For example, they could be frustrated that their alarm was not loud enough or at their decision to stay up late the night before. This frustration might cause Jordan to feel irritable and on edge, potentially leading to conflicts with family members or friends during this chaotic morning. 3. Embarrassment: Jordan might feel embarrassed about their late arrival, especially if tardiness is not a common occurrence for them. The anticipation of arriving at school and facing their classmates or teachers could make Jordan feel self-conscious and concerned about their reputation. This embarrassment may lead them to take actions to minimize or mask their lateness, such as attempting to sneak into class, making up excuses for their tardiness, or avoiding eye contact with peers and teachers. 4. Guilt: It's not uncommon for individuals to feel guilty about letting themselves or others down, and Jordan may experience this emotion upon being late for school. They might feel guilty for wasting their parent's time if they have to drop them off at school or for letting their friends down by not being there on time. Jordan might also feel guilty if their tardiness affects the group's progress in a collaborative project or if their teacher has to take time to catch them up on the material. This guilt may lead them to apologize profusely, make efforts to compensate for the lost time, or try to improve their tardiness in the future. Overall, Jordan's emotions upon being late for school could significantly impact their actions, thoughts, and interactions with others. It is essential for Jordan to recognize and process these feelings healthily, communicate their emotions to others when appropriate, and put effective strategies in place to prevent future incidents of sleeping through their alarm. This could involve establishing a more regular sleep routine, finding more effective methods to wake up, and having contingency plans in place for those days when things don't go as planned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Fearless villagers in South Africa have been filmed wrestling with deadly Nile crocodiles in a bid to catch as many as possible after 15,000 escaped from a farm. The reptiles, which can grow to 16ft long, were accidentally freed after heavy rain made the nearby Limpopo river flood last weekend. Bosses at the Rakwena Crocodile Farm in the north-east of  the country opened the gates to the animals’ pens to release the rising waters – inadvertently letting their entire stock out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Brave: Three men pin down a crocodile so they can tie its claws and jaws with plastic ties. Caught: At least 2,000 of the crocodiles are believed to have been recaptured since they escaped last weekend. Danger: Nile crocodiles are meat eaters and have been known to attack humans. The reptiles have since been spotted. all over the local area – including on a school sports field – and. wildlife experts urged local people to avoid the animals and stay. indoors. As the flood waters fell, many have been found trapped in the branches of trees. The Nile crocodile is the largest crocodile in Africa and the second-largest in the world after the saltwater crocodile. Prey consists of gazelles, antelope, waterbuck, sitatunga, lechwe, wildebeest, zebras, warthogs, giraffes and Cape buffalos. They are also known to eat domestic animals such chickens, goats, sheep and cattle and are known to attack humans. Males typically measure between 3.5 and 5 metres but very old, mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more. They are found in Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Egypt, Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, South Africa, Malawi, Sudan, South Sudan, Botswana, and Cameroon. Isolated populations also exist in Madagascar and in Senegal. But as this incredible footage shows, many residents showed no fear in tackling the crocodiles themselves. At least 2,000 had been caught by Friday according to South Africa's Afrikaans language Beeld newspaper. Police have been leading the hunt which has mainly taken place at night because their eyes reflect in the torchlight and they are easier to find. The video shows locals pinning the crocodiles to the ground and then handcuffing them with plastic ties. Earlier this week, the crocodile farm's boss Zane Langman told the Beeld that he has been recapturing the animals whenever he is alerted to one. He said he had already caught 'a few. thousand' in the dense bush and orange groves next to his farm, but he. told the newspaper that 'more than half' of his reptiles are still. missing. Commercial. crocodile farms breed the animals for their skin, which is used to make. crocodile leather for items such as belts, shoes and handbags. There is also a small market for. crocodile meat, but most often the dead reptile's is fed to other crocs. as the species is cannibalistic. The. commercial crocodile farming industry is small, but growing, in South. Africa, where there are around 60 farms containing a total of around. 500,000 animals. Because the quality of the skin is. paramount, some farms keep each crocodile in its own, battery-style pen. so that its hide is not scratched or otherwise damaged by other animals. However this has lead to allegations of animal cruelty and most farms keep the animals in communal pens. Nile. Crocodiles are meat eating and can grow to up to five metres long. They. can run at up to eight miles an hour and swim at up to 22 mph. They. are extremely dangerous to humans. Their preferred method of killing is. to grab an animal in their enormous jaws then drag it, alive,. underwater to drown it. Blunder: The crocodiles were accidentally released after farmers tried to release excess flood water from their pens. An estimated 15,000 crocodiles have escaped from the Rakmena Farm in South Africa where they are bred for their skin which is used in handbags, belts and shoes.

If you have a room that has long walls paired with shorter walls, creating a narrow space, it's best to create your focal point for the room on the long wall. If you try to place it on the narrower wall, the room will look even bigger than it already does. Available choices:  --For example, if you have a small room, such as a bedroom, use your walls as a focal point. If your bedroom has an entrance into the center, use that to make your room look larger.  --A focal point can be an entertainment center or it can be a large piece like a painting. Basically, it's what the attention is focused on in your space.  --Use a piece of furniture to create a focal point on either side. For instance, a simple couch looks great on this wall, and a large, deep rug looks great on your dining table, for instance.  --Try to create focal points that create at least 1 vertical , 1 horizontal, and 1 vertical vision of the room. Fix your focal points to one piece of the wall.","output":"Start by assessing the space and determining the look you want to achieve. Consider the style and color scheme of the rest of your home to ensure that your hallway or long wall decoration complements the overall design. Once you have a vision, follow these steps to decorate your long wall or hallway: 1. Plan your layout: Sketch the wall or hallway on paper with measurements and create a rough layout of where your focal point and other decor pieces will go. Consider symmetry and balance when planning the layout. 2. Choose the artwork or decorative elements: Select one or more large pieces of artwork, a mirror, or a patterned wallpaper to serve as a main focal point. If you prefer a gallery wall, use a mix of framed photos, paintings, prints, and other wall decor items in different sizes and shapes, keeping in mind the overall color scheme. 3. Add lighting: Proper lighting can enhance the ambiance and make the space more inviting. Track lighting, wall sconces, or floor lamps can all work well to illuminate and showcase your focal point and other decor elements. 4. Incorporate storage: If your hallway or long wall is part of a functional space like a living area or a bedroom, consider adding shelves or built-in storage to keep the area organized and visually appealing. 5. Mix and match textures and materials: Combine various textures and materials such as wood, metal, fabric, and glass to add interest and depth to your space. 6. Hang your decor: Start with your focal point and work outwards, hanging your artwork or decorative pieces on the wall. Use appropriate hardware and tools for a secure installation, and be sure to hang items at eye level or slightly lower to create a more intimate feel. 7. Create a sense of flow: Use accent colors and repeating patterns in your decor to guide the eye down the hall or along the long wall, creating a sense of movement and flow. 8. Incorporate various heights: To create visual interest, consider installing floating shelves or wall-mounted storage at different heights. This will help to break up the long expanse of the wall while also providing functionality. 9. Accessorize: Complete your design with accessories that complement your focal point and overall style. Examples include decorative objects, small sculptures, or potted plants on shelves, or a unique runner rug in the hallway. 10. Reevaluate and adjust: Once you have decorated your long wall or hallway, step back and assess the overall look. Make adjustments as needed, whether it's moving a piece here or there, adding more elements, or removing some that aren't working. By following these steps, your long wall or hallway will become a visually engaging and functional space that adds character to your home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, \\"Gill\\" being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called \\"Great Gilwell\\" and \\"Little Gilwell\\". The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining 5.6 hectares (14 acres) property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that Leonard Tresilian wanted to leave his estate to?

Given the below context:  Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune.  It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440.  Furthermore,  when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s.  The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages. In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily.  Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...

It is also located near Croatia some further south. Trieste is located at the head of the Gulf of Trieste and throughout history it has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of Latin, Slavic, and Germanic cultures. In 2009, it had a population of about 205,000 and it is the capital of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Province of Trieste.  - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - Winnetou is a fictional Native American hero of several novels written in German by Karl May (18421912), one of the best-selling German writers of all time with about 200 million copies worldwide, including the \\"Winnetou\\"-trilogy.  - Friuli-Venezia Giulia is one of the 20 regions of Italy, and one of five autonomous regions with special statute.

It comprises the major part of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia, i.e. the administrative provinces of Udine, Pordenone, and Gorizia, excluding Trieste.  - Emona or Aemona (short for ) was a Roman castrum, settled by colonists from the northern part of Roman Italy. Emona itself was the region's easternmost city, although it was assumed formerly that it was part of the Pannonia or Illyricum, but archaeological findings from 2008 proved otherwise. It was located in the area where the navigable Ljubljanica came closest to Castle Hill. The river played an important role as a transport route for the trade between the city and the rest of Roman empire. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana.  - The Gulf of Trieste (, ) is a very shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea.

News article: Celebrity Justice Cuts Both Ways for Paris Hilton “She’s a pawn in a turf fight right now,” said Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School Los Angeles. “It backfired against her because she’s a celebrity. She got a harsher sentence because she was a celebrity. And then when her lawyer found a way out of jail, there was too much public attention for it to sit well with the court.” The struggle between the judge and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, which runs the jail, incited indignation far beyond the attention normally paid to a minor criminal matter. Judicial and police officials here said they were inundated with calls from outraged residents and curious news media outlets from around the country and beyond. The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, decried Ms. Hilton’s release as an example of “double standards,” saying consideration was given to a pampered rich girl that would never have been accorded an average inmate. Even the presidential candidate John Edwards found himself drawn into the debate. When asked about Ms. Hilton’s release on Thursday he said, “Without regard to Paris Hilton, we have two Americas and I think what’s important is, it’s obvious that the problem exists.” California has been struggling to comply with a federal order to ease crowding in its jails and prisons, and Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County has carried out a program of early release. But that has frustrated prosecutors who believe that early release undermines their efforts to punish those found to have broken the law. At a news conference on Friday, Sheriff Baca said: “The special treatment appears to be her celebrity status. She got more time in jail.” Under the normal terms of the early release program, he said, Ms. Hilton would not have served “any time in our jail.” The city attorney whose office prosecuted Ms. Hilton’s case, Rocky Delgadillo, said preferential treatment had led to her being sent home with an ankle bracelet. In the original order sentencing Ms. Hilton to jail, the judge had stated that Ms. Hilton would not be allowed a work furlough, work release or an electronic monitoring device in lieu of jail time. “We cannot tolerate a two-tiered jail system where the rich and powerful receive special treatment,” Mr. Delgadillo said after learning of the release. In a news conference on Friday, Mr. Baca said Ms. Hilton “had a serious medical condition,” though he declined to say what it was. In a scene that seemed a parody of O. J. Simpson’s low-speed chase more than a decade ago, news cameras on Friday followed a police cruiser containing a sobbing Ms. Hilton as it drove slowly down the Los Angeles highway to Superior Court from her home. The issue became nonstop fodder for channels like CNN and Fox News, as legal experts debated how rare the decision was to release her, and whether doing so neutralized, negated or otherwise neutered the judge’s original order. Amid the debate over serious questions of equal justice under the law came speculation over the nature of Ms. Hilton’s “medical situation,” which Mr. Baca cited as the reason for her release. On television, commentators questioned whether she was a suicide risk or if she was eating properly in jail. Judge Sauer had ordered the hearing for 9 a.m. When Ms. Hilton did not appear, apparently believing that she could participate by telephone, he sent sheriff’s deputies to escort her from her home. When she arrived and the hearing began, the judge said he had received a call on Wednesday from an undersheriff informing him that Ms. Hilton had a medical condition and that the sheriff’s office would submit papers to the judge to consider releasing her early. The judge said the papers describing a “psychological” problem had not arrived, and he interrupted Friday’s court session every few minutes to state the time and note that the papers had still not shown up. In ordering her return to jail, Judge Sauer said there were adequate medical facilities within the system to deal with Ms. Hilton’s problems. Ms. Hilton was not the only high-profile defendant whose celebrity prompted a raised eyebrow from a judge this week. Also on Friday, the judge who sentenced I. Lewis Libby Jr. to prison this week issued an order dripping with sarcasm after receiving a supporting brief from a dozen prominent legal scholars, including Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard and Robert H. Bork, the former Supreme Court nominee. The judge, Reggie B. Walton of Federal District Court in Washington, said he would be pleased to see similar efforts for defendants less famous than Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. “The court trusts,” Judge Walton wrote, in a footnote longer than the order itself, that the brief for Mr. Libby “is a reflection of these eminent academics’ willingness in the future to step up to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this court and throughout the courts of our nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions.” “The court,” he added, “will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries.” Adam Liptak and Maria Newman contributed reporting from New York, and Ana Facio Contreras from Los Angeles.

When she was let out early, a lot of people were upset and thought it wasn't fair because regular people don't get that kind of special treatment. Eventually, the judge ordered her to go back to jail, saying that the jail could take care of her medical problem.

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about  Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.

It’s important that both boys and girls see menstruation as a normal and healthy process, not something that people should be embarrassed about or feel guilt or shame from. Avoid derogatory language that makes menstruation sound negative, dirty, or unpleasant.  Boys may think that the bleeding may be painful, like from a cut. Assure them that the bleeding does not hurt and is not painful. You can explain that some women experience cramps, which are muscle cramps in the body, but the pain does not come from bleeding. When talking about menstruation, communicate that menstruation is a healthy and normal part of growing up for girls. Just like boys develop facial hair and their voices change, girls start to physically change, too. Say, “Before her blood comes for the first time, a girl does not have access to her power to create a baby. When it does come, it signals her that her body is ready to have a baby. It’s exciting to have this ability. Now, whether she is ready for a baby is something else!” For young children, you can talk about how the body cleans itself. Say, “Girls’ bodies are different than boys’ bodies. A major part of the body is cleaning from the inside out, like when you go pee or poo, or when you blow your nose. When girls get older, their body starts cleaning in a new way. Sometimes girls use special things to help their bodies be clean.” Girls have different body parts than boys. You may want to define terms like “uterus,” “vagina,” or “pregnancy.” Say, “These are all body parts that girls have that boys do not have. Uterus is a big word that means where a baby grows. Vagina is a word that tells us where babies leave the body, or where blood leaves if there is no baby. Pregnancy is what happens when a baby is growing inside a woman.” You can say, “Women and girls have different body parts than boys. This is because women can grow babies in their bodies and men cannot. These are the things that women have that men don’t.” With older boys, you may want to introduce common terminology related to women’s cycles. Clearly explain any newly introduced terminology. Some things you may want to explain include the words “period,” “menstruation,” or “cycle.” You may also want to include slang terms, like “time of the month,” “Aunt Flo,” or “moon/moon cycle,” as these terms may come up at school or within the boy’s social network. Keep your answers simple. If explaining the word period, say, “A period is something at the end of a sentence. But it can also mean  the time each month when a woman’s body cleans itself from the inside out. It’s a word that sums up a process that happens in a woman’s body.” Clearly communicate that there is nothing “wrong” with menstruation blood. It is not embarrassing, gross, or shameful. It doesn’t make a girl “dirty.” If your boys know that a girl is menstruating, tell them to treat her with respect and not to tease her or make her feel bad.  Say, “If you notice a girl has her period or has blood on her clothes, it’s important to treat her with respect. It’s not okay to tease her or make fun of her. Don’t say anything hurtful to her or anyone else. Remember that it’s normal to have a period.” Make sure they know that menstruation is totally normal and healthy.

Article: Many health experts in the US and Australia recommend avoiding this method, since harmful bacteria on the shell could get in contact with the egg. The risk of contamination is much lower in the EU, which has a very effective anti-salmonella program. If you're concerned about the risk, use one of the other methods instead. Cooking yolks or whites until firm makes them much safer. If you plan to serve the eggs runny or raw, consider another separation method. Room temperature eggs have runnier whites, which can make this method messy and difficult. Work with eggs straight from the fridge instead. This is where you want to make the cleanest crack you can manage. The key with this method is to crack the egg evenly, so you can easily transfer the yolk between the two halves. Tap the center of the egg gently against a hard object, so a crack forms across about half of the egg. The edge of a bowl is a good surface for getting two equal halves. The edge can also break off shell fragments into your white, though, so a flat counter might be better if your eggs have thin shells. Hold the egg over a bowl in both hands with the crack facing upward and the wide end tilted down. Slowly pull apart the two halves with your thumbs, until the egg breaks into two halves. Because the egg is tilted, the yolk should fall into the lower half. \\"Pour\\" the intact yolk back and forth between the two halves of the shell. Repeat this about three times, while the white drips over the side of the shell and into the bowl below. Drop the yolk in another bowl once there are only tiny bits of white stuck to it. If you have more eggs to separate, consider using a third bowl, so a messy crack doesn't drop shell shards or broken yolk into your whites. Separate each egg over this third bowl, then empty the bowl into the other whites bowl before you move on to the next.

This bank was like a giant money box, where people could keep their money safe, borrow money, and get help making more money. Now, you see, making and managing people's money is not an easy job. Sometimes a bank has to figure out that it needs to become even better at helping its customers. So one day, Deutsche Bank decided they wanted to make some changes in the way they did things. Deutsche Bank realized they wanted to focus on two very important things: wealth management and investment banking.  Wealth management is like being a money doctor. It helps people take care of their money, make it grow, and plan for their future, like building a house or going to school. Investment banking is like being a money scientist. It helps businesses grow by finding creative ways to get them the money they need and giving them advice. To make these changes, Deutsche Bank made a plan. They wanted to be one of the top money doctors and money scientists in the world. So they started working very hard, like you do when you practice your sports or hobbies, to become better and better at wealth management and investment banking every day. They also wanted to make sure that when they helped people, they did it in a way that was good for everybody. So they made a promise to themselves, that when they helped people, they would also think about things like taking care of the earth, being kind to animals, and helping people who don't have much money. And so, little by little, Deutsche Bank started to change. They got really focused on becoming a great money doctor and money scientist. They even hired some new people who were very good at these jobs and let some others go who were not as good. Now, because they were so focused, people started to notice. The customers of Deutsche Bank were happy with the changes and trust them even more to help them with their money. The people in the bank were excited because they were becoming better at their jobs. And the big boss of the bank, called the CEO, was very proud of all the hard work everyone was doing. And so, as Deutsche Bank keeps working hard, they hope to continue to get better and better at helping people with their money in a way that is good for everyone.

Review: How can we believe any of the material we read in this book when the author does not even know the proper name for the PERSIAN Gulf in the map of Mesopotamia!!!! Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review in question does convey a negative sentiment towards the book. The reviewer expresses their frustration and disbelief regarding the accuracy and credibility of the content in the book, primarily due to the author's alleged mistake in the naming of the Persian Gulf in a map of Mesopotamia. As a result, the reviewer casts doubt on the overall reliability of the book and implies that this error may be indicative of deeper inaccuracies or flaws in the research and presentation of information. To analyze the review further, two primary areas of concern can be identified that contribute to the negative sentiment: 1. Doubt on the reliability of the content: The reviewer raises the question, \\"How can we believe any of the material we read in this book when the author does not even know the proper name for the PERSIAN Gulf in the map of Mesopotamia?\\" This rhetorical question suggests the reader's disappointment and skepticism regarding the book's content. The presence of errors, such as the incorrect naming of geographical entities, could diminish the reader's trust in the information and, consequently, the quality of the book. 2. The implication that this error may signify larger problems: By pointing out a specific error in the book, the reviewer implies that there may be other mistakes as well. This creates an overarching sense of doubt and suspicion about the research and presentation of information throughout the book. Readers are left with the impression that if the author failed to correctly convey fundamental details, it is possible that other points or statements may be similarly false or misleading. In conclusion, the product review exhibits a negative sentiment by expressing concerns about the credibility and reliability of the book. The reviewer's critique stems from their frustration with a particular error, which subsequently casts doubt on the entirety of the book. This skepticism undermines the overall quality and trustworthiness of the information contained within its pages, resulting in a negative opinion of the book by the reviewer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, we will subtract 159 from both sides. That looks like this: 6 * f + 159 - 159 = 147 - 159 6 * f = -12 Now we need to find out what 'f' is. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 6: (6 * f) / 6 = -12 / 6 f = -2 So, the value of 'f' is -2.

Step 1: Sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant - This is the initial step where the plant captures energy from sunlight which is required for photosynthesis. Step 2: The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water - Light energy is used to break water molecules into its components - oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. This process is called photolysis. Step 3: The water breaks into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons - As a result of photolysis, water molecules break down into oxygen gas, which is released as a byproduct, and hydrogen ions and electrons which will be used in the next steps of the process. Step 4: Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH - The hydrogen ions and energized electrons from the previous step are used to convert NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) into NADPH (reduced form of NADP+). NADPH stores energy and will be used in the next steps of photosynthesis. Final step: Production of glucose and oxygen through the Calvin cycle - The generated NADPH, along with another molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) produced in the photosynthesis process, are used in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon dioxide into glucose. The glucose can then be used by the plant for energy and growth, while oxygen is released as a byproduct.

When you are in a dark environment like a movie theater, your eyes need to adjust to the low light conditions. This happens through a few key steps: Step 1: Pupil dilation To adapt to the low light levels, the pupils of your eyes dilate (widen) to allow more light to enter. This helps you see better in the dark. Step 2: Activation of rods The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions. During the time spent in the dark theater, rods become more active, further enhancing your ability to see in the darkness. Step 3: Regeneration of rhodopsin Rhodopsin, also known as visual purple, is a light-sensitive pigment found in the rods. In dark conditions, rhodopsin levels increase, aiding in night vision. When you exit the movie theater into bright sunlight, your eyes need to readjust to the higher light levels. This process also involves several steps: Step 1: Pupil constriction As the intense light hits your eyes, the pupils constrict (narrow) to limit the amount of light entering the eyes. This constriction happens quickly, but it takes a few moments to reach its peak. Step 2: Deactivation of rods The cones, which are responsible for color vision and work best in bright light, become more active as they are better suited to detect higher light levels. The rods, being more sensitive to dim light, decrease their activity. Step 3: Rhodopsin breakdown The bright light causes the rhodopsin in the rods to break down, reducing their sensitivity to light. This results in the feeling of being momentarily \\"blinded\\" or overwhelmed by the brightness. Step 4: Adjustment period As your eyes adapt to the bright light, the temporary sensation of being blinded subsides. The adjustment period varies depending on the individual and the difference in light levels, but it usually takes a few minutes for your eyes to fully adapt. In conclusion, when you exit a dark film theater, the world appears too bright initially because your eyes have become more sensitive to darkness and need to readjust to the sudden increase in light levels through a series of physiological changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not a little bigger. Not even a lot bigger. They have _ gigantically, scientists now conclude. Their new finding lends support for something known as \\"Cope's rule.\\" It holds that animals tend to evolve into species that are much larger than their distant ancestors. This hypothesis takes its name from the 19thcentury paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. While studying fossils , he was the first to notice this trend. Noel Heim is a paleontologist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. He also is a co-author of the new study. His team compared the body size of animals between the Cambrian Period and modern times. This was a span of 542 million years. The animals studied included species from more than 17,000 genera. They ranged from ancient trilobites, plesiosaurs (extinct reptiles with a long neck and flippers) and many less familiar creatures to today's whales and clams. Ocean animals today are an average of 150 times larger than they were during the Cambrian, Heim's group reports. The smallest animals alive today -- tiny crustaceans called ostracods -- are only about one-tenth the size of the Cambrian's tiniest animals. But today's largest ocean animals -- whales -- are more than 100,000 times bigger than the biggest in the Cambrian. \\"Classes of animals that were already big ... tended to live longer,\\" Heim says. They also tended to change more than classes of animals that were small did. The size gains in ocean animals are much larger than would be expected by chance, saysJonathan Payne. He's a co-author who also works at Stanford. The scientists don't know what drives the trend. One possibility is an arms race between predators and prey. The idea here is that larger animals are less likely to become some other animals' meal. Another possibility has to do with oxygen. Land animals evolved from species that started in the ocean. Some of these land animals eventually returned to the ocean. And they kept the ability to breathe... The ocean animals' change in size   _  .

Michael Pearson, who will stay as chief executive until a replacement is found, said Valeant was still a \\"strong and resilient company\\". However, Valeant's former finance chief has declined to resign as a director. Shares in Valeant jumped 11% in early trading after heavy losses last week, driven by fears of a default. Valeant chairman Robert Ingram said: \\"While the past few months have been difficult, Valeant has a collection of leading brands, valuable franchises and great people, and I am confident that the company will be able to rebuild its reputation and thrive under new leadership.\\" Activist investor Bill Ackman, who has a 9% stake in Valeant, has been appointed to the board. Former chief financial officer Howard Schiller declined a request to step down from the board, meaning Katharine Stevenson voluntarily resigned instead to make space for Mr Ackman, the company said. Valeant added that Mr Schiller had contributed to the \\"mis-statement\\" of company results in 2014 and early 2015. However, Mr Schiller said: \\"As a result of the fact that I did not engage in any improper conduct regarding this proposed restatement [of results], I have respectfully declined the request from the company's board to resign from the board.\\" Bill Ackman, 48, the newest member of Valeant's board, is one of the world's most well-known activist hedge fund managers, and has been an outspoken supporter throughout the company's turmoil. Mr Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square owns 9% of Valeant shares, making it the company's second largest investor. Last week, when the possibility that Valeant would default on its bonds was raised, Mr Ackman wasted no time reassuring Pershing Square investors that the drug company was still a good bet. In a letter he wrote that it was \\"highly likely\\" that banks would grant Valeant a waiver for missing the deadline to file financial information. Without that waiver Valeant could have entered a default on its loans. \\"[Mr Ackman] has put his credibility on the line and it could make or break him,\\" Aswath Damodaran a professor of finance at New York University, told the BBC. \\"The markets are going to decide [Valeant's] value- his words could initially stem the problem, but they don't mean as much now,\\" said Mr Damodaran. Mr Ackman's support for Valeant is not new. He teamed up with the drug maker in 2014 to make a bid for Botox-maker Allergan. In a controversial move Mr Ackman bought shares in both companies in an attempt to arrange the tie-up. He agreed to pay Valeant 15% of any profit made if Allergan was bought by a third party- which it eventually was. Allergan's board rejected several offers by Valeant and was eventually purchased by Actavis for 66bn (Â£46bn). Mr Ackman is no stranger to public corporate disputes. He has spent 1bn betting against nutritional supplement brand Herbalife, and encouraged regulators to investigate its board. Mr Ackman has not reserved his insults for the company. He verbally spared with activist investors Carl Icahn and Daniel Lobe over Herbalife. During a televised interview on CNBC Mr Ackman said Mr Icahn was being dishonest with investors, while Mr Icahn accused Mr Ackman of being a \\"cry-baby in the schoolyard\\".  The two had a public reconciliation in 2014. Valeant shares more than halved last week after it lowered revenue forecasts and said that delays in filing its annual results could result in a notice of default. The firm is also facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its relationship with pharmacy Philidor, and an investigation by the US Congress into its drug pricing.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Hine ( or Hinay or \`\` Hineih '' ) Mah Tov is a Jewish hymn traditionally sung at Shabbat feasts .  - Sabbath is a day set aside for rest and worship. According to the Sabbath is commanded by God to be kept as a holy day of rest, as God rested from creation. It is observed differently among the Abrahamic religions and informs a similar occasion in several other practices. Although many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition of: \\"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy\\".  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - The Exodus (from Greek  \\"exodos\\", \\"going out\\") is the founding, or etiological, myth of Israel; its message is that the Israelites were delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belong to him through the Mosaic covenant. It tells of the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt following the death of Joseph, their departure under the leadership of Moses, the revelations at Sinai (including the Ten Commandments), and their wanderings in the wilderness up to the borders of Canaan. The exodus story is told in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, and their overall intent was to demonstrate God's actions in history, to recall Israel's bondage and salvation, and to demonstrate the fulfillment of Israel's covenant.   - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Shabbat (\\"rest\\" or \\"cessation\\") or Shabbos or the Sabbath is Judaism's day of rest and seventh day of the week, on which religious Jews and certain Christians (such as Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh Day Baptists) remember the Biblical creation of the heavens and the earth in six days and the Exodus of the Hebrews, and look forward to a future Messianic Age. Shabbat observance entails refraining from work activities, often with great rigor, and engaging in restful activities to honor the day. Judaism's traditional position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution, though some suggest other origins. Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the Abrahamic and many other religions.  - The Messianic Age is a theological term referring to a future time of universal peace and brotherhood on the earth, without crime, war and poverty. Many Abrahamic religions believe that there will be such an age; some refer to it as the consummate \\"kingdom of God\\", \\"paradise\\", Peaceable Kingdom, or the \\"world to come\\".

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - A reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is a heat engine (usually, although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.  - A V engine, or Vee engine is a common configuration for an internal combustion engine. The cylinders and pistons are aligned, in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in a \\"V\\" when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. The Vee configuration generally reduces the overall engine length, height and weight compared to an equivalent inline configuration.  - A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft. Most banks are set at a right angle (90°) to each other, some at a narrower angle, with 45°, 60°, and 72° most common.  - A W8 engine is an eight - cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . The W8 can be imagined as flat plane crank V8 engine combining two narrow - angle ( 15 degree ) VR4 engine blocks , mounted juxtaposed at 72 degrees to each other and coupled to one crankshaft . Nearly square external dimensions mean the large eight - cylinder engine will fit in the space typically taken by a V6 engine .  - Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles.  - A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2.0 L to 4.3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine. Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. It is becoming more common as the space allowed for engines in modern cars is reduced at the same time as power requirements increase, and has largely replaced the inline 6, which is nearly twice as long - too long to fit in many modern engine compartments - and the V8, which is larger, more expensive, and has poorer fuel economy. The V6 engine has become widely adopted for medium-sized cars, often as an optional engine where an inline 4 is standard, or as a standard engine where a V8 is a higher-cost performance option.  - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons.  - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach.  - A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. (Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the long axis of the vehicle, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front.)  - In an internal combustion engine of the reciprocating type, the crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft. The enclosure forms the largest cavity in the engine and is located below the cylinder(s), which in a multicylinder engine is usually integrated into one or several cylinder blocks. Crankcases have often been discrete parts, but more often they are integral with the cylinder bank(s), forming an engine block. Nevertheless, the area around the crankshaft is still usually called the crankcase. Crankcases and other basic engine structural components (e.g., cylinders, cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and integrated combinations thereof) are typically made of cast iron or cast aluminium via sand casting. Today the foundry processes are usually highly automated, with a few skilled workers to manage the casting of thousands of parts.   - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards.  - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion.  - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

Process: - The nuclei of some atoms have too few or too many neutrons - The atoms become unstable - The atoms split - In alpha decay, two protons and two neutrons are released from the atom - In beta decay, a neutron changes into a proton and an electron - The proton joins the nucleus of the atom - The electron is released -   Question: suppose the atoms are more stable happens, how will it affect LESS radioactive decay occurring.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, we'll first summarize the information given and then analyze the influence of more stable atoms on radioactive decay and the second effect mentioned (beta decay). 1. Some atoms have unstable nuclei due to an improper number of neutrons. 2. These unstable atoms can undergo radioactive decay through processes like alpha decay and beta decay. 3. Alpha decay involves the release of two protons and two neutrons from the atom. 4. Beta decay involves a neutron changing into a proton and an electron, where the proton joins the nucleus of the atom and the electron is released. Now, let's examine the situation where the atoms become more stable. If the atoms are more stable, this means that their nuclei are less likely to decay due to having more stable neutron to proton ratios. Therefore, this would result in less radioactive decay occurring.  As for the second effect mentioned (beta decay), since the atoms are more stable, there will be fewer instances where a neutron needs to change into a proton and emit an electron for the atom's nucleus to become stable. This would lead to less beta decay occurring as well. The answer to this question is: less."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The wild animals appear to be following much larger birds. But those aren't birds at all. They are three-wheeled aircraft called trikes , and the pilots flying them are wearing white helmets and white gowns. That plan might sound like a stupid idea, but it's not. The pilots are from an organization called Operation Migration. They are helping the whooping cranes learn to migrate, or move from one area to another when the seasons change. The cranes are endangered. In 1941,the species had dwindled to roughly 20 birds because of hunting and habitat loss. US wildlife officials counted 149 whooping cranes in November 1995,the most since the American government began taking censuses in the 1930s.Today,about 380 remain. In the fall, whooping cranes are supposed to migrate south. However, many of them don't know how. \\"With so few birds left, young whooping cranes typically don't have parents around to teach them,\\" explains pilot Joe Duff. That's where the trikes come in. Each October, pilots dress up as whooping cranes and take to the skies in Wisconsin. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are big whooping cranes. It takes about three months to reach south--with plenty of rest stops on the way. The pilots lead the cranes to refuges, or protected areas, in Florida.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Vanessa Allen. PUBLISHED:. 18:44 EST, 22 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:29 EST, 23 December 2013. Nigella Lawson was effectively put on trial without a lawyer, her furious brother claims today. The TV cook was falsely portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed' and 'addled by narcotics', Dominic Lawson says. The court did not let her present evidence to defend herself, treating her instead as an 'object to be paraded and tormented during ten hours of cross-examination as a key prosecution witness. Bond: Nigella Lawson and brother Dominic Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court, west London. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Lawson likens her treatment to the burning of heretics in the Spanish Inquisition and warns that the 'vicious' treatment of prosecution witnesses is a threat to British justice because it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence. He says his sister was 'heroic' in the face of such treatment but that the circus surrounding the fraud trial of her former aides has left the public under the impression she was the defendant. Yesterday defence minister Anna Soubry told the BBC it was 'disgraceful' that the allegations and the collapse of Miss Lawson's marriage to advertising guru Charles Saatchi were played out in a courtroom. 'Nigella Lawson quite properly complains that she feels that she's on trial,' said the Tory MP. 'I just find it utterly appalling.' Lawyers for Miss Lawson's former housekeepers Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo questioned the 53-year-old about her drug use in an attempt to show she sanctioned the sisters' £685,000 spending in return for their silence. Miss Lawson admitted taking cocaine seven times. She admitted she had also smoked cannabis during the collapse of her 'doomed' marriage but insisted she was not a long-term or habitual user. She said she had been drug free since leaving the relationship. Sisters Elisabetta (left) and Francesca Grillo, the two former personal assistants cleared of defrauding Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi. Giving evidence at Isleworth Crown Court in West London, Miss Lawson said she had faced 'a long summer of bullying and abuse' which she said had been 'dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi's reputation and savaging mine'. As her two former housekeepers were acquitted of a £685,000 card fraud, Miss Lawson said she had been 'vilified' by the court process despite having done all she could to alert the Crown Prosecution Service to a 'sustained background campaign deliberately designed to destroy my reputation'. She said she had been made to feel she was on trial without any legal protection or representation, adding: 'I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.' 'On trial': Nigella Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in London where she gave evidence in the trial of two former personal assistants who worked for her and Charles Saatchi. Charles Saatchi being protected by security at Isleworth Crown Court. Her brother says she was given no advice or support by the CPS and – as a witness and not a defendant – was not entitled to a lawyer to represent her. Mr Lawson writes: 'I would say that her conduct in the witness box was heroic. It was especially heroic given the way what was meant to be a formal examination of transactions by two employees had turned into a media circus – or rather an auto da fe – with this prosecution witness as the object to be paraded and tormented.' He adds: 'The process of justice is seriously damaged if the system makes testifying intolerable for prosecution witnesses.' Mr Lawson's warning follows several high-profile trials which have raised questions about the treatment of prosecution witnesses, including violinist Frances Andrade who committed suicide after giving evidence against a teacher who sexually abused her as a child. The parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler also faced detailed questions about their private lives from a lawyer representing her killer Levi Bellfield during his trial. Miss Soubry said it was 'disgraceful' that the collapse of a marriage should have played out in a courtroom and took aim at Charles Saatchi, saying the saga began with the 'Throttlegate' photographs of him grabbing Miss Lawson by the throat at a Mayfair restaurant. 'The whole thing is disgraceful. I think we're beginning to lose the plot in this country,' she said. 'This started with an unfortunate divorce. It started with a photograph of her being assaulted by her husband. So out in public was played what should have been a very private and very distressing moment. 'As a result of that they became divorced. These criminal proceedings had already begun, back in 2012.' Highlights:","output":"1. Nigella Lawson's brother, Dominic Lawson, claims she was effectively put on trial without a lawyer. 2. The TV cook was falsely portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed' and 'addled by narcotics'. 3. Dominic Lawson likens her treatment to the Spanish Inquisition, and warns it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence. 4. Nigella Lawson complains she felt like she was on trial, despite being a key prosecution witness. 5. Defence minister Anna Soubry calls the situation 'disgraceful' and 'utterly appalling'. 6. Nigella Lawson admitted taking cocaine seven times and smoking cannabis during her marriage but denied being a long-term or habitual user. 7. Two former housekeepers, Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, were acquitted of £685,000 card fraud."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash.  Who is causing more marine pollution? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Hilda is causing more marine pollution.  Hilda disposes of her excess fertilizer into the river that is connected to the Malegese Ocean. When excess fertilizers are dumped into a body of water, they can cause nutrient pollution. These nutrients can create an excess of algae that sucks up oxygen in the water and creates dead zones where marine life cannot survive, harming aquatic habitats and ecosystems. The result is marine pollution. On the other hand, Luke, who owns a farm near the Dundrin Ocean, does not dispose of his garbage in the ocean or rivers. Instead, he stores excess fertilizer for future use or disposes of his trash properly. This suggests that he is not contributing to marine pollution to the same degree as Hilda.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Crusader army under Goffredo is laying siege to Jerusalem, where the Saracen king Argante is confined with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings of the coming victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms that she will be Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from the sky in a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' only chance of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this. The scene changes to a garden, with fountains and birds, where Rinaldo and Almirena are celebrating their love. They are interrupted as Armida appears, and wrests Almirena from Rinaldo's embrace. Rinaldo draws his sword to defend his lover, but a black cloud descends to envelop Armida and Almirena, and they are borne away. Rinaldo mourns the loss of his loved one.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Complete the next sentence: How to efficiently heat a room  Replace old or damaged weatherstripping on the doors and windows.  Buy a new roll of weatherstripping at your local hardware store. Install it in the gaps around any doors and windows in the room to prevent heat from escaping and cold air from coming in. Pick from: (I) Just pull off the old or damaged weatherstripping and apply the new roll using the adhesive that comes on the strips. Raise the door thresholds if they're adjustable.; (II) Continue to install weatherstripping in the spaces under window coverings, to help prevent heat from escaping. Replace any parts that are missing or forgotten during the heating process.; (III) Install heaters on the ceiling and along the walls. Heat can flow from deeper and colder places, so buy a power source for heating a room without heaters before you place it in and on your windows.; (IV) Leave it on during one to two days of heating, then take it off and replace it in the morning when the temperature is between 70 and 80 degrees fahrenheit (16-27 degrees celsius). Use rubber gaskets around windows and windows when installing weatherstripping.; The answer is:","output":"(I) Just pull off the old or damaged weatherstripping and apply the new roll using the adhesive that comes on the strips. Raise the door thresholds if they're adjustable. To efficiently heat a room, it's crucial to maintain the existing warmth and prevent any further heat loss. One essential way to do this is by replacing the old or damaged weatherstripping around your doors and windows. You can easily buy a new roll of weatherstripping at your local hardware store and install it yourself. Here's how: - First, pull off the old or damaged weatherstripping. Over time, weatherstripping can become worn down or damaged, reducing its efficiency in keeping out drafts. Therefore, removal of the old material is a necessary first step.    - Next, apply the new weatherstripping. Most types of weatherstripping come with adhesive on one side, which makes the application process easy. Simply cut a piece of weatherstripping to match the length of the gap, remove the backing paper from the adhesive side, and apply it to the gap. Press firmly to make sure the weatherstripping adheres properly. - It would also be helpful to raise the door thresholds if they're adjustable. Gaps under doors can act as conduits for cold air to seep into your room and for warm air to escape. By raising the thresholds under your doors, you can minimize these drafts, contributing to a warmer room. Completing these simple steps can help to efficiently heat a room by minimizing heat loss. Remember, every little step that reduces drafts and insulates your room can make a big difference to the overall warmth of the room and the efficiency of your heating system.  Contrary to option (III), installing heaters on the ceiling and along the walls as a primary method of heating a room isn't usually the most efficient solution. While heaters can help to directly add heat to a room, they can be costly to run and don't address the root issue of heat loss through gaps and poor insulation.  Moreover, options (II) and (IV) also might not be the best added steps in this context. Under window coverings are typically not the main culprit for heat loss in a room unless they are poorly fitted, so focusing on that might divert the attention from effective solutions. Also, using heating equipment intermittently or applying weatherstripping when the temperature is specific is not as effective as using these properly on a regular basis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Read the context carefully to determine the location of Capriole Goat Cheese. Justification: To properly draw a hypothesis from the context, we must first understand the details and facts presented in the text. In this case, the context provides information about the location of Capriole Goat Cheese, stating that it is in Greenville, Indiana. Step 2: Determine whether the context supports the hypothesis.

Question: Does Obree ever hold a world record? Movie title: The Flying Scotsman Movie plot: The film starts with Graeme Obree (Miller), who suffers from crippling bipolar disorder, cycling into a wood where he prepares to hang himself. A flashback to Obree's (Sean Brown) childhood depicts him being physically attacked at school by other pupils, leaving severe psychological scars. One day Obree is given a bicycle by his parents and we see Obree evading the bullies on his bike. The adult Obree is married with a child. While competing in local races, he runs a failing cycle shop and has to supplement his income as a bicycle courier. Baxter (Cox), a boatyard owner who is (unbeknownst to Obree) a minister, befriends the atheist Obree. Obree decides to try and beat the hour record. He has neither the funding nor the quality of bicycle required. Determined to succeed, he constructs \\"Old Faithful\\", a revolutionary bicycle designed by Obree for maximum efficiency, made up from scrap metal and components from a washing machine. With help from his friend and manager Malky McGovern (Boyd), Obree plans to break the world record in Norway. His first attempt is a failure, but he tries again the following morning and succeeds. His victory is short-lived, and his record is broken by Chris Boardman (Adrian Grove (credited as Adrian Smith)) a week later. The Union Cycliste Internationale changes the rules to discourage Obree from using his experimental bicycle. Obree is severely depressed the night following his record-making ride. This is exacerbated when Boardman breaks the record. When Obree is confronted in a pub by the four bullies who had victimised him years earlier at school, he becomes completely withdrawn and rarely leaves his house. Baxter attempts to counsel him, but Obree feels betrayed when he discovers that Baxter is the pastor of a local church. He recovers enough to compete in the Individual Pursuit World Championship in 1993, in which he uses his bicycle design again. The UCI officials begin rigorously enforcing the new ruling, penalizing him for riding in the stance that his bicycle design is... Answer:","output":"Yes, Graeme Obree, the protagonist in the movie \\"The Flying Scotsman,\\" does hold world records during his cycling career. The film is based on the true story of Obree, a Scottish cyclist known for his innovative approach to the sport and his struggles with bipolar disorder. In the movie, Obree constructs a revolutionary bicycle called \\"Old Faithful\\" using scrap metal and components from a washing machine. With this bicycle, he attempts to break the hour record, which is a measure of how far a cyclist can travel in one hour. His first attempt in Norway is unsuccessful, but he manages to break the record the following morning. However, Chris Boardman, another cyclist, breaks Obree's record just a week later. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) changes the rules to discourage Obree from using his experimental bicycle, but despite these setbacks and his struggles with mental health, Obree is able to compete in the Individual Pursuit World Championship in 1993. He continues to use his innovative bicycle design and riding stance, which leads the UCI to rigorously enforce new rulings against him. In real life, Graeme Obree set two world hour records. His first record-setting achievement came in 1993 when he covered 51.596 kilometers (32.034 miles). He later broke his own record in 1994 with a distance of 52.713 kilometers (32.753 miles). Obree also became the World Champion in the 4,000-meter individual pursuit in both 1993 and 1995. Despite the challenges and adversities he faced throughout his career, Obree's remarkable accomplishments, perseverance, and innovation cemented his place in cycling history. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal for \\"The Flying Scotsman,\\" it's essential to consider the inspiring true story of Graeme Obree, his unique approach to cycling, and his incredible achievements in the face of numerous obstacles. The movie presents an intriguing and powerful story that showcases the resilience and determination of an exceptional athlete."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lionel Messi achieved yet another milestone in his glittering career on Saturday night when he surpassed 400 career goals for club and country. The Argentinian wizard scored twice in Barcelona's 6-0 thumping of Granada to take his overall goal tally to 401 - comprised of 359 for his club and 42 for his country. 'I never imagined I could achieve anything like this in my career,' the humble Messi wrote on his Facebook page afterwards. 'I'll continue working hard to reach more targets.' Lionel Messi scored his 400th career goal in Barcelona's 6-0 win over Granada at the weekend and now has his sights set on breaking more records in both La Liga and the Champions League Messi has 67 in the competition, four shy of OPTIONS: - Argentina. - Argentinian. - Barcelona. - Champions League. - Cristiano Ronaldo. - Facebook. - Granada. - La Liga. - Lionel Messi. - Messi. - Raul.","output":"Messi has 67 in the competition, four shy of Raul's record. The remarkable achievement adds to Messi's ever-growing legacy as one of football's all-time greats. He is now within striking distance of Raul's record of 71 goals in the Champions League, a milestone that many believe the Barcelona star will soon surpass. Despite fierce competition from Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently stands at 68 Champions League goals, Messi remains determined to break more records both in La Liga and Europe's most prestigious club competition. Rivalry between these two footballing giants has intensified over the years, with each of them pushing the other to greater heights as they battle for both individual and team honors. The Argentinian superstar's impressive goal-scoring record extends to various domestic and international tournaments. In La Liga alone, Messi has netted 271 times, making him the current all-time top scorer of the Spanish league. This record was previously held by Telmo Zara, whose 251 goals stood atop the La Liga scoring charts for more than 60 years. Messi's achievements on the international stage are equally noteworthy. With 42 goals to his name, he holds the record as Argentina's top goalscorer, a title he claimed in 2016 after netting a stunning free-kick against the United States during the Copa America Centenario. The four-time Ballon d'Or winner was instrumental in leading his national team to three consecutive finals between 2014 and 2016, including the World Cup and two Copa America tournaments. Despite facing criticism from some quarters for his inability to win a major international title with Argentina, Messi's seemingly limitless talent and genuine passion for the game continue to endear him to fans across the globe. His humble response to reaching the 400 goal milestone, shared via Facebook, is a testament to his grounded personality and focus on striving for even greater accomplishments in the future. It remains to be seen how many more records Messi will break in his extraordinary career. However, one thing is for certain: the Argentinian maestro will continue to dazzle football lovers around the world with his mesmerizing skills and unmatched goal-scoring prowess. With his sights now firmly set on surpassing Raul's Champions League record and extending his already-impressive La Liga tally, Lionel Messi's journey towards cementing his place as one of the greatest footballers in history is far from over."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Three Colors: Blue Movie plot: Julie (Juliette Binoche), wife of the famous composer Patrice de Courcy, must cope with the death of her husband and daughter in an automobile accident she herself survives. While recovering in hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdose, but cannot swallow the pills. After being released from hospital, Julie, who it is suggested wrote (or helped to write) much of her husband's famous pieces, destroys what is left behind of them. Calling Olivier (BenoÃ®t RÃ©gent), an unmarried collaborator of her husband's who has always admired her, she spends a night with him and says goodbye. Emptying the family house and putting it up for sale, she takes an apartment in Paris without telling anyone, her only memento being a mobile of blue beads that the viewer assumes belonged to her daughter. Julie disassociates herself from all past memories and distances herself from former friendships, even being no longer recognised by her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She also reclaims and destroys the unfinished score for her late husband's last commissioned workâa piece celebrating European unity following the end of the Cold War. Snatches of its music, however, haunt her throughout the film. Despite her desire to live anonymously and alone, life in Paris forces Julie to confront elements of her past that she would rather not face. A boy who saw the accident seeks her out to give her a Christian cross he found by the car and to repeat her husband's last words, the punchline of an indelicate joke. She reluctantly befriends an exotic dancer named Lucille (Charlotte VÃ©ry) who is having an affair with one of the neighbors and helps her when she needs moral support. Then on TV she sees Olivier in an interview, announcing that he will try to complete Patrice's commission and showing pictures of Patrice with an attractive young woman.

Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward \\"Ted,\\" was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from tuberculosis. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as \\"A.G. Bell\\") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at University College London, Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.

The thalidomide disaster of the early 1960s left thousands of babies with deformed limbs because their mothers innocently took a sleeping pill thought to be safe during pregnancy, In its well-publicized wake, countless pregnant women avoided all medications, fearing that any drug they took could jeopardize their babies’ development. I was terrified in December 1968 when, during the first weeks of my pregnancy, I developed double pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics and codeine. Before swallowing a single dose, I called my obstetrician, who told me to take what was prescribed, “reassuring” me that if I died of pneumonia I wouldn’t have a baby at all. In the decades that followed, pregnancy-related hazards were linked to many medicinal substances: prescription and over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as well as abused drugs and even some vitamins. Now, however, the latest findings about drug use during pregnancy have ignited new concerns among experts who monitor the effects of medications on the developing fetus and pregnancy itself. During the last 30 years, use of prescription drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy, when fetal organs are forming, has grown by more than 60 percent. About 90 percent of pregnant women take at least one medication, and 70 percent take at least one prescription drug, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the late 1970s, the proportion of pregnant women taking four or more medications has more than doubled. Nearly one woman in 10 takes an herbal remedy during the first trimester. A growing number of pregnant women, naïvely assuming safety, self-medicate with over-the-counter drugs that were once sold only by prescription. While many commonly taken medications are considered safe for unborn babies, the Food and Drug Administration estimates that 10 percent or more of birth defects result from medications taken during pregnancy. “We seem to have forgotten as a society that drugs pose risks,” Dr. Allen A. Mitchell, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at Boston University Schools of Public Health and Medicine, said in an interview. “Many over-the-counter drugs were grandfathered in with no studies of their possible effects during pregnancy.” Medical progress has contributed to the rising use of medications during pregnancy, Dr. Mitchell said. Various conditions, like depression, are now recognized as diseases that warrant treatment; drugs have been developed to treat conditions for which no treatment was previously available, and some conditions, like Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, have become more prevalent. Now a new concern has surfaced: Bypassing their doctors, more and more women are using the Internet to determine whether the medication they are taking or are about to take is safe for an unborn baby. A study, published online last month in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, of so-called “safe lists for medications in pregnancy” found at 25 Web sites revealed glaring inconsistencies and sometimes false reassurances or alarms based on “inadequate evidence.” The report was prepared by Cheryl S. Broussard of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with co-authors from Emory, Georgia State University, the University of British Columbia and the Food and Drug Administration. “Among medications approved for use in the U.S.A. from 2000 to 2010, over 79% had no published human data on which to assess teratogenic risk (potential to cause birth defects), and 98% had insufficient published data to characterize such risk,” the authors wrote. But that did not stop the 25 Web sites from characterizing 245 medications as “safe” for use by pregnant women, which “might encourage use of medications during pregnancy even when they are not necessary,” the authors suggested. Furthermore, the information found online was sometimes contradictory. “Twenty-two of the products listed as safe by one or more sites were stated not to be safe by one or more of the other sites,” the study found. The question of timing was often ignored. A drug that could interfere with fetal organ development might be safe to take later in pregnancy. Or one (for example, ibuprofen) that is safe early in pregnancy could become a hazard later if it raises the risk of excessive bleeding or premature delivery. Fewer than half the sites advised taking medication only when necessary, and only 13 sites encouraged pregnant women to consult their doctors before stopping or starting a medication. Doctors, too, are often poorly informed about pregnancy-related hazards of various medications, the authors noted. One woman I know was advised to wean off an antidepressant before she became pregnant, but another was told to continue taking the same drug throughout her pregnancy. “In many instances the best bet is for mom to stay on her medication,” said Dr. Siobhan M. Dolan, an obstetrician and geneticist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She said that if a woman is depressed during pregnancy, her risk of postpartum depression is greater and she may have difficulty bonding with her baby. Dr. Dolan, who is author, with Alice Lesch Kelly, of the March of Dimes’ newest book, “Healthy Mom Healthy Baby,” emphasized the importance of weighing benefits and risks in deciding whether to take medication during pregnancy and which drugs to take. “In anticipation of pregnancy, a woman taking more than one drug to treat her condition should try to get down to a single agent,” Dr. Dolan said in an interview. “Of the various medications available to treat a condition, is there a best choice — one least likely to cause a problem for either the baby or the mother?” She cautioned against sharing medications prescribed for someone else and assuming that a remedy labeled “natural” or “herbal” is safe. Virtually none have been tested for safety in pregnancy. Among medications a woman should be certain to avoid, in some cases starting three months before becoming pregnant, are isotretinoin (Accutane and others) for acne; valproic acid for seizure disorders; lithium for bipolar disorder; tetracycline for infections, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists for hypertension, Dr. Dolan said. “Many medications that are not recommended during pregnancy can be replaced with low-risk alternatives,” she wrote. Dr. Broussard, who did the “safe lists” study, said in an interview, “We’ve heard about women seeing medications on these lists and deciding on their own that it’s O.K. to take them. “Women who are pregnant or even thinking about getting pregnant should talk directly to their doctors before taking anything. They should be sure they’re taking only what’s necessary for their health condition.” A reliable online resource for both women and their doctors, Dr. Mitchell said, are fact sheets prepared by OTIS, the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists, which are continually updated as new facts become available: http://www.otispregnancy.org.

Background: Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. Context: In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life.  Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe.  Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

Article: My grandmother Adele loved culture and was generous with its gifts. When I was a child, she took me to museums, restaurants, dances. She showered me with gifts from her travels around the world. But I can only remember her giving me one book--a book that, to this day, I have not read. She presented me with her own favorite childhood book: Hans Brinker. My grandmother was happy to share this book with me. She even decorated the title page with her proud writing. I tried to read it. I adored reading, and would dive into a new pile of books from the library all at once. But something about Hans Brinker just wouldn't let me in. The story was set in Holland, a long time ago. It felt dull and unfamiliar--even though I was a fan of classics of other times and places. I simply read the first pages over and over. I could not progress. Standing on a bookshelf in our living room, the book was like something I avoided. It scolded me for not being interested, for not trying hard enough, for disappointing my grandmother. The book started to fit in, almost forgotten, until Adele asked. Had I read it? Did I like it? Always determined, she wanted to know the answer. I would make some kind of excuse, feel bad, and open it again, hoping for a new reaction. _ . Years passed and finally Adele and I both accepted that I would never read Hans Brinker. Eventually I cleared the book from the shelf. The Hans Brinker experience led me to set a rule that I've lived by ever since: Do not ask about a book given as a gift. Don't ask, despite your desire to discuss it to grow closer. The desire for such connection is what gives book-giving with special meaning--and increases the owner's possibility to be a letdown. Guilt is basically the same as for all gifts, though. If the giver doesn't have the pleasure of seeing or hearing about the gift being enjoyed, and asks whether it is, then the owner--unless she can truthfully say \\"yes\\"--either has to admit to not liking the present, or else lie on the spot. Neither is pleasant. So, don't ask. Question: What does the author think about the book his grandmother gave him? Answer: Select from: A. Boring.. B. Interesting.. C. Puzzling.. D.

Pebbles, which are small stones or rock fragments, can naturally be found in or near these settings as they are common elements in the outdoor environment. Due to the regular foot traffic in a playground, it is likely that these pebbles may have been walked on by people visiting the area. Other options, like lakes and ponds, can also have pebbles, but they might not have the same level of consistent human interaction as a playground, making it a more sensible answer.

This ecclesiastical headgear is used to signify their religious rank within the church hierarchy. Zucchettos come in different colors according to the rank of the person wearing it: 1. The Pope: The Pope wears a white zucchetto, which is made of watered silk, as a symbol of purity and to emphasize his higher position in the Church. The use of a white zucchetto is unique to the Pope and cannot be worn by any other clergy member. 2. Cardinals: Members of the College of Cardinals, often referred to as \\"princes of the church,\\" wear a scarlet or red zucchetto. This color symbolizes their willingness to shed their blood in defense of the faith. 3. Bishops: Bishops, including archbishops and patriarchs, wear a purple or amaranth zucchetto. The purple color signifies their royalty in the spiritual realm, as they are considered the successors of the Apostles. 4. Priests, deacons, and other lower-ranking clergy: These clergy members wear a black zucchetto. Black symbolizes their humility and simplicity, as they act as servants to their congregation and the Church as a whole. In some cases, an abbot or a religious superior may also wear a zucchetto, usually in the same color as the rest of their religious order's attire. It is important to note that the zucchetto is not a required vestment but rather a symbol of the bearer's ecclesiastical rank, and its use is subject to the appropriate liturgical protocols and traditions within the Roman Catholic Church."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. negative; B. positive; What would be an example of an A. review?","output":"A negative review is a critique or evaluation of a product, service, entertainment, or any subject matter that highlights its shortcomings, flaws, or unsatisfactory elements. A negative review can help inform potential consumers or users about possible issues they may encounter and give businesses the opportunity to improve on the aspects that provoke customer dissatisfaction or frustration.  An example of a negative review for a hotel or accommodation might look like the following: Title: Terrible Experience at XYZ Hotel Rating: 1/5 Stayed: June 11-15, 2022 I regret to say that my recent stay at XYZ Hotel was nothing short of a disaster, and I strongly discourage others from booking a room here. My dissatisfaction with the hotel can be summarized across three main points: cleanliness, service, and noise pollution. On arrival, I found that my assigned room was far from clean. I discovered several apparent stains on the bedsheets, as well as a considerable amount of dust on top of the nightstand and wall lamp. Furthermore, the bathroom appeared to have gone uncleaned, with soap scum on the sink, hairs in the shower, and a generally unpleasant smell permeating the entire room.  Regarding the service at XYZ Hotel, I encountered multiple issues that only served to worsen my experience. When I went to the front desk to report the unclean state of my room, I was met with an unapologetic and seemingly disinterested receptionist who simply offered to send housekeeping later. After waiting for hours, no one ever arrived to address the issue. I also had a negative encounter with the bartender at the hotel's bar, who was impolite and inattentive. The noise pollution at the hotel was insufferable. Starting early in the morning and lasting well into the night, there was heavy construction work occurring just outside the hotel's premises. This constant disruption made it nearly impossible to get a good night's sleep, which was highly frustrating as I had book the hotel on a business trip. Although I understand that the hotel cannot control all external factors, the management should have made an effort to inform guests and possibly offer temporary solutions such as noise-canceling headphones, earplugs, or even discounted rates. Overall, my stay at XYZ Hotel was an overwhelmingly negative experience, leaving me with no choice but to advise others against staying here. The combination of poor cleanliness, inadequate service, and unacceptable noise levels created an environment that made it difficult to work, rest, or enjoy my trip in any way. I will not be returning to this establishment, and I encourage others to consider alternative accommodations to avoid a similarly disappointing experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Oprah, if you're reading this, for goodness sake return this woman's calls.

Track down the ton of letters asking -- pleading -- for your help starting a Winfrey-style talk show in Africa. Because this isn't just another eager fan. Her name is Mosunmola Abudu, and in the last eight years she's done it -- and then some. With no TV experience whatsoever, Abudu has become the \\"Oprah of Africa\\" -- it's impossible not to read an interview with the glamorous 49-year-old without the moniker cropping up. And with good reason. \\"When I started my journey into television, there was nothing that I didn't try, to reach this woman,\\" says Abudu about her early attempts to contact Ms","output":"Winfrey. \\"I was relentless in my pursuit, believing that she could see the potential in my vision for a talk show in Africa.

Her tenacity and ambition have proven that she didn't need anyone's validation to achieve her dreams. So, Oprah, if you ever find those faxes and letters, know that you missed out on something extraordinary – but perhaps it was for the best. After all, it's not every day that two powerhouse women, each creating their own talk show legacy, can proudly stand side by side – one in America, the other in Africa – and demonstrate that dreams do come true, no matter where you are or who you are."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Это было не так плохо, как в советское время, когда мы поддерживали страны третьего мира, как против Америки, так и против Европы, но все же такая позиция не отвечала долгосрочным интересам России. Translate this to English?","output":"The statement translates to English as: \\"It was not as bad as in the Soviet times when we supported third-world countries against both America and Europe, but still, such a position did not correspond to the long-term interests of Russia.\\" Delving deeper into the context of this statement, it appears to be a commentary on USSR's foreign policy. During the Soviet era, the USSR was known for its aid and support to third-world countries as part of their strategic geopolitical calculations during the Cold War. The primary goal was to extend their sphere of influence around the globe and counter the Western powers – predominantly the United States and Europe. The aid and support to the third-world countries was not entirely altruistic. It was often an exertion of soft power - a form of sway, which not only involved the provision of financial aid, but also support in the form of military training, provision of arms and ammunition, technical knowledge, personnel training, infrastructure development, among others. These were strategies applied not just by the Soviet Union, but also by Western powers to assert geopolitical influence on a global scale. The second part of the statement regarding how this approach didn't align with Russia's long-term interests might refer to the aftermath of Soviet collapse. The financial burden of supporting other economies, maintaining military presence in various parts of the world, along with the internal economic difficulties, contributed to the collapse of the Soviet economy. With the fall of the USSR and the emergence of the Russian Federation, policies and strategies underwent considerable amendments to navigate the newly globalized world. This change in geopolitical environment required a strategic approach that prioritized Russia’s national interests above the ideologically driven internationalism of Soviet times."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: The thing issues twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States is one of various whats? Context: As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.","output":"The thing that issues twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States is one of various student-run media outlets at Notre Dame University."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are today's equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century. Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don't happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of \\"life after death\\" or \\"god\\" or \\"sin\\" or \\"the devil\\" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. Sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. However, The 700 Club is in a class by itself. They are truly a cult. While I believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. The 700 Club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of 'cult' but due to The 700 Club's vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law in this country.

In less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks.

Samantha seems to always have a liquor bottle in their hand while Patricia didn't, so","output":"it was clear that their approaches to handling life's challenges and social situations were quite different. While Samantha found solace and camaraderie in her liquid courage, Patricia preferred to face everything head-on without any artificial enhancements. Samantha's reliance on alcohol dates back to her college days when she experienced considerable pressure from friends and classmates to unwind, relax, and fit in. It started innocently enough with her joining a group of friends at parties and social gatherings where alcohol flowed freely. Unfortunately, over time, Samantha began to develop a dependence on it, causing her to turn to her trusted companion - the liquor bottle - whenever she needed a boost of confidence or a way to numb the pain. On the other hand, Patricia had faced her fair share of adversity over the years, but she managed to cope without the use of alcohol as a crutch. She was raised in a strict household with parents who encouraged open communication and healthy coping strategies to deal with stress or setbacks. In addition to that, her personal experiences with friends who struggled with addiction had instilled in her a sense of responsibility and caution when it came to substance use. This led Patricia to take stock of her own mental and emotional well-being more seriously, and she cultivated healthier habits such as regular exercise, journaling, and meditation to navigate through life's turbulence. As time passed, the contrast between both women became more and more apparent. Samantha's reliance on alcohol interfered with her ability to maintain stable relationships and make sound decisions. She often found herself stumbling and grappling with the consequences, struggling to keep her head above water. Her circle of friends began to diminish, and she became increasingly isolated. Patricia, on the other hand, took pride in her steadfast resilience in the face of life's obstacles. Her approach enabled her to have a level head and clear mind, resulting in being able to form deep connections with those around her. People were drawn to her unwavering strength and genuine compassion, and she ultimately became a beacon of hope and stability for those who needed guidance. In spite of their differences, Samantha and Patricia managed to maintain a sense of mutual respect for each other, as they recognized the contrasting ways each chose to cope with life's struggles. They would meet occasionally to catch up with one another, and their conversations would often revolve around their shared experiences and the ways they attempted to navigate the complexities of life. Though Patricia was aware of Samantha's dependence on alcohol, she never judged her harshly. Instead, she remained a supportive friend, respecting Samantha's autonomy to make her own choices. However, with time and growing concern for her friend's well-being, Patricia began to gently suggest alternative coping mechanisms to Samantha, sharing her own experiences with healthy habits and stress management techniques. Although resistant to these suggestions at first, Samantha gradually took note of her friend's unwavering commitment to her own personal growth and began to question her own dependency on the all-too-familiar liquor bottle. As they continued to learn and grow together, Samantha and Patricia's friendship transcended their differences, and they emerged as a testament to the power of personal resilience and the infinite capacity for change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes. The door opened. \\"Dingo.\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" Her job as Rick's assistant was to take care of his place while he was out being a rock star. She made sure all his bills were paid, his animals were fed, and that the subsequent fallout from any parties she might have in his absence didn't leave any lasting damage. She was pretty by most standards, gorgeous by others. Short with a tight schoolgirl body and raven hair that teased her avian shoulders. But by whatever standard, her beauty was like a rare and exotic bird she kept caged behind the bars of her perfect teeth. As soon as she opened her mouth it flew away.

The premise states, \\"I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done with the photograph.\\" This statement communicates only one specific action — the speaker asked the young man about what he did with the photograph. There's no mention of asking about the content of the photograph (what was on it) or any previous query about the location of the photograph (where it is). The hypothesis suggested, which states that the speaker asked about the content of the photograph after asking about its location, introduces new information that is not present or implied in the original premise. For this hypothesis to be confirmed as true, the premise would need to include instances of the speaker asking about the whereabouts of the photograph and then following up with a question about its content. Therefore, based on the available premise, the specified hypothesis cannot be confirmed as true. It's important to remember when reading, interpreting, or analyzing texts that a hypothesis needs to be directly supported by the given information in the premise to be classified as accurate or true.

This inheritance turns out to be Blackwood Hall - a grand, centuries-old mansion steeped in history and surrounded by luscious gardens. Helen, who never knew of her great-aunt's existence, is intrigued and excited by this mysterious family connection and decides to visit the mansion.  Helen's closest friends, Laura and Daniel, join her as they dream about the potential of renovating and reopening Blackwood Hall as a luxury boutique hotel. Upon arrival, they are met with an eerie feeling. The housekeeper, Mrs. Jenkins, who has worked for the family for decades, informs them of the dark past and series of unexplained events that have befallen the previous inhabitants of Blackwood Hall. Act 2: Ignoring the ominous warnings, Helen and her friends decide to spend their first night in the mansion. As they explore the halls, discussing their plans and dreams for the estate, they uncover a hidden room - a study that belonged to Helen's great-aunt. Inside, they find a collection of books and journals about the supernatural and a letter addressed to Helen from her great-aunt, warning her about a malevolent force residing within the mansion. During dinner, Helen and her friends share stories of hauntings, laughing off the warnings they discovered earlier. As night falls, each member experiences unsettling, and terrifying occurrences that can only be specters of the supernatural. Helen, unfazed by these encounters, confronts the force in the study. The ghostly presence reveals itself to be of her great-aunt, warning Helen that she is in grave danger. Act 3: Frightened by the supernatural encounters, Laura and Daniel make the decision to leave Blackwood Hall. Helen, however, feels compelled to stay and uncover the truth behind her great-aunt's message and the mansion's hauntings. As she investigates, she learns of a series of tragic deaths that occurred within the mansion's walls over the centuries. Convinced that her great-aunt's spirit is trying to protect her, Helen searches for a way to break the curse and free her family from the malevolent force. Unfortunately, she becomes consumed by the need to solve the mystery, unaware that her own life hangs in balance. On their last night at the mansion, Helen stays up late, completely absorbed in researching the supernatural events. Suddenly, a powerful storm rolls in and surrounds the mansion with lightning and darkness, as Helen finally uncovers the truth. The malevolent presence is, in fact, a vengeful spirit that feeds on human suffering – particularly that of Helen’s bloodline. Act 4: The storm reaches its peak as Helen races to free her great-aunt's spirit and break the curse of the mansion once and for all. However, in a cruel twist of fate, Helen's efforts only serve to make the vengeful spirit stronger. With a heavy heart, Helen's great-aunt appears once more, revealing that the only way to break the curse is for Helen to willingly sacrifice herself, freeing her family from the torment of the vengeful spirit forever. As the spirit's power intensifies, Helen makes her decision. Throwing open the doors of Blackwood Hall, she allows the storm to envelop her and take her life in a brilliant display of light and darkness. As she breathes her last breath, Helen's great-aunt watches over her, ensuring that her sacrifice is not in vain. With Helen's death, the curse is broken, and the vengeful spirit is vanquished. Blackwood Hall remains abandoned, a monument to Helen's sacrifice. Years later, as Laura and Daniel revisit the estate, they still remember and cherish the love and bravery of their friend Helen who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect them and generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At first, people played the music only at family parties. But it became more popular later. In the 1920s,people played country songs on the radio, and they made them into records. When people in the countryside moved to towns and cities to look for work, they took their music with them. Country music continued to change and became popular across America.

It was clear that the letter was too big to fit into the small, standard-sized envelope we were given. I considered my options and justified my decision step by step. Step 1: Assessing the situation The letter was simply too large and thick to be forced into the small envelope, so I knew I couldn't proceed without making a change.  Step 2: Identify possible solutions I thought about two possible solutions: finding a larger envelope or folding the letter so that it would fit into the current envelope.  Step 3: Evaluate the options I weighed the pros and cons of each option. A larger envelope would accommodate the letter without any alterations. However, I didn't have an appropriately sized envelope readily available and might need to visit the store to purchase one. On the other hand, folding the letter could cause damage to the paper and potentially make it more challenging to read. But it would enable me to use the envelope I already had. Step 4: Choose a course of action Considering the urgency of posting the letter, I decided that folding the letter would be the best option, as it would save time and complete the task on hand. I acknowledged the possibility of creases, but I believed the recipient would understand the situation and not mind a slightly wrinkled letter. Step 5: Implement the decision Carefully, I found the strategic points to fold the letter, trying my best to minimize any impact on the document's readability. After a few delicate folds, the letter finally fit into the envelope. Step 6: Monitor the results With the letter now securely inside the envelope, I sealed it shut and addressed it to the recipient.

Look who's talking.      Former FBI Director James Comey, who has cultivated a low public profile since his surprise firing last May, confirmed Monday that he is the author of a Twitter account that was previously anonymous — and signaled that he is going to rejoin the national conversation.      Comey tweeted an image of himself standing alone, along the roadside in Iowa, writing, \\"On the road home. Gotta get back to writing. Will try to tweet in useful ways.\\"      Earlier this year, a reporter for Gizmodo traced the Twitter account to Comey, after doing what she described as \\"four hours of sleuthing.\\" The account, under the pseudonym \\"Reinhold Niebuhr,\\" takes the name of a well-known theologian about whom Comey wrote an undergraduate thesis at the College of William & Mary.      Another clue: The account is now called @FormerBu, for former, um, bureau. Last week, the account posted two public tweets — an image of a kayaker at West Point, and a photo from Little Round Top, in Gettysburg, Pa., with the line, \\"Good place to think about leadership and values.\\"      Until Monday, however, Comey had not formally acknowledged he was the man behind the account.      True to form, the more creative minds on Twitter took things farther afield. \\"Darth,\\" a prominent and playful figure on the social media site, noted his presence in Iowa — wearing running shoes — and added a Nike swoosh and the words, \\"he's running.\\" A lot of political reporters took notice of those facts, too.      Comey served as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, deputy U.S. attorney general, and the top lawyer at Lockheed Martin before being named to run the FBI by President Barack Obama. He was abruptly fired by President Trump in May, who said he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he made his decision.      He has never occupied elected office, although many of his friends and former colleagues are pushing the idea.      Other Twitter users replied to Comey with their own special requests. ||||| CLOSE James Comey has a book deal. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) reveals what we know. Buzz60      FILE - In this June 8, 2017 file photo, former FBI director James Comey speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. Internal employee surveys show that fired Comey was highly respected and trusted within the bureau during his nearly four-year tenure. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)      Former FBI Director James Comey was in Iowa this weekend.      An anonymous Twitter account believed to be used by Comey – who was fired by President Donald Trump earlier this year amid the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election – published three tweets over the weekend alluding to a visit to Iowa.

He’s turned away from the camera, but sure looks like Comey.      Minutes after the tweet was posted, Benjamin Wittes, a legal analyst who’s known to be a friend of Comey, tweeted confirmation that the account does indeed belong to the former director and, by extension, that he was indeed in Iowa this week.      Ok, in light of this latest tweet, I will confirm that @FormerBu is, in fact, James Comey himself. https://t.co/6QbhOG7Qzp — Benjamin Wittes (@benjaminwittes) October 23, 2017      So we’ve established he was here. But why?      Well, Comey is married to Patrice Failor, an Iowa native whose brother is Ed Failor Jr., a top staffer for the Republican caucus in the Iowa Senate.      Ed Failor's Facebook page happens to note that his father, Ed Failor Sr., celebrated his 90th birthday over the weekend, just the kind of family celebration an out-of-state daughter and son-in-law would come back for.      The Des Moines Register learned that celebration included a birthday dinner at 801 Chophouse in downtown Des Moines, the venerable steakhouse long popular among visiting politicos.      801 general manager Damon Murphy confirmed to the Register that Comey attended the Failor party at the restaurant on Saturday.      \\"They enjoyed themselves in a semi-private room, just a quick little dinner, in and out,\\" Murphy said.      Ed Failor Jr. declined to confirm that Comey was in the state — but he didn’t deny it either.      In his tweets, Comey seems to hint at a new public role for himself after several months out of the spotlight after his high-profile firing.      “Gotta get back to writing” he said in the final Iowa tweet. “Will try to tweet in useful ways.”      Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2yDWogI ||||| Summary:","output":"Former FBI Director, James Comey, confirmed he was the author of a previously anonymous Twitter account on Monday.

Explanation: The translation of \\"I'm starting to see a real little man there\\" to Czech is \\"Začínám tam vidět opravdu malého muže.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"I'm starting to see\\" is translated to \\"Začínám vidět.\\" In Czech, verb and subject pronouns are often combined into one conjugated verb form. In this case, \\"začínám\\" (I am starting) comes from the verb \\"začít\\" (to start), and it implicitly contains the pronoun \\"I.\\" - \\"a\\" is translated to \\"jednoho\\" when referring to a masculine object in an accusative case like the one we have here; however, in this specific context, it would sound unnatural in Czech, and it's perfectly fine to drop the \\"jednoho\\".  - \\"real\\" is translated to \\"opravdu.\\" In this context, \\"opravdu\\" is an adverb that means \\"really\\" or \\"truly,\\" emphasizing the genuineness of the little man. - \\"little man\\" is translated to \\"malého muže,\\" which is in the accusative case. The adjective \\"malý\\" (little) in the masculine singular accusative form becomes \\"malého,\\" and the noun \\"muž\\" (man) changes to \\"muže.\\" - \\"there\\" is translated to \\"tam,\\" an adverb indicating a specific location.

Pigment epithelial (PE) cells isolated from the eye possess the ability to suppress the T cell receptor-dependent activation of T cells and the induction of regulatory T cells in vitro. This property is dependent on the cells’ capacity to produce cell-surface and soluble inhibitory molecules, for example CD86 (B7-2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, thrombospondin-1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1/B7-H1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 2α. Cultured ocular PE cells from the iris, ciliary body, and retina can individually suppress T-cell activation via mechanisms that partially overlap. Moreover, PE-derived regulatory T cells acquire functions that play a role in establishing immune regulation in the eye. Multiple strategies are employed within the eye to control immune-mediated inflammation.

With just a few simple steps in layering and choosing the right combination, anyone can look effortlessly cool and chic with minimal effort. In this article, we will discuss the benefits of wearing a jacket with a black T-shirt with a white collar and short sleeves, and why it might be your new favorite go-to outfit. So, let's get started. Step 1: Choosing the Right Jacket A jacket can elevate any casual look and provide added warmth and protection against the elements. There is a multitude of jacket styles to choose from, such as bombers, denim jackets, or blazers, depending on the occasion and desired aesthetic. When pairing with a black T-shirt, consider a jacket in a complementary color or neutral tones like navy, olive, or tan. Step 2: A Black T-Shirt with a Twist Selecting a black T-shirt with a white collar and short sleeves makes for an eye-catching and modern look that instantly adds style points to your outfit. The monochrome design lends itself to easy matching, while the white collar creates a subtle statement and sense of sophistication. Ensure the shirt has a comfortable fit for easy layering under a jacket. Step 3: Keeping the Layers Balanced Layering can be a tricky game, and it's essential to find the right balance. A correctly layered outfit should be comfortable to wear, and the layers should harmoniously come together.

If needed, adjust the jacket to showcase the T-shirt's contrasting white collar - creating that perfect balance. Step 4: Accessorizing and Completing the Look With the base of your outfit established, you can put the finishing touches with suitable accessories and complementary wardrobe staples. Complete the look with a pair of well-fitting jeans or trousers in a neutral color. Depending on the occasion, accessorize the outfit with a hat, belt, or jewelry for added elegance. Conclusion With the right choice of jacket and a black T-shirt with a contrasting white collar, you can create a striking and effortlessly stylish ensemble. This outfit offers countless possibilities for accessorizing and can easily be adapted to various settings, from casual day-to-day wear to a more sophisticated evening look.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: Small crustaceans exchange gases across thin areas of the cuticle; larger species have what to accomplish this?   A:","output":"Larger species of small crustaceans have developed specialized, efficient respiratory structures called gills in order to accomplish gas exchange across thin areas of the cuticle. Unlike small species that rely on direct diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide through their cuticle, larger crustaceans have complex respiratory systems capable of supporting their increased size and metabolic requirements. Gills are thin-walled, flat, or filamental-like extensions of the body surface that provide a large surface area for the exchange of gases. They are typically located on the sides of the body, on the appendages, or in specialized chambers. In larger crustaceans, such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish, gills are usually found within gill chambers located on either side of the cephalothorax, which is the fused head and thorax region. These gill chambers are covered by a bony plate called the carapace that protects the delicate structures within and helps to keep water flowing over the gills. As water flows over the gills, oxygen dissolved in water diffuses across the thin walls of the gill filaments and enters the crustacean's circulatory system, where it binds to respiratory pigments like hemocyanin. Simultaneously, as oxygen is taken up into the blood, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses out of the blood and into the water, which is then carried away as the water continues to flow over the gills. Having specialized respiratory structures like gills is essential for larger crustaceans to meet their metabolic demands and support their larger body size. The increased surface area provided by gills allows for more efficient gas exchange and better adaptation to different aquatic environments – from freshwater to saltwater and from shallow to deep waters. The development of gills highlights the evolutionary adaptability of crustaceans and their ability to thrive in diverse ecological niches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. However, the unimpressed washroom attendant, Uncle Pio (Steven Geray), keeps calling him \\"Mr. Peasant\\". One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful and spirited new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth). It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Johnny visits Gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their loveâhate dynamic. While it is unclear just how much Mundson knows of Gilda and Johnny's past relationship, he appears to be in ignorance when he assigns Farrell to keep an eye on Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are both consumed with their hatred of each other, as Gilda cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and he grows more abusive and spiteful in his treatment of her. Mundson is visited by two German businessmen. Their secret organization had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundson's name to hide their connection to it.

Question: suppose More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot. happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: less Step 1: Place the water in a pot Reason: To begin the process of separating salt from water, the water needs to be heated, and a pot is a common vessel for this purpose. Step 2: Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover Reason: To help collect the evaporated water (water vapor), a cover that extends over the sides of the pot will assist in catching and directing the water vapor to the second pot. Step 3: Place a larger pot under the first Reason: The larger pot is placed underneath to collect the dripping fresh water, which results from the condensation of water vapor on the cover. Step 4: Heat water to evaporation Reason: Heating the water to the point of evaporation allows the water vapor to separate from the salt that cannot evaporate, allowing for the extraction of fresh water. Step 5: Water vapor will collect on the lid Reason: As the water vapor rises and comes into contact with the cooler lid, it will condense into droplets. Step 6: Drip into the second pot as fresh water Reason: The fresh water droplets collected on the lid will then drip into the larger pot underneath, resulting in a collection of fresh water separate from the salt.

Seeing all kinds of recent shooting incidents,I think it should be controlled more strictly than now. Somebody said that the person who has it in mind to kill another can do it without a gun,so the causes of murders are not guns but the trend of despising   life in the US. And they also insist that there is no clear evidence that the increasing number of murders is connected with possession  of guns,so the personal rights should not be restricted  by the reason that there is not enough evidence. Several months ago,I agreed with that partly. But as we know,the private groups like NRA have used the public opinion and persuaded the government to protect their profit. Other weapons such as knives,razors ,bats are made for their own usage. But guns are made for only one reason--to kill someone. Of course,there are people who have guns to protect themselves from the criminals. But crime is getting more cruel and severe nowadays,so actually even if someone has a gun,it is impossible to guard himself completely. As a substitute ,I think,if the possession of guns is controlled more strictly,people can live safer lives than now. There are other reasons to oppose the gun control (e.g.the possession of guns is historical inheritance  and represents that people's resistance  will be against tyrannical   government),but none of them can justify and explain today's serious situation in the US. Question: What is the current situation in the US? Answer:  [A]. The number of murders is rising.. [B]. Everyone in the US possesses a gun.. [C]. NRA has ruled over the country.. [D].

The movie failed to meet them. I don't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I do expect them to be internally consistent. This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla. A shape-shifting mystic warrior from Korea, curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess. A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent \\"paranormal division\\" - which has gone unremarked up to this point. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims \\"I never meant for this to happen.\\" A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who \\"died like star-crossed lovers.\\" Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owe a lot to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it. The dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing \\"Ran\\" with a karaoke rendition of My Way - and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa. In short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: De Blasio and New York: Promises Now, Payments Later For nearly his last five years as mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg and the United Federation of Teachers failed to agree on a contract for the city’s public schoolteachers. By the time Bill de Blasio took office as mayor in January, the teachers were demanding billions in retroactive pay increases for the years they didn’t have a contract and therefore didn’t get base pay increases. Mr. de Blasio, a liberal who ran with strong support from unions, wanted to provide retroactive pay, but the city is not exactly flush with cash to hand out. So his solution was to promise retroactive pay now and pay it later. The contract he recently negotiated with the teachers’ union includes payouts equivalent to 4 percent pay increases for 2009 and 2010, but teachers won’t start getting the money until 2015. They won’t get it all until 2020, by which time the new teachers’ contract will have been expired for two years. Nicole Gelinas, my former colleague from the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, argues that this means the city’s budget is not balanced. Effectively, the city is borrowing money from its teachers: The teachers are providing labor now, on the expectation that the city will pay them later. Mr. de Blasio hardly invented the idea of “balancing” a budget by paying in promises instead of cash. The teachers’ union notes that the city has executed contracts with deferred pay at least twice before, in 1976 and 1991. And it extends far beyond New York: The requirement to balance budgets annually, funding current expenses from current revenues, pushes governments to find ways to promise payment later, and not count that payment as a current expense. This can help governments get through periods of fiscal stress without cutting services too deeply or raising taxes too sharply, but it can also get lawmakers into a lot of trouble, when they fail to understand the true costs of the promises they’re making. Retirement benefits are a common vehicle for backdoor borrowing. State and local governments routinely promise public employees health benefits in retirement, but almost none consistently set aside enough cash in advance to cover those costs. Cash pensions are ordinarily pre-funded, but states and cities use all sorts of gimmicks to reduce the amount of cash they have to set aside for pensions. For example, pension funds “smooth” pension investment returns in a way that gives the government credit for assets that don’t exist. Funds in several jurisdictions, including Los Angeles and Detroit, reacted to the stock market declines of 2008 and 2009 by extending the number of years over which they smooth asset declines, which allowed them to reduce their pension systems’ annual cash demands — without actually reducing the cost of the pension benefits promised. Sometimes, the methods of borrowing are even more crass. Today, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced that, because of a revenue shortfall, he would pay 60 percent less into the state’s pension funds than was prescribed under a 2011 law he signed. He described this as “doing what I need to do to fulfill my constitutional obligation to balance a budget,” but because taxpayers will eventually have to repay the missed pension contributions with interest, that’s not really balancing; it’s borrowing. Illinois routinely “balances” its budget by delaying payments to people owed money by the state, including medical providers who participate in Medicaid. The Illinois comptroller, Judy Baar Topinka, noted in a 2013 report that “Illinois ended 2013 with an overall bill backlog that was 1.4 billion smaller than the same time last year.” That still left the state with 6.1 billion in overdue bills to its counterparties. In some cases, governments hide the cost of business subsidies by providing loan guarantees instead of direct cash payments. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey provided a bond guarantee to support the private construction of 4 World Trade Center and is discussing providing one for 3 World Trade Center. Those loan guarantees are valuable and they reduce the developer Larry Silverstein’s cost to build, but they won’t show up as a budgetary cost to the Port Authority unless he actually defaults on his debts. That’s an error: Simply providing the guarantee and taking on the risk of payment is costly, as demonstrated by the fact that buying a similar guarantee in the private markets would be expensive. Those contingent liabilities can become a big deal when they turn into actual liabilities. Rhode Island learned this the hard way in 2012, when it used bond guarantees as a strategy for economic development and job creation, and then ended up on the hook for 75 million plus interest when 38 Studios, a video game company founded by the ex-Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, went bankrupt. This is a good example of how paying in promises instead of in cash can get lawmakers in trouble. The 38 Studios deal would have probably looked less appealing to Rhode Island legislators had they needed to put up cash upfront to get someone else to take on the risk of a 38 Studios failure. It can even be argued that part of the regular pay increases that Mr. de Blasio negotiated with the teachers constitutes borrowing. The contract contemplates low base salary increases of just 1 percent for the years 2013 through 2015, rising to 3 percent by 2018. Is a higher promised wage increase in later years a reflection of an expectation that overall wage growth will be stronger in the future? Or is it an inducement to get the union to accept a smaller wage increase now — and therefore a form of borrowing? Some tactics, like Illinois’s practice of just not paying bills, are obvious forms of backdoor borrowing. But sometimes, as with a labor contract that includes low wage increases now and higher ones in the future, it’s ambiguous; that ambiguity can make it hard to say whether a government’s budget is balanced or not. After a skirmish with Scott Stringer, the city comptroller, Mr. de Blasio amended his budget to reclassify 725 million in promised payouts to teachers who may retire soon as spending in this year’s budget, reducing the amount of implicit borrowing. The logic is that the promises are being made now and should be counted now, even if the cash goes out the door in a later year. But billions more in promised retroactive pay to teachers who are not eligible to retire soon will still be counted in later budgets — in the case of payments due in 2020, in a budget that could come as Mr. de Blasio is in his second and last term as mayor. Let’s hope the city has plenty of money then to pay off the implicit loan we’re taking out from teachers today.","output":"Mayor Bill de Blasio negotiated a contract with New York City's teachers' union that includes retroactive pay increases, which have been criticized as a form of backdoor borrowing.

Plot title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind.

Which language is this?","output":"This sentence is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. The Czech language is closely related to Slovak and has similarities to other Slavic languages such as Polish and Russian. It uses the Latin alphabet with several additional diacritic marks for specific Czech sounds, such as č, š, and ž, which are called háček (hook); á, é, í, and other vowels with an acute accent; and ů, which is a ring above the letter u. The sentence \\"Chvíli mu trvalo, než to skousnul\\" can be translated to English as \\"It took him a while to swallow it\\" or \\"It took him a moment to come to terms with it.\\" The phrase suggests that someone had difficulty accepting or dealing with something, either physically, as in swallowing food or a pill, or metaphorically, adjusting to new information or a significant change.  Czech is an inflected language, which means that the endings of nouns, adjectives, and verbs change according to their function in a sentence. This characteristic allows Czech speakers to use different and relatively flexible sentence structures, which can result in a variety of word orders based on emphasis or style. This flexibility, however, can be challenging for non-native speakers learning the language. Czech is spoken by around 10 million native speakers and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. In both the Czech Republic and abroad, there are communities of people who speak it as their first language.

Most people's cursory thoughts of Queen Victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne, and early years.

There are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing, the film tries to stay true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period.

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

Please answer the following question: When I was fourteen, I earned money in the summer by cutting lawns , and within a few weeks I had built up a body of customers. I got to know people by the flowers they planted that I had to remember not to cut down, by the things they lost in the grass or struck in the ground on purpose. I reached the point with most of them when I knew in advance what complaint was about to be spoken, which request was most important. And I learned something about the measure of my neighbors by their preferred method of payment: by the job, by the month--or not at all. Mr. Ballou fell into the last category, and he always had a reason why. On one day, he had no change for a fifty, on another he was flat out of checks, on another, he was simply out when I knocked on his door. Still, except for the money apart, he was a nice enough guy, always waving or tipping his hat when he'd seen me from a distance. I figured him for a thin retirement check, maybe a work-related injury that kept him from doing his own yard work. Sure, I kept track of the total, but I didn't worry about the amount too much. Grass was grass, and the little that Mr. Ballou's property comprised didn't take long to trim  . Then, one late afternoon in mid-July, the hottest time of the year, I was walking by his house and he opened the door, mentioned me to come inside. The hall was cool, shaded, and it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the dim light. \\"I owe you,\\" Mr Ballou said, \\"but...\\" I thought I'd save him the trouble of thinking of a new excuse. \\"No problem. Don't worry about it.\\" \\"The bank made a mistake in my account,\\" he continued, ignoring my words. \\"It will be cleared up in a day or two. But in the meantime I thought perhaps you could choose one or two volumes for a down payment. He gestured toward the walls and I saw that books were stacked   everywhere.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What is required to be good at playing tennis? Possible A: tennis racket, skill, competition, tennis court, legs  Why is \\"skill\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"Skill is an answer aligned with human common sense because, to be good at playing tennis, one must possess the knowledge, ability, and talent to play the sport effectively. Mastery of various essential techniques, such as serving, forehand and backhand strokes, footwork, and tactics, are critical to perform well in tennis. This encompasses both physical and mental skills required for the game. While other factors like a tennis racket, competition, tennis court, and legs also contribute to playing tennis, the skill factor is the most indicative of how successful a player will be. For instance, a tennis racket is necessary to play, but without skill, a person cannot effectively utilize the racket. A tennis court is obviously important to have a proper surface for the game, but merely having access to a court does not make one a good player. Similarly, legs are essential for mobility and agility during the game; however, strong legs alone do not guarantee success. Lastly, competition helps gauge one's skill level and improve through challenges, but it is the player's skill that ultimately determines their performance. In summary, skill is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most crucial factor in determining a player's performance and success in tennis. Without the necessary skills, even with all the equipment and opportunities, an individual would not perform well in the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Empty roads giving you a weird feeling. We had all possible difficulties finding our airbnb accommodation as its address was like Marida, Caucel, Avenida 68, Puerta Sisal, Calle 31, Avenida Caucel 68, Calle 3/2419 B. After much asking around, as we don't have a navigation system here, and consulting our paltry maps, we gave up and phoned our host who navigated us to the house, which turned out to be located in a semi-fenced residential area outside the city. Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone. William:   William: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep, did some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan today and are looking forward to reconnoiter the area tomorrow. William:   Hobbs: Hi there! Many thanks for the details. Caucel rings a bell with me. Is it to the west of the city itself? A fairly new development? William: That's it. Brand new and still being developed. Following a wide and brand new avenida today, we ended up with this.   And dense vegetation beyond! Hobbs: Looks like Mexico to me. But they'll pick up the continuation once they needed it. Practically minded as they are. And how did you like the city itself? William: We got stuck on the Plaza Mayor, this being Sunday. It was turned into a market square with stalls offering local food, craftsmanship products and household goods, surprising un-touristy. In front of Palacio del Gobierno, a supreme show of dancing in local costumes. William:   Hobbs: Did you manage to get to the balcony of the Palacio on the first floor and get some photos from there? William: But of course! William:   William: Theresa tried to prevent me from trespassing but you know me. Even managed to get to the loo there! Hobbs: Good boy! And how about the cathedral? Casa de Montejo? Is it still accessible or is it only a bank? William: Both, and Theresa intends to visit the cathedral again to take some more photos. I didn't find it that impressive, apart from the west facade of course. A small part of Casa de Montejo on the ground floor is a museum now, interiors with period furniture plus a small modern art gallery, quite pleasant though over-airconditioned, but the rest is a bank, I think. Hobbs: If I remember correctly they bought the building some time ago and financed its restoration. To have a good overview of the city, you should try a ride on an open double-decker bus.

Sentence 1: \\"The economy could be still better.\\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility for economic improvement, meaning that the current economic situation is not at an optimal level. The speaker may be implying that there is untapped potential or that certain policies or factors can help uplift the economy. However, this sentence does not provide any information on the efforts or intentions of any individual or group trying to improve the economy. Sentence 2: \\"They wanted to do their best.\\" This statement expresses the desire or intention of an individual or group to give their best effort in a given situation. The context of \\"their best\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, and without any specific reference, \\"their best\\" could be applied to a wide range of situations. Now, analyzing both sentences together, there is no direct connection between the two statements. Sentence 1 discusses the potential for economic improvement, while Sentence 2 focuses on the intent of an individual or a group to give their best effort. If we wanted to make a connection between the two sentences, we would need to know if the individuals or the group mentioned in Sentence 2 are involved in the economic circumstances talked about in Sentence 1. If the people mentioned in Sentence 2 were, for instance, policymakers or business leaders, you could make a connection between their \\"best efforts\\" and the potential for economic improvement suggested in Sentence 1. In that case, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence could also be true if these individuals or groups indeed wanted to do their best to improve the economy. However, based on the information provided, there is no direct link between the truth of Sentence 1 and the truth of Sentence 2. The first sentence refers to the potential for economic improvement, while the second sentence refers to the intent of individuals or groups to do their best. As such, without any additional context, it cannot be determined that if the first sentence is true, the second would also be true.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A starship, starcraft or interstellar spacecraft is a theoretical spacecraft designed for traveling between planetary systems, as opposed to a vehicle designed for orbital spaceflight or interplanetary travel.  - Rama (Sanskrit:  \\"Rma\\") or Sr Rmachandra (Sanskrit :  ) is the seventh avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu. He is the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which is the principal narration of the events connected to his incarnation on Earth, his ideals and his greatness. Rama is one of the many deities in Hinduism and especially of the various Vaishnava sects. Religious texts and scriptures based on his life have been a formative component in numerous cultures of South and Southeast Asia. Along with Krishna, Rama is considered to be one of the most important avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric sects, he is considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar.  - Rendezvous with Rama is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke first published in 1973. Set in the 2130s, the story involves a cylindrical alien starship that enters Earth's solar system. The story is told from the point of view of a group of human explorers who intercept the ship in an attempt to unlock its mysteries. This novel won both the Hugo and Nebula awards upon its release, and it is regarded as one of the cornerstones in Clarke's bibliography.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Bert Gentry Lee (born 1942) is the chief engineer for the Planetary Flight Systems Directorate at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and also a science fiction writer. He had engineering oversight responsibility for the twin rover missions to Mars that landed in January 2004, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) in 2006, and the Deep Impact and Stardust missions. He was also the chief engineer for the Galileo project from 19771988 and director of science analysis and mission planning during the Viking projects.  - Rama II is a novel by Gentry Lee and Arthur C. Clarke first published in 1989 . It recounts humankind 's further interaction with the Ramans , first introduced in Rendezvous with Rama . Written primarily by Lee , Rama II has a distinctly different writing style than the original , with a more character driven narrative and a closer - to - contemporary mindset , ambience and human relations than the first novel 's more futuristic tones . Rama II is the first novel of the \`\` new '' Rama series , as Rendezvous with Rama is not always counted as part of it .

By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini.

Joe Schmidt's side - already without Johnny Sexton, Robbie Henshaw and Sean O'Brien - were not derailed by their lengthening injury list. Instead, they became the first European team since 2003 to beat all three leading southern hemisphere teams in one calendar year. \\"To have a number of changes to the team and then having to make positional changes during the game makes it a win we are very, very happy with,\\" Best said. \\"You have to give credit to the Aussies, especially at the start of the second half.

Click on \\"System\\" → \\"Library\\" → \\"Compositions\\" to get there. You should see many different  compositions, some which work with Photo Booth and some that don't. If you are having trouble finding the Composition Folder, use the search bar in the top corner of Finder. Click on \\"Users,\\" or click on your profile (this is the name used to sign into your computer, such as JSmith) in the other Finder window. Click on \\"Library\\" once you've found your account. This is the library of you user account, whereas the other one is the library of your entire computer. You'll be transferring the compositions (effects) from the System folder to the personal library. If there is already a  compositions folder here, move on to the next step. If not, click \\"File\\" → \\"New Folder\\" and name it \\"Compositions\\". Not all of these effects will be perfect for Photo Booth, but many users have already posted the best effects to copy. At minimum, try bringing over: ASCII Art, Blue Print, Blur, City Lights, Color Controls, Color Invert, Compound Eye, Concert, Crystallize, Dot Screen, Exposure Adjust, Gamma Adjust, Kaleidoscope, Line Overlay, Line Screen, Monochrome, Neon, Pixelate, Pointillize, Posterize, Sharpen, Tracer, Zoom Blur If you do not have one, you can download TextWrangler for free online, which let you edit the compositions into Photo Booth effects. Don't get intimidated by this process if you don't know coding -- all you have to do is delete 5 lines. Click on \\"File\\" → \\"Open,\\" then find your compositions (Blue, City Lights, Neon, etc.). Remember to look in your new folder, found by \\"User\\" &rarr, \\"Library\\" → \\"Composition.\\" You can also right click on the effect you want to edit, like \\"ASCII Art\\" and choose TextWrangler after clicking \\"Open With...\\" The coding in these effects includes some lines that prevent Photo Booth from accessing them.

Possible A: milk machine, farmyard, countryside, fairgrounds, long horns  Why is \\"countryside\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Countryside\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a natural environment where cows usually live and graze on open fields. The cows being lost in the city and hating the noise would logically lead them to long for a quieter, more familiar environment like the countryside where they can live comfortably and away from urban disturbances. It also implies that the cows would prefer a place with fresh air and natural surroundings, which is characteristic of the countryside."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's rewrite the equation to make it easier to understand: 794 * j = -3205 * j - 51559 + 287500 Our job is to find out the number that j represents. To do this, we need to get all the terms with j on one side, and all the numbers without j on the other side. Here's what we'll do: 1. Add 3205 * j to both sides of the equation to move the -3205 * j from the right side: (794 * j) + (3205 * j) = -51559 + 287500 2. Combine the j terms: (794 + 3205) * j = -51559 + 287500 3. Calculate the sum of 794 and 3205: 3999 * j = -51559 + 287500 4. Now, calculate the sum of -51559 and 287500: 3999 * j = 235941 Alright, we're almost done! Now, we need to find the number for j. We'll do this by dividing the number on the right side by the number next to j (which is 3999): j = 235941 / 3999 5. Let's do the division: j = 59 So, j represents the number 59 in this problem.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"Preparing rocks for painting involves a series of steps to ensure they are properly cleaned, smoothed, and primed for the best possible results. Here is a detailed guide on how to prepare rocks for painting which makes the most sense to accomplish this goal: 1. Collecting or purchasing rocks: The first step is to either collect rocks from nature or purchase them at a gardening or crafts store. Look for rocks with a smooth surface, relatively flat, and free from cracks or deep fissures. The size and shape of the rock can vary, depending on your painting project and design requirements. 2. Washing rocks: Once you have your rocks, it is essential to thoroughly wash them to remove dirt, dust, and debris. You can use a brush with soft bristles, running water, and mild dish soap to gently scrub the rocks. Make sure to rinse them well to remove any soap residue. 3. Soaking rocks: After washing, let the rocks soak in a bucket or sink filled with water for about 30 minutes. This step helps to release any remaining dirt or debris, particularly from small crevices. 4. Drying rocks: Drain the water and let the rocks air dry in a sunny or well-ventilated area. This step might take a few hours, or up to one day, depending on the size and the type of rock. Ensure the rocks are completely dry before moving forward, as moisture might interfere with the painting process. 5. Sanding rocks (optional): Some rocks might have rough spots that require smoothing before painting. Use sandpaper (120 grit is a good starting point) to gently smooth the surface of the rock. Make sure to do this in a well-ventilated area and wear a mask to avoid inhaling rock dust. Wipe the rock with a damp cloth to remove any dust from sanding and allow it to dry. 6. Applying primer/base coat (optional): To enhance the durability and aesthetics of your painted rock, apply a coat of white paint or gesso as a base. This step is optional, but it can help make the colors more vibrant and provide better adhesion of the acrylic paint. Make sure to use a primer that's designed for multi-surface use, is waterproof and non-toxic. Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. 7. Painting the rocks: Use acrylic paints to create your designs on the rocks. Acrylic paint is water-resistant when dry, and it adheres well to rock surfaces. Prefer using non-toxic paints and brushes of varying sizes to achieve different levels of detail. 8. Drying the painted rocks: Let the painted rocks dry completely before moving on to the next step. This process can take anywhere from an hour to overnight, depending on the thickness of the paint applied. 9. Applying a protective sealant: To protect your painted rocks from the elements and increase their longevity, apply a clear, waterproof sealant. Choose a sealant specifically designed for outdoor use and compatible with acrylic paints, such as Mod Podge Outdoor or a spray-on varnish. Apply the sealant according to the manufacturer's instructions and let it dry completely. 10. Displaying your painted rocks: Once the rocks are dry and sealed, they are ready to be displayed, hidden, or given as gifts. Painted rocks are a unique and creative way to decorate gardens, home interiors, or to simply brighten someone's day with a fun and unexpected artistic find. By following these steps, you can prepare rocks for painting in a way that makes the most sense and ensures a high-quality, long-lasting, and aesthetically-pleasing finished product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

The choices provided are: bed, basement, floor, and store. Step 2: Eliminate the incorrect choices \\"These twos are incorrect answers\\" indicates that two choices should be disregarded, but does not specifically point out which ones. Therefore, we need to examine each choice on its own merit. - Bed: This is not a suitable location for long term storage of toys, as the bed is a place for sleeping and it wouldn't be practical to store items there for a long time. - Basement: This is a possible storage location, as basements are often used for storing items long term. - Floor: This is not an ideal location for long term storage, as it could create clutter and hinder movement within the house. - Store: This choice is ambiguous, as it could mean a storage facility or a retail store. However, the context suggests that the toys are being kept within the family, which eliminates the possibility of a retail store. So, we can rule out \\"store\\" as an option. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer based on the remaining options With \\"bed\\" and \\"floor\\" eliminated as unsuitable options, we are left with \\"basement\\" as the most appropriate choice. Rationale for choosing \\"basement\\" as the answer: Basements are commonly used for long term storage of items that are no longer needed on a daily basis, but are still important to keep within the family, such as memorabilia, seasonal items, or in this case, Sam's old toys. Storing the boxes in the basement keeps them out of the way, yet still accessible, and allows for easy organization without cluttering up the living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father. Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \\"typical\\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love. Tom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich \\"Madame La Comtesse\\" and her friends.

The Miss USA beauty pageant aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the networks game shows. John Charles Daly hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an animal rights activist who eventually convinced producers of The Price Is Right to cease offering fur coats as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), Alan Thicke in 1988, Dick Clark from 1989 to 1993, and Bob Goen from 1994 to 1996. The pageants highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s, when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: After their road win in Miami, the Patriots returned home to face the Steelers, who the Patriots had not lost to since 2004. On the opening kickoff, Patriots linebacker Vince Redd forced a fumble of Carey Davis at the Steelers' 20-yard line that Davis eventually recovered; an unnecessary roughness penalty by the Steelers' Keyaron Fox meant the Steelers would begin their first drive from their own 10-yard line. Four plays in, Vrabel intercepted Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and returned it 5 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Steelers' 14-yard line. After a Welker reception moved the ball to the Steelers' 2-yard line, Morris ran in for a 2-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. The Steelers' ensuing possession went three-and-out, but a holding penalty by Aiken on the punt moved the Patriots back to the Steelers' 20-yard line. A 27-yard Moss catch on the next play would help the Patriots reach midfield, but a third-down sack of Cassel set up a Patriots punt, which was returned by the Steelers' Santonio Holmes for 29 yards. Following a 21-yard reception by tight end Heath Miller to begin the drive, the Steelers moved further into Patriots territory on two Nate Washington catches of 15 and 16 yards, both on third down. The Steelers then failed to score from the Patriots' 2-yard line on third down, setting up a 20-yard Jeff Reed field goal to cut the Patriots' lead to 7-3. Three plays into the Patriots' next drive, Moss dropped a pass after he beat his defender inside the Steelers' 35-yard line, eventually setting up another Patriots punt on the final play of the quarter. An exchange of three three-and-outs began the second quarter, leading to Patriots drive that began from their own 40-yard line. A fourth down conversion put the Patriots in the Steelers' red zone, but the Patriots were unable to reach the end zone and settled for a 29-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended their lead to 10-3. Following a 31-yard Gary Russell kick return that gave the Steelers the ball at their own 37-yard line, the Steelers moved 63 yards on 9 plays, capping their drive with a 19-yard Holmes touchdown catch to tie the game at 10 with just under two minutes left in the half. Two plays later, the Patriots found themselves in Steelers' territory again following a 41-yard Faulk run; 35 seconds remained in the first half by the time the Patriots reached the Steelers' 9-yard line on a first down. The Patriots' next three plays would be Cassel pass attempts to Moss; the second of which was dropped by a leaping Moss in the back of the end zone. On fourth down, Gostkowski's 27-yard field goal attempt was no good to keep the game tied at 10 going into halftime. Following a 23-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Steelers cornerback Ike Taylor to begin the second half, the Patriots moved into Steelers' territory, but another sack of Cassel forced a Patriots punt. Starting from their own 14-yard line, the Steelers responded by embarking on a 14-play, 79-drive that reached the Patriots' 7-yard line on a second down but no further; a 25-yard Reed field goal gave the Steelers their first lead of the game, 13-10. With Hobbs, the usual kick returner, on the sidelines vomiting and suffering from cramps, Slater took the ensuing kickoff; the rookie muffed the catch and the fumble was recovered by Fox at the Patriots' 8-yard line. Two plays later, Roethlisberger hit wide receiver Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown reception to extend the Steelers' lead to 20-10. Faulk stepped in as kick returner for the next kickoff, which he returned to the Patriots' 29-yard line. However, on the next play, Cassel was strip-sacked by Steelers linebacker James Harrison; the fumble was recovered by linebacker LaMarr Woodley at the Patriots' 26-yard line. Despite a 19-yard Miller catch to begin the Steelers' possession, the Patriots forced the Steelers to kick a field goal; Reed's 20-yard kick gave the Steelers a 23-10 lead. Hobbs came back to return the next kickoff, which began the Patriots' drive from their own 35-yard line. Three plays in, Welker was hit from behind by Steelers safety Ryan Clark after a Cassel pass attempt was tipped; Clark was called for a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty to move the Patriots in Steelers' territory. On 3rd-and-11 from the Steelers' 48-yard line, Cassel was again strip-sacked by Harrison; this time linebacker James Farrior recovered the fumble at the Patriots' 47-yard line. The Steelers next drive began on the final play of the third quarter and reached as far as the Patriots' 22-yard line, where Reed missed a 40-yard field goal to give the Patriots the ball back at their own 30-yard line. The Patriots proceeded to move into Steelers' territory, but on 3rd-and-13 from the Steelers' 43-yard line, a Cassel pass intended for Watson was intercepted by safety Troy Polamalu at the Steelers' 11-yard line and returned for 23 yards in the Patriots' fourth turnover of the second half. Three plays later, a 31-yard Willie Parker moved the Steelers to the Patriots' 28-yard line; they would get as far as the Patriots' 22-yard line before Reed kicked a 45-yard field goal to extend the Steelers' lead to 26-10. With less than six minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots began their next series from their own 44-yard line after Reed's kick was returned from the Patriots' 30-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Cassel found Gaffney open inside the Steelers' 25-yard line, but the wide receiver dropped the pass; Taylor threw the ball back toward Gaffney after the play, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that moved the Patriots into Steelers' territory. Seven plays later, on a first down from the Steelers' 14-yard line, Cassel was intercepted by linebacker Lawrence Timmons, who returned it 89 yards before being tackled at the Patriots' 1-yard line by Watson. Two plays later, Russell ran in for a 1-yard touchdown that gave the Steelers a 33-10 lead with less than three minutes to go in the game. The Patriots could not score on their next possession, ending the game and dropping the Patriots' record to 7-5. Question: How many field goals were missed in the game?

Următorul punct pe ordinea de zi este raportul elaborat de Reimer Böge, în numele Comisiei pentru bugete, referitor la mobilizarea Fondului european de ajustare la globalizare: Suedia - Volvo; Austria - Steiermark; Ţările de Jos - Heijmans - C7-0254/2009 -. Translate this to English?","output":"The next item on the agenda is the report drawn up by Reimer Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, relating to the mobilization of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: Sweden - Volvo; Austria - Steiermark; Netherlands - Heijmans - C7-0254/2009. This report appears to be concerning the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is a fund established by the European Union to support workers who have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation-induced changes and structural shifts in world trade. In this specific case, it seems that the report discusses the mobilization of this fund with respect to several EU member countries - specifically, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands. The mentioning of the companies or regions (Volvo in Sweden, Steiermark in Austria, and Heijmans in the Netherlands) implies that the workers from these entities or regions might have been significantly affected by global changes and are hence, targeted beneficiaries of the EGF. The reference to \\"C7-0254/2009\\" would appear to be a specific document or case number related to this issue, likely representing the official proposal to mobilize the EGF for the workers from Volvo, Austria (Steiermark), and Heijmans. Reimer Böge, who is mentioned as having drawn up the report, was likely the one tasked with the investigation and documentation of this issue for the consideration of the Committee on Budgets, which is the body in charge of handling budgetary matters within the European Union.  This item on the agenda underlines the fact that even in a globalised world, there are mechanisms in place at a supranational level such as the EGF to try to cushion the adverse effects globalisation might bring about, especially concerning job losses. Also, it shows the commitment of the European Union toward social protection and solidarity, trying to minimize economic disparities and safeguard workers' rights despite the ongoing pressures of globalisation."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Options: - bedsores - sleep in - well rested - aren't ready when arrives - lay down Answer:","output":"bedsores Step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the question and options given: The question asks about the consequences of staying in bed too long, so we need to find a negative outcome associated with this behavior among the options. 2. Evaluate each option:    a. bedsores - Bedsores are a result of prolonged pressure on the skin, which can happen when someone stays in bed for too long.    b. sleep in - This option could be the result if someone oversleeps, but it doesn't necessarily describe a consequence of staying in bed too long.    c. well rested - This option seems more positive than negative and might be the result if someone gets enough sleep, but doesn't imply staying in bed for too long.    d. aren't ready when arrives - This option is somewhat unclear and doesn't specifically link to the scenario of staying in bed too long.    e. lay down - This option is not a consequence but an action someone would perform to be in bed in the first place. 3.

I read this Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen. Let me tell you, it's not a terrific play, it is easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. The acting was really lacking, the scenery-honest to God-looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality is lousy...there is this mind-numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks...and I also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is non-existant. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which would be OK but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more. In any case I think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which I don't really reccomend, then don't aim your hopes to high. The play, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.

Both are folk song artists, whose latest gig at a small music club fails to impress the owner and draw a crowd. The owner fires them and declares that since everyone seems to prefer 'rock and roll' and 'disco dancing,' he's decided to turn his place into a Rock Club.Dan and Jan then find themselves on the street with little money. Dan takes his guitar to a pawn shop to get money for food, leaving Jan alone in the woods. As she sits there, she laments how she'd give anything to be a rock star, feeling that if she was one, people would listen to her music.Suddenly, the Earth shakes, and in a puff of smoke, a large, red-skinned creature appears, clad in a white suit. He presents Jan with his card, which claims him to be B.L. Zebub, the head of 'Devil May Care Productions.' B.L. then introduces his assistant, Wheez Weasel, who shows Jan a contract. However, the enormous amount of paperwork leaves Jan's head spinning, and she decides to sign without having thoroughly read the paperwork. After signing in her own blood, Jan is taken from the wooded area, just as Dan comes back.Wheez is put in charge of managing Jan, and conjures a band up for her. Jan's musical career spans several different music styles, and soon, she has amassed fame and fortune, and is one of the most talked-about performers on stage. Dan continues to try and see her, but is foiled at every turn by Wheez.At an outdoor amphitheater at the height of her fame, Jan performs several different genres of music, before the moon overhead is blotted out by a large bird, which happens to be B.L., come to collect her.Jan rushes out of the amphitheater, with B.L. following her and changing shape depending on where she goes. When he finally catches her, he explains the clause in her contract that states that her soul now belongs to him, given that she has achieved superstardom.

For Halloween this year Victoria bought a costume at store but Katrina made their own as","output":"For Halloween this year, Victoria bought a costume at the store, but Katrina made their own, as they always enjoyed DIY projects and showing off their creative side. Step by step, Katrina crafted a one-of-a-kind outfit that would make a lasting impression at this year's festivities. Step 1: Idea Selection Katrina wanted to create something unique and fun, so they brainstormed different ideas for the costume. After considering various options, such as a mythical creature, a popular movie character, and a historical figure, they finally decided to dress up as a steampunk pirate. Step 2: Gathering Materials Once the idea was finalized, Katrina made a list of materials and props needed to create the steampunk pirate costume. This included a white blouse, a brown waistcoat, a long skirt, leather belts, goggles, pirate hat, various gears and cogs for decoration, gold and bronze spray paint, and a toy gun to modify with steampunk elements. Step 3: Modifying and Creating Pieces To create the steampunk pirate look, Katrina started by modifying the white blouse and skirt. They distressed the fabric and added patches of brown material to give it a worn-out appearance. They then painted the gears and cogs with gold and bronze spray paint and attached them to the brown waistcoat and other parts of the costume. Step 4: Assembling Accessories Katrina put together a set of goggles with gears and cogs on the sides, using a pair of old swimming goggles they found in the garage. They also customized the toy gun by painting it bronze and attaching gears, turning it into a makeshift steampunk weapon. Step 5: The Finishing Touches The costume was almost complete, but it needed some finishing touches. Katrina attached a leather belt around their waist and draped several chains with gears hanging from them. They also found a pirate hat and gave it a steampunk twist by attaching a few more gears and cogs onto the brim. With the steampunk pirate costume complete, Katrina was excited to reveal their creation at the Halloween party. Victoria, who had bought a pre-made witch costume, was amazed by the level of detail and effort Katrina had put into their outfit. Though their costumes were different, the friends had a great time together, marveling at Katrina's impressive ensemble and enjoying the Halloween festivities."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - The North American Plate is a tectonic plate covering most of North America, Greenland, Cuba, the Bahamas, extreme northeastern Russia, and parts of Iceland and the Azores. It extends eastward to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and westward to the Chersky Range in eastern Siberia. The plate includes both continental and oceanic crust. The interior of the main continental landmass includes an extensive granitic core called a craton. Along most of the edges of this craton are fragments of crustal material called terranes, accreted to the craton by tectonic actions over the long span of geologic time. It is thought that much of North America west of the Rocky Mountains is composed of such terranes.  - The Kula Plate was an oceanic tectonic plate under the northern Pacific Ocean south of the Near Islands segment of the Aleutian Islands. It is subducted under the North American Plate at the Aleutian Trench and is surrounded by the Pacific Plate.  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt \\"(Eje Volcánico Transversal)\\", also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the Sierra Nevada (\\"Snowy Mountain Range\\"), is a volcanic belt that covers central-southern Mexico. Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they are visible to a large percentage of those who live on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - The Eastern Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that is east of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, England) and west of the antimeridian. It is also used to refer to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, in contrast with the Western Hemisphere, which includes North and South America. This hemisphere may also be called the \\"Oriental Hemisphere\\". In addition, it may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the \\"Old World\\".  - The Okhotsk - Chukotka Volcanic Belt ( OCVB ) is a Cretaceous volcanic belt in northeastern Eurasia . It is one of the largest subduction - zone related volcanic provinces in the world , stretching some 3200 km and comprising about 2 million km3 of volcanic and plutonic material . The volcanism within the volcanic belt was related to the subduction of the ancient Kula Plate , which moved in a northward direction about 55 million years ago .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active region. Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity, such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of unusually high temperature (700-1400 °C) where magma is created by partial melting of solid material in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually form along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 1050 km. For example, volcanoes in Mexico and western North America are mostly in volcanic belts, such as the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern Mexico and the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province in western Canada.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".

Take the opportunity to briefly introduce yourself. In addition, remind her of how you know each other.  Say something like “Hey, Ann! I’m John – we know each other through Andy.” Don’t be offended if she doesn’t know your name or forgets it later. Whatever way you decide to contact her, you should consider using humor. Humor will make a potentially awkward situation funny, and help remind her of your virtues. There are many ways you can do this:  Start with a light-hearted joke about something you might think is funny. For example, if you remember she really likes Oreo cookies, you can joke about those. Joke about fashion. For instance, say “I was just in the mall and saw someone that looks exactly like you wearing crocs.” Use self-deprecating humor. For example, say, “Hey, do you remember me? The guy who wears the absurd cowboy boots.” Contact her and start up a conversation about how she’s doing in life. If you’re interested in a romantic relationship with her, this is a good way to find out if she is available. In addition, this is a very honest and straightforward way of reinitiating contact.  Generally, you can say something like “It’s been a while since we spoke. How are you doing?” If you knew her from work, and one of you has moved on, ask her “So, what’s going on with work these days?” In the case you knew each other through a mutual friend, you could simply ask about whether she’s spoken to that person recently.

She may respond telling you that you’re texting the wrong person, or she might pretend to be the person you’re supposed to be texting. Whatever happens, use it as an opportunity to talk to her.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: Is Quora better than Google for answers? Question 2: How is Quora better than Google? Pick from: [i] no. [ii] yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the exact same thing; however, they are related, as both questions are seeking to understand the advantages of using Quora over Google for answers. The difference in the two questions is that Question 1 asks for a comparison between the two platforms, while Question 2 assumes Quora is better and wants an explanation of its advantages. To provide a detailed and long answer addressing both questions, we will first compare Quora and Google for answers and then, if Quora has advantages, point out how it is better than Google. Quora is a platform where individuals can ask questions and receive answers from other users who have knowledge or experience in the subject matter. It serves as a community-driven platform that enables users to actively engage with each other to obtain specific answers or insights into various topics. On the other hand, Google is a search engine that allows users to search for information from a vast array of online sources including websites, blogs, forums, and more. Now, let's discuss some of the ways Quora may be considered better than Google for certain kinds of answers: 1. Personalized answers - With Quora, users can ask specific questions and receive customized answers from people with expertise in that area. Google, being a search engine, directs users to existing content from various sources that may not always cater to the user's exact question or specific needs. 2. Expertise-driven insights - Quora has subject matter experts in multiple domains, professionals, and enthusiasts who volunteer answers to those seeking help. This contributes to high-quality, reliable, and well-informed responses, which may not always be the case when browsing through multiple search results on Google. 3. Social interactions - Unlike Google, Quora establishes a sense of community through interactions within its platform. People can have conversations, follow domains of their interest and experts they trust, contribute, and validate answers by upvoting or downvoting them. 4. Focused content curation - Quora enables users to follow topics of interest, rendering a more specific, subject-focused browsing experience. Google, by design, covers the entire internet, which may lead to information overload and lower relevance of search results at times. However, it is essential to remember that Quora and Google serve different purposes. While Quora is a platform to obtain specific answers and engage with a community, Google is designed to provide access to a vast array of information available on the internet. Quora can be useful for personalized insights and interactive experiences, but Google offers a much broader perspective. In conclusion, it may not be fair to categorically state that one platform is better than the other since they cater to different needs. Quora can be better for personal insights and community-based information, while Google offers users an unparalleled library of diverse and extensive information from the web. The choice between the two will depend on the context, type of question the user has, and their personal preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am. I lovingly wrapped my camera in a soft scarf every day for 3 weeks, growled under my breath at anyone who looked like they might jostle me and at one point found...

Here is an article: Done right, cookie-selling can pack as many business lessons as calories. As the Girl Scouts Web site argues: “Every time you buy a box of cookies, you help girls learn 5 essential skills — goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills, and business ethics. . . . They learn and they earn, all thanks to you!” But these lessons aren’t learned when Scouts sell outside grocery stores or via mobile app, or, even worse, when parents ask their colleagues to purchase Girl Scout cookies, a query I recently received at a casual work lunch. My friend wasn’t prepared for the lecture that followed. I’d be more than happy to buy cookies from his daughter, I said, but only if she called me on the phone to personally ask for the sale. This goes beyond helicopter parenting. Ensuring that kids sell their own cookies is responsible parenting. When I was a Scout, I remember getting my order form and sitting down with my mom and dad to ask which of their friends I might approach for sales. There were long weekends of walking door to door with my parents, working on my “cookie elevator pitch” in between houses. I knew which houses were easy sells and which were tougher. I didn’t realize at the time that I was learning marketing strategy in addition to sales. When I returned to the office after that recent lunch, I began reviewing an interview for a documentary I am working on called “All the Queen’s Horses ,” about Rita Crundwell, a former comptroller of Dixon, Ill., who is serving 191 / 2 years in federal prison for embezzlement. As a comptroller — and very similar to my duties as a cookie-peddling Scout — Crundwell collected checks from residents. But after collecting these checks and depositing them in city bank accounts, she transferred the money to a secret bank account and purchased horses, jewelry and real estate for more than 20 years without her Dixon neighbors suspecting a thing. As a 10-year-old Scout, I remember almost having a Crundwell moment when I asked my mother one day if I could “borrow” from my cookie-sale stash when I needed lunch money — as long as I put it back in time to turn the money in to our Scout leader. My mother looked at me sternly and explained that the money did not belong to me — taking it wouldn’t be right. Our neighbors trusted me because I was a Girl Scout, she said, and it would be unethical to borrow the money, even if I intended to pay it back. Twenty-five years later, I’m interviewing business professionals who rationalized their behavior as “borrowing” money from their companies and planning to return it at some later date. I’ve seen good people commit extraordinary crimes. Specifically, I think back to my interview with Diann Cattani, who said she “borrowed” almost 500,000 from her company over a period of two years. I believe she intended to pay the funds back later. Unfortunately, they were never repaid, and she spent 18 months in a federal prison. Now Cattani spends much of her time lecturing business students about avoiding fraud. Selling cookies, I learned more than how to resist the temptation to embezzle. Since my parents were not involved in the process, other than walking me around the neighborhood, the buck stopped with me. I was in charge of all orders and counted my money every night. I learned never to set unrealistic sales goals; to always take responsibility for my work; and that if someone says “no,” have confidence, because another will say “yes.” A few weeks ago, I received a phone call. It was my friend’s 7-year-old daughter with her Girl Scout Cookie sales pitch. Not only was she poised and professional, she closed the deal by asking for the names of friends who might be interested in purchasing cookies. I was impressed — and ordered three boxes of Thin Mints. If she follows my old-school approach to Girl Scout Cookie sales, she may not be the sales leader in her troop, but she could be the next Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sandra Day O’Connor, Sally Ride, Barbara Walters or Gloria Steinem — all legendary Girl Scouts. I trust that they sold cookies themselves, learning about accountability along the way. I am raising a future Girl Scout in my house, and I look forward to our cookie-season chats as chances to teach her that there are no shortcuts in business — or in life. kelly@heliosdigital.com Read more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter.

Summarize: You may not be able to solve the situation--your mother is still going to be sick no matter what you do. However, you can be there for her. You can show up when you're needed. You can offer support and encouragement. It may not be dealing with the problem as you'd liked to do, but you will be doing something, which can help alleviate your feelings of uselessness. You can pray, meditate, or just take a few deep breaths, but whatever way, take a moment to calm yourself down. Accept that you do not have control over the situation. Your mother may be sick, but you can take the time you are spending with her to develop a better relationship with her than you've had in the past. Even if it doesn't change anything, it will help others realize that they aren't the only ones who are dealing with these feelings, which is a way you can provide support. It also opens up the discussion, so others have a chance to talk about their feelings, as well. Long-term stressful situations can lead to depression, and feeling useless could be a symptom of depression, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms.  Symptoms of depression include having trouble focusing, feeling pessimistic, not being interested in things you usually enjoy, feeling guilty, being extra tired, being consistently sad, and even experiencing physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches.  Feeling sad on occasion doesn't mean you’re depressed. Depression is a sustained period of not caring and feeling sad. When symptoms start to overrun your life, you may be depressed. If you are depressed, you may need medication, or you might need to seek out counseling to help you work through some issues, which may help alleviate your feelings of uselessness. Remember, being depressed is not a sign of weakness. It can be caused by a traumatic event in your life, but it could also be a chemical imbalance that needs to be corrected. Also, certain medications, your genes, and other problems like illnesses can also lead to depression.","output":"The situation you are facing involves your mother being sick, and while you may not be able to solve the issue or change her health condition, there are various ways you can support and be there for her.

During this challenging time, taking a moment to calm yourself through prayer, meditation, or deep breathing exercises can help. Acknowledging that you do not have control over the situation is an important step, but focusing on strengthening the relationship you have with your mother can provide a positive outcome for both of you.  Sharing your feelings of helplessness and concern with others can provide both you and them a sense of connection and support, opening up conversations for mutual understanding and encouragement.

However, Roy L's mechanic takes Luke on a wild ride during which Luke has a heart attack and dies.Ruddy, Jeff, and Jim try to cover this up by burying Luke in an old Edsel in a service pit out back. When Roy L and his lawyer Sam (Joe Flaherty) show up looking for Luke, Rudy explains that Luke drove to Florida in the Edsel. Roy L believes that Ruddy is lying, but Sam explains that there's no way to disprove this claim.Ruddy goes through with the first of several advertising stunts. Taking his camera crew out to a packed football stadium, they intend to hijack the signal for the football game to tell of their car lot. Things don't go as planned, when Jeff begins cursing on camera that the car he's standing by is red (he's superstitious about the color), and the woman they hired for the commercial ends up getting her dress ripped off on public television. The technique works, as the stunt makes newspaper headlines, and brings all sorts of people out to see the New Deal car lot.Roy L counters this with a little stunt of his own, but in the war to win customers, Rudy does one better, and steals away Luke's customers, by...

Cameron gave Carson his shirt back after washing it twice but still the stain didn't come out.  Given the context: How would Cameron feel afterwards?  Possible answers: bad about the stain, hopeful that Carson would be glad, disappointed with Cameron The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine the answer, let's analyze the situation step-by-step: 1. Cameron borrowed Carson's shirt. 2. Cameron washed the shirt twice in an attempt to remove a stain. 3. Despite Cameron's efforts, the stain did not come out. Given these steps, it is reasonable to assume that Cameron might feel: - Bad about the stain: Cameron put effort into trying to remove the stain and was unable to do so successfully. This could lead to feelings of guilt or disappointment since Cameron was responsible for the shirt when the stain occurred.  - Disappointed with himself: Cameron tried his best to fix the problem, but his efforts were unsuccessful. It's natural for an individual to feel disappointed in themselves if they can't solve a problem they feel responsible for. Considering these justifications, the answer to this question is most likely that Cameron would feel bad about the stain and disappointed with himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing. It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other as they convey the same meaning using slightly different wording and structure. Both sentences express that the individual in question retired to Italy and then returned to their private life after a span of two years. The primary difference between the two sentences lies in their construction, but the underlying idea remains the same.  In the first sentence, the focus is on the individual's retirement to Italy and their subsequent escape, followed by their return to a private life. The sentence is structured as follows: \\"He retired to Italy where he escaped and returned to private life for two years.\\" In the second sentence, the main elements are the same - the retirement to Italy, the period of two years, and the return to a private life. However, the sentence structure is slightly altered: \\"He retired to Italy, where he fled for two years and returned to his private life.\\" Both sentences convey the idea that the individual in question sought a period of respite in Italy, lasting for two years, before ultimately returning to their previous lifestyle.

Question: \\"Who has little trouble studying Ashkenazi Jews?\\"  Context: \\"A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\"  Answer:","output":"The question \\"Who has little trouble studying Ashkenazi Jews?\\" refers to the ease with which researchers and scientists can study the genetics and genealogy of Ashkenazi Jews due to their largely homogeneous genetic makeup and endogamous practices. The context provided from the 2006 study highlights the distinct genetic subgroup that Ashkenazi Jews form, regardless of their geographical origin in Europe. This distinctive genetic homogeneity allows researchers to study Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease compared to other populations that exhibit a higher degree of genetic diversity. The study lends credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group and allows researchers to explore various aspects of their genetic makeup, including potential genetic markers for diseases, unique traits, and ancestry. The endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and the ongoing exclusive marriage practices among Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, reinforce the prevalence of Ashkenazi genes. Researchers who benefit from this relatively straightforward population to study include geneticists, anthropologists, historians, and other medical professionals who can focus on understanding the prevalence of specific genetic diseases or conditions within the Ashkenazi community, tracing their origins and historical migrations, or identifying potential treatments or preventive measures related to this particular ethnic group. The fact that Haredi Jews often have extremely large families further supports research efforts in studying Ashkenazi genes, as it provides an ample number of subjects for genetic or genealogical studies while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the findings. With this increased sample size, researchers have a unique opportunity to draw statistically significant conclusions that can be beneficial to both Ashkenazi Jews and the broader scientific community. In conclusion, those who have little trouble studying Ashkenazi Jews are researchers and scientists who can take advantage of the genetic homogeneity and endogamy that characterized this population, as well as their distinctive demographic practices like having large families. These factors combine to create a rich source of information for researchers to study the genetics, genealogy, history, and medical aspects related to Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease and accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright kiddo, let's break down this problem and solve it step by step. We want to find the value of \\"a\\".  Our equation is: 0 = -17*a + 102 - 221 First, we need to add 102 and -221 which are like taking 102 apples and then taking away 221 apples. So that's: 102 - 221 = -119 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -17*a - 119 To solve for \\"a\\", we need to move -119 to the other side. Since it's -119, it will turn into 119 when we move it, like this: 0 + 119 = -17*a So now we have: 119 = -17*a Now, we need to divide by -17 to find out what \\"a\\" equals.

A Canadian woman has been denied entry to the U.S. by a border agent who cited a 2012 hospitalization for depression. Ellen Richardson, a paraplegic, had planned a 6,000 cruise departing from New York. The agent said she could 'pose a threat to herself or others' based on the 2012 hospitalization. Richardson wants to know how the agent had access to her personal medical information. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Canadian Woman Denied Entry to U.S. Over Past Hospitalization for Depression Introduction: A Canadian woman, Ellen Richardson, who intended to depart on a 6,000 cruise from New York, was left astonished when she was denied entry to the United States. The reason cited by a border agent was her 2012 hospitalization for depression, raising questions about how the agent gained access to her personal medical information. Body: Ellen Richardson, a paraplegic woman, had planned and saved up for her dream cruise trip that would start from New York, but her plans fell apart when she was told she could not enter the United States. The border agent responsible for this decision based it on a previous incident where Richardson had been hospitalized for depression in 2012.  The agent claimed that Richardson could 'pose a threat to herself or others' due to her past hospitalization for mental health issues. This explanation has not only left Richardson in shock but also prompted her to raise concerns about how this confidential medical information ended up in the hands of the border agent. Step 1: Gather information on privacy laws and medical information disclosure To shed light on the situation, it is essential to gather information on privacy laws surrounding the disclosure of personal medical information, both within and between countries. It is also crucial to understand the authority rights that border agents possess to access private data. Step 2: Investigate if there were any previous similar incidents Investigating previous incidents, where individuals had been denied entry based on their medical history, will help in understanding how often and under what circumstances such confidential information is used for border control purposes. Step 3: Speak to experts about the legality of the agent's actions Consulting with legal and privacy experts will provide valuable insights into whether the border agent's actions are in line with the law or if Richardson's rights have been infringed upon. Step 4: Reach out to Ellen Richardson for her perspective on the situation To ensure a balanced and informative article, it is necessary to hear from Richardson herself about her experience, emotions, and future plans following this incident. Step 5: Contact relevant authorities and ask for an explanation Reaching out to relevant authorities to request an explanation for the border agent's decision and the disclosure of Richardson's medical information will be an essential part of the investigation. Their response may offer clarification or even prompt changes in policies and procedures. Conclusion: The denial of entry to Ellen Richardson, based on her previous hospitalization for depression, raises significant concerns about the disclosure and use of personal medical information for border control purposes. As the story unfolds, it is hoped that further investigations will bring clarity to the legality of these actions and prevent such incidents from reoccurring in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi (   Tatsuguchi Nobuo ) , sometimes mistakenly referred to as Nebu Tatsuguchi ( August 31 , 1911 -- May 30 , 1943 ) , was a surgeon in the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) during World War II. He was killed during the Battle of Attu on Attu Island , Alaska on May 30 , 1943 . A devout Seventh - day Adventist , Tatsuguchi studied medicine and was licensed as a physician in the United States ( US ) . He returned to his native Japan to practice medicine at the Tokyo Adventist Sanitarium , where he received further medical training . In 1941 , he was ordered to cease his medical practice and conscripted into the IJA as an acting medical officer , although he was given an enlisted rather than officer rank because of his American connections . In late 1942 or early 1943 , Tatsuguchi was sent to Attu , which had been occupied by Japanese forces in October 1942 . The United States Army landed on the island on May 11 , 1943 , intending to retake the island from the Japanese . Throughout the ensuing battle , Tatsuguchi kept a diary in which he recorded its events and his struggle to care for the wounded in his field hospital . He was killed on the battle 's final day after the remaining Japanese conducted one last , suicidal charge against the American forces . Tatsuguchi 's diary was recovered by American forces and translated into English . Copies of the translation were widely disseminated and publicized in the US after the battle . The American public was intrigued by a Christian , American - trained doctor serving with Japanese forces on the island and by his apparent participation in assisting with the deaths of wounded Japanese soldiers in his field hospital during the battle 's final days . Translated excerpts from Tatsuguchi 's diary have been widely quoted in Western historical accounts of the battle , especially his final entry in which he recorded a farewell message to his family .  - The Aleutian Islands Campaign was a military campaign conducted by the United States in the Aleutian Islands, part of the Alaska Territory, in the American theater and the Pacific theater of World War II starting on 3 June 1942. A small Japanese force occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska, where the remoteness of the islands and the challenges of weather and terrain delayed for nearly a year a larger U.S./Canadian force to eject them. The islands' strategic value was their ability to control Pacific transportation routes, which is why U.S. General Billy Mitchell stated to the U.S. Congress in 1935, \\"I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.\\" The Japanese reasoned that control of the Aleutians would prevent a possible U.S. attack across the Northern Pacific. Similarly, the U.S. feared that the islands would be used as bases from which to launch aerial assaults against the West Coast.  - The , literally \\"Army of the Greater Japanese Empire\\", was the official ground-based armed force of the Empire of Japan, from 1871 to 1945. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of War, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. Later an Inspectorate General of Military (Army) Aviation became the third agency with oversight of the army. During wartime or national emergencies, the nominal command functions of the emperor would be centralized in an Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ), an ad-hoc body consisting of the chief and vice chief of the Army General Staff, the minister of war, the chief and vice chief of the Naval General Staff, the inspector general of military aviation, and the inspector general of military training.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The as part of the Supreme War Council was established in 1893 to coordinate efforts between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy during wartime. In terms of function, it was approximately equivalent to the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - The was the historical Japanese nation-state and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan.  - Attu is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010.  - The Emperor of Japan is the head of the Imperial Family and is the ceremonial head of state of Japan's system of constitutional monarchy. According to the 1947 constitution, he is \\"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.\\" Historically, he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion as he and his family are said to be the direct descendants of the sun-goddess Amaterasu, and his importance also lies in dealing with heavenly affairs, including Shinto ritual and rites throughout the nation.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.  - The Territory of Alaska or Alaska Territory was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from August 24, 1912, until January 3, 1959, when it was admitted to the Union as the State of Alaska. The territory was created as the District of Alaska on May 17, 1884.  - The Battle of Attu, which took place from 1130 May 1943, was a battle fought between forces of the United States, aided by Canadian reconnaissance and fighter-bomber support, and the Empire of Japan on Attu Island off the coast of the Territory of Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands Campaign during the American Theater and the Pacific Theater and was the only land battle of World War II fought on incorporated territory of the United States.

Timber farm used AM fungi, while Pine farm used other conventional agricultural methods. But I can use this background: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999).

From keeping kosher to observing the Sabbath, their way of life hasn't changed much over the centuries. However, one aspect that has evolved with the times is their ability to obtain certain ritual items through air freight. Many ancient Jewish laws require specific items for religious observances. For example, tzitzit are fringes worn on prayer shawls and tefillin are small black leather boxes containing scrolls with sacred writings. These items must be made according to precise specifications and can only be produced in certain parts of the world. In the past, obtaining these items meant relying on travelers or shipping by sea, which could take months to arrive. However, advancements in air freight have allowed for these items to be transported quickly and effectively. Now, communities around the world can receive ritual items from Israel or other locations within a matter of days, allowing for a continuation of their ancient traditions. This has been especially important in more remote areas where access to these items is limited. Air freight has also allowed for the transport of items used for Jewish weddings and circumcisions, both of which are important events in the Orthodox community. These items, such as chuppahs and mohels' equipment, can be transported from one location to another with ease. While modern technology may seem at odds with ancient traditions, air freight has become a vital tool for many Orthodox Jewish communities.

Russia supplies around 30% of Bulgaria's natural gas and electricity, making it the country's largest energy provider. However, concerns over Russia's political influence and the risk of supply interruptions have led many Bulgarians to call for diversification of energy sources. The protests come as Bulgaria is set to begin negotiations with Russia over the renewal of a long-term gas contract. Many Bulgarians fear that the government will agree to unfavorable terms, further strengthening Russia's grip on the country's energy sector. The protesters are also calling for greater transparency and accountability in Bulgaria's energy sector. They accuse the government of favoring Russian companies and failing to invest in renewable energy. Bulgaria has set a target of producing 25% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, but the protesters argue that the government is not doing enough to meet this goal. The protests have attracted widespread support, with politicians from across the political spectrum expressing solidarity with the demonstrators. The government has responded by promising to take steps to reduce Bulgaria's reliance on Russian energy and to promote renewable energy sources.

One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products.","output":"The frequency of collisions would be higher in case B, as higher concentrations of reactants usually lead to an increased frequency of collisions."},{"instruction":"Why would someone be unable to be bringing suit? going to court financially unable aggravation randomness great expense The best answer","output":"financially unable, as the inability to afford legal fees or other associated costs of a lawsuit may prevent someone from bringing suit."},{"instruction":"Are the questions What is the best demat account service provider in India? and What is the best DEMAT account provider for beginner? asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking for the same thing - the best demat account service provider in India for beginners."},{"instruction":"Pete envies Martin although he is very successful.

Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat. Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%. and the situation: Mike went to his local grocery store.

The US Olympic Committee picked the city today over Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, reports the Boston Globe. Now comes two years of wooing the International Olympic Committee, which will make its final choice in 2017. NPR thinks that Boston has a legitimate shot, though it expects a close competition with other cities that might include Rome; Paris; Budapest; Berlin; Doha, Qatar, and Baku, Azerbaijan. Plus this wild card: If South Africa bids, some in the IOC may be tempted to stage Africa's first Olympics ever, says NPR's Howard Berkes.","output":"Boston Selected to Compete for 2024 Summer Olympics The United States Olympic Committee has announced that Boston will be the official candidate city for the 2024 Summer Olympics, as reported by the Boston Globe. The decision was made after careful consideration of other potential US host cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Now, Boston will spend the next two years wooing the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in hopes of winning the bid for the games, which will be decided upon in 2017. Many believe that Boston has a strong chance of success, according to NPR. However, with other international cities such as Rome, Paris, Budapest, Berlin, Doha, Qatar, and Baku, Azerbaijan also in the running, competition for the coveted position will be fierce. Furthermore, the possibility of South Africa bidding for the games could provide a unique wild card element in the decision-making process for the IOC. Despite the challenges ahead, Boston is confident in its ability to host a successful event. City officials are proposing a compact Olympic venue plan, which would allow athletes, spectators, and media to be within a short distance of one another. The plan includes utilizing several existing sports facilities and temporary structures, thereby reducing costs and avoiding overbuilding. Other aspects of Boston's plan include utilizing the city's colleges and universities as athlete housing, and opening Boston Harbor as a key transportation hub. City officials hope that presenting Boston's history and culture as well as its exceptional sports scene will appeal to the IOC and win them the bid. If Boston is ultimately selected, it will be the first US city to host the Summer Olympics since Atlanta in 1996. The event is expected to bring significant economic benefits to the host city, though it will also pose significant logistical and security challenges. Regardless, Boston is ready to take on the task and showcase the best of what the historic city has to offer."},{"instruction":"When a multicellular organism is damaged, it will repair itself as Options: it mutates. the cells work together. the cells move. it makes its own food.","output":"The cells work together."},{"instruction":"By Damien Gayle and Andy Dolan A lottery winner who split from his wife after they scooped a £148million jackpot will marry a stable girl in a James Bondthemed ceremony, it is claimed.
