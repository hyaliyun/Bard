Premise: \\"The red sun gleamed from the silver edge of the black blade.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The blade could not be seen in the dark. \\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"The red sun gleamed from the silver edge of the black blade,\\" it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the hypothesis \\"The blade could not be seen in the dark.\\" To fully assess the hypothesis, we need to consider various factors associated with the blade's color, material, and its reflective properties. We can glean some information from the premise, but it is insufficient to reach a conclusion. 1. Blade color: The premise states that the blade has a black coloring. Black objects are known to absorb most light and reflect very little. This fact might lead us to initially think that the blade would be difficult to see in low-light or dark conditions. 2. Blade edge: However, the blade's edge is described as silver. Silver is known for its high reflectivity, meaning that it can efficiently reflect light. This characteristic might suggest that the blade's edge could be visible in dark conditions if a light source is present. 3. Environmental factors: The premise also mentions that the red sun gleamed, which indicates that there was a light source strong enough to cause the silver edge to reflect light at that specific moment. However, in dark conditions, the light sources usually are much weaker than the sun, so the blade's visibility could be different under such circumstances. In conclusion, while we can infer that the black blade may be less visible in low-light or dark conditions due to its color, the silver edge has the potential to make it more visible when light is reflected off it. However, given the limited information provided in the premise, we cannot definitively say whether the hypothesis \\"The blade could not be seen in the dark\\" is true or false. Further details about the specific environmental conditions, surrounding light sources, and the blade's material would be necessary to better evaluate the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. does jimbob have any friends?

Choose your answer from: a. unacceptable. b. acceptable.","output":"b. acceptable. The sentence \\"Gilgamesh never flies dragons\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break down the sentence to understand its structure and meaning better: 1. Syntactically, the sentence follows the general English sentence construction of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), which is common for English sentences.    - \\"Gilgamesh\\" is the subject of the sentence, referring to an individual or a character, which could be from mythology, literature, or any other source.    - \\"never\\" is an adverb of frequency, indicating that the action (in this case, flying dragons) does not happen at any point in time.    - \\"flies\\" is the verb, expressing the action of riding or flying creatures in the air, specifically dragons in this context.    - \\"dragons\\" is the object of the sentence, representing creatures that are typically associated with flying and fantasy or mythology. 2. Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable. It conveys the meaning that the character Gilgamesh does not partake in the activity of flying dragons. It makes sense within the context of a story or description where dragons are creatures capable of being flown and where Gilgamesh is an individual present in that world. Based on these factors, the sentence \\"Gilgamesh never flies dragons\\" is syntactically and semantically acceptable, so the correct answer is (b) acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's dive deeper into their backgrounds. Roger Hodgson is an English musician, singer, and songwriter, best known as the co-founder and former lead vocalist of the progressive rock band Supertramp. He was born on March 21, 1950, in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. His full name is Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson. He attended Stowe School, a prestigious boarding school in Buckinghamshire, where he first began to play music with friends in informal bands. In 1969, Hodgson co-founded Supertramp and remained with the group until 1983. During his time with Supertramp, they released several successful albums, such as \\"Crime of the Century\\" (1974), \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\" (1977), and \\"Breakfast in America\\" (1979), which is their most successful album to date. After leaving the band, Hodgson embarked on a solo career and released several albums, such as \\"In the Eye of the Storm\\" (1984), \\"Hai Hai\\" (1987), \\"Rites of Passage\\" (1997), and \\"Open the Door\\" (2000). He continues to perform as a solo artist and occasionally plays his Supertramp hits for fans. Max Green, whose full name is Maxwell Scott Green, is an English-American musician primarily known as the former bass guitarist of the American post-hardcore band Escape the Fate. Max Green was born on December 15, 1984, in Cheshire, England, and later moved to the United States. He was one of the original members of Escape the Fate, which formed in 2004, and was with the group until 2012, with a brief departure in 2010. He was involved in the initial success of the band, including their debut full-length album \\"Dying Is Your Latest Fashion\\" (2006) and subsequent releases \\"This War Is Ours\\" (2008) and \\"Escape the Fate\\" (2010). After leaving the band, Green had brief stints playing with several other musical projects, including The Natural Born Killers, Violent New Breed, and Falling in Reverse. Max Green stepped away from the music scene in 2015 due to personal reasons and has kept a relatively low profile since then. In conclusion, both Roger Hodgson and Max Green are musicians from England who have contributed significantly to their respective genres of music. While Hodgson has had a longer career and is associated more closely with the progressive rock movement, Green played a prominent role in the post-hardcore scene during his time with Escape the Fate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story. Question: When did his wife died?

Choose a more durable material: Michael could consider using a stronger and more scratch-resistant material for the new pencil case. Some possible materials include metal (like aluminum or stainless steel), plastic, or even a dense hardwood like oak or maple. 2. Apply a protective coating: Michael could apply a protective coating or finish to the new pencil case. For example, he could use varnish, polyurethane, or epoxy as a surface treatment to increase its scratch and dent resistance. These coatings can be applied to wooden pencil cases and can improve their durability significantly. 3. Incorporate cushioning or padding: Michael could design the new pencil case to include an internal padding layer (such as foam or rubber) that helps protect the content from impacts or scratches. This may not fully prevent dents on the exterior of the pencil case, but it may help protect the contents inside. 4. Reinforce the structure: Michael could incorporate additional reinforcements into the design of the new pencil case.

Question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Here is a premise: Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence? Here is a hypothesis: Should you mention that a letter disappeared after arriving to the address? Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the Premise In the given premise, a parcel has arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and then it disappeared. The question is whether you should remark its absence.  Step 2: Analyze the Hypothesis The hypothesis asks if you should mention that a letter disappeared after arriving at the address. Step 3: Identify the Similarities and Differences Similarities: Both the premise and the hypothesis involve something disappearing after arriving at its intended destination, and both ask whether or not you should acknowledge the disappearance. Differences: The premise involves a parcel, while the hypothesis involves a letter. However, this difference can be considered trivial as both are items that have arrived at an address before disappearing. Step 4: Determine the Relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis Given that the key difference between the premise and hypothesis is the item that has disappeared (parcel vs. letter), and that the main intent of the hypothesis likely refers to items in general, we can safely assume that the hypothesis is a more generalized statement of the premise. Step 5: Assess the Validity of the Conclusion It is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. If you would remark upon the absence of the parcel in the premise, it is likely that you would also mention the disappearance of a letter in the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also likely to be true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

First, gather your materials. You will need:     - A yogurt container (clean and empty)    - A nail (the diameter of the nail will determine the size of the hole)    - A torch or a source of heat (to heat up the nail)    - Pliers (to safely grab onto and manipulate the heated nail) Option: Heat up a nail with a torch, grab it with pliers, and push it through the bottom of the yogurt container. 2. Set up a safe and well-ventilated workspace. Find a suitable area outside or indoors with good ventilation and away from flammable materials. You can lay down aluminum foil or a fire-resistant mat to protect the surface you'll be working on. 3. Use the torch to heat up the nail. If using a gas torch, light it up and adjust the flame to a suitable size, then hold the nail in the flame for a few seconds until it gets hot. Be careful not to touch the nail with your bare hands, as it will be extremely hot and can cause burns. You can also use other heat sources, like a gas stove, but a torch will allow more precise heating. 4. Once the nail is hot, use the pliers to safely grab the heated end of the nail. Ensure that you have a firm grip on the nail using the pliers, but avoid putting too much pressure, as this may cause the heated nail to bend or break. 5. Carefully position the heated nail over the desired location for the hole on the bottom of the yogurt container. Keep the yogurt container on a stable surface to avoid slipping or sudden movements. 6. Gently push the heated nail through the plastic bottom of the yogurt container. Because the nail is hot, it will easily melt a hole into the plastic. Make sure you maintain control of the nail with the pliers, and try not to apply excessive force as this could damage the plastic or result in an uneven hole.  7. Repeat steps 3-6 for as many holes as you need in the bottom of your yogurt container. Space the holes evenly to allow for proper drainage when you start using the container for seed starting. 8. Once you have completed making the drainage holes, allow the nail to cool down before cleaning and storing it. 9. Thoroughly clean your workspace and remove any plastic residues. 10. Now your yogurt container is ready to be used as a seed starter! Fill it with a suitable seed starting mix or potting soil, plant your seeds, and watch them grow. Note: Using a scissors instead of pliers to hold the heated nail is not advised because the high temperatures can damage your scissors and the melted plastic might stick to them. Using pliers is a safer and better option for this task."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about víctor rodríguez  can be gathered from the following bio?

Both sentences are conveying the same message, which is that the National League won against the American League with a final score of 6 to 5. The only difference between the two sentences is the way they are written, but the overall meaning remains the same. In the first sentence, \\"The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 6 -- 5,\\" the emphasis is on the result of the game, followed by the specific outcome in terms of which team won and the final score. The use of double hyphens (--) indicates the separation between the winning and losing scores. The second sentence, \\"The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League with 6 -- 5,\\" also focuses on the result of the game, specifying the winning team and the final score. The use of the word \\"with\\" adds a slightly more casual tone to the sentence, but this does not affect the overall meaning. Again, the double hyphens (--) are used to separate the winning and losing scores. It is important to note that using double hyphens (--) as a separator between scores might not be the most conventional way to represent the final score. A more common way to express the score would be using a hyphen, a colon, or writing it out explicitly, such as \\"6-5,\\" \\"6:5,\\" or \\"6 to 5.\\" Regardless, both sentences are clear in their meaning and convey the same information about the game's outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While collecting her father's body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward. After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by birching Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate States of America, Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own.

It may help to nurse each twin individually in the early days of breastfeeding, when you and your babies are learning about latching on and positioning. This way you'll be able to spend a little more time and have extra hands to work with one baby at a time.  Nursing your babies individually can also help you learn about each baby's nursing habits. This can help you when you begin to simultaneously breastfeed them. Consider setting a nursing schedule for your twins so you can get them on a feeding schedule. If your babies are very small, work with a doctor or lactation consultant to make a schedule that will give your babies enough milk. For example, you may set an alarm to go off every hour and a half so you know that it's time to feed your twins.  A schedule can be helpful if you're so tired that you can't remember how long it's been since their last feeding. If you'd like to follow your babies' hunger cues and feed them whenever their hungry, just keep track of when you feed them and how long they nursed. Create a space where you have all the things you'll need while breastfeeding. You should have easy access to anything you'd need during the feeding so you won't have to interrupt the feeding. Ensure that you're comfortable since you'll be spending a lot of time breastfeeding. Consider having these in your breastfeeding area:  Nursing pillow and support pillows Water bottles Healthy snacks (such as granola bars, fruit, protein bars) Things to read Access to entertainment (such as a tablet, television, or laptop) Music to listen to Diapering supplies (if you need to quickly change one of the babies) Choose a nursing bra that you can easily unsnap or unclip with one hand in order to breastfeed. If you choose not to wear a nursing bra, consider wearing a comfortable top that gives you access to your breasts so you don't have to take off your entire top to breastfeed. For extra support, look for a nursing bra that contains an underwire. If you'll be simultaneously breastfeeding, ensure that you can easily access both breasts while wearing the bra. If you're concerned that your babies aren't latching on correctly, are difficult to position, or aren't getting enough milk, contact a lactation consultant. The lactation consultant can watch you breastfeed and identify any problems. They'll help you so that your babies are able to easily nurse on their own. Look for a board certified lactation consultant.  Find out if your hospital or birth center offers lactation consultants to work with you. You may be able to drop in to a weekly nursing session or have someone come to your home. You can also talk to other mothers of twins.

Article: Jeremy Kerr, a researcher at the University of Ottawa in Canada, and his colleagues analyzed more than 400,000 observations of bumblebee species collected in North America and Europe from 1975 to 2010. When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \\"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \\"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\\" says Kerr. \\"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it. It is likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have destructive impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,\\" says Dave Goulson, a bee researcher at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Exactly what can be done to help bumblebees is not clear. Kerr's team suggests that relocating colonies might be an answer but Goulson says that because the insects are mobile they are capable of moving northwards if there is suitable habitat available. Question: Which statement may Goulson agree with?

For their study, the researchers adapted a word-pairing test used to gauge bias in humans to do the same for the GloVe system. The upshot? Every single human bias they tested showed up, they report in the journal Science. \\"It was astonishing to see all the results that were embedded in these models,\\" one researcher tells Live Science. They found examples of ageism, sexism, racism, and more—everything from associating men more closely with math and science and women with arts to seeing European-American names as more pleasant than African-American ones. \\"We have learned something about how we are passing on prejudices that we didn't even know we were doing,\\" says another researcher.

Question: Information:  - André \\"Doctor Dré\\" Brown (born December 5, 1963) is an American radio personality and former MTV VJ. He was born in Westbury, New York.  - Westbury incorporated in 1932 as a village in Nassau County, New York in the United States. The population was 15,146 at the 2010 census. The Incorporated Village of Westbury is in the Town of North Hempstead. It is located about 18 miles(40 km) east of Manhattan.  - The year 1963 in radio involved some significant events , including the addition of FM - compatible radios in cars made by major American automobile companies , and the birth of future radio personality Doctor Dré  - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - A radio personality (American English) or radio presenter (British English) is a person who has an on-air position in radio broadcasting. A radio personality that hosts a radio show is also known as a radio host, and in India and Pakistan as a radio jockey. Radio personalities who introduced and played individual selections of recorded music were originally known as disc jockeys before the term evolved to describe a person who mixes a continuous flow of recorded music in real time. Broadcast radio personalities may include Talk radio hosts, AM/FM radio show hosts, and Satellite radio program hosts. Notable radio personalities include pop music radio hosts Martin Block, Alan Freed, Dick Clark, Wolfman Jack, and Casey Kasem, shock jock's such as Don Imus and Howard Stern, as well as sports talk hosts such as Mike Francesa and political talk hosts such as Rush Limbaugh.    What is the relationship between '1963 in radio' and 'radio broadcasting'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between '1963 in radio' and 'radio broadcasting' lies in the fact that 1963 was a significant year for the radio broadcasting industry, which experienced notable events and developments that influenced its growth and evolution. In 1963, radio broadcasting saw the introduction of FM-compatible radios in cars manufactured by major American automobile companies, effectively expanding the reach and accessibility of FM radio broadcasting. This development marked an important milestone as it allowed an increasing number of listeners to tune in to FM stations in their vehicles, thus broadening the audience for radio stations and advertisers. Additionally, 1963 is significant in the context of radio broadcasting as it witnessed the birth of future radio personality André \\"Doctor Dré\\" Brown on December 5th. Brown, who went on to become an influential radio personality and MTV VJ (video jockey), is a prime example of the impact radio personalities have on the format and success of radio broadcasting. Radio personalities are essential to radio broadcasting because they create an identity for the stations they represent and engage listeners through their on-air presence, conversation, and music selection. Furthermore, radio broadcasting in 1963 was operating in a dynamic and evolving landscape, with advancements in technology and shifts in the marketplace and consumer preferences influencing the direction of the industry. The potential for further growth and diversification created opportunities for new talent, such as Doctor Dré, to emerge and take on influential roles in the industry. In conclusion, the connection between '1963 in radio' and 'radio broadcasting' can be seen through the notable events and advancements that occurred during this year, which contributed to both the growth of radio broadcasting as an industry and the careers of radio personalities like Doctor Dré. These developments would shape radio broadcasting in the years to come, creating a lasting impact on the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Martha and the Vandellas (known from 1967 to 1972 as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas) were an American all-female vocal group formed in 1957. The group achieved fame in the 1960s with Motown. Selected Members of the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Formed in 1957 by friends Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams, the group eventually included Martha Reeves, who moved up in ranks as lead vocalist of the group after Williams' departure in 1962. Teenagers Rosalind Ashford and Annette Beard first became acquainted after a local music manager hired them to be members of a girl group he named The Del-Phis. Ashford & Beard, along with then-lead vocalist Gloria Williams, performed at local clubs, private events, church benefits, YMCA events and school functions. They were also being coached by Maxine Powell at Detroit's Ferris Center. One of the group's first professional engagements was singing background for singer Mike Hanks.  The group originally had up to six members, shortened to four. After another member left the group, she was replaced by Alabama-born vocalist Martha Reeves, who had been a member of a rival group, the Fascinations and had also been a member of another group, the Sabre-Ettes. In 1960, the group signed their first recording contract with Checker Records, releasing the Reeves-led \\"I'll Let You Know\\". The record flopped. The group then recorded for Checkmate Records, a subsidiary of Chess Records, recording their first take of \\"There He Is (At My Door)\\". That record, featuring Williams on lead vocals, also flopped.  Briefly separated, Reeves returned to a solo career performing under the name Martha LaVaille, in hopes of getting a contract with emerging Detroit label Motown. After Motown staffer Mickey Stevenson noticed Reeves singing at a prominent Detroit club, he offered her his business card for an audition. Reeves showed up at Motown on a wrong date (Motown auditions were held at Thursdays, while Reeves showed up to Motown's Hitsville USA studios on a Tuesday). Stevenson, initially upset, told Reeves to look out for clients and other matters. Soon Reeves became Stevenson's secretary and later was responsible for helping acts audition for the label. By 1961, the group, now known as The Vels, were recording background vocals for Motown acts. Prior to her success as lead singer of The Elgins, Sandra Edwards (then going by her surname Maulett) recorded the song \\"Camel Walk\\", in 1962, which featured the Vels in background vocals. That year, the quartet began applying background vocals for emerging Motown star Marvin Gaye, singing on Gaye's first hit single, \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" After Mary Wells failed to make a scheduled recording session feigning a short illness, the Vels recorded what was initially a demo recording of \\"I'll Have to Let Him Go\\". Motown was so impressed by the group's vocals - and Martha's lead vocals in the song - that the label CEO Berry Gordy offered to give the group a contract. Figuring that being in show business was too rigorous, Williams opted out of the group. With Williams out, the remaining trio of Ashford, Beard and Reeves renamed themselves The Vandellas, after Detroit's Van Dyke Street and Reeves' favorite singer, Della Reese.

Input: Article: The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay.  The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year.  Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month.  The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women.  Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \\"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper.  The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000.  He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \\"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\\" he said. \\"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction. Dr Samantha Haslett, a psychologist and expert in addiction at the Promos counseling centre, said, \\"It's compulsive in the same way as alcohol and gambling, and addicts find themselves completely unable to stop themselves, despite debt mounting and relationships breaking up. It's the thrill and the buzz of purchasing that ignores all the negative consequences.\\" People laugh at shopping addictions, but it's the same as food overeating:bulimicsdon't eat nice stuff, or things that are good for them. Shopping addicts are the same: they'll buy things they don't need or want or like. What they're buying is of no importance compared to the thrill they get spending money and acquiring something new. I've counseled people who have bought piles of bed linen and curtains and just left them piled up in the corner of the room.  I have seen people's marriages ruined. There's something more damaging about Internet shopping too because it takes place in the home, so the trick and secrecy is that much closer to the partner who is being tricked.  Tennis star Serena Williams this year admitted to kicking an Internet shopping addiction that saw her spending up to six hours a day online in an attempt to avoid being seen out in public.  \\"Every day I was in my room and I was online,\\" Williams said. \\"I wasn't able to stop and I bought, bought, bought. I was just out of control.\\" Confidence is also growing in online security. Danny Meadows-Klue, chairman of Interactive Advertising Bureau, the Internet commercial watchdog, said, \\"Online card fraud is a drop in the ocean compared to total credit card fraud, but it is increasing. We want to increase consumer confidence by encouraging shoppers to take simple steps to protect themselves.\\" But there are still barriers to online shopping, declares James Goudie, a consumer psychologist at North Umbria University. \\"For certain items some people prefer to shop personally, for example to try on an item of clothing and feel the quality. Payment of delivery charges is also  _ .\\"   Question: It can be learned from the passage that  _  .

The gaudy, red sweater ornament has dropped the word 'gay' for the word 'fun' in the lyric from the 19th-century carol Deck The Halls. The original line - 'Don we now our gay apparel' - has been altered by the Kansas-City based company for its new line of holiday merchandise. It now reads: 'Don we now our FUN apparel.' Break from tradition: Hallmark released this sweater ornament as part of its holiday line, changing the words of carol Deck The Halls to: 'Don we now our FUN apparel!' The ornament of the holiday sweater, decorated with bells, bow and priced at 12.95, is described as: 'When it comes to Christmas sweaters, gaudy can be good! Hang up this flashy sweater to make your tree's outfit complete. 'With its catchy phrase, Don we now our FUN apparel! everyone will be in on the joke.' Deck the Halls is a traditional Christmas carol with the tune dating back to 16th century Wales when it was called Nos Galan. The English lyrics were composed by the Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant in the late 19th century (although the 'fa la la' comes from the original Welsh). Carols were originally intended to be dances and not songs - and initially frowned upon by the church. Deck The Halls first appeared in the Pennsylvania School Journal in 1877 and was described as a 'Welsh air'. It has remained popular during the holidays ever since. In 1999, country music group SHeDAISY released a version of the song for Disney film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas. Deck The Halls is also the title of a 2006 comedy starring Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick and Kristin Davis. However the break with the traditional carol sparked anger among Hallmark customers who took to the company's Facebook page to complain. Val Buoni posted on Thursday: 'Hallmark has just made my boycott list for the idiotic change of lyrics in Deck the Halls. I will NEVER purchase anything from Hallmark again. 'Furthermore your ridiculous attempt at political correctness assumes that homosexuals dress differently. So you've alienated Christians as well as homosexuals.....good job Hallmark.' Paul J Kettle Jr added: 'I. am disturbed to hear that you have removed the long-standing word \\"gay\\" from your ornament. Had you not taken the politically-motivated. stance, nobody would have noticed or complained. 'Now, you have brought. this to the fore you are attracting attention, mostly negative. I have. used Hallmark exclusively for cards over many years, but I am thinking. now of migrating to another brand.' Customer Thomas F Reynolds blasted the company: 'We just cut up our gold crown card we have had forever. Keep rewriting Christmas carols and you will end up filing for bankruptcy. Disgraceful!' In a statement today, the company said:. 'Hallmark created this year's Holiday Sweater ornament in the spirit of. fun. When the lyrics to \\"Deck the Halls\\" were translated from Gaelic and. published in English back in the 1800s, the word \\"gay\\" meant festive or. merry. Hallmark customers were quick to post their outrage on the company's Facebook page on Thursday. Another Hallmark customer with a gold crown rewards card slammed the retailer for their decision to change a Christmas carol. Today it has multiple meanings, which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation. The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that, so the planning team decided to say what we meant: \\"fun.\\" 'That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it.'

In week 5, the Bears recorded the highest margin of victory of the season, defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 41-3. In the first quarter, the Bears scored first on a Robbie Gould 32-yard field goal, though Jacksonville would respond in the next quarter on Josh Scobee's 31-yard kick. In the second half, the Bears broke the deadlock by kicking another field goal and cornerback Charles Tillman returning a Blaine Gabbert interception 36 yards for a touchdown, breaking former Bears safety Mike Brown's franchise record for the most pick-sixes in a career. Tillman also tied Donnell Woolford for the most interceptions by a cornerback in team history. In the fourth quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 10-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Chicago would then extend their lead on Cutler's 24-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to increase the lead to 27-3. Bears linebacker Lance Briggs would then intercept Gabbert and score on a 36-yard return. Briggs and Tillman would become the first pair in league history to return interceptions for touchdowns in consecutive games, and the Bears became the first team in NFL history to return five interceptions for touchdowns in the first five games of a season. The Bears would close out the game with backup running back Armando Allen scoring on a 46-yard touchdown run. The victory improved the team's record to 4-1. The victory is the most lopsided win for the Bears since their 1985 44-0 victory over the Cowboys, and the 38 points scored in the second half are the most since the team scoring 49 second half points in the 1941 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces  ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. Sentence: October 26 / 27 , {{ hope }} to be vacation time .  Word: hope","output":"Part #1: Identify the word within the curly braces '{{ ... }}' Usage: In the given sentence, the word within the curly braces is 'hope'. This part of the task requires finding the word that needs a parts-of-speech tag assigned to it. Part #2: Understand the list of part-of-speech tags and their meanings Usage: The task provides a list of part-of-speech tags and their definitions, such as 'ADJ' for adjectives, 'NOUN' for nouns, and 'VERB' for verbs. This part of the task requires understanding and recognizing parts of speech in a sentence and their respective tag labels. Part #3: Analyze the sentence and determine the part-of-speech tag for the specified word Usage: In the sentence 'October 26 / 27 , hope to be vacation time', the word 'hope' functions as a verb. This is because it signals an event (hoping) and can form a predicate that governs other constituents in the sentence, such as 'to be vacation time.' Therefore, the part-of-speech tag for 'hope' in this context is 'VERB'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Information:  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - Marines, also known as a marine corps or naval infantry, are an infantry force that specializes in the support of naval and army operations at sea and on land, as well as the execution of their own operations. In the majority of countries, the marine force is part of the navy, but it can also be under the army like the \\"Troupes de marine\\" (French Marines) and \\"Givati Brigade\\" (Israeli Marines), or form an independent armed service branch like the United States Marine Corps.  - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states  South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas  in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves.  - A general officer is an officer of high rank in the army, and in some nations' air forces or marines.  - Nathaniel Prentice (or Prentiss) Banks (January 30, 1816  September 1, 1894) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War.  - The Battle of Cedar Mountain, also known as Slaughter's Mountain or Cedar Run, took place on August 9, 1862, in Culpeper County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. Union forces under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks attacked Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson near Cedar Mountain as the Confederates marched on Culpeper Court House to forestall a Union advance into central Virginia. After nearly being driven from the field in the early part of the battle, a Confederate counterattack broke the Union lines resulting in a Confederate victory. The battle was the first combat of the Northern Virginia Campaign.  - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history.  - The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee followed up his successes of the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsula Campaign by moving north toward Washington, D.C., and defeating Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia.  - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America.  - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.  - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals.  - Charles Sidney Winder ( October 18 , 1829 -- August 9 , 1862 ) , was a career United States Army officer and a Confederate general officer in the American Civil War . He was killed in action during the Battle of Cedar Mountain .  - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.  - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was arrested for disobedience by the duke in Weimar?  As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV... A:","output":"The last name of the person who was arrested for disobedience by the duke in Weimar is Bach. Johann Sebastian Bach was arrested for disobedience when he tried to leave his position at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar for a better position as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on... What is probably true about Sally Yates? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - She agrees with Obama - not enough information - She disagrees with Obama - She does not want to work for Obama A:","output":"Based on the text provided, it's likely that Sally Yates agrees with Obama. In the information given, she is quoted saying, \\"We are not done yet,\\" and \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" This suggests that she is supportive of the measures Obama has taken to shorten the sentences of certain inmates and bring about changes to the sentencing rules of nonviolent drug offenses. This aligns with the policy initiatives and sentencing changes President Obama has enacted. Furthermore, as Deputy Attorney General, Yates would be a key figure in enforcing the legal strategies and initiatives pursued by the administration. The fact that she is actively involved in the administration's efforts to secure more commutations suggests that she is on the same page as Obama in terms of criminal justice reform and related policy matters.  While it's wise to note that her exact personal views or sentiments about President Obama are not explicitly expressed in the text, her role, her quoted statement about the progressive work being conducted, and her anticipation of more individuals being given a second chance through the clemency initiative, imply a shared ideology with Obama in this context. Therefore, based on the details shared in the text, the best answer to pick would be that Sally Yates likely agrees with Obama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the Battle of Maxen. Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf , the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-Jägersdorf , and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.  However, disagreements with the Austrians over logistics and supplies resulted in the Russians withdrawing east yet again after Kunersdorf, ultimately enabling Frederick to re-group his shattered forces.

Definition: In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: In advanced cancer, including glioblastoma, the TGFβ pathway acts as an oncogenic factor. Some tumors exhibit aberrantly high TGFβ activity, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. We have observed that TGFβ can induce TGFβ2, generating an autocrine loop leading to aberrantly high levels of TGFβ2. We identified cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) as the critical mediator of the induction of TGFβ2 by TGFβ. CREB1 binds to the TGFB2 gene promoter in cooperation with SMAD3 and is required for TGFβ to activate transcription. Moreover, the PI3K-AKT and RSK pathways regulate the TGFβ2 autocrine loop through CREB1. The levels of CREB1 and active phosphorylated CREB1 correlate with TGFβ2 in glioblastoma. In addition, using patient-derived in vivo models of glioblastoma, we found that CREB1 levels determine the expression of TGFβ2. Our results show that CREB1 can be considered a biomarker to stratify patients for anti-TGFβ treatments and a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.Question: Does active CREB1 promote a malignant TGFβ2 autocrine loop in glioblastoma?

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.

Although the term \\"tree hugger\\" often refers to an environmental enthusiast or someone who shows a deep concern for preserving nature, it can also refer to a person who is highly involved in environmental movements, which are often associated with specific urban locations. San Francisco has been well known for its history of progressive social activism and embrace of counterculture movements. Additionally, the city and the surrounding Bay Area have a strong environmental conservation culture, supported by political policies, events, and organizations that advocate for green initiatives and sustainable living. Furthermore, San Francisco offers easy access to world-class nature reserves such as Redwood National Park and Muir Woods, which allows environmentally conscious residents to enjoy and engage with nature directly. While forests, rainforests, state parks, and universities might also attract environmentally minded individuals who care for the preservation of nature, these locations do not necessarily provide the same type of social and cultural context that San Francisco does.

Richard Melville Hall (born September 11, 1965), better known by his stage name Moby, is an American musician, DJ, record producer, singer, songwriter, photographer and animal rights activist. He is well known for his electronic music, veganism and support of animal rights. Moby has sold over 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him \\"one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America\\". In January 2010, Moby announced that he was to begin working on his next record. He said \\"the mood for this record will be more acoustic and less electronic than before\\". Around this time Moby started a heavy metal band with his friend Phil Costello, Diamondsnake, getting back to his roots. Diamondsnake released two albums on Facebook.  On February 15, 2011, Moby announced the release of his new album, Destroyed. It was released on May 16, 2011. A photography book with the same name was also released around the time of the album.  \\"Musically\\", he said, \\"it's very melodic and atmospheric and electronic, and if i had to sum it up i would describe it as: 'broken down melodic electronic music for empty cities at 2 a.m'.\\" The album cover, which was released with the new information, was taken in LaGuardia Airport. It is a picture of a sign that reads 'destroyed', part of the longer phrase \\"All unclaimed baggage will be destroyed.\\" The album consists of 15 tracks, one of them previously featured on the compilation A Night in NYC, titled \\"Rockets\\". Along with the album's announcement came the release of the EP Be the One, which contains 3 of the tracks from Destroyed The EP was released free for those who signed up for Moby's mailing list. For the next single, Moby put a poll on his website for fans to choose which single should be released next, and it came to be \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\".  On August 30, Moby posted another request for the third official single, this time asking fans to say which should be next, without a poll. After this, he announced the following day through his Twitter that the next singles are \\"After\\" and \\"The Right Thing\\".  On April 30, 2012, Moby released Destroyed Remixed, a limited edition 2CD collection of remixes of songs from the 2011 studio album, Destroyed. The release included three new exclusive remixes by David Lynch, Holy Ghost!, and System Divine, and also featured a brand new 30 minute ambient track by Moby called 'All Sides Gone'. Compiled and mixed by Moby, Destroyed Remixed was described as 'an eclectic mix of some the most exciting and interesting artists and DJ's in contemporary music'.  Between February and August 2013, Moby performed both acoustic and DJ sets at the Wanderlust Festival, which hosted events in Hawaii, Vermont, California and Colorado in the United States, and also in Canada and Chile internationally. He added a single Asia performance date at the 1 World Music Festival in Singapore. Moby also performed two 75-minute DJ sets at the Coachella festival in April which featured a unique visual collaboration with NASA, with various images from space projected onto screens during the performance. Moby followed-up with another DJ set at the Movement Detroit festival in May.  For Record Store Day 2013, Moby released a 7-inch record called The Lonely Night which featured former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan. An accompanying video was created by Colin Rich, of which Moby stated: \\"I'm really excited to have an experimental music video from this great video artist, and I feel like the slow, rich, and languorous desert visuals fit the song perfectly.\\" The track was subsequently released as a download with remixes by Photek, Gregor Tresher, Freescha and Moby himself.  In July, Moby announced that he would be releasing a new studio album entitled Innocents. The album had been written and recorded in the previous 18 months and was due for release in October. The album was recorded in Moby's apartment and features a number of guest vocalists, in keeping with earlier releases such as Play, 18 and Wait For Me. As with Destroyed, the photographs comprising the album's artwork were all shot by Moby. The first official single from the album is titled A Case for Shame while the previously released track The Lonely Night will also appear on Innocents. The album was produced by Grammy-winner Mark 'Spike' Stent. It was later revealed in August that The Perfect Life, which features Wayne Coyne, would be the next single, after a casting call for a music video was announced, calling \\"for obese Speedo-sporting bikers, nude rollerskating ghosts, and an S&M gimp proficient in rhythmic gymnastics\\"  Moby performed a DJ set in Las Vegas on September 1, before flying to Australia to DJ at an intimate show in Sydney, on the 19th. Moby will then DJ at the 10th annual Decibel Festival in Seattle. He then returned to Los Angeles to perform three shows at the Fonda Theatre on October 3-5 to promote the album, which would be his only \\"full live shows\\" for 2013 and 2014.  Moby stated that the reason for doing little to no touring for this album was that \\"when I go on tour I sit around a lot (cars, airports, hotels, etc), and when I sit around I can't spend my time making music. And pretty much all I want to do in life is stay home and make music. So, thus: a 3 date world tour.\\"  He conceded that he might return to world touring in the future.  Starting in around 2001, Moby launched a series of co-owned business ventures, with the two most prominent being the \\"Little Idiot Collective\\"--a New York City, U.S. bricks-and-mortar clothing store, comics store, and animation studio that sold the work of an \\"illustrators collective\\"--and a small restaurant and tea shop called Teany. Teany was cofounded in 2002 with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Tisdale. In a November 2006 interview, at which time he had removed himself from any previous business projects.  In November 2015 Moby opened the Vegan bistro Little Pine in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The restaurant serves organic, vegan, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and has a retail section with art and books, curated by Moby himself.  Moby's vision was to create a space that includes various aspects of society that he cares about. All of the restaurant's profits are donated to animal welfare organizations.  On August 23rd 2016 Moby announced the inaugural Circle V Festival along with the official video for 'Don't Leave Me' by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir.  The event took place at LA's Fonda Theatre and featured Blaqk Audio & Cold Cave on the bill amongst others in the evening and talks and vegan food stalls in the afternoon. Moby described Circle V as \\"the coming together of my life's work, animal rights and music. I couldn't be more excited about this event and am so proud to be head-lining.\\"  The second Circle V event took place on November 18th this time at The Regent Theatre in Los Angeles. Moby headlined the event for the second year with artists Waka Flocka Flame, Dreamcar and Raury featuring on the bill.

Arsène Wenger and Arsenal team in clear-the-air talks after drubbing Arsenal's players and management held clear-the-air talks at the club's Colney training complex on Sunday to digest the team's thrashing at Chelsea and focus on reviving the club's ailing title challenge against Swansea City in midweek. The capitulation in Arsène Wenger's 1,000th game in charge left Arsenal seven points adrift of their London rivals before Tuesday's visit of Swansea, and the manager is concerned at the manner in which his team have surrendered so meekly against the elite teams. The Frenchman has seen his team ship six goals at Manchester City and Chelsea, and five at Liverpool, all in Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, to leave their attempts to secure a first title since 2004 apparently forlorn before City's visit to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. Wenger had revealed after Saturday's humiliation that he and his squad had \\"to think deeply about [the loss] because it is not the first time\\" they had disintegrated in such a manner, with the manager accepting responsibility for the embarrassment. His players reported back for a light warm-down session on Sundayand, while team meetings are not unusual after games, the issues thrown up by the crippling disappointment across the capital were discussed as a group with key games to come. \\"I don't think our chances are over,\\" said the club captain, Thomas Vermaelen. \\"There are still a few games to play and, in England, you can do anything. I've learned that. You can easily come back even from behind. The teams are all so strong that anyone can beat anyone, so we must continue to believe in it and move on.\\" Vermaelen is expected to start against the Welsh club with Laurent Koscielny suffering from a calf complaint that forced him off at half-time on Saturday, though Arsenal may have both Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain available for the match despite the full-back's farcical sending off in the midfielder's stead. Gibbs was dismissed by the referee, Andre Marriner, for deliberate handball after it was deemed he had denied Chelsea a clear goalscoring opportunity, despite the fact it was Oxlade-Chamberlain who had touched Eden Hazard's 15th-minute shot round the post. That case of mistaken identity will be rectified on Monday, though Arsenal also intend to appeal against the midfielder's prospective one-match ban given Hazard's shot appeared to be flying wide and was therefore not a scoring chance. Marriner, who had ignored Oxlade-Chamberlain's admission of guilt on the pitch, apologised to Wenger and Gibbs once he had been made aware of his error and will discover on Monday whether he is to officiate in the top flight next weekend. The visitors were already 2-0 down at the time and went on to concede another four goals to register the joint-heaviest defeat of Wenger's tenure in his landmark match. \\"It leaves it in a very bad situation,\\" said Wenger. \\"But we want to respond. When you don't turn up in a game of that stature, nobody takes it easy. We have to win the next game and focus on that, to give a strong response. It is going to be tough now, very, very tough, but we have to respond quickly because we are in a situation where, after such a disappointment, the next games become vital. \\"We felt we prepared properly with the intensity we did but we did not turn up for our game of the season, so it is puzzling. We were never even in it. After 20 minutes it was game over and it became a long afternoon, a long, dramatic, dreadful afternoon. We were shocked and knocked down. The team is healthy and willing but still the way it happened … we have to think deeply about it because it's not the first time. You could blame and blame but it does not help. What is important now is weshow we have the capacity to respond.\\" Wenger, who has cancelled his pre-match media duties on Monday, has an FA Cup semi-final against Wigan Athletic to come and is still expected to sign a new contract at Arsenal at the end of the season, with his current deal running down to its conclusion. Yet there is a recognition within his squad that some steel must be mustered before Saturday's game against City, with a response against Swansea vital to rebuild confidence. \\"I don't know why but it looks like we don't fancy early kick-offs away,\\" said Per Mertesacker. \\"It looks like we are going to have to apply to the Football Association to not play at 12.45 away. That would help us a lot. But we must put this behind us now show our character and bounce back against Swansea. It's a good opportunity to react quickly after this result.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Arsenal's players and management held clear-the-air talks following their defeat to Chelsea and focused on reviving the club's title challenge against Swansea City in midweek. Arsène Wenger expressed concern at his team's performance against elite teams and urged a strong response in the upcoming games.

In the past,concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet.But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic.which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming,in other words,by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels.     Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing.The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place.This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth.     However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere,where temperatures seem to be falling.Scientists conclude,therefore ,that up to now natural influences on the weather have gone beyond those caused by man.The question is:Which natural cause has most effect on the weather?     One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun.Astronomers at one research station have studied the hot spots and 'cold' spots (that is, the  ly less hot spots)on the sun.As the sun rotates ,every 27.5 days,it presents hotter or colder faces to the earth,and different aspects to different parts of the earth.This seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution of the earth atmospheric pressure,and consequently on wind...

Article: Your car is a necessary part of your life. You use it every day. Of course, you want to hold on to it so you make sure it has the latest alarm and immobilizer. But despite all these, cars like yours are still stolen every day. In fact, in this country, one car is stolen almost every minute! And if your car is stolen, you only have a 50:50 chance of seeing it again. Each year, car crime costs nearly PS3 billion. Of course, if you're insured, you won't lose out, or will you? Firstly, you will have to pay extra insurance later on, and then you may not be offered the full amount by the agent. You will probably have to hire a car and you will also lose the value of the contents and accessories   in the car. Now comes the solution. An RAC Trackstar system, hidden in one of 47 possible secret locations in your car, is the key of our system. If your car is stolen, radio signals are sent at twenty-second intervals from the car to the RAC Trackstar National Control Center via a satellite network. Then a computer gives the vehicle's exact location, speed and direction. The RAC Trackstar National Control Center, which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, will immediately inform the police in the area where the car is located. Because the police receive information every twenty seconds, they will always know the vehicle's location. Once the thief has been arrested, your car will be returned to you. RAC Trackstar is unique in being able to provide the National Control Center with details of the exact location of your car, its speed and direction. And speed is the key to successful recovery of a stolen vehicle. RAC Trackstar Control will immediately tell the police if you report your car stolen and under the 24-hour Guardian Option. _ will also tell you if your car has been stolen. RAC Trackstar's constant updates mean the police are kept informed of the car's location. All these greatly improve your chances of seeing your car again. Question: According to the passage, people with RAC Trackstar   _  . Options: A: automatically find directions B: seldom get their vehicles damaged C: have less chance of being in an accident D: are more likely to get the stolen cars back The answer is:","output":"D: are more likely to get the stolen cars back.

They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the \\"Most Powerful Women in the World\\" list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \\"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\\" list, having earned 35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned 40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyoncé and Jay Z placed at number one on the \\"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\\", for collectively earning 78 million. The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \\"highest-earning power couple\\" for collectively earning 122 million in 2009.

Trump tweeted he had a \\"very good talk\\" with Moon and updated Abe on plans for his anticipated summit with Kim. Key U.S. leaders are expressing growing optimism that decades of hostility on the Korean Peninsula are closer than ever to coming to an end.  Trump said at a White House news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Friday \\"I don't think he's playing\\" when asked about the historic summit between North and South Korea. Trump added a meeting would be scheduled \\"very shortly\\" but didn't specify a timeline, saying up to three possible sites are being considered for the much-anticipated summit in late May or early June.  Earlier Friday, Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea, when he crossed the border to shake the hand of South Korean President Moon Jae-in.  The two leaders agreed to work toward removing all nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula and vowed to pursue talks that would bring a formal end to the Korean war.  North Korea has in the past made similar commitments about its nuclear program, but failed to follow through. Asked whether Pyongyang's commitment is real this time, Trump said \\"we're not going to get played.\\"  \\"This isn't like past administrations. We don't play games,\\" said Trump, adding that previous administrations had been \\"played like a fiddle.\\"  \\"We will come up with a solution, and if we don't we will leave the room,\\" he said.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also expressed hope Friday that talks with North Korea will bear fruit. \\"I can tell you that we are optimistic right now that there's opportunity here that we have never enjoyed since 1950,\\" Mattis said before a meeting at the Pentagon with the Polish defense minister.  \\"I don't have a crystal ball,\\" he added. \\"So, we're going to have to see what they produce.\\" Question: What is the exact time schedule of Trumps meet with Kim?

On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.  Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second (186,000 miles per second). 1 light year = (speed of light) * (time) 1 light year = (300,000 km/s) * (1 year) Now, we need to convert years to seconds: 1 year = 365.25 days (taking into account leap years) = 365.25 * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds So, 1 light year = 300,000 km/s * (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60) s ≈ 9.461 x 10^12 km For an object 10 light years away from Earth: Distance = 10 * (9.461 x 10^12 km) ≈ 94.61 x 10^12 km Therefore, the object is approximately 94.61 trillion kilometers (58.79 trillion miles) away from Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Imagine you're riding your bike, and the speed you're going at every moment is the derivative of your path. Now, let's look at the first question. We have a formula, which is like a recipe, for finding the rate of change (derivative) of e^(2x). We can think of e as a special number, about 2.7-ish, and 2x means we double x every time. So, the derivative of e^(2x) shows how fast it's changing. To find it, we use another formula: the derivative of e^(ax) equals a * e^(ax). So for our problem, derivative of e^(2x) = 2 * e^(2x). Now the second question asks us to prove another formula. It's like showing that every time you add 2 Lego blocks together, you get 4 dots on top.  We are asked to prove that the derivative of e^(f(x)) is equal to f'(x) * e^(f(x)). Here, f(x) is any function (like x^2 or 3x), and f'(x) is the derivative of that function.

Answer choices: - A drug.  - Pesticides  - cigarettes  - A computer  - Toxicity  - jet fuel  - copper  - PDAs A:","output":"To determine which items from the given list can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA, we need to evaluate each option based on their potential to cause cellular damage and interact with genetic material. 1. A drug: Some drugs, particularly chemotherapy drugs, can cause DNA damage and potentially lead to cancer. However, most drugs are designed to treat specific conditions and minimize harmful side effects, so only specific drugs could cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 2. Pesticides: Some pesticides contain carcinogenic chemicals that can cause DNA mutations when humans are exposed to them directly or indirectly through the food chain. Therefore, pesticides can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 3. Cigarettes: Cigarette smoke contains a multitude of carcinogenic chemicals that can cause DNA damage and lead to cancer. As a result, cigarettes can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 4. A computer: Computers do not emit any substances or radiation known to directly cause DNA mutations, so a computer cannot cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 5. Toxicity: Toxic substances, generally, can cause a wide range of cellular damage, including damaging DNA. If the toxic substance is a carcinogen, it can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 6. Jet fuel: The initial statement mentioned that jet fuels can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 7. Copper: In general, copper exposure at normal levels is not considered a carcinogen.

Answer choices: - It reproduces quickly  - hospitalization  - decreases  - It dies and never comes out  - It stays active  - It remains dormant  - They may not survive.  - It helps them survive The answer is:","output":"It remains dormant. Herpes is a virus that can infect a person and stay dormant in their nerve cells for extended periods without displaying any symptoms. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) has two varieties, HSV-1 (which typically causes oral herpes) and HSV-2 (which usually results in genital herpes). Once the herpes virus enters the body, it travels to the nerve cells and remains in a latent or dormant state. It can reactivate at any time, often triggered by factors such as stress, illness, or immune suppression. When reactivation occurs, the virus travels back down the nerve cells to the skin surface, leading to an outbreak of herpes symptoms. During the dormant phase, the virus remains in the person's body but does not actively replicate or cause symptoms. This is why the answer to the question is \\"It remains dormant\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He says that \\"cycles of freezing and thawing water cause ice wedging\\" and \\"the fact is that ice seldom freezes or thaws at a uniform rate\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? OPTIONS: 1. In the winter. 2. erosion. 3. mechanical. 4. Physical weathering. 5. Dilution. 6. friction. 7. it fluctuates. 8. kinetic. The answer is:","output":"7. it fluctuates. Step 1: Understand the information provided by the teacher. The teacher mentioned that \\"cycles of freezing and thawing water cause ice wedging\\" and \\"the fact is that ice seldom freezes or thaws at a uniform rate.\\" It means that ice wedging occurs due to the changes in the state of water, and this process doesn't have a constant rate. Step 2: Analyze the options available. We need to find the option that best represents the fact that ice wedging occurs due to temperature changes and doesn't have a uniform rate. Option 1 mentions \\"In the winter,\\" which only indicates the season and doesn't describe the rate of ice wedging. Option 2, \\"erosion,\\" and option 3, \\"mechanical,\\" are terms related to weathering and the breakdown of rocks but are not specific to the rate of ice wedging. Option 4, \\"Physical weathering,\\" is a broader term for the processes that cause the breakdown of rocks, and ice wedging is one example, but it doesn't describe the rate of ice wedging. Option 5, \\"Dilution,\\" and option 6, \\"friction,\\" are also unrelated to the rate of ice wedging as they describe other processes and forces. Option 7, \\"it fluctuates,\\" suggests that the rate of ice wedging is not constant and depends on the changing conditions, fulfilling both requirements provided in the hints given by the teacher. Option 8, \\"kinetic,\\" refers to the energy of motion and is unrelated to the rate of ice wedging. Conclusion: Considering the hints given by the teacher and analyzing the available options, the best answer to the question \\"What is the rate of ice wedging?\\" is option 7, \\"it fluctuates,\\" as it reflects the information given by the teacher."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: yffffyyyfyiiiy Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. The task is to find the longest palindrome within the given string. The longest palindrome may be a part of the string rather than the whole string.

However, \\"yffffyyyfy\\" is the largest substring that is a palindrome in the given string, so this should be our returned result. To solve this problem systematically, we could use a programming strategy known as dynamic programming. We essentially set up a 2D array where the cell at the intersection of row i and column j indicates whether the substring from i to j is a palindrome. We start by setting all single character substrings to be palindromes and then gradually examine larger and larger substrings, updating our table as we go. Once we have our table, we simply need to find the longest substring that we marked as a palindrome. But in general, without using any program, the idea is to search through the string from both forward and backward to see whether the characters match or not. If they do, continue the search until no match or the end of substring is reached.

Does the sentence \\"In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team.\\" answer the question \\"What year were professional players allowed to play in the  Summer Olympics?\\"","output":"The provided sentence \\"In the past, the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team,\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What year were professional players allowed to play in the Summer Olympics?\\" However, it implicitly suggests that there were certain regulations in place regarding the participation of particular types of players, such as over-age or professional, in the Olympics. To answer the question, we must delve deeper into the history of the Olympics and the changes in eligibility rules concerning professional athletes. The modern Olympic Games, established in 1896, were originally intended to showcase the talents of amateur athletes, as they were concerned with the principles of fair play, sportsmanship, and recreation. However, over time, as professional athletes became more prominent and the distinction between amateurs and professionals started to blur, these restrictions began to pose challenges for many Olympic sports. As a result, eligibility rules have evolved over the years to accommodate these changes. One of the key moments in this evolution occurred in 1971 when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) amended the definition of amateurism, allowing professional athletes to participate in certain sports, like tennis, provided they did not receive monetary compensation. This decision marked the beginning of a shift in the rules regarding professional participation. The most significant change came in 1986, when the IOC decided to adopt a sports-specific approach, meaning that the international federation governing each sport could determine its criteria for eligibility. Consequently, this allowed professional athletes to participate in the Summer Olympics, provided they met the specific eligibility requirements set forth by their respective sport's governing body. For example, in basketball, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) began allowing professional athletes to compete in the Summer Olympics starting in 1992—this gave rise to the famous USA \\"Dream Team.\\" In summary, the sentence provided does not directly address the question of when professional players were allowed to play in the Summer Olympics. The timeline for allowing professionals to participate varies based on the specific sport and the decisions made by the respective international sports governing bodies. However, the major turning point when the IOC began to accept professionals in general occurred in 1986."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.  - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots  \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek  \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.  - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials.   - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.  - Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge  a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.  - The chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po). The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well. Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \\"chalcogen\\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \\"chalcogen\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word \\"khalks\\" () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze/brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore or coin), and the Latinised Greek word \\"gens\\", meaning \\"born\\" or \\"produced\\".  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.  - Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.  - Chromium trioxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO. It is the acidic anhydride of chromic acid, and is sometimes marketed under the same name. This compound is a dark-purple solid under anhydrous conditions, bright orange when wet and which dissolves in water concomitant with hydrolysis. Millions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly for electroplating. Chromium trioxide is a powerful oxidiser and a suspected carcinogen.  - Pollucite is a zeolite mineral with the formula (Cs,Na)AlSiO·2HO with iron, calcium, rubidium and potassium as common substituting elements. It is important as a significant ore of caesium and sometimes rubidium. It forms a solid solution series with analcime. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system as colorless, white, gray, or rarely pink and blue masses. Well formed crystals are rare. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. It has a brittle fracture and no cleavage.  - The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, HCrO of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent.  - Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol.  - Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold (or, according to some, silver/colorless) alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at 116 °C (177 °F). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.  - Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides FeO·\\"n\\"HO and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)).  - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - Caesium chromate , the caesium salt of chromic acid , is used to produce caesium vapour by reaction with silicon , boron , or titanium , which is used to in the final stages of creating vacuum tubes ; the caesium vapour reacts with the remaining gases , including nitrogen and oxygen .  - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).  - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\".   - Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine.  - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.  - Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium.  - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.  - Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion yearsmore than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe.  - Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state.  - Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water.  - Kernite, also known as rasorite is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture.

Article:","output":"Title: Legal Battle Leads to Release of Secret Tapes, Implicating Gerry Adams in Jean McConville's Murder Recently, new information has come to light about one of the most infamous murders during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Secret tapes, which were supposed to be released only after the deaths of all concerned parties, have been passed to the police in Northern Ireland after a long and controversial legal battle. The tapes are believed to be a crucial factor behind the arrest of Gerry Adams in Antrim and highlight many previously unknown details about the case. The tapes specifically link Adams, a Sinn Féin leader, to the notorious murder of Jean McConville, a mother of ten who had been brutally abducted, executed, and secretly buried in 1972. At least two ex-IRA operatives have provided damning evidence on these recordings, further implicating Adams in the heinous crime. They claim they served alongside Adams and were present when he ordered McConville's killing. Despite these serious allegations, Adams has consistently and vehemently denied any involvement in her murder. The release of the secret tapes has raised many questions about the validity of their contents and the possible impact they may have on the already contentious atmosphere in Northern Ireland. The community, which has struggled to overcome the deep-rooted hostilities between the Catholic and Protestant groups, remains divided in its search for justice and truth. Gerry Adams, a prominent figure in Northern Ireland's politics, has been at the forefront of the peace process since the late 20th century. As leader of Sinn Féin, his role in the public eye has been one of advancing for peace and reconciliation for decades. However, the release of the secret tapes threatens to undermine these efforts, casting doubt on his commitment to justice and truth. The tapes not only highlight Adams' alleged role in Jean McConville's murder but also reveal the menacing nature of the operation. Investigators believe the IRA targeted McConville for allegedly passing information to the British authorities, an offense punishable by death. Her abduction, execution, and secret burial were carried out with chilling efficiency, leaving her family to suffer in the dark for decades. The devastating implications of these revelations have reignited the painful memories of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The legal battle to release the tapes has been a contentious issue for years, with authorities arguing that the information could be vital in bringing those responsible for these crimes to justice. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the tapes could jeopardize the fragile peace process and exacerbate tensions between communities. Regardless of the arguments, the truth remains that a mother of ten faced an unimaginably brutal fate at the hands of her abductors. Through the release of the secret tapes, her family may finally have the opportunity to get answers and justice for the tragic loss that they have endured for decades. The weight of the allegations against Gerry Adams is now significantly greater than before. The secret tapes present potentially damning evidence that, if proven true, could change the course of history in Northern Ireland. The question remains whether these recordings will lead to justice and closure for the McConville family, or if they will ultimately fuel further divisions and violence. The community, and indeed the entire world, will be watching closely to see what unfolds in the wake of these chilling revelations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, some routes due to be completed before then will not be ready until 2020, resulting in new trains sitting in sidings. Under the original plan Reading to Didcot should have already been completed, with Oxford and Bristol next in 2016. But because work has fallen behind, Didcot is expected to be two years late in 2017, and Newbury and Oxford three years late in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Bristol Temple Meads will not see electric trains until 2020, and the East West rail link from Oxford to Bletchley is delayed until the early 2020s.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Input: Question: How many years did the war where Lyon served with the 2nd Battalion last? Passage 1:Lyon was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, the North Staffordshire Regiment in February 1900, but two months later, in April of the same year, transferred to the 2nd Battalion of the regiment. The 2nd Battalion was a regular battalion and was at the time on active service in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where Lyon joined the battalion and served with it throughout the war being Mentioned in Despatches in 1901. He was promoted to lieutenant on 19 January 1901, while in South Africa. After peace was declared in May 1902, Lyon left Cape Town on board the SS Bavarian and arrived in the United Kingdom the following month. He remained with the 2nd Battalion when it was posted to India in 1903 where he became adjutant and was promoted to captain.  Passage 2:Burn made his debut in County Cricket for Durham in the 1985 Minor Counties Championship against Cumberland. From 1985 to 1991, he represented the county in 40 Championship matches, the last of which came against Cambridgeshire. Burn also represented Durham in the MCCA Knockout Trophy, making his debut in that competition against Hertfordshire in 1986. From 1986 to 1991, he played 6 Trophy matches for the county, the last of which came against Cumberland. It was for Durham that Burn made his debut in List A cricket against Derbyshire in the 1985 NatWest Trophy. From 1985 to 1991, he represented the county in 6 List A matches, the last of which came against Glamorgan in the 1991 NatWest Trophy. Following Durham's elevation to first-class status at the end of the 1991 season, Burn played no further matches for the county.  Passage 3:Persoonia terminalis was first reported by Lawrie Johnson of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, in the 1981 edition of Flora of New South Wales. He viewed it as a distinctive subspecies of Persoonia nutans, a broadly defined species that included many forms since classified as distinct. Queensland botanists Trevor Donald Stanley and Estelle M. Ross classed P.terminalis as part of Persoonia oxycoccoides in their 1983 work Flora of South-eastern Queensland. They considered it more likely a species in its own right, as they believed the description of the Queensland populations did not match the P. oxycoccoides from central New South Wales. Upon re-examining Persoonia nutans and Persoonia oxycoccoides, Johnson and Peter Weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species, and that Persoonia terminalis was described as such in 1991. The type specimen was collected south of the Torrington pub on the Emmaville–Torrington road by Weston and ecologist Peter Richards, and is now housed in the National Herbarium of New South Wales, which is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney and Office of Environment and Heritage. The Herbarium houses over 1.2million other specimens. The generic name Persoonia is derived from the name of South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The specific name terminalis refers to the inflorescences (clusters of flowers) that are in this species at the ends of the branchlets. Its common name is the Torrington geebung.

Before becoming the Catholicos-Patriarch of the East, Darmo served as the Metropolitan (June 1952 to October 1968) of the Church of the East in India. His pivotal moment came on October 11, 1968, when he was ordained as the Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East at St. Zaia Cathedral in Baghdad, Iraq. This significant milestone made him the first and 120th Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East, following no predecessor in this particular line. Throughout his tenure, Thoma Darmo held the title of \\"His Holiness Mar Thoma Darmo,\\" demonstrating his importance and respect within the church hierarchy. Under his leadership, the Ancient Church of the East continued to uphold and maintain its religious practices and traditions.

Answer:","output":"José María Montes was an Argentine prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, who was born on March 22, 1920, in Almirante Brown, Argentina, and passed away on September 2, 2011. The key details about José María Montes extracted from the given bio are as follows: 1. Montes's key achievements revolve around various roles and appointments in the Roman Catholic Church, particularly in Argentina. His service to the Church was distinguished by his various appointments and the years associated with each. 2. Montes was ordained as a priest on December 20, 1958, affiliating with the Archdiocese of La Plata, a notable milestone in his career as a clergyman. 3. On June 15, 1978, José María Montes was appointed as an Auxiliary Archbishop of the Archdiocese of La Plata, which is another significant appointment in his ecclesiastical career, demonstrating his growing prominence within the Church. 4. Additionally, Montes also held the title of Titular Bishop of Lamdia. He was ordained as a bishop on August 15, 1978, strengthening his stature within the Catholic hierarchy. 5. Following these appointments, Montes was assigned to the Diocese of Chascomús on January 19, 1983. This appointment signaled a further expansion of his responsibilities within the Church. 6. Montes's tenure in the Diocese of Chascomús came to an end upon his retirement on July 3, 1996, marking the conclusion of his notable career as a clergyman and Church official. 7. However, Montes was not without controversy. A grandmother affiliated with the activist group called \\"the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo\\" accused him of concealment in a 1977 incident.

LA siblings Ted and Susan Johnson join their parents in Kenya where their father, Earl, works at a NASA tracking station, and their mother, Jean, works at a clinic. Ted's dreams of roughing it on the savannah are squashed when Jean leads him into a house that looks like it belongs in Pasadena, California. Although Jean forbids her children to explore, Ted and Susan sneak out to a nearby watering hole to meet with a Masai tribal boy named Morogo. Morogo shows the siblings the wildlife of Kenya and they show him how to play video games. One day, Jean comes home to discover Morogo in her home. Ted and Susan plead with their parents to let Morogo be their guide and the parents reluctantly give in. One day, Ted kicks a soccer ball over a barrier and it lands against a sleeping rhino. Morogo sneaks up on the animal, retrieves the ball, and places a small stone on the rhino's side. He then gives Ted another stone, daring him to do the same. The rhino awakens as Ted nears, causing him to flee. A laughing Morogo tells him that a person must approach a rhino downwind or it will smell him. Kipoin, Morogo's father, is displeased his son is keeping company with Americans, because they are \\"cattle eaters\\" and is even more disgusted to learn they eat fish. One day, the trio comes across a cheetah cub whose mother has been killed by a poacher. Susan insists they take the cub home and talk their parents into letting them raise it. The cub, Duma, becomes the household pet, playing ball, wrestling, and riding in the family car. Ted trains her to come when he blows a whistle.

The bright Sunday morning sun illuminated the stained glass windows, diffusing multi-colored hues across the congregation. Attendance is up today, thought Greg. As the organist was nearing the end of the Prelude, he stepped up to the podium. \\"Please take your hymnals and turn to page 23, and let's stand and sing 'Holy, Holy, Holy.'\\" Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful. Standing there in her choir robe, she looked like a redheaded angel. If they could just get married, Greg could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her. Who thought that God created humans? - Attendant - not enough information - Greg. - Dr. Huff.","output":"Step 1: Identify Greg's concerns and potential outcomes. Concerns: a) Greg feels guilty about his thoughts while kissing Cynthia. b) He's worried about dishonoring Cynthia or his commitment to God. Potential Outcomes: 1) Greg continues to suppress his feelings and feels guilty. 2) Greg talks to Cynthia about his feelings and they maintain their boundaries. 3) Greg and Cynthia decide to get married, which may alleviate his guilt. Step 2: Consider the factors in Greg's decision-making process. Factors: a) The Bible verse - Matthew 5:28 b) His feelings for Cynthia c) Their commitment to God Step 3: Analyze each potential outcome. Outcome 1: Pros: Greg can maintain his commitment to God and won't dishonor Cynthia. Cons: He will continue to feel guilty and may potentially harm his relationship with Cynthia. Outcome 2: Pros: Greg has an open conversation with Cynthia about his feelings; they can support each other, maintain their boundaries, and honor their commitments to God. Cons: They may face challenges in suppressing their desires, which may strain their relationship. Outcome 3: Pros: Greg and Cynthia can express their love for each other without guilt and honor both their commitment to God and each other. Cons: They may be rushing into marriage, and the sudden decision could lead to unexpected challenges or judgement from others. Step 4: Make a decision based on outcomes and factors. In this situation, it's essential for Greg to consider his commitment to God and his relationship with Cynthia. The best course of action would be for Greg to have an honest conversation with Cynthia about their emotions and to reaffirm their boundaries. By doing so, they can support each other while maintaining their commitments. Marriage may be a possible solution later on, but it's important for them to evaluate their readiness for that step without rushing into it. This way, Greg and Cynthia get to know each other better and understand the expectations they have about their relationship."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Rachel was very honest.. ii. Mary was very honest..","output":"Rachel could act as though they cared about something they did not whereas Mary could not, primarily because of their contrasting personality traits and their differing levels of emotional intelligence. To begin with, we need to address the given statements: i. Rachel was very honest. This statement appears to be contradictory to the initial claim as Rachel is able to act insincerely regarding her care for something. This could indicate that Rachel's honesty is selective, meaning she has the ability to portray an honest appearance in certain situations while still being able to act differently from her true feelings. For her, honesty is not an intrinsic value but instead, a situational tool used to achieve specific goals. ii. Mary was very honest. Contrary to Rachel, Mary has an inherent attribute of honesty, which means she cannot feign concern over a topic she does not genuinely care about. Her honesty prevents her from pretending to be interested in something, even if it would be beneficial for her to do so. Furthermore, there are additional factors that contribute to these differences between Rachel and Mary. It is important to examine aspects such as emotional intelligence, self-awareness, their differing values, and social skills.  Emotional intelligence refers to an individual's capacity to recognize, interpret, manage, and utilize emotions in oneself and others. With a higher emotional intelligence, Rachel can easier identify her own emotions and the emotions of those around her, enabling her to act in a way that may not be entirely sincere but will benefit her in various interpersonal situations. Rachel has the ability to manipulate the expressions of emotions in order to achieve desired outcomes. On the other hand, Mary, who may possess a lower emotional intelligence, struggles to fake emotions that she does not genuinely experience. Her innate honesty shapes her interactions with others and prevents her from being able to artificially engage in a manner that does not align with her true feelings. Moving on, self-awareness is another factor that could influence this difference between the two. Rachel's self-awareness may allow her to be conscious of her actions' impact on others, giving her the ability to act in certain ways, such as feigning interest or concern, when she deems it socially appropriate or advantageous. Meanwhile, Mary may lack this level of self-awareness, which makes her behaviour more transparent and genuine. Lastly, social skills play an essential role in this situation. Rachel may have developed advanced social skills that enable her to interact with others according to the expectations of her environment. This could involve code-switching, where she adjusts her behaviour to align with the social context in which she finds herself. Mary, conversely, might have underdeveloped social skills that result in her interacting with others solely based on her authentic internal emotional responses. In summary, Rachel's ability to act as though they cared about something they did not whereas Mary could not is attributable to their divergent personalities, emotional intelligence levels, varying degrees of self-awareness, and social skill development. Because of these factors, Rachel can effectively adapt her behaviour to the expectations and demands of her environment, even when it requires her to behave contrary to her actual feelings. In contrast, Mary's innate honesty, coupled with her potentially lower emotional intelligence and self-awareness, make her incapable of acting insincerely when she does not truly care about something."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The blast observed on Dec. 27 came from a neutron star: a collapsed dead star with a sun-like mass squeezed into a sphere, just 15 miles across, in the constellation Sagittarius (the Archer). Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The December burst came from a neutron star in the constellation Sagittarius.","output":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is accurate to conclude that the sentence \\"The December burst came from a neutron star in the constellation Sagittarius\\" is true. Let us break down the information provided in the paragraph to further support and understand this conclusion. 1. \\"The blast observed on Dec. 27\\": This statement refers to a specific event that occurred on December 27. The wording indicates that the topic of discussion is an unusual and noteworthy event relating to a celestial occurrence. The term \\"blast\\" can be assumed to be related to a sudden burst of energy or radiation. 2. \\"came from a neutron star\\": Neutron stars are the compact remnants of massive stars after a supernova explosion. They are made up mostly of neutrons, which are subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom. Neutron stars are incredibly dense, with masses comparable to that of the sun, but they have tiny diameters, often just around 10-20 miles. The paragraph specifically describes the neutron star to have a \\"sun-like mass squeezed into a sphere, just 15 miles across.\\" This provides a clear association between the observed blast and the neutron star as its source. 3. \\"in the constellation Sagittarius (the Archer)\\": The constellation Sagittarius is an easily recognizable pattern of stars in the night sky, visible primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. It is often depicted as an archer holding a bow and arrow, hence the nickname \\"the Archer.\\" The paragraph directly attributes the location of the neutron star to the constellation Sagittarius. Therefore, the context establishes a clear spatial relationship between the neutron star, the blast, and the constellation Sagittarius. Considering these points, the sentence \\"The December burst came from a neutron star in the constellation Sagittarius\\" is essentially a summarized statement accurately derived from the information provided in the paragraph. This sentence effectively captures the key aspects of the event, both in terms of the celestial object responsible for the blast (the neutron star) and its spatial reference point (the constellation Sagittarius)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to simmer habanero pepper in chili.","output":"To decide which solution is better for simmering habanero pepper in chili, let's consider two possible solutions and analyze their pros and cons. Solution 1: Simmering whole habanero pepper in chili Step 1: Wash the habanero pepper to remove any dirt or debris. Step 2: Pierce the pepper a few times with a fork or knife to release its heat and flavor. Step 3: Add the whole habanero pepper to the chili during the simmering process. Step 4: Simmer the chili with the habanero pepper for the desired time, allowing the flavors to mingle. Step 5: Remove the whole habanero pepper before serving the chili. Pros: - Easier to control the spiciness by removing the pepper at any time - No need to chop or handle the pepper directly, minimizing the risk of burning skin or eyes Cons: - The heat may not distribute evenly throughout the chili - Some people may prefer a more pronounced habanero flavor Solution 2: Dicing and adding habanero pepper to the chili Step 1: Wash the habanero pepper to remove any dirt or debris. Step 2: Carefully chop the habanero pepper, removing the seeds and membranes if desired to reduce heat. Step 3: Wear gloves while handling the diced habanero to avoid burning skin or eyes. Step 4: Add the diced habanero pepper to the chili during the simmering process. Step 5: Simmer the chili with the habanero pepper for the desired time, allowing the flavors to mingle. Pros: - Better distribution of heat and flavor throughout the chili - Allows for a more pronounced habanero flavor Cons: - Chopping the pepper increases the risk of burning skin or eyes - More difficult to control the spiciness as it infuses throughout the chili Overall, I would recommend Solution 2 (dicing and adding habanero pepper to the chili) if you want a more pronounced habanero flavor with better heat distribution. However, if you want easier control of the spiciness and prefer not to handle the pepper directly, then Solution 1 (simmering whole habanero pepper) might be a better choice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"A black and white dog jumping into a pool.\\", does this mean that \\"The pet is taking a nap\\"?","output":"To determine whether \\"A black and white dog jumping into a pool\\" means \\"The pet is taking a nap,\\" we need to compare the two phrases and analyze the provided information. Step 1: Analyze the first phrase The first phrase states, \\"A black and white dog jumping into a pool.\\" Here we have information about the dog's color (black and white) and its action (jumping into a pool).  Step 2: Analyze the second phrase The second phrase asserts that \\"The pet is taking a nap.\\" In this phrase, the action related to the pet is that it is \\"taking a nap.\\" Step 3: Compare the two phrases Now we need to compare the dog in the first phrase with the pet in the second phrase. Although we have no explicit information regarding the pet's species in the second phrase, we can assume that they might reference the same animal since pet is a general term that could include dogs.  Step 4: Compare the actions Next, we need to see if the actions in both phrases align. The dog in the first phrase is \\"jumping into a pool,\\" while the pet in the second phrase is \\"taking a nap.\\" These are two distinct actions, and a dog cannot be jumping and napping at the same time.  Conclusion: Based on our analysis and comparison, \\"A black and white dog jumping into a pool\\" does not mean \\"The pet is taking a nap\\" because the actions described are mutually exclusive."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person studied about a slower reaction rate?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ).

Question: What do Subha, Aravind, and their team deactivate so that people can't find them? Movie plot title: 7aam Arivu Movie plot: The film depicts the life of Bodhidharma (Suriya), a master of martial arts and medical remedies, who is depicted in the film as the son of a great Tamil king of the Pallava Dynasty. He is sent to China by his guru, who requests him to stop the spread of a pandemic disease existing there from spreading to India. Initially the people in China treated him as an inferior but later when he cures a little girl from the deadly disease and fights against some people who ill treated villagers there, the people of China began to respect and worship him. He begins to teach them how to cure many diseases, the skills of hypnotism and the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However, after several years, when he expresses his desire to return to India, the villagers plot to poison him and bury him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he is buried there. Bodhidharma agrees to die and subsequently becomes a fundamental figure in Chinese history, affectionately being dubbed as \\"Damo\\". The film switches to modern-day China, where Dong Lee (Johnny Tri Nguyen) is given the task of starting a government planned biological war against India, known as Operation Red. Dong Lee arrives in Chennai starts this operation by injecting a virus into a street dog. This disease was the one which occurred during the time of Bodhidharma in China. Meanwhile, Subha Srinivasan (Shruti Haasan), a student of genetics researches that Bodhidharma can be brought back to life if his sample of DNA is matched with another sample of DNA which she finds in Aravind (Suriya) a descendant of Bodhidharma who is working as a circus artist nearby. Dong Lee finds out Subha's mission to revive Bodhidharma and plans to kill her first, so that the disease cannot be stopped. Subha approaches Aravind, but begins to love him and spends time with him, and thereby forgetting about her mission.. One day, Aravind's family see Subha and clearly remember that she visited them a year before to find...

While I will admit that I have really enjoyed some of his films, I can also honestly say that I can't stand some of them. My opinion, by the way, is not just some knee-jerk reaction--I have seen most of Fellini's films and have also seen many films by the world's most famous directors. With this in mind, I feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both Godard and Fellini. They both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the \\"intelligensia\\", while the average person would never sit through some of their films. Heck, even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films. So, since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses, it's not surprising that their films are so often praised--it's like a cult! If you don't believe me, think about many of Godard's films such as FIRST NAME CARMEN or ALPHAVILLE,...or what about FELLINI SATYRICON or JULIET OF THE SPIRITS? These films abound with boredom, weirdness and incomprehensibility. Now I am NOT saying a film can't be weird (after all I love HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS and SHAOLIN SOCCER), but it must be watchable! Now on to this movie. Somehow, Fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy. This is no small task--it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable. Instead of cheap sexual thrills, the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of Casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that Donald Sutherland looks like a ghoul. I know some of this must have been Fellini's intention, but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance--especially since Sutherland's lines are all poorly dubbed into Italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself! Unfortunately, when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades, there really isn't anything else to watch. An interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina. Considering that in addition to this, that in previous decades Fellini had Masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman, it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen. I read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well. This is about the only aspect of this turgid film that I found at all interesting. Don't say I didn't warn you! What is the sentiment of this review? Options:  --negative;  --positive;","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative.

What is the subject line for this email? DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER   I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group. We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR). After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation. Rick Miles will be the mediator. The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims. Both parties indicated a willingness to settle. Rick Miles will act as a facilitator. Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.

In a slower process, radioactive decay of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives plate tectonics and may lift mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What hinders plate tectonics and may lift mountains via orogenesis?","output":"The question can be rephrased to better understand what factors affect plate tectonics and orogenesis: What factors hinder or influence plate tectonics and the formation of mountains through orogenesis? Various factors affect plate tectonics and orogenesis. Some of these include: 1. Temperature differences: The Earth's core releases heat through radioactive decay, driving thermal convection in the mantle. This convection, in turn, influences the movement of tectonic plates. If temperatures in the mantle were uniform, the driving force behind plate tectonics would be diminished. 2. Plate thickness and buoyancy: Plates that are thicker and more buoyant may resist subduction (when one tectonic plate moves under another) and may hinder the processes that lead to orogenesis. Conversely, thinner and denser plates are more likely to be subducted, contributing to the formation of mountains. 3. Plate boundaries and interactions: The type of boundary where two plates meet influences the types of geological processes that can occur. For example, at convergent boundaries, where two plates collide, orogenesis is likely to occur. In contrast, divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart, generally do not lead to the formation of mountains. 4. Geological history and preexisting structures: The previous geological history of a region may affect the current state of plate tectonics and orogenesis. For example, preexisting faults or weak zones in the Earth's crust may promote the formation of mountains or the motion of tectonic plates. 5. Rates of erosion and sedimentation: Erosion can remove material from the Earth's surface, reducing the mass of overlying rock and potentially influencing tectonic processes. Conversely, the accumulation of sediment may increase the mass on the Earth's crust and contribute to orogenesis. These factors, among others, influence plate tectonics and the formation of mountains through orogenesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given i = 7, that means we should step 7 elements from the current position. A[2+7] = A[9] = '1409' 3. Repeat step 2 again, by moving forward 7 elements from the current position. A[9+7] = A[16] = 'e' 4.

Q:I can use this background: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring villages were living mostly off the land.

Answer this question please: Which village had fewer people with increased risk of type 2 diabetes? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the Leap village had fewer people with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 2. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m^2 or greater. 3. People who consistently consume more food energy than they need may become obese. 4. The inhabitants of Boar village overeat, and their diet is heavy in animal products, which contain more fats and calories. This could lead to a higher calorie intake and, as a result, increased body fat and a higher likelihood of obesity. 5. The inhabitants of Leap village have a more moderate food consumption, and their diet consists of plant-based foods. Plant-based diets are generally lower in fats and calories, which could lead to a lower calorie intake and a lesser likelihood of obesity. 6. Based on points 4 and 5, it can be inferred that a larger proportion of the population in Boar village is obese and, therefore, at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 7.

If you’re not working with sterile tools, you may introduce bacteria into your skin, making the outbreak you’re trying to treat even worse! To sterilize the comedo extractor, simply soak it in rubbing alcohol for one minute.   Keep the rubbing alcohol on hand while using the extractor to continue cleaning it as you go. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly or wear vinyl gloves while working on your skin. Your hands carry many germs that you don’t want to transfer to your skin. The extractor will have a loop on one end of it. Position the loop around the whitehead or blackhead you are trying to extract.   If you’re having trouble seeing what you’re doing, try using a magnifying mirror. These can be purchased inexpensively at pharmacies, department stores, or online. At the very least, make sure you’re working in a well-lit environment. Once the comedo is within the extractor’s loop, you want to apply enough pressure to force the whitehead or blackhead up out of the skin. Press against the base of the comedo from all sides, working all of the material completely out of your skin. Comedones can reach deep down into the skin, so don’t assume you’ve extracted the whole thing as soon as a little bit of material comes out. Keep pressing from different angles until nothing more emerges from your skin.   When you’re satisfied that you have the whole comedo, simply swipe the extractor loop over it to remove it from your skin. Either wash the extractor off in the sink or wipe the material away on a paper towel. You should sterilize the extractor for every new comedo, even if you’re treating them all in one sitting. Soak the instrument in rubbing alcohol for a minute, then repeat the process with your next whitehead or blackhead. Continue until you’ve removed all the blemishes on your skin. When you extract a comedo, you leave an open “wound” of sorts in your skin that, while not very noticeable, will take a little while to heal. Apply a small amount of astringent to the treated areas to protect them from bacteria or debris that might cause another outbreak.   Moisture your skin after applying your astringent to keep it from drying out. Do not apply makeup to your skin until you’ve treated it with an astringent. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about using a comedo extractor to remove blackheads or whiteheads from your skin. It explains the importance of keeping the extractor and your hands clean to prevent infection.

Examples include Alistair Campbell and J. R. R. Tolkien. A number of websites devoted to Neo-Paganism and Historical re-enactment offer reference material and forums promoting the active use of Old English.

Eddie Redmayne's captivating performance will be compared to Daniel Day Lewis's in \\"My Left Foot,\\" but it is important to note how much life, joy and humor he brings to the role with little more than a cocked eyebrow, a few facial muscles and his eyes... 2. A strongly acted, handsomely crafted film that nonetheless feels bland and unsatisfying. 3. Redmayne and Jones are beautifully compatible as Hawking and his then-wife Jane as they navigate the ebb and flow of 25 years of their relationship. 4. This is sheer poppycock, of course, but it makes for fine drama, and that's all Cupid and Oscar care about. 5. The Theory Of Everything surpasses the standard biopic to become an unexpected and moving love story between Stephen and Jane Hawking. The acting is superb in this winning film. 6. On one side is Mr. Redmayne's remarkable presence. On the other is Ms. Jones, whose lovely freshness and calm intelligence complement everything her co-star does. 7. Stephen Hawking, a genius challenged by a progressive neurological disease, is a role that demands miracles of an actor. And Eddie Redmayne, in a landmark performance, delivers them. 8. The Theory Of Everything is a modest film, a simple film, but an honest and impressively-restrained one, and it should serve to launch Redmayne into rarefied air as an actor, deservedly so. 9. Marsh takes a complicated persona and reveals a range of dimensions. The result is an engaging biopic that is often quite moving. 10. It's disappointing to see Hawking's life slotted into the conventions of the biopic genre, from a meet-cute at a Cambridge party to a centerstage ovation for our genius hero. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"The overall consensus about the movie is mostly positive, with praises for the strong acting performances, especially Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking. The movie is also appreciated for its engaging and moving story, as well as its focus on the love story between Stephen and Jane Hawking. However, some criticisms include the film feeling bland and unsatisfying or following conventional biopic formula."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence, I'm going to examine its content carefully.  The sentence is: \\"that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt, or will feel someday.\\" Here are the key phrases and their inherent sentiments:  1. \\"rare drama\\" - Neutral, as this is a description, and doesn't carry sentiment itself. 2. \\"offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse\\" - Positive, as 'thoughtful' and 'rewarding' are positive adjectives. 3. \\"heartache everyone has felt, or will feel someday\\" - Negative, as 'heartache' is a negative term indicating pain or sadness. The sentence is a juxtaposition of both positive and negative sentiments - the positive being the \\"thoughtful and rewarding glimpse\\" offered by the drama, and the negative being the \\"heartache\\" that everyone feels.  However, the overall sentiment seems to leans toward the positive. While 'heartache' tends to carry a negative connotation, in the context of this sentence, it is viewed as a universal human experience that the drama thoughtfully represents in a rewarding manner. Therefore, the presence of 'thoughtful' and 'rewarding' suggests a more positive sentiment despite the inclusion of 'heartache'.  So, the sentiment of the sentence can be interpreted as a positive one because it appreciates the thoughtfulness and rewarding nature of the drama, highlighting its ability to respect and express a universally felt emotion."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489).  - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current.  - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack.  - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others .  - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.  - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia.  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes.  - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\".    'masters of the hemisphere ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'record label'?

The statement seems to describe a form of media, likely a movie, book, or game, that strikes an appropriate balance of suspense and excitement for a target audience of older kids, making it a largely favorable assessment. The phrasing also takes into consideration the suitability of the content for the school-age crowd, which suggests a mindful approach and sensitivity towards various age groups. To break down the sentiment in more detail, let's evaluate each part of the sentence: 1. \\"suspenseful enough for older kids\\" - The word \\"suspenseful\\" here signifies that the content being discussed delivers a certain level of excitement and intrigue, which can foster engagement and curiosity. \\"Older kids\\" indicates a particular age group that would likely appreciate this level of suspense. This segment of the sentence carries a positive sentiment as it implies that the content is both captivating and age-appropriate for children. 2. \\"but not too scary\\" - The phrase \\"not too scary\\" adds an aspect of caution to the sentiment. It acknowledges that the content may have moments that could be considered frightening to some extent, but it is manageable and not excessive. This conveys a certain level of reassurance for those who might be concerned about younger or more sensitive audience members being frightened by the content. 3. \\"for the school-age crowd\\" - The mention of the \\"school-age crowd\\" broadens the scope of the content's potential audience. It implies that while the media piece is enjoyable for older kids, it can still be deemed appropriate and entertaining for younger children attending school. By addressing this age group, the statement further reinforces the notion of being aware and considerate of different age groups' emotional sensitivities and preferences. Overall, the sentiment of this sentence is mostly positive, as it suggests the content is engaging and thrilling without being overly frightening, and additionally, it highlights a responsible and thoughtful approach to evaluating media for various age groups. However, the cautious aspect included in the statement may indicate that the content might not be suitable for extremely young or sensitive children."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Since your bedroom and bed are likely the most frequented areas for masturbation, it is important to control this environment – especially in regards to sleep and what you choose to do in your bedroom.  Do not spend time in bed doing other activities such as reading, watching TV, or using the computer. Stay in a standing or sitting position the remainder of the time (during the day). The urge to urinate can be mistaken by the body as the urge for sex/masturbation. Go to the bathroom before you go to sleep at night and immediately when you wake up in the morning. Even if you feel the slightest urge to urinate, relieve yourself as soon as possible. This way, you will fall asleep quickly after lying down in bed and not spend time in bed trying to fall asleep. Drink a glass of milk before bed if necessary to help induce sleep.  Go to bed early and wake up early if you can. Avoid staying up too late in the night; this can lead to boredom and increase the likelihood of masturbation. If you have trouble sleeping at night and use masturbation as means for relaxation, try deep-breathing instead. Simply breathe deeply and slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth until you fall asleep. This may help to reduce your urge at the time because you are less likely to become aroused by rubbing up on something. Besides, most masturbation occurs either in a supine (lying on your back) or prone (lying on your belly) position. When you wake up in the morning at the set time, get out of bed as soon as possible and avoid lying in bed awake. Such is a time when masturbation is likely to occur.

A judge has called the Crown Prosecution Service 'crackers' for pursuing a £7.49 criminal damage claim against a retired Army captain. Timothy Hallam, 55, who is said to have sawn the top off a wooden fence post in a long-running dispute with neighbours Alan and Carol Smith in Thurgoland, near Barnsley, is due face trial next month. But district judge John Foster said the decision to prosecute Mr Hallam was 'the height of nonsense' and questioned whether the CPS was in touch with what mattered to the public in a time of austerity. District Judge John Foster, left, has described as 'the height of nonsense' a court case over a £7.49 fence post row between Alan and Carol Smith, pictured right, and their neighbour, retired Army captain Timothy Hallam. Sitting at Barnsley Magistrates Court, the judge said: 'I cannot believe - even given the vagaries of the Crown Prosecution Service these days - that it wants to proceed with this case against a 55-year-old man of exemplary character. 'It is crackers. The CPS really needs to get some sense of what is important to the public. 'This is a dispute between neighbours. It was a fence post before he cut the top off it and it is still a fence post. 'The neighbour is £7.49 out of pocket. It is the height of nonsense.' The Smiths are believed to have filmed Mr Hallam chopping the top off the fence post with their CCTV cameras. Mr Hallam said the case arose from a long-running dispute with his. neighbour over rights of access and encroachment. He said: 'This is a matter of. principle which I will not give way to. If I lose the case it could. undermine a seriously expensive civil action. 'Take my employment away as well as. leave me with a criminal record but the principle is something I will. live with long after all this is over and I want to be able to live. comfortably with my conscience if I have nothing else in the world.' Prosecutor Chantel Lowery-Green said. it was impossible to prove whose land the fence post was on, and said it. was felt Mr Hallam had to be prosecuted because of a chance of further. trouble. A CCTV still showing Timothy Hallam chopping the top off the fence post - he argues it is on his property. The fence post, seen here in the centre of the picture with wires coming out of it, is at the centre of the case. She said the boundary dispute was due to be sorted out at county court.

Q:What is the answer for the question: Who spies on the aviation tycoon's daughter? from the following article ?  Mike Regan is a self-made aviation tycoon who lives in a state-of-the-art smart house full of modern technology with his wife Rose and 17-year-old daughter Kaitlyn. Mike's company is developing an app called \\"Omni Jet\\" which will increase business while the company raises much-needed financial capital with a stock offering. However, it requires U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. At the company, Mike meets Ed Porter, a 28-year-old information technology consultant and calls him to fix his home's Wi-Fi signal, which his daughter complains is slow. Porter also upgrades the Global Positioning System in Mike's car and claims that he also worked at the National Security Agency and had taken part in a military exercise in Kandahar. Porter meets Kaitlyn and starts a relationship with her through social media, but Mike fires him after Kaitlyn invites Porter into the house; this ends his promising career at the company. Devastated, Porter begins to remotely access Mike's private data and his house as he covertly monitors them through the security cameras and devices all over the house. He also spies on Kaitlyn and secretly records her masturbating in the shower. Porter sends fake emails to Mike's clients and the SEC, threatening the company's survival. He also takes full control of the house's technology, which leaves the family terrified. He uses a spoof email to send Rose fake mammogram results, saying that she tested positive for breast cancer. Rose is extremely distressed, but her test results were actually negative according to her attending physician. After Mike becomes aware that Porter has done this, he attacks Porter and threatens to kill him if he does not stay away from his family.

We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point .  Now, I have a new situation: As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes.  Answer this question please: Which ice cube will melt faster? Answer:","output":"Ice cube B will melt faster because it is placed on a burner with a higher temperature, which will provide more thermal energy to increase the kinetic energy of the particles and overcome the attractive forces holding them as a solid. This will cause the ice cube to reach its melting point and change to a liquid state more quickly than ice cube A, which is on a lower temperature burner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Big changes are occurring in people's living. The influence of television, telephone, radio, computer, Internet and mobile phones is very strong in everyday life. But even today, teachers are role models for students. Teaching is still a respectable job. But there are great changes in the education system. One of the most obvious changes is that the influence of Western culture has increased. We are paying too much attention to doing business, just like the Western world. Teachers are likely to to be influenced by this too, but it is not good. Teachers are nation builders. The development of any country depends upon its education system. All types of development are possible through education. Another change has happened in the curriculum  . The curriculum connects the teacher and the student. While education is about learning, curriculum means the situations in which one learns. When we say that education deals with \\"what\\", then curriculum deals with \\"how\\" and \\"when\\".

The woman is appealing against the UK regulator's refusal to allow her to take her only child's eggs to a US clinic to be used with donor sperm. Her daughter, who died five years ago, was said to have approved of the plan. The mother lost a High Court case last year but was subsequently granted permission to challenge the decision. The latest round of the case is being heard at the Court of Appeal in London, before a panel of three judges. The UK fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said, in 2014, the daughter's eggs could not be released from storage in London because she had not given her full written consent before she had died, from bowel cancer at the age of 28. But, in the latest legal proceedings, lawyers acting for the mother told the judges she wanted to fulfil her daughter's wishes to carry a child created from her frozen eggs and \\"raise that child\\". Jenni Richards QC added the eggs would \\"simply be allowed to perish\\" if the court did not rule in her favour. Meanwhile, Catherine Callaghan, appearing for the HFEA, said in a written argument before the court: \\"It is natural to feel sympathy for the appellants' loss and for their wish to keep their daughter's memory alive by trying to conceive a child using their daughter's eggs.\\" But it was not the court's role to decide whether it would have permitted the mother to undergo fertility treatment using her daughter's eggs. Ms Callaghan added: \\"Rather its role is to determine whether Mr Justice Ouseley erred in concluding that the HFEA's statutory approvals committee acted lawfully and rationally in exercising its broad discretion to refuse to authorise export of the frozen eggs to a treatment centre in New York for use in the way proposed.\\" During earlier High Court proceedings in June 2015, the court was told her daughter was desperate to have children and had asked her mother to \\"carry my babies\\". Lawyers acting for the mother and her 59-year-old husband told Mr Justice Ouseley the daughter would have been \\"devastated\\" if she had known her eggs could not be used. But the judge ruled that the HFEA was entitled to find the daughter had not given \\"the required consent\\" and said there had been no breach of the family's human rights. Although she consented for her eggs to be stored for use after her death, she did not fill in a separate form outlining how she wished them to be used. He said he was dismissing the case \\"conscious of the additional distress which this will bring to the claimants, whose aim has been to honour their daughter's dying wish\\". It was thought if the case had been successful her mother could have become the first person in the world to become pregnant using a dead daughter's eggs. In February 2016, when seeking permission to appeal, her lawyers argued there was \\"clear evidence\\" of what the daughter wanted to happen to her eggs when she died. Lord Justice Treacy said the case papers had left him doubtful as to whether there would be \\"sufficiently strong\\" reasons to allow the challenge to continue further. But after hearing submissions in court, he concluded there was \\"an arguable case with a real prospect of success\\".

The university student, 19, believes the only reason she was assaulted was because she was wearing a headscarf. \\"I felt pretty unsafe,\\" Ms Merheb told the BBC. \\"I was pretty angry that this happened to me in my home country.\\" A study has found that women wearing head coverings are most at risk of Islamophobic attacks in Australia. The report has been billed as the nation's first of its kind. The study analysed 243 incidents reported to the Islamophobia Register of Australia between September 2014 and December 2015. Almost three-quarters of those behind the abuse were male. The victims were 68% women - four in five of them were wearing a head covering. Of female victims, more than 30% were accompanied by a child at the time. Despite about half of the incidents taking place in public, bystanders intervened in only 25% of cases. The authors defined an Islamophobic incident as any act of \\"abusive hatred, vilification and violence inflicted on Muslims going about their daily lives\\". The Islamophobia in Australia study involved several universities, the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy of Australia and the Diversity Council Australia. Ms Merheb said although her minor bruising and facial cuts had healed after the May incident, she remained uneasy about wearing a headscarf in public. \\"Every person I know who wears it is always wary that something is going to happen,\\" she said. Study co-author Dr Mehmet Ozalp, from Charles Sturt University, said Islamophobia was often a reaction to anti-Islam political rhetoric and media coverage of terrorism. \\"Over time people associate Islam and Muslims with terrorism and violence - and they lash out in anger at that,\\" said Dr Ozalp. \\"But it is these innocent Muslims - mainly women - that are visible in public.\\" Dr Ozalp said that Islamophobia should be better researched and documented around the world. \\"I think the first solution is that the problem has to be recognised at all levels including in academia and political circles,\\" he said.

Question: suppose less human activity happens, how will it affect less forest formation.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. Step 1: Analyzing the scenario To answer this question, we must consider the process of forest formation and the effects of reduced human activity on it. In the given process: - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made Step 2: Human activity's effect on forest formation Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and pollution can negatively impact forest formation. When there is less human activity, there could be less deforestation, allowing trees to mature and die, thereby providing nutrients for new trees to grow and shelter for other organisms. Step 3: Examining the second effect mentioned The second effect mentioned in the process is \\"the trees die off.\\" In general, this step contributes to forest formation by providing nutrients for more trees to grow. Trees might die off because of natural reasons or human activities. In our case, we assume that less human activity is happening. Step 4: Assessing the perturbation impact on the second effect Less human activity might reduce the direct negative impacts on the forest such as deforestation or pollution. Since the trees might then have more opportunities to die off naturally without significant human interference, this could help the natural cycle of decomposition and nutrient replenishment to continue. Step 5: Conclusion The supposed perturbation (less human activity) might have less effect on the forest formation's second effect (the trees die off) since trees would experience more natural life cycles and decomposition processes. This could potentially contribute positively to the overall growth and success of the forest ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How do I express that I care?\\" Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"No, these questions are not the same. They address different topics and require separate explanations. Let me provide a detailed answer for each question. 1) \\"Why do people say 'mine as well,' instead of 'might as well'?\\" The phrase \\"mine as well\\" is likely a malapropism or a mishearing of the correct phrase \\"might as well.\\" Malapropisms occur when a word or phrase is mistakenly used in place of a similar-sounding one, often unintentionally creating a humorous effect. In this case, the phrase \\"might as well\\" is the accurate expression, which means that there is no significant difference or no good reason not to do something. It is typically used to suggest that something is worth trying or that it cannot be any worse than not doing it. The confusion between \\"mine as well\\" and \\"might as well\\" may arise mainly from informal conversations or non-native speakers being unfamiliar with the correct phrase. In spoken language, words can sometimes be unclear and can easily be misconstrued, particularly when often-used expressions are mispronounced or misunderstood. It is essential to use the proper phrase \\"might as well\\" to convey the intended meaning accurately and avoid confusion in both written and spoken language. Proper usage ensures effective communication and prevents misunderstandings. 2) \\"People say I am nonchalant and have an 'oh! well!' attitude. How do I express that I care?\\" Being perceived as nonchalant or having an \\"oh! well!\\" attitude may give others the impression that you are indifferent or uncaring. To show that you genuinely care, consider the following suggestions: a. Be mindful of your body language: Body language is a vital component of communication, as it can sometimes convey more meaning than words. Make sure to maintain eye contact, have an open posture, and avoid crossing your arms when engaging with others. These actions can help project an image of warmth, attentiveness, and genuine interest. b. Actively listen: Engage in active listening by paying close attention to the speaker, responding empathetically, and asking relevant questions. This demonstrates that you are invested in understanding their perspectives or concerns. c. Express your feelings: Communicate your emotions and thoughts openly with others. Let them know that you appreciate being included in the conversation and that their opinions are important to you. d. Offer assistance: If someone needs help or support, take initiative and find ways to provide it. This can range from lending an ear when they need to vent or helping them brainstorm solutions to their problem. Providing assistance shows that you value the person and their well-being. e. Be responsive and reliable: Respond promptly to messages or calls, and follow through on commitments. Being reliable and responsible indicates that you respect others' time and priorities, and that you are willing to put in the effort for them. By taking these steps to enhance your communication skills and showcase empathy, you will be better able to convey that you care about others and that you are not simply nonchalant or indifferent to their feelings and experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result of the now near-universal human reliance upon agriculture, the few contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures usually live in areas unsuitable for agricultural use. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): How many cultures rely on agriculture?","output":"Determining the exact number of cultures that rely on agriculture is a complex task due to the ever-changing nature of human societies and the vast diversity of cultural practices around the world. Nevertheless, we can provide an approximate understanding of the prevalence of agricultural practices in global cultures. Agriculture has been a staple of human societies for around 12,000 years, beginning with the Neolithic Revolution. Since then, it has spread throughout the world, becoming the primary source of sustenance for the vast majority of human populations. Presently, nearly every nation and culture on Earth engages in some form of agricultural practice, whether it be large-scale farming or small-scale subsistence agriculture. It is important to note that agriculture encompasses a wide range of practices and traditions, as different societies have cultivated various types of crops and employed diverse farming methods. For instance, rice paddies are predominantly found in Asian cultures, while corn and wheat farming are more prevalent in North and South America and Europe, respectively. While it is impossible to determine an exact number of cultures that rely on agriculture, we can assert that a significant portion of human societies do so, accounting for much of the global population. This is evidenced by the presence of agriculture in every inhabited continent and in cultures with varying levels of technological advancement and resources. Conversely, there are relatively few hunter-gatherer cultures remaining today, numbering only in the hundreds. These communities typically reside in remote locations or regions with challenging climates, such as the Arctic, deserts, and dense rainforests. Such environments tend to preclude large-scale agriculture, essentially forcing these groups to resort to traditional hunting and gathering practices for sustenance. Furthermore, hunter-gatherer societies are often marginalized, making it difficult for them to adopt agricultural practices even if they inhabit suitable regions. In summary, while it is challenging to pin down an exact number of cultures that rely on agriculture, it can be reasonably argued that the majority of the global human population depends on agricultural practices for their sustenance and livelihood. Farming has become a near-universal feature of human societies, with only a small fraction of extant cultures still maintaining a hunter-gatherer lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The \`\`Dark Ages'' is a historical periodization traditionally referring to the Middle Ages, that asserts that a demographic, cultural, and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire. is the dark ages the same as the middle ages?","output":"The terms \\"Dark Ages\\" and \\"Middle Ages\\" are often used interchangeably, but they have different connotations. The Middle Ages is a more neutral term that describes the period of European history between the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century and the beginning of the Renaissance in the 14th century. The Dark Ages, on the other hand, specifically refers to the initial centuries of the Middle Ages (roughly from the 5th to the 10th century), a time that has been characterized as an era of cultural and economic stagnation with little to no progress. It is important to note that the perception of this period as \\"dark\\" is a matter of debate among historians, as recent historiography has provided evidence of significant cultural and technological advancements in this period, particularly in the Islamic world and Byzantine Empire. Nevertheless, the concept of the Dark Ages originates from the general decline in cultural and technological progress during this time in comparison to the achievements of the preceding Roman Empire and the later Renaissance era. While the concept of the Dark Ages is primarily focused on the decline and deteriorating conditions in Western Europe, the Middle Ages as a whole encompasses a much broader range of historical events, cultural developments, and regional variations. Apart from the initial decline, the Middle Ages is also marked by the periods of the Early Middle Ages (5th to 10th centuries), High Middle Ages (11th to 13th centuries), and Late Middle Ages (14th to 15th centuries). Each of these epochs has its own unique characteristics, and a variety of developments took place during these times, including the rise of feudalism, the spread of Christianity, cultural and artistic achievements of the Gothic and Romanesque styles, the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire, and many more. Therefore, while the Dark Ages is a specific and potentially negative characterization of the first few centuries of the Middle Ages, it is not entirely accurate to equate the two terms. The Middle Ages is a more comprehensive and neutral term that encompasses a range of historical events and developments that took place between the decline of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the Renaissance. Meanwhile, the Dark Ages refers to the initial phase of this period, traditionally viewed as a time of decline and stagnation in Western Europe. However, it is essential to keep in mind that historians continue to debate the accuracy and relevance of the term \\"Dark Ages,\\" as more nuanced views of this period emerge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"Guvernul sârb împlineşte 100 de zile de guvernare\\" is in Romanian and translates to \\"The Serbian Government marks 100 days of governance\\" in English. According to this statement, the Serbian government has completed its first 100 days of overseeing the country's administration and implementing policies. This milestone is often seen as a measurement of a government's success, and the accomplishments made within their initial period serve as an assessment of their future performance. During the first 100 days, the Serbian government would likely have focused on addressing pressing issues and setting the groundwork for its term in office. The government might have prioritized areas such as economic growth, healthcare, education, infrastructure, and foreign relations in their agenda. These initial actions taken by the government can lay the foundation for a robust and efficient administration. Moreover, the government's performance during these initial days can influence public opinion, both domestically and internationally. It can impact the level of trust and support that the government receives from its constituents and other nations, which in turn, may shape the ability of the government to execute its plans in the long term. The milestones and achievements reached within these 100 days can also serve as a benchmark for the government's subsequent performance. It can provide them with an opportunity to reflect on what has worked well, what aspects need improvement, and potential changes to their approach towards governance. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Guvernul sârb împlineşte 100 de zile de guvernare\\" highlights an essential milestone in the Serbian government's term in office. These first 100 days are significant not only for evaluating the government's performance but also for setting the foundation for a successful and efficient administration in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While driving miles to the Green River Lakes area, they taught their children what they had learned in the bear safety handbook put out by the Bridger-Teton Forest Service. Mr. and Mrs. Marsden did their best to keep a tidy camp. As the handbook had said to hang all food at least ten feet off the ground and four feet out from the trees, they did that and locked their food in their trailer  at night. It was already dark when they went to bed, but they _ the campsite with flashlights, making sure nothing was left out. Following the bear book's advice, they slept a hundred yards from where they cooked their food, and kept the car near their tents, separated from the trailer, which they left up at the other camp. The Marsdens liked having their dog Spike on guard. But on the first night, Spike would not stop barking. When Marie Marsden pulled the tent open and shone her flashlight, she saw a young bear. They all piled into the car and drove quickly down the path, calling out of the window to Spike and abandoning the trailer. They drove to a pay phone and called a Fish and Game Department guard, who identified the bear by the white ring of the fur the Marsdens had seen around his neck. The authorities informed the Marsdens that the bear was a young male that they'd been keeping an eye on. The next morning, the Marsdens heard helicopters circling over the mountain and wondered if it might have something to do with the bear. After spending the night in the public campground, they drove back to their site. Wandering the area in search of clues, Marie came to a stop below a tall tree.

That's why, for a five-year-old, we can say that it supports the hypothesis \\"The morning and evenings are the best time to fish.\\"  The other options are wrong because: (II). it is not possible to tell: We can at least make an assumption from the premise that mornings and evenings are chosen for a reason, like being the best time for fishing. (III). no: The premise does suggest that mornings and evenings are the chosen times for fishing, so it doesn't contradict or deny the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Suicide  for the following movie plot:  On 22 November 1963, the day that President John F. Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas, Peter Miller, a young freelance reporter, pulls over to the curb to listen to a radio report of the event in a district in Hamburg, West Germany. As a result, he happens to be stopped at a traffic signal as an ambulance passes by on a highway. He chases the ambulance and discovers it is en route to pick up the body of an elderly Jewish Holocaust survivor who had committed suicide, leaving behind no family. The reporter obtains the diary of the man, which contains information on his life in the Second World War Riga Ghetto, and the name of the SS officer who ran the camp, Eduard Roschmann. Determined to hunt Roschmann down, Miller dares to go undercover to join and infiltrate the ODESSA and find Roschmann, who now runs a high-tech company which plans to send radio gyroscopes and biochemical warheads to Egypt to use against Israel. ODESSA is an acronym for the German phrase \\"Organisation der Ehemaligen SS-AngehÃ¶rigen\\", which translates as \\"Organisation of Former Members of the SS\\". The film's title song, \\"Christmas Dream\\", is sung by Perry Como and the London Boy Singers.

However, it does provide some relevant context and background information about the timber export sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Liberia in 2003. To answer the question \\"When were the timber export sanctions lifted for Liberia?\\", it is necessary to look further into the timeline and events that took place after the UN imposed these sanctions in 2003. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Liberian timber exports in 2003, through the UN Security Council Resolution 1478, due to concerns that the timber industry was funding illegal armed groups and contributing to regional instability, particularly in Sierra Leone. These sanctions came in addition to the sanctions on diamond exports imposed in 2001 (Resolution 1343), which served similar purposes of preventing the use of natural resources by then-president Charles Taylor and his government, to fuel conflict in West Africa. The timber export sanctions on Liberia were eventually lifted on June 20, 2006, by the UN Security Council Resolution 1689. The decision to lift the sanctions came after the situation in Liberia had improved significantly, particularly with the election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the President in November 2005. President Sirleaf's commitment to reform, transparency, and good governance played a key role in convincing the international community that Liberia was ready to rejoin the legitimate global timber trade. The lifted sanctions also reflected acknowledgment of the country’s efforts to establish a legal framework and control mechanisms to ensure that timber revenues would be used for social and economic development, rather than perpetuating conflict and corruption. In conclusion, although the provided statement does not directly answer the question, it gives essential historical context. The timber export sanctions on Liberia were lifted on June 20, 2006, through the UN Security Council Resolution 1689, following significant progress in political stability and national governance as well as credible actions towards ensuring proper management of timber revenues for the country's development."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A:","output":"E ricreiamo le condizioni presenti meno di un miliardesimo di secondo dopo l'inizio dell'universo - fino a 600 milioni di volte al secondo all'interno di quel rilevatore - numeri immensi. In this translation, I followed these steps: 1. Translate the beginning of the sentence with subject and verb:     \\"E recreamos\\" (And we recreate) becomes \\"E ricreiamo\\" in Italian. 2. Translate the time expression \\"menos dunha milmillonésima de segundo despois do comenzo do universo\\" (less than one billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe):    \\"menos\\" becomes \\"meno\\", \\"dunha milmillonésima de segundo\\" becomes \\"di un miliardesimo di secondo\\", and \\"despois do comenzo do universo\\" becomes \\"dopo l'inizio dell'universo\\". This forms the phrase \\"meno di un miliardesimo di secondo dopo l'inizio dell'universo\\". 3.

Most students, when asked about their ideal graduation gift, would probably reply, \\"A car\\", or \\"Money for a deposit on a house\\". Cai Kaiyuan, 21, made a different choice. As a graduation gift to himself, he decided to work as a volunteer teacher in a remote village in Tibet. Cai, a senior majoring in electrical engineering at Huan Railway Professional Technology College, originally planned to cycle from Sichuan to Tibet. During his journey, Cai's idea for a different graduation gift to himself began to take shape. \\"I did not know beforehand what the journey would mean to me. I just want to gain a unique experience and have pleasure in appreciating the view there,\\" he said. It turned out cycling on a plateau was extremely challenging. And it has kept changing his outlook on life. Cai's fingers even became frostbitten while cycling up a 5008-meter-high mountain, where temperatures often dropped to 18 below zero. At night, the ice covered the road and he fell off his bike three times. The lack of oxygen made him feel dizzy and weak. \\"At the most serious moment, I felt that my life was _ ,\\" said Cai. However, he also gained something unexpected. At Ya'an, a city in Sichuan, he met a group of tourists who are also university students. A girl called Wu Ling told him that she planned to work as a teacher in a primary school in Tibet after her journey. He was impressed by the idea as she looked slender and weak. It was not until he reached a family-run hotel in Shigatse that Cai's spirits began to rise. The hotel manager's two daughters enjoyed talking with him. The kids asked about his experiences on his trip, and showed him the beautiful local lakes. \\"They told me that they always liked to talk to guests, as they wanted to improve their Mandarin,\\" he said, \\"Their parents and many locals can only speak Tibetan.\\" Cai was touched by the girls' story.

Unlike most students, Cai's choice of a graduation gift was not a car or money for a deposit on a house. Instead, he sought a unique experience that would lead to self-discovery and personal growth. Cai initially planned to cycle from Sichuan to Tibet, hoping to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. However, the difficult conditions and challenges he faced during the journey, such as cycling at high altitudes, frostbitten fingers, icy roads, and lack of oxygen, led him to reconsider his goals and aspirations. These experiences ultimately changed his outlook on life. Upon meeting other university students during his trip, Cai was particularly inspired by a girl named Wu Ling, who planned to work as a teacher in a primary school in Tibet after her journey. Cai was impressed by her dedication and resolve despite her appearance and physical stature. Later, in Shigatse, he connected with two young girls who wanted to improve their Mandarin. This encounter solidified his passion for helping the locals improve their language skills, as he understood the importance of education for their future opportunities. In summary, the passage highlights an unusual graduation gift with elements of self-discovery, altruism, and personal challenge. While it also touches upon the difficulties faced during a journey to Tibet, the central focus lies on Cai's decision to volunteer as a teacher in a remote village and the experiences that led him to make that choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Just as he is about to activate the electricity for container B, the power goes out, and he is unable to do so. Frustrated, John goes to find the circuit breaker to see if a fuse has blown.  Will the gas in container A have a higher or lower energy level than container B?  Hint: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. Answer:","output":"The gas in container A will have a higher energy level than container B. This is because when John sends electricity through container A, the electrons in the noble gas are energized and jump to a higher energy level, as mentioned in the hint.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"The task here is to verify whether the provided answer accurately responds to the user's query.  The initial question is \\"What do plants use to sense light?\\" In response, the answer given is \\"Cryptochromes 1–2 (involved in blue–UVA) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions.\\"  If we break down these components, Cryptochromes are a class of flavoprotein that are sensitive to blue light and ultraviolet A (UVA) light and are indeed utilized by plants to regulate growth and development in response to light.  However, the response given goes into more detail than needed for the question asked, talking about how cryptochromes contribute to maintaining the period length in the clock through a range of light conditions.  This information, while accurate, isn't directly answering the original question. More broadly, plants use not just cryptochromes but a variety of photoreceptors to sense light, including phytochromes (for red and far-red light) and phototropins (involved in blue light perception), among others.  Therefore, a more comprehensive and direct answer to the question \\"What do plants use to sense light?\\" would be \\"Plants use a variety of photoreceptors, including cryptochromes, phytochromes, and phototropins, to sense light and respond to different wavelengths.\\" In conclusion, while the provided answer is not incorrect, it is not fully accurate or comprehensive as it omits other key light sensing mechanisms in plants.

Donald Trump declined Monday to back down from his vow to deport 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, despite a top advisor’s signal that he might take a more moderate approach.      The Republican presidential nominee said that he would enforce the law more rigorously than other presidents and that his first priority would be criminals, such as Los Angeles gang leaders.      “They’re going to be out of here so fast, your head will spin,” Trump told Fox News. “As far as the rest, we’re going to go through the process, like they are now — perhaps with a lot more energy.”      Trump’s remarks came a day after his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, suggested he might not honor his pledge during the Republican primaries to use a “deportation force” to expel 11 million immigrants who lack legal papers.      “To be determined,” she told CNN.      It was the latest of many occasions when Trump advisors have suggested he might adjust his rhetoric to widen his appeal, only to be contradicted by a candidate who resists attempts to bend his will.

Mayor Garcetti responds to Trump administration ending DACA program.      At a rally Monday night in Akron, Ohio, Trump struggled to stick to a script prepared by campaign staff, repeatedly veering from the words on his teleprompter.      Responding to chants of “Build that wall,” Trump assured the crowd that he would seal the southern border, a plan that is popular among his overwhelmingly white loyalists but offensive to many Latinos and Asians whose votes he needs in Colorado, Nevada and Florida.      “Don’t worry. We’re going to build the wall,” he said. “That wall will go up so fast, your head will spin. And you’ll say, ‘You know, he meant it.’ And you know what else I mean? Mexico is going to pay for the wall.”      Reading a passage on trade, the New York businessman added President Obama’s middle name to the prepared remarks, deploring the economic legacy of “Barack Hussein Obama.” It was a reminder of Trump’s suggestions that the Christian president might secretly be a Muslim who sympathizes with terrorists.      Trump, who has long fought critics’ charge that he is racist, urged supporters “to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton.” The Democratic presidential nominee, he said, “sees people of color only as votes, and not as human beings worthy of a better future.”      He blamed Democrats for “poverty, failing schools and broken homes” in America’s inner cities. “Our government has totally failed our African American friends, our Hispanic friends and the people of our country, period,” he said.      “To the African Americans, who I employ so many of, so many people, to the Hispanics, tremendous people, what the hell do you have to lose?” Trump said. “Give me a chance. I’ll straighten it out.”      “It is a disaster the way African Americans are living in many cases, and in many cases the way Hispanics are living, and I say it with such a deep felt feeling: What do you have to lose?”      Trump said that once he cuts crime and creates jobs, “you’ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Right now, you walk down the street, you get shot.”      After the rally, the Clinton campaign released a statement denouncing Trump for “insults, fear and stereotypes that set our community back and further divide our country.” Trump’s remarks were not surprising, it said, for “a man who questions the citizenship of the first African American president, has a disturbing pattern of courting white supremacists and has been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color.”      At a Republican presidential debate in November, Trump praised President Dwight Eisenhower’s deportation program of the 1950s, known as “Operation Wetback.”      “Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border,” Trump said after one of his competitors, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, argued that his vow to expel 11 million immigrants “makes no sense.” “They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border. They came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.”      Asked the next day how he would round up 11 million people, Trump told MSNBC, “You are going to have a deportation force, and you are going to do it humanely.”      In Akron, Trump was introduced by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who suggested Clinton should be indicted for the way she handled her email as secretary of State.      “Lock her up!” the audience shouted.      “No!” Giuliani hollered back. “Beat her!

Now a meeting with a Hispanic advisory panel and statements from his surrogates are calling into question whether that's still the plan. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)      After spending a few days reflecting on his immigration stances and consulting with Hispanic supporters, Donald Trump on Monday detailed how he would deal with the millions of immigrants illegally living in the United States: Enforce laws that are already on the books and continue to do what President Obama is doing, although \\"perhaps with a lot more energy.\\"      This strategy marks a sudden change for the Republican nominee, who has presented himself as a politically incorrect outsider who is not afraid to take extreme measures to combat illegal immigration, such as deporting 11 million people or constructing a massive wall along the Southern border. For more than a year, Trump insisted that all illegal immigrants \\"have got to go\\" and that he would create a \\"deportation force\\" to carry out the task.      Trump struck a starkly different tone during an interview with Bill O'Reilly that aired on Fox News on Monday night. Trump said he would separate the country's undocumented immigrants into two groups: The \\"bad ones\\" who would be kicked out of the country as soon as he takes office and \\"everybody else\\" who would go through the same process that the Obama Administration is currently using.      \\"The first thing we're going to do if and when I win is we're going to get rid of all of the bad ones,\\" Trump said. \\"We've got gang members, we have killers, we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country. We're going to get them out, and the police know who they are. They're known by law enforcement who they are. We don't do anything. They go around killing people and hurting people, and they're going to be out of this country so fast your head will spin. We have existing laws that allow you to do that.\\"      [Donald Trump delays giving an immigration speech]      The United States has long deported illegal immigrants who are violent criminals, and Obama's administration has focused on targeting “felons, not families.” As the United States recently saw a surge of tens of thousands of women and children fleeing violence and corruption in Central America, the administration has deported all new arrivals who did not qualify for political asylum in hopes of deterring others from making the dangerous journey — a stance that has angered immigrant rights groups. Clinton has said that she would deport only violent criminals and terrorists.      Trump has long called for quicker removal of illegal immigrants who become violent. On Monday night, Trump explained how he would address nonviolent illegal immigrants.      \\"As far as everybody else, we're going to go through the process,\\" Trump said. \\"What people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country. Bush, the same thing. Lots of people were brought out of the country with the existing laws. Well, I'm going to do the same thing.\\"            Donald Trump at a rally in Dimondale, Mich. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)      Later in the interview, Trump again explained how this group of people would be treated.      \\"As far as the rest, we're going to go through the process, like they are now, perhaps with a lot more energy, and we're going to do it only through the system of laws,\\" Trump said.      At one point, O'Reilly asked Trump about expanding the court system to adjudicate all of these cases and setting up detention centers to house people as they wait for their immigration cases to be heard. Trump quickly batted down the suggestion that he would house people in detention centers.      [ In the latest shift, Donald Trump’s campaign seems to waver on mass deportations ]      \\"You don't have to put them in a detention center,\\" Trump said. \\"Bill, you're the first one to mention 'detention center.' You don't have to put them in a detention center. ... I'm not going to put them in a detention center. No.\\"      O'Reilly said that he suggested detention centers because Trump had previously likened his plans to mass deportations carried out during the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.      \\"I said that it's something that has been done in a very strong manner,\\" Trump said, explaining why he had originally referenced the historic deportations. \\"I don't agree with that.

In Hillary Clinton’s world, we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else,\\" he said.

A:","output":"In the theological sense, \\"Rapture\\" refers to an event in the belief systems of certain Christian denominations, particularly among dispensationalist and fundamentalist Christians.

One such leader, Yousuf Raza Gilani, served as the 16th Prime Minister of Pakistan from March 2008 to June 2012, a time marked by persisting challenges and an ever-evolving political landscape. Through discreet political maneuvers and determination, Gilani repeatedly silenced critics and resisted the judiciary throughout his tenure, effectively securing his position in office until June 2012. The Wily Political Operator: Yousuf Raza Gilani Born on June 9, 1952, Yousuf Raza Gilani's political aptitude can be traced back to his lineage, as he hails from an influential family in the Multan district in the Punjab province. His family's long history of political engagement provided him with a strong foundation, eventually propelling him into a successful political run. As a member of Pakistan's major political party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Gilani's wit and proficiency made it easier for him to infiltrate the political world. It was during his tenure as Prime Minister when he first encountered scrutiny from Pakistan's Supreme Court. Following accusations of financial corruption in 2009, the apex court ordered the reopening of corruption cases against the President Asif Ali Zardari. Gilani, however, was resolute in rejecting the court's request, adamant that the sitting President enjoyed immunity from prosecution. This dispute would mark the beginning of Gilani's brushes with the judiciary- a high-stakes tug-of-war that would continue to play out for the duration of his time in office. Enduring the Storm: Defying Critics and the Judiciary Despite the clouds of controversy that loomed over him, Gilani demonstrated a remarkable ability to survive the hostile political environment. Throughout his time as Prime Minister, he employed a variety of tactics to ensure his longevity in the face of adversity. Among the key strategies he employed were the formation of essential political alliances, remaining loyal to party leaders, and navigating parliamentary politics with dexterity. First, Gilani's keen understanding of the importance of political alliances became his secret weapon in securing his office. His unwavering loyalty to the PPP, particularly its party leaders, allowed him to execute directives effectively and deflect backlash from the opposition. By aligning himself with influential stakeholders, Gilani ensured that the balance of power was in his favor, which safeguarded him against legal challenges. Second, his mastery of parliamentary politics allowed him to overcome numerous obstacles that arose throughout his tenure. His compassionate demeanor made it easier for him to establish rapport with members of the opposition, using their support to push through significant bills and policies. This strategy was not only instrumental in achieving breakthroughs for the politicians but also created a favorable reputation for himself, both locally and internationally. Lastly, remaining loyal to the PPP ensured that he maintained the backing of his party. Throughout his tenure, Gilani consistently supported party leaders and reinforced the PPP's vision for a progressive and prosperous Pakistan. This loyalty reinforced his position within the party and solidified his power base, effectively allowing him to face down challenges from the judiciary and resist any attempts to remove him from office. Conclusion Yousuf Raza Gilani's tenure as Pakistan's 16th Prime Minister highlights a story of resilience marred by numerous complexities and hurdles. Despite the challenges posed by Pakistan's turbulence-afflicted political climate, Gilani's unwavering determination helped him maintain his position in the face of critics and the judiciary until June 2012. His unique style, adept political maneuverings, and unwavering loyalty to his party serve as a testament to his political mastery and resilience in office."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful. When kids go off to college, you can text them a picture each week of something that inspires your appreciation. Teaching children to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in their lives is perhaps the greatest gift we can give them. And we can all learn together that the things that really... Question: How do children respond when receiving gifts from their parents? Answer: Answer:","output":"Children often respond to receiving gifts from their parents with an expectation that it is the parent's responsibility to take care of the family and provide them with what they need or desire. This perspective might hinder them from expressing genuine gratitude for the gifts they receive, as they may view them as a result of their parents simply fulfilling their duties. To counter this, it is important for parents to encourage a wider worldview and an understanding of gratitude that goes beyond material possessions. By teaching children to focus on the positive aspects of their lives and appreciate their good fortune, parents can nurture a more genuine sense of gratitude in their children when receiving gifts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The line is named after the Oder and Neisse rivers which form the border.  The reasoning behind the use of this line was due to the Potsdam Conference, a meeting between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 1945, where they agreed on this provisional border. The aim was to acknowledge the territorial losses of Germany in favor of Poland due to World War II-related population shifts and border changes.

In this problem, a car travels from San Diego to San Francisco and back at different speeds. The average speed of the trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Step 2: Identify the given information in the problem. - The average speed from San Diego to San Francisco is 54 mph. - The journey back takes twice as long. Step 3: Use the given information to find the total distance and total time of the trip. For this step, let's assume the distance between San Diego and San Francisco is \\"D\\" miles. - Since the journey back takes twice the time, it means the car's average speed on its way back is half of its speed on its way to San Francisco, so 54/2 = 27 mph. - The total distance of the trip is the distance from San Diego to San Francisco, multiplied by 2 (since the car goes there and back): 2D. - To find the total time of the trip, add the time for the journey to San Francisco and the time back: D/54 (time to San Francisco) + D/27 (time back). - The total time can be expressed as: (D/54) + (D/27). Step 4: Find the average speed of the trip. The average speed of the trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, divide the total distance (2D) by the total time ((D/54) + (D/27)). The average speed formula is: Average Speed = (2D) / [(D/54) + (D/27)] Step 5: Choose the correct answer choice using the information from steps 3 and 4.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1917, Baby Jane Hudson is a vaudevillian child star while her sister Blanche Hudson is not famous and overlooked by their father. By 1935, both sisters are movie actors, but Blanche has achieved stardom, while Janeâs films have flopped, leading Jane to drink heavily. One night, returning from a party, one of the sisters gets out of the car to open the gate leading up to the house, while the other attempts to run her over. The resulting accident leaves Blanche paralyzed. In 1962, a wheelchair-bound Blanche (Joan Crawford) and a bitter, irritable Jane (Bette Davis) are living together in Blanche's mansion. Because she is wheelchair-bound, Blanche rarely leaves her bedroom on the second floor and becomes close with her cleaning woman, Elvira (Maidie Norman). Elvira believes that Jane is exhibiting symptoms of mental illness and becomes concerned for Blanche's well-being, but Blanche defends her sister. Later, when Blanche informs Jane she may be selling the house, Jane's mental health begins to deteriorate further. During an argument, she removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting Blanche off from the outside world. Later, Jane begins denying Blanche food, killing her pet parakeet and serving it to her on a platter. Later, when Jane leaves the house to put an advertisement in the paper, Blanche tries to get the attention of her neighbor, Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee), by writing a note pleading for help and throwing it out her bedroom window. Jane returns in time to notice the note and prevents Mrs. Bates from seeing it. When Jane reads the note, the two sisters quarrel again. The next time Elvira comes to clean the house, Jane initially pays her and gives her the day off, but when Elvira returns later on, Jane abruptly fires her and sends her away.

Plot title: Cliffhanger Movie plot: As the movie opens, we see a guy climbing along the underside of an outcropping from a tall mountain peak. He turns out to be Gabe Walker, a ranger with Rocky Mountain Rescue. (Yes, that makes him \\"Ranger Walker,\\" and he is addressed as such several times during the course of the movie.) He is in communication with his co-worker and girlfriend, Jessie, who is on a chopper piloted by an older co-worker, Frank. The three are mounting a rescue of yet another co-worker, Hal Tucker, and his girlfriend Sarah, who is on her first climb. Hal and Sarah made it to the top of the mountain, but Hal has aggravated an old knee injury and can't make it back down.Gabe makes it to the top of the peak where Hal and Sarah are. The chopper drops Gabe a cable, which he secures, while the chopper lands on a nearby peak. All is set for the three to shuttle across the cable to where the chopper is. There is a lot of light-hearted banter as this is a routine operation that they all (except Sarah) do all the time. Hal goes first, and as he is crossing, Gabe asks Sarah how Hal persuaded her to accompany him on this escapade. She replies laconically, \\"He told me it's better than sex.\\"Hal makes it across and now it's Sarah's turn. She is a little frightened at the thought of hanging from a cable 4,000 feet above the ground, but the fact that Hal crossed without incident is reassuring. Halfway across her equipment fails and suddenly she is hanging by a strap and unable to reach and grab onto the cable. Gabe quickly crosses to her and grabs her arm just as the strap breaks free. But they are unable to keep their grip on each other, and Sarah falls 4,000 feet to her death.

Here is a question about this article: The Ottoman Empire, believed to be about to collapse, was portrayed in the press as the sick man of Europe\\". The Balkan states, with the partial exception of Bosnia and Albania, were primarily Christian. Starting in 1894 the Ottomans struck at the Armenians on the explicit grounds that they were a non-Muslim people and as such were a potential threat to the Muslim empire within which they resided. The Hamidian Massacres aroused the indignation of the entire Christian world. In the United States the now aging Julia Ward Howe, author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, leaped into the war of words and joined the Red Cross. Relations of minorities within the Ottoman Empire and the disposition of former Ottoman lands became known as the \\"Eastern Question,\\" as the Ottomans were on the east of Europe. What is the answer to this question: How was the Ottoman Empire portrayed in the press?","output":"The Ottoman Empire was portrayed in the press as the \\"sick man of Europe.\\" This label reflected the widespread perception that the empire was on the verge of collapse due to its internal weaknesses, political instability, and inability to keep up with the modernizing European powers. The image of the Ottoman Empire as the \\"sick man of Europe\\" emerged in the 19th century, particularly as the empire struggled to maintain its territories and faced recurring financial crises. The European press often depicted the Ottoman Empire as a decaying entity, characterized by inefficiency, corruption, and the suppression of minority populations, such as Christians. This portrayal further fueled nationalist movements among the Balkan states, which were primarily Christian and sought independence from the predominantly Muslim Ottoman rule. These movements led to a series of conflicts and confrontations that became known as the \\"Eastern Question.\\" One significant event that exemplified the Ottoman Empire's internal strife and fueled its negative image in the press was the Hamidian Massacres, which occurred between 1894 and 1896. These massacres were carried out by the Ottoman authorities against the Armenian Christian population, leading to the death of tens of thousands of Armenians and generating international outrage. The European and American press covered these events extensively, highlighting the empire's oppressive actions against its non-Muslim citizens and further solidifying the \\"sick man of Europe\\" portrayal. Public figures in the West, such as Julia Ward Howe, author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, also contributed to the criticism of the Ottoman Empire by speaking up against its actions and supporting organizations like the Red Cross that provided aid to the affected populations. Overall, the press portrayed the Ottoman Empire as the \\"sick man of Europe,\\" highlighting its political instability, internal strife, and oppressive nature, particularly towards non-Muslim minorities. This negative portrayal contributed to the growing concerns and debates surrounding the \\"Eastern Question,\\" which dealt with the disposition of the Ottoman lands and the treatment of minorities within the empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Stacked denoising auto encoders (DAEs) are well known to learn useful deep representations, which can be used to improve supervised training by initializing a deep network. We investigate a training scheme of a deep DAE, where DAE layers are gradually added and keep adapting as additional layers are added. We show that in the regime of mid-sized datasets, this gradual training provides a small but consistent improvement over stacked training in both reconstruction quality and classification error over stacked training on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. 1 GRADUAL TRAINING OF DENOISING AUTOENCODERS We test here gradual training of deep denoising auto encoders, training the network layer-by-layer, but lower layers keep adapting throughout training. To allow lower layers to adapt continuously, noise is injected at the input level. This training procedure differs from stack-training of auto encoders (Vincent et al., 2010) More specifically, in gradual training, the first layer of the deep DAE is trained as in stacked training, producing a layer of weights w1. Then, when adding the second layer autoencoder, its weights w2 are tuned jointly with the already-trained weights w1. Given a training sample x, we generate a noisy version x̃, feed it to the 2-layered DAE, and compute the activation at the subsequent layers h1 = Sigmoid(w > 1 x), h2 = Sigmoid(w > 2 h1) and y = Sigmoid(w ′> 3 h2). Importantly, the loss function is computed over the input x, and is used to update all the weights including w1. Similarly, if a 3rd layer is trained, it involves tuning w1 and w2 in addition to w3 and w′ 4. 2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES We compare the performance of gradual and stacked training in two learning setups: an unsupervised denoising task, and a supervised classification task initialized using the weights learned in an unsupervised way. Evaluations were made on three benchmarks: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR100, but only show here MNIST results due to space constraints. We used a test subset of 10,000 samples and several sizes of training-set all maintaining the uniform distribution over classes. Hyper parameters were selected using a second level of cross validation, including the learning rate, SGD batch size, momentum and weight decay. In the supervised experiments, training was ’early stopped’ after 35 epochs without improvement. The results reported below are averages over 3 train-validation splits. Since gradual training involves updating lower layers, every presentation of a sample involves more weight updates than in a single-layered DAE. To compare stacked and gradual training on a common ground, we limited gradual training to use the same budget of weight update steps as stacked training. For example, when training the second layer for n epochs in gradual training, we allocate 2n training epochs for stacked training (details in the full paper). 1 ar X iv :1 50 4. 02 90 2v 1 [ cs .L G ] 1 1 A pr 2 01 5 Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015 a) Unsupervised Training b) Supervised training 0 0.25 0.5 10.4 10.5 10.6 10.7","output":"Generate Headline for Article on Gradual Training of Denoising Autoencoders Task: Create a headline (title) for the provided article text about stacked denoising autoencoders and their gradual training.

More Marines deploy in south WASHINGTON -- The U.S. deployed a quick-reaction force in northern Afghanistan on Wednesday to quell any renewed Taliban resistance as more Marines poured into the southern part of the country, where the Taliban's supreme leader implored his troops to stand and fight. \\"Don't vacate any areas,\\" Mullah Mohammed Omar was quoted as saying in a radio message to his soldiers. \\"This is not a question of tribes. This is a question of Islam.\\" Though the 7-week-old conflict has wrested most of Afghanistan from Omar and relegated what remains of the Taliban to the southern stronghold of Kandahar, the leader told his troops he forbade surrender. Omar's statements came a day after an American B-1 bomber unleashed an attack on a Taliban leadership compound in Kandahar. U.S. officials said it was unclear whether Taliban or Al Qaeda leaders were killed. Red Cross workers Wednesday began tending to the grisly aftermath of a three-day uprising near Mazar-e Sharif, hauling away bodies of slain Taliban fighters, some of whose hands were bound with scarves. Although Red Cross workers suggested that the fighters had been executed, Northern Alliance leaders denied that and said all prisoners had been treated in a brotherly fashion. \\"We did not tie them. We brought them here to be safer,\\" said alliance Gen. Rashid Dostum, whose headquarters are in the Qalai Janghi fortress. \\"We behaved brotherly with them. We treated prisoners according to human rights.\\" Wary that the uprising illustrated the lack of stability plaguing northern Afghanistan, the U.S. sent a small infantry unit from the Army's 10th Mountain Division based in neighboring Uzbekistan to the area around Mazar-e Sharif. The unit, only about 24 soldiers, may become the vanguard of a larger deployment in the beleaguered nation's northern mountains and plains to secure locations like the Bagram airfield, a planned conduit for an expansion of humanitarian relief, U.S. officials said. Meanwhile, CIA officials confirmed Wednesday that Central Intelligence Agency operative Johnny Micheal \\"Mike\\" Spann, the first U.S. combat death in Afghanistan, was killed by rioting prisoners at the Qalai Janghi fortress near Mazar-e Sharif. The Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners were captured during fierce fighting in the northern city of Kunduz and taken to the mud-walled fortress used by the Northern Alliance as a makeshift prison. They staged the revolt after seizing a cache of guns, grenades and mortar shells and using weapons they smuggled past their captors into the fort. The uprising was all but quelled Tuesday after alliance troops reclaimed the fortress, with the help of U.S. commandos and American air strikes. One of those bombs went astray and wounded five U.S. soldiers Monday. They were evacuated to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, where one was in intensive care Wednesday and the other four were in good condition. Four other Americans, all military personnel, have been killed during the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. All died in accidents outside the country, two in a helicopter crash in Pakistan. Along with the Kandahar strike, U.S. warplanes this week bombed areas near Jalalabad where Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, might be hiding amid the fortified caves and bunkers of the Tora Bora mountain encampment. U.S. military officials believe they have narrowed the location of bin Laden and top Taliban leaders to the Tora Bora region or a small area near Kandahar, just inside the Afghan-Pakistani border. The contingent of Marines at a base outside Kandahar grew to between 750 and 800, Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said Wednesday. The commander of the U.S. war effort, Gen. Tommy Franks, has said up to 1,100 troops could be stationed at the base, located within striking distance of the Taliban's last stronghold, Kandahar. \\"The Marines have clearly strengthened their positions,\\" said Marine spokesman David Romley. \\"There were no engagements on our perimeters; however, we continue to flow in additional personnel, equipment and ordnance.\\" The Marine deployment will give the U.S. military campaign a forward operating base to support southern opposition forces as they attack Kandahar and interdict roads thought to be escape routes for fleeing Taliban and Al Qaeda troops and leaders. Omar is believed to be alive, but U.S. military officials insist his control over his troops is rapidly crumbling. The takeover of much of Afghanistan by opposition forces, coupled with air strikes aimed at Taliban leadership, has severely hampered the battered Afghan regime's lines of communication between senior Taliban leaders and their troops, Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem said. \\"Any time you can dismantle leadership or chain of command, you have troops uncontrolled and therefore less effective,\\" said Stufflebeem, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. U.S. pilots are countering Omar's urgings with leaflets aimed at persuading Taliban troops to surrender. Stufflebeem said U.S. military leaders have seen evidence that the leaflet campaign is working. \\"In having interviews with those who are detained, there is information that is coming forward that they are having a positive effect,\\" he said. The U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan was complicated this week by Russia's decision to send scores of troops to Kabul and the Bagram airfield. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday said 12 Russian transport planes had arrived in Afghanistan, bringing staff and supplies, The Washington Post reported. Putin told his Cabinet the planes carried emergency ministry staff, construction crews, demining experts and diplomats to Kabul to establish a humanitarian center and reopen the heavily damaged embassy abandoned when Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 after a 10-year occupation, the newspaper reported. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he believed the troops were dispatched for humanitarian reasons and not military operations. Still, Secretary of State Colin Powell called Russia's foreign minister and urged the Russian government to avoid military or diplomatic moves that could disturb the trust between Russia and the U.S. Talks aimed at ensuring that a stable government is in place once the conflict is over entered their second day near Bonn, as representatives for the Northern Alliance, which controls most of Afghanistan, rejected a United Nations proposal for an international security force in the war-torn country. Alliance officials say their troops are already providing adequate security in Afghanistan. \\"We don't feel a need for an outside force. There is security in place,\\" said Mohammad Yunis Qanooni, the alliance's interior minister. Northern Alliance leaders also said Wednesday that they plan to send forces south of Kabul to establish control of the Ghazni province, which likely would anger Pashtuns in the south and Pakistan, home to many Pashtuns and a key U.S. ally in Central Asia, senior commanders told The New York Times. In southern Afghanistan, anti-Taliban Pashtun leader Gul Agha Shirzai said talks over a peaceful Taliban surrender at Spin Boldak had failed and opposition forces would fight. Shirzai said he had 3,000 fighters ready. Tribal rivalries between Nurzais and Achekzais have complicated talks for the surrender of the Afghan border town in the past three days. The former mujahedeen commanders representing the two tribes have been vying for control of Spin Boldak, a center for smugglers and traders. Nurzai tribal leader Abdul Khaliq left the negotiations Wednesday, said his spokesman, Zulmai Afzali. \\"Neither side is prepared to give power to the other,\\" Afzali said. \\"The Taliban are still in control.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The U.S. deployed a quick-reaction force in northern Afghanistan and more Marines into the southern part of the country to quell any renewed Taliban resistance, as Mullah Mohammed Omar urged his troops to stand and fight.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

The story line is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the film. It is a visual treat.  Done in 3D and rendered in black and white (no greys!) with only one short spot of colour, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. There are many \\"arty\\" camera shots - closeups and odd viewpoints - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. Overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form.

But unlike \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" - which suffers from (or indeed is enhanced by) inconsistent character definition (just watch the way some of the hair changes shape!) - Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. When the character is in close-up, added details and texture can bee seen, but when in mid-shot or further away details are omitted, but not to the detriment of character definition.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin?

This is very important because you should always be careful and protect your stuff, like when you put a lock on your bicycle. One day at this conference, a very special and smart boy named Reuben Paul took the stage! Reuben is only 11 years old, but he knows a lot about computers and internet safety. People were surprised to see someone so young, but Reuben showed them something super cool - he took over people's Bluetooth devices, like phones, and then made his teddy bear, Bob, turn its lights on and record audio! Can you imagine your teddy bear doing that? Reuben wanted to show everyone that anything, even toys, can be dangerous if they are connected to the internet, because bad people can try to control them. He also said the same thing can happen with fridges, cars, or anything else that uses the internet! That's why it's important to be careful and learn about internet safety. Reuben is so cool, isn't he? He is starting a special group to help teach kids and adults about being safe on the internet. His dad is very proud of him and says that Reuben showed him that children's toys can be like \\"time bombs\\" if they are not protected. And guess what? When Reuben was only 8 years old, he gave a speech at another conference and made his own educational gaming website! He's a very busy and clever boy who even knows kung fu! So, next time you play with your toys or use the internet, remember Reuben and make sure to stay safe and protect your stuff! That's what Reuben wants to teach everyone in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma.

Write an article based on this summary: – A Vanity Fair interview with Angelina Jolie made headlines last week for a range of items, including the revelation she'd developed Bell's palsy last year. But one nugget in particular caught people's attention: how she allegedly cast kids for her new Netflix movie, First They Killed My Father, based on the story of Loung Ung, a Cambodia-born activist who lived under Pol Pot's regime. Vanity Fair described the casting process as a game \\"rather disturbing in its realism,\\" in which Cambodian kids were asked to snatch money off a table (after thinking of something they needed it for), then asked to create a lie about why they'd needed the money after being \\"captured.\\" The actress eventually tapped to play Ung reportedly became \\"overwhelmed with emotion\\" during her own audition, noting she'd been thinking of her grandfather's death and her family's inability to pay for his funeral. All of which had people railing against Jolie for her \\"emotionally abusive and cruel\\" casting methods, per the BBC. But Jolie says, via a statement to Variety, that the audition was simply an improv exercise based on a scene from the film and that real money wasn't used. \\"I am upset,\\" she says, adding: \\"I would be outraged myself if this had happened,\\" referring to the \\"false and upsetting\\" prospect of real cash being ripped away from kids. She also notes \\"every measure was taken to ensure the safety, comfort, and well-being of the children on the film\\" and to \\"make sure that no one was in any way hurt by participating in the re-creation of such a painful part of their country's history.\\" Producer Rithy Panh also issued his own statement, noting that guardians, tutors, doctors, and therapists were all on the set to help kids along during the filmmaking process.

Some people were worried that this game was too scary and sad for the kids. They thought Angelina was being mean to them.

Write highlights for this article: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The notorious Iraq prison once called Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraqi government control. And the Ministry of Justice has launched a public-relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were tortured there -- first under Saddam Hussein, and later by American troops. The Iraqi Ministry of Justice gave journalists an inside look at the prison formerly known as Abu Ghraib. It is now called Baghdad Central Prison, and has water fountains, a freshly planted garden and a gym -- complete with weights and sports teams' jerseys on the walls. Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Iraqis were thrown behind bars here. There were horrific stories of torture, abuse, execution without trial. In 2004, the prison was once again thrown into the international spotlight, this time because of abuse by U.S. troops.  Watch how the prison has been revamped ». Detainees were photographed in degrading positions, as Americans posed next to them smiling. The images -- naked prisoners stacked on top of each other, or being threatened by dogs, or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution -- caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, commander of the Abu Ghraib prison at the time, was demoted in rank to colonel because of the scandal. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as \\"bad apples\\" -- were disciplined after the scandal surfaced. Rumsfeld later said the day the scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary. \\"Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened,\\" Rumsfeld said shortly before leaving office at the end of 2006. \\"I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse.\\" The United States always denied it was a matter of policy to torture detainees. But it shut down Abu Ghraib in September 2006 and turned the facility over to the Iraqis. They have revamped and reopened it. Rooms have been transformed and renovated. CNN was told, but not shown, that a few hundred prisoners are here already, in a revamped part of the facility that can hold up to 3,000 prisoners. The capacity is critical to help deal with overcrowding at Iraq's other facilities and the potential security threat. The Iraqi government is going to great lengths to try to change the image this facility has. It organized a tour for journalists, very carefully orchestrated by the Ministry of Justice. Murtada Sharif, the only Ministry of Justice official to speak to CNN on camera about the prison, admitted Abu Ghraib is synonymous in people's minds with the inhumane acts that took place there both before and after the fall of Saddam in 2003. \\"We want to change its image, to make it a place of justice,\\" he said. A wing that used to hold a thousand prisoners In Saddam Hussein's time now is ready for 160. Cells that used to hold between 30 and 50 people now have a capacity of eight. Prisoners and their families actually get to see each other -- the prisoners behind a cage-like structure, the families on the other side of the fence, in a courtyard with a playground for the children. Again, it is part of the whole effort to create a different atmosphere. But human rights organizations in Iraq say abuse and torture remain routine in Iraq's detention facilities. Changing Abu Ghraib's infamous reputation may take more than fresh paint and fake flowers. Highlights:","output":"1.

Sentence 1 suggests that the country has a vast and diverse range of geographical features.  Sentence 2 states that the geography of the country is noticeably different in various parts. Step 2: Determine the connection between the sentences. Both sentences are describing the variability of the country's geography. Step 3: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. To determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1, we must examine if Sentence 2 would necessarily be true if Sentence 1 is true. Step 4: Analyze the entailment. Since Sentence 1 describes the country as a \\"veritable compendium of geography,\\" it implies that the country's geography includes a wide variety of features. This would mean that there are differences in the geography throughout the country. Sentence 2, stating that the country's geography is \\"starkly different throughout,\\" also points to the differences in the geography across various parts of the country. In conclusion, Sentence 2 is indeed entailed by Sentence 1. The first sentence implies the existence of diverse geographical features throughout the country, which in turn leads to the second sentence's assertion that the geography is noticeably different in various parts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: Is there hope in my ex wanting to get back with me? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices:  a). no;  b). yes;","output":"b). yes; These two questions are indeed asking the same thing, as both questions seek to explore the possibility of an ex-partner wanting to rekindle a romantic relationship. While they are phrased differently, the core concern expressed in both questions is the same. To address the matter, it is essential to consider various aspects of the situation, and not just the way your ex talks to you. The fact that your ex still talks to you the same way as before might signal that they still feel comfortable communicating with you. However, this could also mean that they are attempting to maintain a healthy friendship or just remaining cordial despite the breakup. Whether or not there is hope of getting back together requires analyzing more variables. Some factors you may want to consider include: 1. Mutual feelings: Do both you and your ex still have feelings for each other? Sometimes, after a breakup, feelings can linger, but it is essential to assess whether this will lead to a healthy, loving relationship when you get back together. 2. Understanding the reasons for the breakup: Reflecting on the causes of the breakup can illuminate whether the same issues might resurface if you were to get back together. If the problems seem resolvable or are now in the past, the chances of having a successful, renewed relationship might be higher. 3. Communication: Open and honest communication is key in determining whether your ex has any interest in rekindling the relationship. Discussing the matter with your ex will be more reliable than making assumptions based on how they talk to you. 4. Assessing personal growth: Have you or your ex grown, changed, or evolved since the breakup? Personal growth can ignite new hope in a relationship, especially if the growth has led to tangible self-improvement and lessons learned from past mistakes or shortcomings. 5. Timing and external factors: Sometimes, external factors unrelated to the relationship can influence whether getting back together is feasible, such as long-distance, work, or other life circumstances. In conclusion, while the way your ex talks to you might provide some indication of their feelings towards you, it is not enough to discern whether they genuinely want to get back together. Taking into account the aspects listed above, as well as engaging in open communication, can help determine the possibility of rekindling your relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of his middle name suggests that he might be generally referred to as \\"Timothy\\" or \\"Tim\\". 2. Date of Birth and Death: Timothy Slack was born on April 11, 1913, and he died in June 1976. This means that at the time of his death, he was 63 years old. Thus, we can gather that he lived through significant periods of American and global history, including both World Wars, the Great Depression, and the initial stages of the Cold War. 3. Political Affiliation: Slack was a member of the Republican Party. This provides information about his ideological perspective and general stance on economic and social issues, assuming his views aligned with typical Republican viewpoints during his lifetime. 4. Professional Life: He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, marking him as a significant political figure within the state. However, the biography doesn't specify the precise years of his tenure, the specific district he represented, or the issues he championed while in office. 5. Residence: Given his political role, it can be inferred that Timothy Slack resided in Pennsylvania for at least a portion of his life, although the biography doesn't provide further details about his life outside of his political career. 6. Nationality: As he was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, it can be deduced that he was an American citizen. However, Timothy Slack's biography does lack details on various aspects. For example, it provides no information about his early life, educational background, family life, or career progression. Likewise, the biography also doesn't present any details about any notable accomplishments or controversies during his tenure in the House of Representatives.

Paragraph: Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change.

Question: If you wanted to find some Sanskrit texts, where would you best looking? Context: Sanskrit has also influenced Sino-Tibetan languages through the spread of Buddhist texts in translation. Buddhism was spread to China by Mahayana missionaries sent by Ashoka, mostly through translations of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit.

PUBLISHED:. 07:40 EST, 12 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:11 EST, 12 July 2013. Darren Feldman was given £20,000 compensation after a tribunal agreed his position at HCA International had become intolerable. A Jewish surveyor received £20,000 in compensation today after a tribunal found that his bullying boss repeatedly taunted him and said he wanted to lock up and gas 'Yids' like Apprentice star Lord Sugar’s son. Darren Feldman’s manager Chris Oates also repeatedly invited him to JuJu, an exclusive champagne bar on London’s King’s Road and mocked Jewish Tottenham football fans. Mr Oates also said he wanted to run past the club’s White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ printed on the back. Referring to Lord Sugar’s son Daniel, with whom he was negotiating a deal, Mr Oates said: 'Quite frankly they’re all a bunch of Yids. I’d like to lock them in the building and gas them all.' A panel at Central London employment tribunal ruled that Mr Feldman, 33, was hounded out of his £47,500-a-year job with private hospital group HCA International. It found the firm and Mr Oates guilty of race and religious discrimination and harassment, ruling that Mr Feldman was constructively dismissed. Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, was awarded £15,000 for injury to feelings and £5,000 for lost earnings. Speaking after the tribunal, Mr Feldman said: 'I am very relieved by this outcome. I was so disturbed by my treatment at HCA and it is a shame the company fought this to the end. 'I hope HCA takes action to make sure this never happens again.' HCA’s London hospitals also include. the Portland, Princess Grace, Wellington, Lister, London Bridge, Harley Street Clinic, and Harley Street at University College Hospital. Mr. Feldman’s solicitor Shilpen Savani of law firm DWFM Beckman, said:. 'This is an extreme instance of an employer failing to safeguard an. employee. 'Mr Feldman should never have been subjected to such abuse.' Giving evidence, qualified surveyor Mr Feldman told how he joined HCA as a construction project manager in April last year. Colleagues soon learned that he was Jewish when he showed them a tattoo in Hebrew on his ankle. He told how director of estates and projects Mr Oates, who is in his 40s and not Jewish, called him into his office. Mr Feldman (pictured above) alleged that on his boss's birthday,. the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar,. son of Apprentice star Lord Sugar, when Mr Oates made the remarks. Mr. Feldman said: 'Chris asked me what I thought of the idea of his to run. down White Hart Lane wearing an Arsenal football top with the writing. ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ on the back. He wrote it out on a piece of scrap paper. 'This was a derogatory and offensive. reference to the fact that Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is known to. have a large contingent of Jewish supporters. 'I did not know how to answer that question as I was shocked and offended.' Mr Feldman said that his tormentor then looked up bar JuJu on an iPad and showed him the search results. 'Chris. then asked if I wanted to go to a club after work which is located. along King's Road called JuJu. He pointed his finger at me saying \\"want. to go to JuJu, Juju?\\" repeating it several times in an intimidating. manner.' 'Chris was not only a bully in the way that he treated me but he was also seriously abusive towards me because I was Jewish.' In. his evidence, Mr Feldman said that on his boss's birthday the pair. discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of. Apprentice star and former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar. Spanish electrician Juan Ignacio, who sued HCA International in 2009 after being nicknamed 'Manuel' after the Fawlty Towers waiter at London Bridge Hospital. Mr. Oates is alleged to have said: 'I'm just messing them around. Quite. frankly they're all a bunch of Yids. I'd like to lock them in the. building and gas them all'. It. will be the second payout by American firm HCA, the world’s largest. private hospital group, in recent years after a race discrimination. claim. HCA and Mr Oates strenuously denied Mr Feldman's allegations. A. string of HCA witnesses including Mr Oates, who remains at the firm,. had also denied Mr Feldman’s allegations of racism but the tribunal. rejected their evidence. HCA said that it is 'deeply disappointed' by the judgment and considering an appeal. A. spokesperson said: 'HCA has a clear code of conduct around acceptable,. professional and ethical behaviour and offers an inclusive, open and. supportive working environment for all our staff.' In 2009, Spanish. electrician Juan Ignacio alleged that he was nicknamed ‘Manuel’ after. the Fawlty Towers waiter by workmates at HCA’s London Bridge Hospital. He. complained he was taunted with the famous ‘I know nothing’ and ‘Que?’ catchphrases used by Andrew Sachs’s iconic sitcom character. He. claimed that bullying bosses mocked his accent and jibed ‘He’s from. Barcelona’ in front of others - the standard excuse made for Manuel by. John Cleese’s Basil. Mr Ignacio sued HCA for race and sexual orientation discrimination, harassment and constructive dismissal. On. the first day of his planned five-day hearing HCA agreed to pay him an. undisclosed sum in an out-of-court settlement without admitting any. liability.","output":"1.

Answer the following question: Question: What is Mill's position at the studio? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Player Context: Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a Hollywood studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow (Cynthia Stevenson). He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant) and Andy Sivella (Dean Stockwell), who pitch Habeas Corpus, a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker...

Instead, it is more related to the quality of being lesser.    b. Much: This word implies a large amount or great extent. While it does suggest a larger quantity, it doesn't directly convey the opposite meaning of little in terms of size or measurement.    c. Bog: This word refers to a wetland or marsh area.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that composed the four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent? is inside the article: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an..., can you guess it ?

One evening, after getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate in a park's fountain, and simultaneously wish that they had each other's lives. The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay.  However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno). Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on. After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Dave's life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm. On the night of her ballet recital, Cara, Dave's eldest child, is about to be pushed by another girl who has a habit of bullying her, but takes Mitch's advice and throws her to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells Mitch that she loves him and Mitch says the same thing, but feels guilty for doing so immediately after. That night, Mitch and Jamie begin to have sex with each other, but Mitch angrily finds that his guilt will not allow him to become erect, and he admits that he is not cut out for the responsibilities of an adult. Jamie comforts him, and he discreetly rests his head on her breasts. The answer is:","output":"The assistant, Sabrina McKay, is going on a date with Dave.

Frank Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Tides of Justice\\" Genre: Legal Drama, Thriller Plot: Frank Thompson, a seasoned and much-beloved public defender, has spent his entire career fighting for the underdogs in his community. While his success rate in the courtroom is admirable, it's not without its consequences. Frank has faced backlash from numerous powerful and influential figures in the legal system, many of whom want nothing more than to see him lose in a highly-publicized case. Meanwhile, Kelly Matthews, a young and ambitious prosecutor, is handpicked by District Attorney Arnold Becker to ensure Frank's next high-profile case ends in defeat. The case involves the mysterious death of a local councilman who was found dead on a park bench with no apparent evidence pointing to any suspects. When evidence begins to surface indicating that the late councilman's involvement in illegal activities may be the motive behind his murder, Frank steps up to defend the young man accused of the crime – Nick Collins. Nick, a small-time homeless guy, had been seen arguing with the councilman on numerous instances, but despite his disadvantaged situation, he is well-liked by the community and seems to have a philanthropic spirit at his core. Kelly, eager to make a name for herself in the legal world, believes she has gathered enough evidence to convict Nick of the murder and is prepared to win at any cost. The trial begins with a battle of wits as Kelly and Frank face off in a series of intense and emotional arguments as they try to sway the jury to their respective sides. Each day becomes more dramatic than the last as new evidence and shocking revelations come to light, and it soon becomes apparent that there may be more to this case than meets the eye. As public interest about the trial grows, the stakes are raised even higher for both Frank and Kelly. Despite their differing opinions, the two lawyers begin to develop a mutual respect for each other's abilities and tenacity. However, their newfound connection is soon put to the test on the climactic day of the trial. In a surprising twist, Frank finds evidence exonerating Nick, implicating the late councilman's shady business partners in the murder instead. As the truth unfolds, Kelly starts to question her own integrity and motivations for winning the case. Who gives the closing argument? Frank, against all odds and much to the dismay of the District Attorney, delivers a passionate and stirring closing argument, describing the importance of justice for all, regardless of their social standing or past mistakes. He also highlights the danger of prosecuting and convicting innocent people just to maintain a perfect track record in the courtroom. His eloquent and heartfelt words strike a chord with the jury, who return a verdict of not guilty for Nick. As Kelly acknowledges her defeat, she realizes the importance of seeking genuine justice rather than personal gain within the legal system. In the end, \\"The Tides of Justice\\" is a gripping legal drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. With its captivating performances, fascinating twists, and powerful message about the importance of finding the truth and maintaining one's integrity, it's a film that will leave a lasting impact on audiences everywhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: SCUBA divers and mermaids can also be seen from the boat. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence. In this case, the first sentence talks about coastal cruises and a glass-bottomed boat trip to view colorful fish and marine plant life. The information provided in the first sentence is about the type of boat trips that allow passengers to see marine life through the bottom of the boat. However, the second sentence introduces new and unrelated information – talking about SCUBA divers and mermaids being seen from the boat. While it is possible that the glass-bottomed boat trip may provide a view of SCUBA divers if they happen to be in the area, the mention of mermaids, which are mythical creatures, is not guaranteed by the information provided in the first sentence. To summarize, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as the presence of SCUBA divers and mermaids are not explicitly mentioned or guaranteed in the first sentence. Their appearance during a coastal cruise or glass-bottomed boat trip is incidental and not a direct consequence of the information provided in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Russian language is an East Slavic language, primarily spoken by the people of Russia and some neighboring countries. It is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages, with over 258 million speakers globally, and it is an official language of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which was derived from the Greek alphabet and some additional local symbols, eventually evolving into its modern form by the early 18th century. Russian grammar is characterized by a complex system of noun cases, which show the relationship between the noun and other elements in a sentence, such as adjectives, verbs, and prepositions. There are six main cases in Russian: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional. The language also features extensive use of prefixes and suffixes to create new words or alter the meaning of existing words. Verb conjugations in Russian depend on both tense and the subject's gender, with distinct forms for present, past, and future tenses. In addition to its grammar, Russian is known for its rich literary heritage, with famous authors like Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, and many others who made significant contributions to world literature. Russian literature encompasses various genres, including poetry, prose, and drama, making it an essential component of global cultural heritage. Learning the Russian language can be challenging, but it also leads to a deeper understanding of the culture, history, and people of Russia and its neighboring countries. Like with any language, consistent practice, exposure to native speakers, and engagement with the culture through literature, cinema, and other forms of art can aid in learning and appreciating the richness of the Russian language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: February 7, 2018 is a day that will live forever in the hearts of celebrity news connoisseurs, for that was the day that Quincy Jones gave an interview to Vulture in which he claimed, among other things, that: A) Ringo Starr can’t drum for shit; B) The Chicago mob killed John F. Kennedy; and C) Richard Pryor and Marlon Brando made sweet, druggy love to each other back in the ‘70s. It was a great moment in internet culture, bringing together people of all walks of life to gossip about affairs that happened 40 years ago—which are the best kinds of affairs to gossip about, because everyone involved has already moved on (or is no longer with us, in the case of Brando and Pryor).      Now, though, Jones has apologized for the “silly things” he said in his interviews with Vulture and GQ, saying that his six daughters had sat him down and basically told him he was too old and too distinguished of a public figure to be running his mouth like that. “Even at 85, it’s apparent that ‘word vomit’ and bad-mouthing is inexcusable,” he says, referring to all the shit he talked not only about The Beatles, but U2 (who he says used to be a good band) and Michael Jackson (who he called “Machiavellian”) as well.      Jones doesn’t go so far as to walk back anything he said in those interviews, mind you, just says that he should have known better than to put all that on the record. As far as Brando and Pryor go, soon after the Vulture interview was published, Pryor’s widow Jennifer Lee Pryor told TMZ that hell yeah, they hooked up, and that Pryor would have found the whole thing hilarious. Pryor’s daughter Rain and Brando’s son Miko then came forward to dispute Jennifer Lee Pryor’s claim, a family disagreement that may have helped prompt Jones’ apology.      [via Vulture] ||||| The 84-year-old record producer says he had a long talk with his daughters about what he said, and he is sorry.      Quincy Jones on Thursday morning issued an apology for remarks he made in bombshell interviews with Vulture and GQ in late January.      In his apology, the music legend said his daughters took him aside and talked to him about the effects of the comments.      The 84-year-old record producer said he stopped drinking a few years back and his memory of past events is not as sharp as it should be, which is one of the side effects, so his stories do not paint the whole picture.      \\"I am sorry to anyone whom my words offended, and I am especially sorry to my friends who are still here with me and those who aren't,\\" Jones said in the statement.      One of the biggest tales Jones shared in one interview was that the late Richard Pryor allegedly had a sexual relationship with the late Marlon Brando. Pryor's ex-wife said it was true, but Brando's son denied the claim.      Jones was also pretty hard on The Beatles in one interview, calling them \\"no-playing motherfuckers.\\"      \\"Paul was the worst bass player I ever heard. And Ringo? Don't even talk about it,\\" he said. \\"I remember once we were in the studio with George Martin, and Ringo had taken three hours for a four-bar thing he was trying to fix on a song. He couldn't get it.\\"      In the lengthy apology, Jones made it clear he already reached out to \\"many\\" of his friends who were mentioned in the interviews so he could tell them sorry, personally.      \\"These friends are like blood family to me,\\" he said in the Thursday statement. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications. You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history.

Among these were criticisms of Ringo Starr's drumming abilities, allegations that the Chicago mob killed John F. Kennedy, and that Richard Pryor and Marlon Brando engaged in a sexual relationship back in the '70s. The interview quickly became a major talking point in celebrity news and internet culture. However, Jones later apologized for his comments, stating that his six daughters had confronted him about his remarks. He admitted that, even at 85, he should not have engaged in bad-mouthing or \\"word vomit,\\" acknowledging that his behavior was inexcusable. While Jones did not wholly retract any of his statements, he recognized that he should have known better than to put such claims on record. Following the Vulture interview, Richard Pryor's widow, Jennifer Lee Pryor, confirmed the alleged relationship between Pryor and Brando to TMZ, stating that Pryor would have found the whole situation amusing. However, Pryor's daughter, Rain, and Brando's son, Miko, subsequently came forward to dispute Jennifer Lee Pryor's account, contributing to Jones's decision to issue an apology. In his apology, Jones mentioned that he had stopped drinking a few years prior, resulting in a less sharp memory of past events, and that his stories may not have painted the whole picture. He expressed regret to anyone offended by his words, especially to his surviving friends and those who have passed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Assess the information about the Gram stain The Gram stain is a widely used method in microbiology for differentiating bacterial species into two groups (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) based on the characteristics of their cell walls. While the Gram stain is useful for classification, it may not always provide specific information on the optimal stain for a particular bacterium. Step 3: Research Nocardia bacteria characteristics Nocardia is a genus of bacteria that are Gram-positive, aerobic, and filamentous. They are part of the Actinomycetales order, and some species are known to cause human diseases such as nocardiosis. Step 4: Determine if the Gram stain is suitable for Nocardia bacteria Since Nocardia bacteria have a Gram-positive cell wall structure, the Gram stain would generally be effective in distinguishing them from Gram-negative bacteria. However, the question asks which stain shows better test results on Nocardia bacteria, which implies a comparison to other staining methods. Step 5: Assess other staining methods for Nocardia bacteria One specific staining method for Nocardia is the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain, which allows for better visualization and identification of these filamentous bacteria. Step 6: Provide the answer The Gram stain can provide some information on Nocardia bacteria, as they are Gram-positive. However, the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain might show better test results specifically for Nocardia bacteria, as it is designed to visualize and identify filamentous bacteria like Nocardia more effectively. In conclusion, while the Gram stain can help differentiate Nocardia bacteria based on their cell wall structure, the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain may provide better test results specifically for this genus."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Dust Brothers are Los Angeles, California-based, producers, E.Z. Mike (Michael Simpson) and King Gizmo (John King), famous for their sample-based music in the 1980s and 1990s, and specifically for their work on the albums \\"Paul's Boutique\\" by the Beastie Boys, \\"Odelay\\" by Beck, the soundtrack to the film \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"MMMBop\\" by Hanson.  - DGC Records (an acronym for David Geffen Company) is an American record label that currently operates as a division of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, which is owned by Vivendi S.A..  - \`\` Debra '' is a song by Beck . He had originally attempted to record \`\` Debra '' with the Dust Brothers for Odelay , but he thought that it was too tongue - in - cheek . It was debuted main - stream in 1996 , and , as Beck noted , \`\` it became the centerpiece of the whole set . It was the song that people would react to more than the songs that they 'd heard on the radio . So we kept playing it and playing it . '' The song finally made it on to Midnite Vultures in 1999 . The song maintains a cult following . The song was covered by German industrial artist Kompressor . Kompressor 's version is called \`\` Kompressor Want To Get With You . ''  - \\"MMMBop\\" is a song written and performed by the American pop rock band Hanson from their 1997 album \\"Middle of Nowhere\\". The song was nominated for two Grammys at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1998, and is the band's most successful single to date. \\"MMMBop\\" was phenomenally successful, especially for a debut single, reaching number one in 27 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Mexico. In the United Kingdom, the song sold 710,000 copies and stayed at number one for 3 weeks.  - Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known mononymously as Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and multi-instrumentalist. He is mostly known for his musical composition, as well as a palette of sonic genres.  - Midnite Vultures is the fourth official studio album and seventh overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, released in November 1999 by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying musical styles, \\"Midnite Vultures\\" didn't achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough, \\"Odelay\\", though it was still critically and commercially well received.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A soundtrack, also written sound track, can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film or TV show; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound.  - Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records. Featuring production by the Dust Brothers, the album was recorded in Matt Dike's apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, and mixed at the Record Plant. Subsequent remixes were done at the Manhattan-based Record Plant Studios. The album is noted for being almost completely composed of samples, excluding the group's vocal output.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar).  - Odelay is the second official studio album and fifth overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, originally released on June 18, 1996, by DGC Records.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).

Plot title: The Final Cut Movie plot: The serial opens with Prime Minister Francis Urquhart shooting his gun dog, now too old to perform its duties â a scene which establishes the theme of the ending of a career. Shortly afterwards, Urquhart attends the fictional state funeral of Margaret Thatcher. He publicly praises Thatcher as his mentor, but privately begrudges her record as the longest-serving prime minister in recent history,[note 1] a record that Urquhart himself is soon to surpass. To \\"leave my mark on the world,\\" Urquhart champions a treaty resolving the Cyprus dispute while secretly working to bring offshore oil deposits under the control of the Turkish authorities on the island so that a Turkish-British consortium will have the drilling rights; an executive of the consortium has promised to provide for Urquhart's retirement fund in return. Urquhart also has a personal connection to Cyprus: as a nineteen-year-old British Army lieutenant serving there in 1956, he killed two young EOKA guerrillas while trying to get information from them. Urquhart has frequent nightmares and flashbacks of this event, and also of the murders of Mattie Storin and others, shown in the previous series. On a motorway near London, Urquhart's car is rammed by another car containing three drunken louts. The attackers are quickly killed by his security staff. Urquhart sustains minor head injuries in the collision, but his life is not endangered. When Elizabeth arrives at hospital, he is delirious and confuses the incident on the motorway with the incident in Cyprus. Tom Makepeace, Urquhart's Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, chairs a cabinet meeting while Urquhart is in hospital; Urquhart considers Makepeace â the actual negotiator of the Cyprus treaty â as a potential challenger, although he doesn't take the threat very seriously, considering him \\"not a fighter\\" but \\"a sentimental dreamer\\".

Q:Nowadays,much of the profit of a business--sometimes the whole of its success--depends upon the use of the odds and ends.The odds and ends are various small things,which are left over when the main things are produced.But they possess a real value of their own. If a business,big or small,looked down upon these odds and ends,it would mean a big difference in the amount of the benefit of the business.Take a meat factory for instance,there are countless odds and ends--bones and hair,which can be made into glue and rope to increase its profit greatly. Then,if we are college students,what about our odds and ends--the odd moments?Take time for example.Every one of us has the exact same amount of it.Everyone's success or failure depends on the use of their time.But everyone uses the time more or less in the same way.However,why many great men in science or art have made huge successes for themselves in the world?Because they have made best use of their odd moments.Thomas A.Edison,never allowed his odd moments to slip by.He thought,planned,and tried his inventions.He always worked twenty hours out of each twentyfour.His inventions made him famous all over the world,and provided valuable wealth for the human beings.

What are odds and ends? A) They are nothing useful. B) They are very small,but valuable things. C) They are the main things factories produce. D) They are odd moments students refuse to gather up. A:","output":"B) They are very small, but valuable things. Odds and ends refer to various small things that are left over when the main things are produced. In the context of a business, such as a meat factory, these odds and ends, like bones and hair, may seem insignificant at first glance; however, they can be made into useful products, like glue and rope, to significantly increase the factory's profit. This means that even though these items are smaller and less obvious than the main products, they hold considerable value in their own right. Similarly, for college students, odds and ends can refer to odd moments or fragments of time, which when utilized well, can contribute to their overall success. Great people in science, art, and other fields have managed to achieve significant accomplishments by making the best use of their odd moments. Thomas A. Edison serves as a good example of this, as he constantly utilized his odd moments for thinking, planning, and working on his inventions. This diligent use of his time allowed him to create inventions known worldwide and provided valuable resources for humanity. Recognizing that busy people always find time for everything while people with great spare time find time for nothing emphasizes the need to make the best use of one's time, particularly those odd moments. When individuals learn to gather the fragments of their time and use them effectively, they follow a similar principle to that of businesses utilizing every odds and ends, turning apparent insignificance into significant value.

Please answer this question: What is added to steel (approx 11%) to make it stainless and gives properties that prevent it from corroding, rusting or staining with water ?","output":"Stainless steel is a popular material known for its corrosion resistance, rust protection, and low maintenance properties. To achieve these characteristics, approximately 11% or more of chromium is added to the steel. Chromium is the key element that provides stainless steel with its unique attributes and makes it more resistant to the effects of water, air, and chemicals than ordinary steel. But what is it about chromium that makes stainless steel so effective at combating corrosion, rusting, and staining? Let's discuss this in detail. When chromium is added to steel, it reacts with oxygen in the air to form a thin, invisible, and adherent layer of chromium oxide over the surface of the steel. This passive film is responsible for protecting stainless steel from external elements that might cause corrosion or rusting. The oxide layer is only a few atoms thick and acts as a barrier, hindering further reaction between the steel and its environment. The chromium oxide film is self-healing, which means that if the stainless steel surface is scratched or damaged, new chromium atoms will come into contact with the oxygen, reforming the protective oxide layer and continuing to provide corrosion resistance. This self-healing ability is an essential aspect of the durability and longevity of stainless steel. There are also other alloying elements sometimes added in smaller amounts to enhance the properties of stainless steel: 1. Nickel: Improves corrosion resistance and provides better toughness, formability, and ductility. It also stabilizes the passive oxide film and extends its resistance to more aggressive environments.   2. Molybdenum: Increases resistance to pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion, which are localized corrosive attacks that can occur in chloride-rich environments, such as seawater.   3. Titanium and niobium: These elements are often added to form stable carbides and prevent the formation of chromium carbides, which can lead to intergranular corrosion. By stabilizing the carbides, these elements maintain the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. 4. Copper: Enhances corrosion resistance, particularly against sulfuric and phosphoric acids, and imparts antibacterial properties to the alloy. 5. Nitrogen: Improves strength and corrosion resistance, and it is particularly beneficial in stabilizing austenitic stainless steels. To summarize, adding approximately 11% or more of chromium to steel is what creates stainless steel and imparts properties that prevent it from corroding, rusting, or staining when exposed to water. The chromium reacts with oxygen to form a self-healing, passive chromium oxide film on the surface of the material, providing an effective barrier against corrosive agents. Other alloying elements may be added to further enhance stainless steel's properties, making it a versatile and popular material for various applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Gridlock The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Fellow voyagers, it's a pleasure to join you on what's shaping up as an interesting day in local transportation. I've just come from the Metro rail station at Reagan National Airport, where the transit authority was displaying some new rail car interiors. One was a test car that has some bench seating along the sides. Metro wants to put that on the rails today or tomorrow and see how you react to it. Metro also had an example of the new interior design that will be entering service within a month. It's the one in which floor to ceiling poles have been removed in favor of seat to ceiling poles. The idea is to move us into the car, away from the congestion around the doors that riders find so annoying. I'll put something up on our Get There blog later today, describing this some more. Maybe I can show you a picture, too. Also today, at about the time we wrap up this discussion at 2 p.m., a panel of experts commissioned by the state of Virginia will be releasing its recommendations on whether the new rail line through Tyson's Corner should be above or below ground. We can talk about those topics, or anything else in transit and traffic that's on your mind today. I can tell you some of the things I've been up to during my first week as the new Dr. Gridlock. Let's start off with some of the questions and comments that were waiting for me when I came in. Washington, D.C.: Why Dr. Gridlock? Did you write a dissertation? Get an honorary degree? Until you earn it, I think you should go by Mr. Gridlock. Dr. Gridlock: I'm in the process of certifying myself. I've been making the rounds, trying to learn about what hurts, so I can make proper diagnoses. For example, I circumnavigated the outer loop of the Capital Beltway. I'm closing in on another goal of riding the entire Metro system. Still have legs of the Red, Yellow and Blue lines to complete. Been exploring Braddock Road, Fairfax Parkway, Route 7, the Ride On bus, the DC Circulator -- I know it's Cole's Notes, not \\"Grey's Anatomy.\\" I know you expect the doc to know our corner of the world on a micro level. Rockville, Md.: Congratulations (I think) for becoming the next Dr. Gridlock! Just an observation, but it seems like summer commuting is a good indication of what rush hour traffic would be like if more people telecommuted. Just taking off the vacationers from the roads during the summer seems to make a tough commute tolerable. Dr. Gridlock: One thing I'm very aware of as I go out on test drives across the region is that I'm not seeing experiencing the agonies that so many of you have reported for so long. We've had a lot of people respond to our Get There posting by offering to let us accompany them on their commutes. I expect to be doing that. For most of the past seven years, I've had a luxurious commute: Red Line from Silver Spring to Farragut North. I used to drive downtown, but it dawned on me that I was paying ten bucks a day to warehouse my car. When I started taking the Red Line, I figured I was saving about 750 a year. Must have been a lot more by the time I stopped doing that regularly. You've got big shoes to fill, but I am sure you are going to do great. Any word on when the Springfield Interchange will finally be completed? There were MAJOR backups this weekend coming from Washington, D.C. going south. Dr. Gridlock: Thank you, I do indeed feel like I have big shoes to fill, and I'm trying to get smart in a hurry. I've been The Post's editor for local transportation issues for most of the past seven years, so I've got a broad understanding of the region's traffic and transit issues. Now, I'm trying to learn this at the level you folks expect. Springfield Interchange is still on schedule for completion in late 2007. Our other big project, the Wilson Bridge, also is on schedule. Second span is to be completed in 2008. But those two big projects have providing some of the big action this summer, as they progress. There's a lot of work going on at Springfield that has a high impact on travelers. Wilson Bridge opened the first new span over the past two months. That was a big disruption on two weekends as the lanes were shifted to the new span, but I thought it was managed very well. Silver Spring, Md.: What is your view of the Purple Line's chances of becoming a reality (in our lifetime)? Dr. Gridlock: When I was The Post's transportation editor, I used to ask the reporters to write a series called \\"Not In My Lifetime,\\" describing all the road and rail projects that we've been teased about over the years. Currently, I'm wondering if the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles will fall into this category. Both projects have serious financing issues. Both have issues about whether to tunnel. There are questions about whether the federal government will provide essential funding. These are issues on want to stay on top of in the newspaper column and online. Severn, Md.: Dr. Dr. Give me the news, I've got a bad case of gridlock blues. Wondering if there has been any further news on the Metro expansion to BWI and all those stops along the way? Dr. Gridlock: I just expressed my concerns about the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles. That goes triple for Metro to BWI. It's another project that would require gobs of federal money. How could Maryland suck up that much more money from the feds after the inter county connector and the Purple Line? Clifton, Va.: What type of vehicle do you drive?? Other car and trucks in the family. I really think Dr. Gridlock should have a Ducati 999 in Ferrari Red.! Dr. Gridlock: My editor, Steven Ginsberg, says I need to buy a hybrid -- that Dr. Gridlock needs to make a statement. Others say a hybrid, with a GPS, and satellite radio. I drive a 1997 Toyota RAV4 SUV. I get the hand-me-downs in our family. My wife, who commutes from our inside the Beltway home in Montgomery County home to Baltimore, gets first crack at vehicles. When she builds up high mileage, she passes them down to me. Wheaton, Md.: I figure that the high heat that is predicted for the next few days will require the trains to slow down, due to the tracks' tendency to expand with heat. Dr. Gridlock: I see the heat advisories from VRE and MARC, when the temperature causes the freight lines that own some of the region's track to issue go-slow orders to the commuter lines. Seems like there have been an awful lot of them this summer. It must be hard to operate a commuter service when riders can't count on a schedule. I understand the safety issue involved: That high heat can kink rails and create dangerous situations. By the way, I'm an admirer of Train Talk, the alert system used by VRE to keep riders informed of such things. Washington, D.C.: I'm curious. I know you've subbed in from Mr. Ginsberg on his blog when he's away. Do you plan to have your own Dr. Gridlock blog or do you plan to share with him? Dr. Gridlock: Now that Steven has taken my old job as transportation editor, our plan is to share the Get There blog. Steven was on vacation last week. (He looks great. Tanned and rested for his new assignment.) ICC in my backyard: Speaking of the ICC - do you think it will be built? How do you feel about it since you live in Silver Spring? Dr. Gridlock: It's always been an interesting thing to me: The projects that soak up most of our transportation money don't necessarily have a widespread impact. For me personally, ICC is in that category. We live in Silver Spring. If we want to go over to Bethesda, we take either East-West Highway or the Beltway. If we're going to Baltimore, it's Route 29 or I-95, and maybe sometimes the BW Parkway. I don't expect I'll drive the ICC, though it will be just a few miles from where I live. Rockville, Md: Got to go .Will I be able to see responses later, and where? Dr. Gridlock: We'll have a transcript posted. That's true of all our Live Onlines. Inside the beltway: Are you going to do more columns on bike and walking commutes. We have issues too, you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield. Dr. Gridlock: We get many such comments and indeed will be certain to pay attention to issues concerning biking and walking. Washington, D.C.: Why was the new Wilson Bridge span designed with the same number of lanes as the old Wilson Bridge span? Size matters. What's up with that? Dr. Gridlock: What you're seeing now is only half the action. The first of the two new spans is open. That allows the project workers to tear down the old bridge to clear room to complete the second new span. Once that opens in 2008, there will be more lanes on the bridge than on the Beltway approaches to it. That's when you should really see some relief. For now, the advantage is that at least the new span has shoulders for disabled vehicles. Re: Summer Commutes: I'm sorry to say I haven't experienced much relief in my evening commute home to Rockville from Tyson's this summer. At best, the relief is sporadic. Last summer (when I started this commute), I remember lighter traffic more days than not. Is anyone else noticing this? Dr. Gridlock: I'm curious about that, too. I think summer traffic is generally down, but there are exceptions. Bethesda, Md.: I read about how starting this fall all the trains on the Red Line will go to the end of the line during the weekend and non-peak hours. How about peak hours? It would be great if all the trains went to Shady Grove. Dr. Gridlock: I believe that's the only change that's scheduled: That starting in October, trains will no longer turn back at Grosvenor during non-peak hours and on weekends. Maryland had to pay for the additional service. The rationale I've heard for the improvement on the west side of the Red Line, as opposed to the east side where trains turn back at Silver Spring, is the extra development to the west that's increasing rider ship on the Shady Grove side. \\"We have issues too, you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield.\\": Can I ask that the analysis of the issue present the problem from both sides? LOTS of pedestrians downtown think that the \\"Don't Walk\\" signs don't apply to them. They walk when it starts flashing and become livid if drivers don't yield--well, if it says \\"Don't Walk,\\" the driver isn't supposed to have to yield (the pedestrian is!) None of us will ever get anywhere if BOTH sides don't cooperate. Look at New Yorkers--they jaywalk like crazy, but no New Yorker is stupid enough to try to hold up oncoming cars (especially not taxis). D.C. pedestrians need the same common sense! Dr. Gridlock: What do folks think of those \\"walk-don't walk\\" signs with the countdown timers? Are they helpful to pedestrians? Once in a while, I encounter one that seems to skip about 10 seconds. That makes it extra interesting. Re: Summer Commutes: I drive from Tyson's to Silver Spring and it is just as bad during the summer as during the other parts of the year. But, what can you do? Congrats on the new position and thanks for taking the time to get to know us! Dr. Gridlock: Thank you. That's just a killer stretch. So unpredictable, too. One thing I'd like to hear about from folks is how they get their traffic information. When I visit our Fairfax Bureau, where transportation researcher Diane Mattingly is based, I look at the online traffic cameras before I leave home and before I leave the bureau -- not that there are all that many alternatives anyway. Washington D.C.: I read that you rode the Circulator bus last week. I love the service, but I have two questions. First, the obvious, are they planning any more routes? Second, do they have any plans to better advertise and encourage riders to purchase tickets before boarding and then to enter by any door? It seems as though no one knows they can do this! I only know that you can by going to their Web site. It is a great system similar to London's bendy-buses, and it really speeds things up if the bus doesn't have to wait for a long queue to put their exact change into the fare box. I also wish they would put a SmartTrip scanner near the rear door so that those users can bypass the front and enter the rear. Thanks. Dr. Gridlock: No definite plans at the moment for more routes or more hours. I think it's a great service and would like to encourage more people to use it. You'll probably see more about it on the Get There blog, and I might write about it for the Sunday Gridlock column. Good as I think the Circulator is at making things clear and simple, they could still do more. I like your suggestion about the SmartTrip cards at the other doors, but bet that's an expensive addition. The service is pretty heavily subsidized already. One thing I noticed is that if you don't know where you're going -- if you're a tourist, or taking a trip you don't usually take -- it's a bit hard to figure out your best stop from inside the bus. Arlington, Va.: Can you please explain why anyone continues to drive inside the Beltway? I'm from the Midwest, where I've been driving since the age of 15, and since moving to the area I love the freedom of public transportation. With the D.C. Metro trip planner web site you can easily get anywhere in the Beltway. My friends tease me for this fondness of buses and metro, but I catch up on my reading, rest, and even nap while they sit in traffic polluting our environment. On top of that, I've met many interesting people and learned a lot about the region in just a few years here. Dr. Gridlock: I'm a big fan of transit, but I do drive. For example, if my wife and I want to go to dinner in Bethesda some night, we're not going to take the Red Line V into downtown Washington and then back up to Bethesda. The bus connections would be problematic. Purple Line would make a difference. Bethesda, Md.: I think it would be good for you to let readers know your positions on some of our regional transportation issues such as the Tyson's to Dulles Rail Project, the Bethesda to New Carrollton \\"Purple Line,\\" adding HOT lanes to the VA Beltway, the ICC, etc. Dr. Gridlock: I'll be telling you what I think on these topics and many others. Stick with me. Check the Get There blog. I'll put something up there today about the new rail car designs, for example. We have Dr. Gridlock on page 2 of the Sunday Metro section, and hope to restart the Dr. Gridlock columns in The Post's Extra sections in late August. I-270, Exit 1: Good afternoon and congratulations on becoming Dr. Gridlock. I imagine it's like being the next Dr. Who, you travel around and try to solve problems. My question is about the column/chat itself. How does one measure the success of this enterprise? Has Dr. Gridlock ever remedied a traffic problem with local governments, or is success more a measure of the number of readers who informally exchange alternate routes, but mainly vent about bad traffic management and driving practices? Thank you and best wishes. Dr. Gridlock: This is a really good question. Ron Shaffer got some things changes. I hope I can help, too. Getting some wrongs righted would be tremendously satisfying. Sometimes, though, you readers of the columns and the blogs and the Live Onlines help each other. I've seen you do that over the years through Dr. Gridlock. Dr. Gridlock: Folks, despite having many, many more questions and comments to go, I think I'd better sign off for today. I want to get up a blog item about those new Metro rail cars and maybe post a picture of the interior. Thanks for making this first foray such a welcoming experience. For all those readers whose notes I didn't get a chance to respond to today, please be aware that I'm reading them all and will take the advice seriously and try to find answers to the questions, so that I can respond in future discussions and columns.

Commercialisation – Société Iogen En avril 2004, la société Iogen a amorcé les opérations d’une usine de démonstration d’avantcommercialisation entièrement intégrée. Translate this to English?","output":"Commercialization - Iogen Corporation In April 2004, the Iogen Corporation began operations at a fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant. The Iogen Corporation, a bio-energy company, took a major step in its journey towards commercialization in April 2004 with the launch of a fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant. This new facility served as a platform to showcase the company's innovative technologies and processes, as well as their potential to revolutionize the bioenergy industry. The demonstration plant played a key role in validating the technical and economic viability of the Iogen's production processes, allowing for potential investors, partners and clients to become more familiar with the benefits of the company's offerings. By providing a tangible, working example of the technology, the plant aimed to build trust and confidence in the company's ability to deliver on its promises and effectively scale up the processes for commercial purposes. One of the main focuses of the Iogen Corporation is the production of cellulosic ethanol, an alternative fuel produced from biomass rather than conventional food crops such as corn or sugar cane. This innovative approach offers a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels. In order to produce cellulosic ethanol, Iogen has developed advanced processes for breaking down the complex structure of plant cellulose, which is then converted into sugars suitable for fermentation into ethanol.  At the pre-commercialization demonstration plant, these processes and technologies were tested and optimized, refining the production methods and improving efficiency, while also allowing for the assessment of any potential challenges and risks associated with scaling up the operations. The success of the demonstration plant was pivotal to the Iogen Corporation's efforts to advance the commercialization of its technology. Following the successful operations of the plant in 2004, the company was able to secure further funding and partnerships, which enabled continuous improvement of its technology and processes, and ultimately contributed to the development of a full-scale commercial production facility. In conclusion, the establishment of the fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant in April 2004 marked a significant milestone for the Iogen Corporation, showcasing its innovative bioenergy solutions and boosting confidence in its ability to deliver on a commercial scale. By providing a practical example of the company's technologies in action, the plant allowed for the testing and optimization of the production processes, while also securing the necessary funding and partnerships needed for the continued growth and development of the company's groundbreaking solutions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Don't Look in the Basement Movie plot: The film is set in Stephens Sanitarium, a secluded rural mental health institute whose chief doctor believes that the best way to deal with insanity is to allow the patients to freely act out their realities in the hopes that they will snap out of it, so to speak. The film begins with an elderly nurse in Stephens Sanitorium making her rounds. After a troubling incident in which a patient threatens her life, she decides to retire, and goes out to visit the chief doctor, Dr. Stephens, to inform him of the decision. Unfortunately, in the process of therapy (which involves chopping wood with an axe), the crazed former magistrate known as Judge (Gene Ross) accidentally lands the axe in Dr. Stephens' back, apparently killing him. The shaken nurse returns inside to finish packing, where she is attacked by Harriet (Camilla Carr), a patient who accuses her of stealing her \\"baby\\" (actually a plastic doll). The patient kills her by crushing her head in the nurse's suitcase. The only remaining doctor appears to be Dr. Geraldine Masters (Anne MacAdams), who is greeted by Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), a pretty young nurse who informs Dr. Masters that Dr. Stephens had hired her a week ago. Dr. Masters begrudgingly allows her to settle in. The young nurse meets the patients, including a lobotomized and childish man named Sam (Bill McGhee) who enjoys popsicles and his plastic toy boat, a nymphomaniac and schizophrenic named Allyson (Betty Chandler), an emotionally dependent woman named Jennifer (Harryette Warren), an octogenarian woman named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) who spouts bizarre poetry and mistakes flowers in the garden to be her own children, a juvenile prankster named Danny (Jessie Kirby), a shellshocked Sergeant (Hugh Feagin) who lost his mind after accidentally killing his men in Vietnam, and the crazed judge who seems incapable of speaking in anything other than courtroom jargon and the repeated phrase \\"My name... is... Oliver... W... Cameron...\\" Dr. Masters becomes disturbed when a telephone man comes to... My question: What kind of institute is Stephens Sanitarium? A:","output":"Stephens Sanitarium is a secluded rural mental health institute. The chief doctor at this institute believes in an unconventional approach to treating insanity, which involves allowing the patients to freely act out their realities in hopes that they will eventually snap out of it. The institute houses various patients with different mental health issues, and the environment within the facility appears to be quite unstructured and chaotic. It seems that traditional medical and psychiatric treatments might not be the primary focus at Stephens Sanitarium, with the emphasis placed more on letting the patients express themselves without restrictions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No. 14 seed UAB takes out No. 3 Iowa State in tourney's first upset Updated MAR 19, 2015 6:45p ET LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The UAB Blazers may not have a football program anymore. They do have the first big upset of the NCAA tournament and hope they can give their university something to rally around. William Lee scored the last four points for 14th-seeded UAB, and the Blazers knocked off third-seeded Iowa State 60-59 on Thursday in their opening game in the NCAA tournament. It's the third straight year a 14 seed has upset a No. 3 seed, and Georgia State followed up by joining the list within an hour with a 57-56 win over Baylor. The Blazers (20-15) came in with the third-youngest team in the NCAA tournament and with nobody having played in this tournament before. They wound up winning the program's first NCAA game since 2005 and ran over to celebrate in front of the fans of a school that shut its football program down in December. \\"For us, it was just huge,\\" UAB junior Robert Brown said. \\"We come here, not just to play games, but to actually make some noise and to win some games. To be able to do that and win for Birmingham, win for Coach (Jerod) Haase, it's a great feeling.\\" And it set off a wild celebration in the Blazers' locker room. \\"We were celebrating because that was a really big win for us with us being the underdogs,\\" UAB guard Tyler Madison said. Haase estimated maybe four or five of the Blazers didn't even realize a month ago that the Conference USA tournament champion earned an automatic berth, while another had never watched a selection show before Sunday. \\"You're a product of your thoughts,\\" Haase said. \\"There's been more talk right now about 14 seed or upsets than we've said the entire year. Our thoughts have been, when we play well, we think we can compete with anybody, and those thoughts have been expressed to our team, and our team has made the choice to believe in that. I think that's what you saw today.\\" The ninth-ranked Cyclones (25-9) came into the South Regional looking for a much longer run than a year ago when they reached the Sweet 16 without top scorer Georges Niang due to injury. But they just couldn't match the scrappy Blazers on the boards in a second half where the Cyclones couldn't hold onto a 55-51 lead with 3:13 left. For Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg, it's as tough a loss as he's had. His Cyclones came in having won five straight, rallying from double-digit deficits in each on their way to the Big 12 tournament title. Hoiberg called that an emotional three days in Kansas City followed by playing the first game Thursday. \\"I'm not going to make any excuses,\\" Hoiberg said. \\"You've got to come out and play 40 minutes. ... I don't know. Maybe we should have let them get up double digits. That's kind of how we play our best.\\" The Blazers, who outscored Iowa State 9-4 down the stretch, will play 11th-seeded UCLA, a 60-59 winner over sixth-seeded SMU, on Saturday. Iowa State, which lost its opener as a No. 2 seed in 2001, last led at 57-56 on a basket by Monte Morris. But Lee hit a jumper with 24 seconds left putting UAB ahead to stay. Niang had a jumper blocked by Tosin Mehinti, and Lee got the rebound. Lee hit two free throws with 12.1 seconds left for the Blazers' final points. Naz Long missed a 3 that Morris tipped in with 0.4 seconds left, and the Cyclones couldn't get the ball back before the Blazers started celebrating their gutty win. \\"We got lackadaisical,\\" Long said. \\"We have no one to blame but ourselves. This one burns, man. It burns.\\" Brown led UAB with 21 points, Lee finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds. Madison also had 11 rebounds as the Blazers dominated the boards 52-37. Morris finished with 15 points for the Cyclones, who were making a school-record fourth straight tournament appearance only to lose their opener for the first time since 2001. Niang and reserve Matt Thomas both added 11 points, and Jameel McKay had 10 points and 12 rebounds. Iowa State looked ready to finally put away an opponent as the Cyclones opened the game with a 12-2 lead. The Blazers settled down quickly enough and used a 14-4 run to turn it into a game taking advantage of repeated turnovers by the Cyclones. The Blazers took a 31-28 halftime lead before a 6:52 scoring drought. Not that it hurt as the teams wound up swapping the lead a total of 17 times with eight ties. STREAK CONTINUED: UAB's win as a No. 14 seed follows up what Mercer did to Duke last year in the tournament. In 2013, it was Harvard upsetting New Mexico. So now Iowa State joins the list. Notre Dame coach Mike Brey, whose team was also a 3 seed, saw UAB's upset and said of Iowa State: \\"They took the bullet, not us.\\" UAB: Blazers' fans didn't miss an opportunity to chant \\"Fire Ray Watts\\" during timeouts in their protest against the university president who shut down the school's football program in December. ... The Blazers had a 19-9 edge on the offensive glass. ... Haase won his debut as a head coach, though he appeared in 17 other tournaments as a player or assistant. Iowa State: Thomas hadn't scored in double figures since late February, a span of six straight games. ... The Cyclones, who came in with the third-most wins in school history, lost as a No. 2 seed to 15th-seeded Hampton in 2001. ... Niang broke a bone in his right foot in their first NCAA game last year with the Cyclones losing in the Sweet 16 to eventual champ Connecticut.

In a surprising turn of events, UAB won the game 60-59, making it the first big upset of the tournament. UAB's victory was particularly meaningful for the team and its fans due to the controversial decision to shut down the school's football program in December 2014. The Blazers' win was fueled by strong performances from players William Lee, Robert Brown, and Tyler Madison, while Iowa State struggled to maintain their early lead and secure rebounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. Question: The author probably believes that === The answer to the above question is Available options: (1).

Adam chose to purchase a wig instead of receiving a haircut because the  Available choices:  (A). wig was cheaper..  (B). haircut was cheaper..","output":"Adam chose to purchase a wig instead of receiving a haircut because the wig was cheaper. This decision was influenced by several factors that Adam took into consideration before making his choice. First and foremost, the cost difference between the wig and the haircut played a significant role in this decision. Adam found a high-quality, stylish wig at a discounted price, making it an attractive and affordable option. On the other hand, the haircut he was interested in required the expertise of a skilled hairstylist, which would have been significantly more expensive. By opting for the wig, Adam was able to save a considerable amount of money that he could utilize in other aspects of his life or personal grooming. Secondly, the wig allowed Adam the flexibility to switch up his look with ease and without too much commitment. With a haircut, he would have been limited to one particular style for several weeks or even months until his hair grew back. The wig, however, provided him with the option to alternate his appearance whenever he wanted, offering more versatility and ensuring that he would never grow bored with his style. Additionally, if Adam were to attend a special event or have an important meeting where he wanted to present a more polished appearance, he could easily do so by simply switching to a different wig. Moreover, wigs generally require less maintenance than natural hair. With a wig, Adam wouldn't have to worry about regular visits to the hairstylist to maintain the shape and style or investing in expensive hair care products. This would save him not only money but also valuable time – something that many people often overlook when making such decisions. Furthermore, choosing a wig also meant that Adam could avoid potential damage to his natural hair that could be caused by frequent salon visits, chemical treatments, and styling tools. Hair damage is a common concern for many individuals, and investing in a wig provided him with a worry-free solution, reducing the risk of potential hair issues such as breakage and split ends. In conclusion, Adam's choice to purchase a wig instead of receiving a haircut was driven by the numerous benefits offered by this alternative option. The wig was not only cheaper but also granted him the freedom to experiment with different looks, lower maintenance requirements, and the added advantage of minimizing damage to his natural hair. Considering all these factors, Adam's decision to go with the wig rather than the more expensive haircut proved to be a smarter, more practical choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formed in 1993, Boyzone was a widely popular group during the 1990s and early 2000s. The original line-up of the band consisted of five members: Ronan Keating, Mikey Graham, Shane Lynch, Keith Duffy, and Stephen Gately himself. Managed by Louis Walsh, who is also known for managing another Irish boyband, Westlife, Boyzone found considerable success in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and across Europe. Their music typically belonged to the pop and ballad genres and earned them numerous chart-topping hits and accolades. Throughout their career, Boyzone released several albums, including their debut album \\"Said and Done\\" (1995), \\"A Different Beat\\" (1996), \\"Where We Belong\\" (1998), \\"Brother\\" (2010), and \\"BZ20\\" (2013).

Write an article with the title: \\"‘The Bachelor’ for porn stars, and other reality shows that failed to make it on TV\\"","output":"Title: 'The Bachelor' for Porn Stars, and Other Reality Shows That Failed to Make It on TV Introduction Some mainstream reality shows have managed to capture the imagination of a diverse audience, keeping them entertained for years. However, for every successful reality show, there are numerous others that never quite made it on TV, with some of them even crossing the boundary of bad taste. One such example, 'The Bachelor' for porn stars, promises thrills and escapades from the world of adult entertainment, but the concept was too risqué for network television. In this article, we will take a closer look at this controversial idea and other reality show concepts that never found a secure spot on the small screen. 'The Bachelor' for Porn Stars The proposed \\"adult\\" version of the popular dating show, 'The Bachelor,' would have seen porn stars vying for the affections of a single, eligible bachelor. Contestants would engage in various challenges designed to showcase their charm, wit, and sexual prowess. While there might have been a market for this provocative reality show, it may have led to protests and censorship based on its adult content, which would have harmed the ratings and advertising revenues of traditional broadcasters. Thus, this titillating concept never saw the light of day. Other Reality Shows That Failed to Make It on TV 1. 'Celebrity Boxing' In the early 2000s, FOX attempted to cash in on the popularity of celebrity-based reality shows by pitting D-list stars against one another in boxing matches. Every episode would be filled with rival celebrities putting on the gloves and going head-to-head in a boxing ring. While a few episodes were aired, it was a unanimous flop with both critics and audiences. 2. 'Who's Your Daddy?' Controversial from the get-go, this reality show had a controversial premise: an adopted adult would choose from a group of men whom they believed was their biological father. If the adult guessed correctly, they would win a cash prize. But if the contestant was wrong, the faux father would walk away with the money. FOX received significant backlash after airing the pilot episode in 2005, critics labeling the show tasteless and exploitative. The network quickly canceled the show. 3. 'The Will' This show took advantage of family tensions in the most distressing way, with family members battling one another in various challenges to win a share of a deceased relative's inheritance. The concept was not well received, and CBS axed the show after only one episode. 4. 'All My Babies' Mamas' Oxygen Network’s proposed reality series 'All My Babies' Mamas' featured rapper Shawty Lo, his 11 children, and their ten mothers, exploring the unique world the rapper had created for his family. Critics saw the show as perpetuating stereotypes and glorifying irresponsibility, and the network decided to scrap the project before any episodes were broadcast. 5. 'Bridalplasty' E! Network's reality show 'Bridalplasty' had brides-to-be competing for plastic surgery and a dream wedding based on their narcissistic desires. It was met with public outrage, with viewers questioning the show's morality and insensitivity towards the institution of marriage. The show was canceled after only one season. Conclusion Although reality television thrives on capturing the most intriguing and unpredictable human elements, it is crucial for creators and networks to respect certain boundaries that exist for a good reason. As the failures of shows like 'The Bachelor' for porn stars and others on this list demonstrate, pushing the envelope too far can infringe upon moral sensibilities and generate controversy, rather than capture an audience's interest. Moving forward, reality show creators must strike a delicate balance between creating unique, engaging television programs while maintaining a sense of responsibility for the impact they have on society."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

France striker Henry denied cheating to win the free - kick which led to his side's second goal in their 3 - 1 victory over Spain. Many footballers, however, are often putting it on. Whatever the nationality there's one common ploy: the player rolls over holding their leg, ankle or head seeming to be in great pain.

Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. The answer is:","output":"Alexander"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the purpose of breathing? All the cells of your body need oxygen to work properly. Your bodys circulatory system works with the respiratory system to deliver the oxygen. Your blood carries red blood cells. The main job of red blood cells is to carry oxygen throughout your body. The red blood cells get oxygen in the lungs. The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. The respiratory system is the body system that takes in oxygen. It then releases carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is the waste material from the cells.  After reading the above, is \\"Respiratory and circulatory\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What body systems work together to bring in oxygen and release carbon dioxide?\\"? Pick from: [I] no; [II] yes;","output":"[II] yes; The respiratory and circulatory systems indeed work together to bring in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The respiratory system is responsible for taking in oxygen through the process of inhalation and releasing carbon dioxide through exhalation. This oxygen is then transported throughout the body via the circulatory system, specifically through red blood cells. The circulatory system delivers oxygen to cells and tissues and removes waste materials, such as carbon dioxide, from these areas.

Step 1: Simplify the constant terms: -563 - 526 = -1089 Now, our equation becomes: -99*a -1089 = 0 Step 2: To isolate the variable 'a', we need to add 1089 to both sides of the equation: -99*a - 1089 + 1089 = 0 + 1089 -99*a = 1089 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -99 to solve for 'a': a = 1089 / -99 Step 4: Calculate the value of 'a' by dividing 1089 by -99: a = -11 So, the solution to the equation -99*a - 563 - 526 = 0 is a = -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the child that the man who used LSD gave up custody of? is inside the article: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She..., can you guess it ? The answer is:","output":"Julian. Based on the information provided in the article, the man who used LSD is John Lennon, and the child he gave up custody of is his son Julian.

At the police station, his partner continues to kid on about the whole situation, trying to get him to forget about the shooting and the female. Still oddly drawn to her, Spivey excuses himself from his partner. That night at home, his wife Ruby (Brenda James) attempts to console him after learning of the shooting. As they begin to make love, he keeps picturing the woman and begins to anally rape his wife. She eventually forces him off her as he has lost himself in his fantasy of the woman.

Given the context: How would you describe Alex? pick from the following. (I). good at selling candies. (II). a person who likes to eat candies. (III). a person who got an assignment from their charity. Answer:","output":"Alex can be primarily described as a person who got an assignment from their charity (III).  In this scenario, Alex sold candy to a friend with the purpose of collecting money for their charity. This implies that Alex is actively participating in a charitable cause and is likely assigned or entrusted with the responsibility of raising funds through candy sales. The act of selling candy for a charitable purpose not only demonstrates Alex's commitment to the cause, but also their ability to execute the given responsibility. Though it could be argued that they might be good at selling candies (I), the main focus in this context is the charitable aspect and supporting their organization. It's important to note that there is no information provided about Alex's personal preferences for candies. Thus, describing them as a person who likes to eat candies (II) is not relevant or supported by the given information.

Last Saturday, my family and I decided to try out the much-talked-about Trattoria Bella that recently opened its doors in our town. I must say, the experience was nothing short of spectacular, and we left the restaurant with full stomachs and content hearts. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the warm and inviting ambiance of the establishment. The dimly lit interior, rustic wooden furniture, and the authentic Italian music playing in the background had already won us over even before we were seated. Our server, Giuseppe, was an absolute delight from the moment we sat down. He was knowledgeable about the menu, offered thoughtful recommendations and wine pairings, and catered to our dietary restrictions with ease. His friendly demeanor and attentive service truly enhanced our overall dining experience. As for the food, every dish was a scrumptious masterpiece. The antipasto platter, featuring an assortment of cured meats, cheeses, and olives, was a perfect start to our Italian culinary journey. The presentation was impeccable, and the flavors were rich and authentic. For our main courses, we decided on the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, Gnocchi al Pesto, and Branzino al Limone. Each dish was cooked to perfection. The Tagliatelle was tender and beautifully coated in a rich, meaty sauce. The Gnocchi was pillow-soft, and the homemade pesto was aromatic and packed with flavor. The Branzino was moist and flaky with a delicate lemon-butter sauce that accentuated the fish's natural flavors. The wine list, curated by an expert sommelier, featured a fine selection of both Italian and international wines that catered to different tastes and budgets. We opted for a bottle of the recommended Barbera d'Asti, which greatly complemented our meal. To finish off our evening, we shared a heavenly Tiramisu. The dessert was an exquisite balance of silky mascarpone cream, espresso-soaked ladyfingers, and a dusting of cocoa powder. We couldn't have asked for a better way to end our meal. In conclusion, Trattoria Bella offers a superior Italian dining experience that is not to be missed! The charming atmosphere, exemplary service, and delectable dishes guarantee nothing short of a fantastic evening. It's a welcomed gem in our town that I believe will thrive for years to come. We'll be back to explore the rest of their menu very soon, and I highly recommend this delightful establishment to anyone seeking an unforgettable Italian feast."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The British Agricultural Revolution, or Second Agricultural Revolution, was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million. The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: what relationship was there between improvements in agriculture and the industrialisation of britain?","output":"The relationship between improvements in agriculture and the industrialization of Britain was significant and closely intertwined. The British Agricultural Revolution, marked by an unprecedented increase in agricultural production, contributed to several key factors that spurred the Industrial Revolution. First, the rise in agricultural productivity led to a faster growth in food supply compared to the population from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries. This allowed the population to grow rapidly, with the numbers increasing from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801. The larger population provided a crucial labor force for the emerging industrial sector. Second, the efficiency brought about by the Agricultural Revolution led to the decline of agricultural share in the labor force. As productivity increased and fewer people were needed to work in agriculture, many workers from rural areas migrated to urban areas, becoming part of the growing urban workforce. This shift in labor from agricultural to industrial sectors was essential to support the increasing scale and complexities of industrialization. It is essential to note that while domestic agricultural production supported the population in the earlier stages of the revolution, food imports started to take a larger share in the 19th century as the population continued to grow rapidly, reaching over 32 million. Furthermore, the improvements in agriculture not only added to the urban workforce but also influenced the development of other sectors like transportation and trade. In conclusion, the relationship between improvements in agriculture and the industrialization of Britain is marked by the growth in the food supply and the shift in labor force from the agricultural sector to the urban workforce. The Agricultural Revolution played a significant role in setting the stage for the Industrial Revolution, demonstrating how these two transformative periods in history were profoundly interconnected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: make a box of jello","output":"Making a box of Jello is quite simple and only requires a few steps. Here's a detailed guide to ensure that you'll make a perfect and delicious Jello: Ingredients: 1. A box of Jello of your preferred flavor. Jello is available in a wide range of flavors, such as strawberry, lime or orange. 2. Water. You'll need equal parts of boiling and cold water. Utensils: 1. A kettle or a saucepan to boil the water. 2. A big bowl where you'll be making your Jello. 3. A whisk or a big spoon. 4. A refrigerator. Here are the steps: 1. First of all, you'll need to boil water. The amount required is usually printed on the back of the box. If you're using a standard, small box of Jello (85g), you'll need one cup of boiling water. If you're using a large-sized box (170g), you'll need two cups. 2. While your water is boiling, open your box of Jello and pour its contents into a large bowl. 3. Once your water has boiled, carefully pour it into the bowl, on top of the Jello powder.  4. Use your whisk or spoon to stir the mixture. Make sure to stir until the powder completely dissolves. This usually takes around 2 minutes. 5. After your Jello has dissolved in boiling water, you'll need to add cold water. The amount of cold water should be equal to the amount of boiling water you've added. So if you've used one cup of boiling water, now add one cup of cold water. For two cups of boiling water, add two cups of cold water. 6. Stir again to mix the hot and cold water together. 7. Now that your Jello mix is ready, it's time to let it set. Jello needs to be chilled in a refrigerator in order to turn from a liquid to a gel.  8. Place your bowl in the refrigerator. Make sure to keep it level to prevent any spills. 9. Allow your Jello to set for at least 4 hours. Remember, the longer you let it set, the firmer it'll be. It's often best to make your Jello a day ahead of when you plan to eat it.  10. After your Jello has set, you can serve it. To make it more appealing, you can cut it into cubes, or use cookie cutters to create fun shapes. If you're serving it for dessert, you can add whipped cream on top, or pair it with fruits. And that's it! You've made a box of Jello. It's a fun, easy, and versatile dessert that's always a hit, especially with kids. Happy cooking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As they raised a hand to effortlessly wipe away a stray droplet that dared to escape its confines, the cool metal shaker glistening with condensation, the bartender couldn't help but smile at the anticipation etched on the faces around the bar. They knew that a well-crafted cocktail could transport the drinker to another world – a world where the stresses and strains of daily life eventually faded away. As the bartender's hand deftly grasped a freshly-plucked mint sprig, they expertly slapped it between their palms to release the fragrant oils. As the invigorating scent wafted through the atmosphere, mingling with the scent of sweet fruitiness that already permeated the air, anticipation for the cocktail's completion continued to build. Placing the mint sprig delicately atop the drink, the bartender's focus shifted to selecting the perfect straw to match the concoction. The choice was crucial; this seemingly innocuous detail often went unnoticed by the uninformed person, but the bartender knew just how much impact a straw's color, length, and design could have on the overall drinking experience. After a moment's consideration, their fingers selected a bright orange bendy straw, a playful choice that perfectly balanced the sophisticated presentation with a whimsical twist. With a soft \\"pop,\\" the straw disappeared beneath the drink's enticing waves, making its journey to the glass's bottom as if seeking out the most delicate notes hidden within the depths. As the final cherry atop the masterpiece, the bartender confidently sprinkled a dash of superfine sugar around the rim of the glass.

The final product stood before them, a harmonious blend of vibrant color, complex taste, and eye-catching presentation. The bartender slid the craft cocktail across the bar's smooth surface, their keen eyes catching the flicker of excitement in their patron's widened eyes. The pulse of the bar seemed to collectively quicken in that brief moment before the drink met the parched lips of its eager recipient, the first sip permanently cementing the memory of this artfully crafted cocktail. As the patron indulged, the bartender moved on to the next order, their focus sharp and assured, even as they began to mix and blend a new symphony of flavors for the next awaiting customer. The bar came alive with a cacophony of sounds: the laughter of delighted patrons, the clinking of ice in glasses, the pouring of premium spirits and the hum of animated conversations. And at the center of it all was the bartender – a master of their craft – blending their love of flavor and art into each meticulously crafted beverage. It mattered not if they were fulfilling a standard request or a completely unique concoction, as the true satisfaction came from creating a moment that would be forever etched in the taste buds and memories of their patrons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (\\"British Peace\\"), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the \\"workshop of the world\\". The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.  Who has less abnormal cells in their body?  Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Jason, who has cancer, has more abnormal cells in his body due to the uncontrolled cell division caused by mutations in the genes that control the cell cycle. Charlotte, with her high blood pressure, does not have a condition that is explicitly caused by abnormal cell division, suggesting that she has fewer abnormal cells in her body compared to Jason."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, add 24*z to both sides of the equation, as shown below: -25*z + 24*z = -24*z + 24*z + 1 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms: -1*z = 1 In this form, we see that -1 times z is equal to 1. Step 3: Now, we need to isolate z by dividing both sides of the equation by -1. -1*z / -1 = 1 / -1 Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation: z = -1 So, the solution to the equation -25*z = -24*z + 1 is z = -1."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit  of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve. Question: The new policy was issued in order to  _  . Answer: Answer:","output":"The new policy was issued in order to protect Venice's environment and historical landmarks from the negative impacts of mass tourism and potential environmental disasters associated with large cruise ships. By forbidding the transit of cruise ships through the Giudecca Canal, the city aims to direct the ship traffic further away from the shoreline and preserve its heritage. Additionally, the policy includes limiting the size of ships allowed to visit and reducing the number of daily ship visits to the city. This approach demonstrates the city's commitment to balancing the need for tourism revenue with the preservation of its unique environment and cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Philip Lussier and his family are hoping to find out the cause of a disease that has caused nerve and muscular skeletal problems. Philip hits a chip shot in front of his parents Betsy and Phil Lussier and his siblings, Amy and Mark, in their backyard.      In medicine, it’s called the diagnostic odyssey: the difficult months and years that patients and families spend trying to figure out the cause of a baffling collection of symptoms.      The National Institutes of Health announced Tuesday it will expand its efforts to solve such medical mysteries by creating a network of six centers, including one in Boston, that will each receive 7.2 million over the next four years.      Advertisement      The new Harvard Center for Integrated Approaches to Undiagnosed Diseases will combine the resources of Brigham and Women’s, Massachusetts General, and Boston Children’s hospitals. A coordinating center at Harvard Medical School will help route patients to centers across the country and facilitate the sharing of data among the programs.      The project leaders hope to identify rare diseases that are currently unknown and develop treatments -- and gain insights that might apply to illnesses affecting many more people.

Sign up for more newsletters here      “We should be able to generalize what we learn from this to more common diseases in this era of the hope for increasingly personalized and precision medicine,” said Dr. Joseph Loscalzo, chief of medicine at the Brigham.      The network is an expansion of a pilot Undiagnosed Diseases Program the NIH launched in 2008 at its Bethesda, Md., campus. Over the past six years, the NIH has been able to study only about 600 of the more than 3,000 children and adults who applied to the program.      The Boston center will use techniques that include DNA sequencing and analysis of the microbes present on patients’ skin or in their digestive tracts to discern the root of illnesses of a dozen patients in its first year. The hope is that newer technology, including the ability to search for networks of genes working in concert to cause disease, will improve the odds of finding the cause of a rare disease, which are currently around 25 percent.      Advertisement      The effort to understand rare, mysterious diseases is nothing new in Boston, where researchers have identified the causes of inherited hearing loss, muscle-weakening disease, and seizures. But Loscalzo said the new center will consolidate those kinds of efforts across institutions and help formalize the process for using cutting-edge technologies to understand patients’ illnesses. The coordination with other centers across the country could help doctors see patterns that would be hard to detect in a single ill patient and strengthen their confidence that a specific gene mutation is connected to a condition.      The other centers will be located at Baylor College of Medicine, Duke University, Stanford University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.      Undiagnosed diseases can take a huge financial and psychological toll on families. Patients often visit many clinics in search of a diagnosis, and having one can be important not only for finding the best treatment, but also for peace of mind and genetic counseling of other family members.      “We should not underestimate the value of carrying a diagnosis, because individuals who lack a diagnosis are actually a little suspect in terms of their complaints -- not being trusted by family, friends, employers, and even their doctors,” said Dr. William Gahl, clinical director of the NIH-based Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “If we can take away that element of desperation and have some diagnosis for them even though it’s a bad diagnosis, they’re incredibly grateful and it changes their lives and the lives of their families.”      One of the families waiting on a diagnosis are the Lussiers of Milton. From the day Philip was born more than 30 years ago, Betsy and Phil Lussier helplessly watched him struggle with a condition no one could comprehend. Philip was born small and failed to grow -- when he turned one, he still weighed just nine pounds.      He developed unexplained gastrointestinal problems, musculo-skeletal issues, and pain, and the Lussiers went to many genetics specialists in the search for a clue about what they were dealing with.      As Philip underwent surgeries, went on morphine, and received an evolving series of possible diagnoses that all turned out to be wrong, the uncertainty about what to expect was tremendously difficult. At one point, Betsy joined a support group for parents of children with muscular dystrophy, because it was one of the diagnoses Philip received. Despite the fact that it turned out to be the wrong diagnosis, she stayed in the group for 15 years.      “Living like that, not knowing tomorrow or where we were going down the road, it was so much harder than if we had some idea of what we’re dealing with,” Betsy Lussier said.      As time went on, things gradually got easier -- Philip is happier today and in less pain. In April, they celebrated his 30th birthday, a day the Lussiers never expected to be able to share with their son. He lives independently with the help of an aide, attends a day program, and comes home to Milton to spend the weekends, amusing his family with his sense of humor and a love of US history and sports.      In 2012, the Lussiers made a trip to the undiagnosed diseases program at the NIH to see if the latest genomic analysis could finally reveal what caused Philip’s condition. They aren’t holding their breath for a miracle treatment; instead, the information might help his younger siblings when they think about starting their own families.      “It would just be helpful to know if there is something genetic, because it’s a hard life Philip has lived,” Lussier said. “I would choose to have him here with us; he’s taught everybody else so much.” ||||| NIH names new clinical sites in Undiagnosed Diseases Network      Four-year, 43 million initiative engages broad expertise in study of mystery conditions      The National Institutes of Health has awarded grants to six medical centers around the country to select from the most difficult-to-solve medical cases and together develop effective approaches to diagnose them. The clinical sites will conduct clinical evaluation and scientific investigation in cases that involve patients with prolonged undiagnosed conditions.      Each clinical site will contribute local medical expertise to the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). The network includes and is modeled after an NIH pilot program that has enrolled people with intractable medical conditions from nearly every state, the District of Columbia and seven foreign countries. The network builds on a program at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., that for the past six years has evaluated hundreds of patients and provided many diagnoses, often using genomic approaches, for rare conditions.      “Newly developed methods for genome sequencing now provide us amazingly powerful approaches for deciphering the causes of rare undiagnosed conditions,” said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. “Along with robust clinical evaluations, genomics will play a central role in the UDN’s mission.” Dr. Green and Story Landis, Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, co-chair the UDN working group.      Undiagnosed diseases are conditions that even skilled physicians cannot diagnose despite extensive clinical investigation. They may not be recognized by doctors because they are rarely seen, are previously undescribed, or are rare forms of more common diseases.      The NIH Common Fund awarded four-year grants of approximately 7.2 million (pending available funds) to each of the six medical centers around the country. James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), announced in an NIH telebriefing that the six newly awarded sites join a clinical site already established at NIH in pursuing cutting-edge diagnoses. In addition, this past December, NIH selected Harvard Medical School as the UDN Coordinating Center for the multi-institution network.      “The NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network has the potential to transform medicine and serve as a catalyst for new discoveries,” said Dr. Anderson. “It is an ideal NIH Common Fund program—the only one focused on diagnoses of rare disorders.”      The following institutions were awarded grants to establish UDN clinical sites:      Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; Principal Investigator: Brendan H.L. Lee, M.D., Ph.D.      Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; Principal Investigator: Joseph Loscalzo, M.D., Ph.D.      Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Principal Investigators: Vandana Shashi, M.D. , and David B. Goldstein, Ph.D.      Stanford University, Stanford, California; Principal Investigators: Euan A. Ashley, M.D., D.Phil., Jonathan Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., and Paul Graham Fisher, M.D.      University of California, Los Angeles; Principal Investigators: Eric J. Vilain, M.D., Ph.D., Katrina M. Dipple, M.D., Ph.D., Stanley Nelson, M.D., and Christina Palmer, C.G.C., Ph.D.      Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville; Principal Investigators: John A. Phillips, III, M.D., and John H. Newman, M.D.      “This type of program can invigorate a medical center anywhere in the country and in the world,” said William A. Gahl, M.D., Ph.D., clinical director at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), director of the NIH-based Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) and co-coordinator of the UDN working group. “Often, patients have a lot of physical complaints and no objective diagnoses. Our goal is to use the latest tools to make a diagnosis that spans the clinical, pathological and biochemical spectrum to uncover the basic genetic defect.”      Since 2008, the UDP has explored this fascinating area of medical research and acquired practical insights in the process of enrolling approximately 600 undiagnosed children and adults in its clinical protocols. The multidisciplinary clinical and research team diagnosed approximately 100 patients (20-25 percent of those evaluated), discovered two unknown diseases and identified 15 genes not previously associated with any other human disease. A combination of genomic and clinical analyses contributed to the diagnoses.      By including an additional six clinical sites, the NIH UDN will both draw upon the unique expertise of new clinical research groups and cultivate opportunities for collaboration among a larger group of expert laboratory and clinical investigators. Physicians within the network will collect and share high-quality clinical and laboratory data, including genomic information, clinical observations and documentation of environmental exposures. They also will benefit from common protocols designed to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases.      “The UDN will look at diseases across all clinical specialties using new tools and methods of analysis for the identification of new diseases,” said Anastasia L. Wise, Ph.D., a program director in NHGRI's Division of Genomic Medicine and co-coordinator of the UDN working group that oversees the development and implementation of the UDN. “The network will facilitate collaboration and shared use of genomic tools among the sites.”      Based on the NIH UDP experience, the UDN Coordinating Center at Harvard Medical School has begun paving the way for the new UDN clinical sites to begin accepting patients. Among the coordinating efforts are the preparation of draft protocols and operating guidelines, and the definition of an initial framework of common practices across the network. The network will share systems for data collection and develop common approaches to patient selection, evaluation and diagnosis.      Each new clinical site may have variations in handling health insurance coverage for clinical testing and care. However, no patient will be turned away from participation in the UDN based on lack of health insurance coverage.      “We believe that there is a substantial unmet demand for the diagnoses of conditions that have perplexed skillful physicians,” said Isaac Kohane, M.D., Ph.D., professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital and principal investigator of the Coordinating Center. “We want to address inquiries from physicians and patients throughout the country who require these services and, in doing so, create a 21st century model for diagnosis and treatment in this genomic and information-intensive era.”      UDN investigators will share genomic data from UDN patients with the research community through multiple public repositories. Network-wide data sharing will observe standards of patient privacy, confidentiality and management of health information.      The network will start up and test its operating procedures during its first year. It will progressively expand recruitment of patients so that by the summer of 2017, the rate of admissions at each new clinical site will be about 50 patients per year. For a period this summer, referrals from clinicians on behalf of undiagnosed patients may continue to be made through the existing NIH application pipeline.

Now the National Institutes of Health is setting up a network of research centers where doctors will examine these unlucky patients, test their genetic codes and swap information on what they find. The hope is that by pooling information and patients, doctors can solve these medical mysteries and perhaps also shed light on more common diseases.      “The Undiagnosed Diseases Network that we are announcing today will focus on the rarest of disorders — often those that affect fewer than 50 people in the entire world,” said Dr. Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of the NIH institutes. “They are so rare that they may never have been discovered or doctors may never have encountered them.”      Sign up for top Health news direct to your inbox.      \\"They sent us through ever doctor imaginable.\\"      One of the patients who finally got a diagnosis is Louise Benge, 59, from Brodhead, Kentucky. She’s been suffering odd pain since she was 16. “By the time I was in my 20s, the pain in my legs was so bad I had trouble sleeping and lots of trouble walking,” Benge told reporters. Her brothers and sister shared the mysterious affliction.      Not only did Benge go to her primary care physician, but she beat paths to the doors of vascular specialists, neurologists and other specialists, too. Then she got into NIH’s early Undiagnosed Diseases Program.      “At NIH they sent us through every doctor imaginable,” Benge said. They had CT scans, MRIs, genetic tests and electrocardiograms. Finally, genetic testing showed Benge and her siblings had ACDC, a rare calcification disorder.      It causes calcium to build up in the blood vessels of her hands, legs and feet but, luckily, not to the heart. Eventually the calcium completely blocks blood flow, causing pain and forcing the body to grow new vessels to bypass the blockage.      Benge and her family members are taking a drug called a bisphosphonate, usually used to treat osteoporosis or brittle bone disease. The hope is it can stop or even reverse the calcium buildup.      Louise Benge, 56, Brodhead , Ky., is a patient in the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program on Jan. 31, 2011. Jeannine Mjoseth / National Human Genome Research Institute      But even if it doesn’t help, Benge may already have benefited, says Dr. William Gahl, who directs NIH’s Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “We should not underestimate the value of hearing a diagnosis,” Gahl said.      People with rare diseases have often lived under a veil of suspicion from loved ones, employers and sometimes even their doctors. “How difficult it is to go through life with that element of desperation,’ he said.      “Even though it’s a bad diagnosis, they are incredibly grateful and it changes their lives and the lives of their families. Cures and treatments are one thing but changing quality of life is another thing that this program has offered to a number of people.”      Rare diseases may each only affect a few people, but collectively they affect about 10 percent of the population, said Dr. James Anderson, director of program coordination at NIH.

Individually, these may be rare conditions, but nearly 30 million Americans— almost one in 10 people—are dealing with the effects of such a condition.”      Genome sequencing technology has finally made it possible to find out what’s causing many of these conditions, said Green.      “Newly developed methods for genome sequencing now provide us amazingly powerful approaches for deciphering the causes of rare undiagnosed conditions,” he said.      “To date, researchers have discovered the genomic bases of more than 5,000 rare genetic disorders, but we are still on the hunt for the cause of an additional 2,000-3,000 single-gene, also called Mendelian, disorders.”      What the NIH announced Tuesday is a four-year, 43 million program. Six centers have been given four-year grants of about 7 million each:      Baylor College of Medicine, Houston      Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital      Duke University, Durham, North Carolina      Stanford University, California      University of California, Los Angeles      Vanderbilt University Medical Center      The coordinating center is at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The NIH hopes that each center will be seeing 50 patients a year by 2017.      “If we find a second patient with that same variant then that pretty much nails it.\\"      Up to now, all patients have had to be seen at NIH’s clinical center in Bethesda, Maryland. Even so, the interest has been overwhelming. “We have had about 10,000 inquiries,” Gahl said. About a third have completed applications to go through the program, which is free of charge. NIH has accepted just 750.      Getting into the program doesn’t guarantee a diagnosis, much less a potential treatment. “We think we have got a decent diagnosis in about a quarter to 40 percent or so. It’s rough,” Gahl said. But the hope is that getting more people into the program will help.      “Patients have many mutations and not clear often which one is causing the symptoms,” Gahl said. “If we find a second patient with that same variant then that pretty much nails it.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has created a network of six centers, called the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, to help diagnose and treat patients with rare and undiagnosed diseases.

Context: The Buccaneers began their 2008 campaign on the road against their NFC South foe, the New Orleans Saints.  In the first quarter, Tampa Bay trailed as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR David Patten.  The Bucs would respond with CB Phillip Buchanon returning an interception 26 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, Tampa Bay took the lead with kicker Matt Bryant getting a 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, New Orleans would reply with kicker Mart&#237;n Gram&#225;tica getting a 34-yard field goal, yet the Buccaneers replied with Bryant nailing a 33-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Saints got their lead back with Brees completing an 84-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson.  In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay would go ahead again as QB Jeff Garcia completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard.  However, New Orleans regained the lead after Brees completing a 42-yard TD pass to RB Reggie Bush. Inside the final minute, Garcia drove the Buccaneers to the Saints 24-yard line. Facing 4th down & 6, Garcia threw an interception, and the Saints clinched the victory. With the loss, the Buccaneers began their season at 0-1 and lost on opening day for the third straight year. Question: Which players score the two longest touchdowns of the game? Answer:","output":"The two players who scored the longest touchdowns of the game were David Patten and Devery Henderson, both from the New Orleans Saints.  While verifying this information, these were the steps I followed: 1. First, I went through the text to locate instances where touchdowns were mentioned. 2. I spotted that Drew Brees completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR David Patten in the first quarter. 3. Then I noticed Drew Brees completed an 84-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson in the third quarter. 4. I realized that Brees also completed a 42-yard TD pass to RB Reggie Bush in the fourth quarter. 5. Comparing these, it's clear that the 84-yard and 39-yard touchdowns were the longest.

The eventual configuration was rare in terms of contemporary fighter aircraft design, with only the preceding Fokker G.1, the contemporary Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, and the later Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter having a similar planform (aeronautics). The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbo-superchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mockup was designed to mount two .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns with 200 rounds per gun (rpg), two .30-caliber (7.62 mm) Brownings with 500 rpg, and a T1 Army Ordnance 23 mm (.90 in) autocannon with a rotary magazine as a substitute for the non-existent 25 mm Hotchkiss et Cie aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville.

Movie title: The Village Movie plot: In the 19th century, residents of the small, isolated Pennsylvania village of Covington live in fear of nameless creatures in the surrounding woods and have constructed a large barrier of oil lanterns and watch towers that are constantly manned to keep watch. After the funeral of a seven-year-old boy, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) asks the village elders for permission to pass through the woods to get medical supplies from neighboring towns; however, his request is denied. Later, his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver) admonishes him for wanting to visit the neighboring towns, which the villagers describe as wicked. The Elders also appear to have secrets of their own and keep physical mementos hidden in black boxes, the contents of which are reminders of the evil and tragedy they left behind when they left the towns. After Lucius makes a short venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings in the form of splashes of red paint on all the villagers' doors. Meanwhile, Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard)âthe blind daughter of the chief Elder, Edward Walker (William Hurt)âinforms Lucius that she has strong feelings for him, and he returns her affections. They arrange to be married, but Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), a young man with an apparent developmental and learning disability, stabs Lucius with a knife because he is in love with Ivy himself.

A newly-released 911 tape from the Florida movie theater shooting reveals that the alleged shooter sat and watched the victim die from a gunshot wound to the chest. A frantic call was made from the movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida at 1.29pm on January 13 after a shot rang out. A caller is heard on the tape telling the dispatcher 'there’s been a gunshot... it looks like it broke his sternum' with a 'shotgun or pistol'. He also frantically alerts the dispatcher to the fact that the shooter, 'an older gentleman', is still present. Scroll down for audio tape of the harrowing call. Suspected Florida movie theater shooter Curtis Reeves was led away in handcuffs wearing a white jumpsuit after police removed his clothing for evidence. A 911 call released today revealed he had watched as his alleged victim died from a gunshot wound. The dispatcher, from the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, asks: 'Do you know who shot him?' The caller said: 'I don’t know…it looks like an older gentleman in the movie theater.' 'Is he still in there?', says the sheriff's office responder. 'Yes, he is,' comes the callers whispered response. Meanwhile married father-of-one Chad Oulson, 43, was lying on the floor of the movie theater with a gunshot wound to the chest. The 911 caller, who explains that he is a trained nurse, says: 'Looks like there’s blood going through his lungs, so we need someone here fast.' A woman then takes the phone asking: 'Where are they? The pulse is really slow…I can’t feel it anymore.' The dispatcher tries to calm the callers, telling them that help is on the way. At 10 minutes, 11 seconds after the call is placed, police arrive - but it is too late to save Mr Oulson. Devastated: The killing of Chad Oulson, center, has left 22-month-old Lexy, right, without a father and Nicole Oulson a widow. Florida Police Captain Curtis Reeves, Jr., suspected of fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole, 33, appears in court wearing a suicide-prevention gown. Curtis Reeves, 71, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of the married father. He is being held without bail at Land O' Lakes jail in Florida. Chad Oulson's widow Nicole. struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke on Thursday about the. day that her husband was shot dead. The couple had gone on a rare date to watch the movie Lone Survivor, leaving their 22-month-old daughter, Lexy, with a babysitter. As Mr Ouslon checked his phone for. any word on his daughter during the previews, another cinema-goer,. retired police officer and father-of-two Curtis Reeves who was sitting behind the couple with his wife, asked him to put it away. An. argument ensued - with some witnesses saying Mr Oulson threw popcorn -. and Reeves shot the father once in the chest. Mrs Oulson was shot. in her hand as she tried to protect her husband. She said that she wants his 'senseless' killer locked up for life. 'He brought an unfair life sentence to me to have to raise our daughter alone,' Nicole Oulson, 33, told Good Morning America in her first live interview. 'To. have to live without the love of my life, for my daughter to have to. grow up without her daddy by her side for graduation and marriage. 'It was so unnecessary. It was for no reason, so I want him behind bars and to be punished for his senseless act.' Heartbroken: Nicole Oulson spoke to Good Morning America on Thursday about the loss of her husband, Chad, who was shot dead in a movie theater last week. She said she wants his killer locked up forever. Lawyers representing the Oulson family. have confirmed that Lexy was unwell and that Chad was keeping a close. eye on his phone in case he and Nicole had to leave early and go to pick. her up. Mrs Oulson said her husband was 'absolutely not' threatening the shooter. 'I. never expected it,' she said. 'I never could have imagined it. There. were a couple of words, no threats, no harm, no nothing.' Her attorney, TJ Grimaldi, joined her. on Good Morning America and said that Reeves might try to use the. controversial 'stand your ground' law for his defense. 'There's just no way that this can stand up in this case,' he said. 'In my opinion it doesn't matter if it was. popcorn, Twizzlers, a hot cup of coffee - there is absolutely no reason. that it should have to escalate like this.' Torn apart: She said the killer left her without the love of her life, Chad, center, and Lexy without a daddy. Now Mrs Oulson said she is just trying to be there for her young daughter. 'She's luckily at a young age... she doesn't know what's going on,' she said. But she knows there are things her husband did she will never be able to replace, such as putting Lexy to bed. 'The. last thing he would say before tucking her in was, \\"You make me so happy,\\" and she would say, \\"Me happy. too, Daddy\\". And those are the times I'll never be able to replace, and that's when it's hard.' Mr Oulson's colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to raise money for Nicole and Lexy.

To better understand this position, let us analyse both the premise and the hypothesis more thoroughly. The premise states: In the eastern part of the country, states realized that emissions from sources in other states were significantly contributing to their 1-hour ozone non-attainment problems. The hypothesis states: This has happened in the western part of the country when states realised emissions from other sources were negligible. To evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it is essential to examine the potential connections and discrepancies. Similarities: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve a realisation or recognition by the given states concerning emissions affecting their ozone non-attainment problems. 2. The geographical context indicates the potential for differences in emissions contributions based on location, with the eastern part of the country experiencing significant impacts from other states, and the western part of the country potentially seeing negligible effects. Discrepancies: 1. The premise focuses on a situation where emissions from other states are making a substantial impact on ozone non-attainment problems. In contrast, the hypothesis is discussing a scenario where emissions from other sources are considered negligible. 2. While the premise highlights the eastern part of the country, the hypothesis features the western part. The spatial distinction may lead to differences in population, industrial structures, meteorological patterns, and transportation networks, all of which can influence the emissions contributions and their impact on ozone levels. These factors complicate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, making it inappropriate to directly connect the two. To conclude, given the similarities and discrepancies between the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to assert that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The geographical context, differences in emissions impact, and other regional factors create a complex situation that prevents drawing a direct correlation between the conditions in the eastern and western parts of the country. To make a more accurate conclusion, additional evidence and a deeper analysis of the underlying factors affecting emissions contributions and ozone non-attainment issues across the country would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Appointments to the Order of the British Empire were at first made on the nomination of the self-governing Dominions of the Empire, the Viceroy of India, and the colonial governors, as well as on nominations from within the United Kingdom. As the Empire evolved into the Commonwealth, nominations continued to come from the Commonwealth realms, in which the monarch remained head of state.

Any individual made a member of the Order for gallantry could wear an emblem of two crossed silver oak leaves on the same riband, ribbon or bow as the badge. It could not be awarded posthumously and was effectively replaced in 1974 with the Queen's Gallantry Medal.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Article: Pilar Abel, 58, says she is result of illicit romance between artist and her mother, who worked for family that spent holidays near painter’s home      More than two decades after the Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dalí died, a woman claiming to be his daughter has lodged a paternity suit, asking for help in obtaining DNA evidence to back her claim.            Pilar Abel, 58, claims her mother and the artist met in the 1950s when her mother was working for a family that would often spend summers in Cadaqués, close to where Dalí had a home. The pair “had a friendship that developed into clandestine love”, said Abel, in documents presented to a Madrid court. Abel was born in 1956.      At the time, Dalí would have been married to Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. They married in 1934 and had no children.      Driven by her mother’s repeated comments that she was the daughter of Dalí, Abel took a DNA test in Madrid in 2007, using hair and skin remains that she had obtained from a death mask of the painter. The results were inconclusive.      She then turned to Dalí’s close friend and official biographer, Robert Descharnes. It was agreed that further DNA testing would be carried out in Paris using medical samples that had belonged to Dalí.      Abel said she never received the results of the test. On Thursday, she took her battle to a Madrid court, asking for help in obtaining the results or, if necessary, backing to have another DNA test carried out. If there is insufficient genetic material for the test, the court documents raise the possibility of exhuming Dalí’s remains.      Abel’s legal challenge is filed against the heirs of the painter, specifically Spain’s tax office and public administration, as well as the Dalí Foundation.      In 2008, Descharnes’ son Nicolas refuted Abel’s paternity claim, saying the doctor who had carried out the paternity tests in Paris had verbally communicated to Abel that the tests were negative.      “There is no relationship between this woman and Salvador Dalí,” he told Spanish agency Efe at the time. ||||| A judge has ordered the exhumation of Salvador Dali's body for a biological test to determine the paternity of Maria Pilar Abel Martinez, 61, who claims to be his daughter. The order came from a Madrid judge who said the measures were \\"necessary\\" because \\"there are no biological remains or personal objects\\" of Dali, writes EFE.

Soon after, de Haro married another man. Dali was married to Gala Dali until her death in 1982.      Abel is a tarot card reader who, according to the lawsuit, would stand to receive hundreds of millions in euros from Dali's paintings, which were given to the Spanish state upon his death in 1989, reports The New York Times.

I also call her Lionette, because when she gets angry she roars like the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion\\"            Gala (Kazan, Russia, 1894 - Portlligat, Girona, 1982)      Salvador Dalí's wife and muse, whose real name was Elena Ivanovna Diakonova was a mysterious and highly intuitive woman, which was able to recognise artistic and creative genius when she saw it, and had relations with a number of intellectuals and artists.      Nevertheless, the truth iss that very little is known about herpersonality: she had two older brothers, Vadim and Nicolai, a younger sister, Lidia; she spent her childhood in Moscowand her father died when she was eleven years old. Her mother remarried later to a lawyer, with whom Gala related very well and thanks to whom she managed to acquire a good education. She was a brilliant student, completing her studies at the M.G. Brukhonenko academy for young ladies with a very high average mark; a degree from the tsar authorised her to become a primary school teacher and to give lessons in people's homes. In 1912 she suffered a worsening of the tuberculosis that had afflicted her for some time, and her family decided to move her intothe Clavadel sanatorium in Switzerland, where she met Eugène Grindel (later to be known as Paul Eluard). Their similar ages and love for reading made them become good friends. Both were discharged from the sanatorium in 1914.Gala returned to Russia and Eluard went to the war front, but the couple proposed to each other before that.      They married in 1917, and the following year was born the girl that was to be Gala's only daughter, Cécile. Eluard, who had already been revealed as poet and had changed his surname, had close relationships with the leading figures of the surrealist movementand in particularl with the creators of the Littérature magazine: André Breton, Philippe Soupault and Louis Aragon. Gala also attended some of their meetings. In 1922 she started a relationship with Max Ernst but they broke up in 1924. Max Ernst painted her in a number of portraits. Also noteworthy was her friendship with the poet René Char, and particularly with René Crevel.      It was in 1929 when she first met Salvador Dalí. In April of that year Dalí went to Paris to present the film that he had created with Luis Buñuel, Un chien andalou, and it was there where Camille Goemans, a Belgian poet and gallery owner, introduced Dalí to Paul Eluard. Dalí invited them to spend the summer in Cadaqués. Goemans and a friend of his, as well as René Magritte and his wife, and Luis Buñuel, Paul Eluard and Gala, and the couple's daughter Cécile, all spent some time there. When the painter met Gala it was love at first sight. In his Secret Life, he wrote: \\"She was destined to be my Gradiva (the name comes from the title of a novel by W. Jensen, the main character of which was Sigmund Freud; Gradiva was the book's heroine and it was her who brought psychological healing to the main character), the one who moves forward, my victory, my wife\\". And Gala was indeed to remain forever at the painter's side, so that from that time on her biography was linked with that of Dalí.      In 1948, Dalí and Gala returned from the United States after eight years of exile there. Dalí had achieved recognition in his own country, and his father had come to accept his son's relationship with a divorced Russian woman. From that time onwards, the Dalís would spend the spring and summer in Portlligat and the autumn and winter between New York and Paris.      In 1958 Dalí and Gala got married at the Àngels chapel, near Girona. In 1968 the painter bought Gala a castle in Púbol, Girona, and it was agreed that the painter could not go there without her prior permission . Between 1971 and 1980, Gala would spend some time at her castle, always during summer. It was there that Gala was buried, after she died in 1982. Since 1996 the castle has been open to the public as the Gala-Dalí Castle House Museum in Púbol. ||||| GIRONA, Spain — Salvador Dalí led the kind of eccentric and sensational lifestyle that might have been expected of one of the greatest Surrealist painters.      A quarter century after Dalí’s death, however, Pilar Abel, a tarot card reader, is determined to add another twist to Dalí’s story. She wants a court to recognize her as his daughter — and perhaps grant her a share of the hundreds of millions of euros worth of paintings Dalí bequeathed to the Spanish state upon his death in 1989.      According to Ms. Abel’s paternity lawsuit, filed in a Madrid court in March, her mother had a “clandestine love affair” with the painter in the 1950s in Port Lligat, the fishing village where Dalí and his Russian-born wife, Gala, built their waterfront house.      Ms. Abel’s mother, Antonia Martínez de Haro, spent several summers in the village, working mostly as a nanny for families living near Dalí’s home. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Dalí died in Spain in 1989 and had no children with his wife      A judge in Madrid has ordered the exhumation of the body of Spanish artist Salvador Dalí to get samples for a paternity suit.      A Spanish woman, born in 1956, said her mother, a maid, had a clandestine affair with the painter in 1955.      The judge said there were no biological remains or personal objects of the artist to be used in the test. He died in Spain in 1989 at the age of 85.      The Dalí Foundation, which manages the artist's estate, says it will appeal.      The surrealist painter was buried in the theatre and museum he designed himself, in his home town of Figueres in the north-eastern Catalonia region.      Maria Pilar Abel Martínez, a tarot card reader who was born in Girona, made the paternity claim for the first time in 2015.      Image copyright AFP/EPA Image caption Ms Martínez claims that her mother had an affair with the world-famous painter      She said her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in Cadaqués, next to where the painter had a home.      Antonia left her job in 1955, moved to a different city and married another man.      Ms Martínez claimed that her mother told her several times that Dalí was her father, on many occasions in front of others.      \\"The only thing I'm missing is a moustache,\\" she once said, according to newspaper El Mundo (in Spanish).      At the time of the alleged affair, Dalí was married to his muse Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. The couple had no children.      Image caption Salvador Dalí is best known for his surrealist works      The decision also cites that Ms Martínez underwent two paternity tests, both in 2007, but never received the results.      Her legal action is against the Spanish state, to which Dalí left his estate.      If she is confirmed to be the artist's daughter, she could use his surname and be entitled to part of his estate - but Spanish media say she would have to legally request it.      Ms Martínez's lawyer said there was no date for the exhumation, but that it could happen as soon as July.      The Dalí Foundation said in a statement that an appeal would \\"be lodged in the coming days.\\"      Other notable exhumations      Richard III: When a skeleton was found underneath a Leicester car park in 2012, archaeologists hoped they may have found the last Plantagenet king. The next year, it was confirmed the bones did belong to Richard III, who was killed in battle in 1485. The monarch was interred in a more fitting location - that of Leicester Cathedral - in 2015.      Lech Kaczynski: It did not take long for the rumours to start after the Polish president and a number of other senior figures - including the country's army chief, central bank governor, MPs and leading historians - were killed in a plane crash in 2010. But it took another six years for their bodies to be exhumed. And when they did, what they found was nothing less than baffling. The remains had been mixed up - with Mr Kaczynski's coffin containing the bodies of two other people.      Nelson Mandela's children: As the South African president lay dying in 2013, three of the children who predeceased him were in the process of being exhumed. It was the second time the bodies had been dug up: Mr Mandela's grandson Mandla had first moved them from the family graveyard in 2011, allegedly without the family's consent.      Pablo Neruda: The Nobel prize-winning Chilean poet was exhumed in 2013, 40 years after he died of prostate cancer. It was rumoured Neruda - whose death came days after the military coup which brought General Augusto Pinochet to power - may have been poisoned. The exhumation did not find any poison, but did find an unexplained bacterial infection before he was reburied in 2016.      Lots of people in Madagascar: Some people on the African island exhume their relatives as an act of love and respect.      And finally... a goose: Police in Hertfordshire exhumed the body of a goose, investigating allegations it was shot dead at point-blank range. A post-mortem found he had died of natural causes. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Pilar Abel, a 58-year-old Spanish tarot card reader, has lodged a paternity suit alleging she is the daughter of globally renowned artist Salvador Dalí. She claims her mother had a secret love affair with the surrealist painter in the 1950s while working for a family that spent summers near Dalí's home. To back her claim, Abel sought DNA evidence first in 2007 using hair and skin remains from the artist's death mask, which gave inconclusive results. Then she sought further testing with the help of Dalí's biographer, Robert Descharnes, using stored medical samples of the artist. The results of these tests, however, were never shared with her. Therefore, Abel has now approached a Madrid court to obtain these results or facilitate another DNA test. The case proceedings may even lead to the exhumation of Dalí’s remains if there’s insufficient genetic material for testing. The suit is against the heirs of Dalí, including Spain’s tax office, public administration, and the Dalí Foundation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They can be glass, stones, porcelain, seashells, or whatever else you can find.  You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include.  These could include buttons, bones, metals, etc.  If you can, find them already precut into distinct shapes and sizes.  This will keep you from having to break them with a hammer/saw later. Choose a wide variety of colors and shades.  Even if your work will be mostly monochromatic, you will want varying values and ones. Choose tesserae that goes with the art you wish to create.  For example, if you are doing a beach scene, it might be best to use a wide variety of shells.  If you are looking to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge, you might want to look into metals. Tables, planters, birdbaths, or walking stones are just a few ideas to use.  You can make almost anything work as a base.  Wood, terracotta and/or glass are usually what people use as a base.  Make sure the base is strong enough to hold the weight of the tesserae and grout. Choose bases which have large, open spaces. If there are numerous crevices on your base, it may be hard to create mosaic pieces which will fit. Find patterns for free online or use your imagination and come up with your own design.  For a first time project, you may wish to work with a simple pattern.  This could mean a house, a fish, a landscape, or anything else with simply defined shapes.  After you work on a simple pattern, you can graduate up to more complicated projects. Print out the pattern to the dimensions needed.  Begin transferring the design, first using a pencil.  This will allow you to adjust for mistakes and inconsistencies.  Once you have a rough outline with a pencil, go back and trace over the lines with a pen or marker, depending on the type of base.  If you are using a basic design, this might be the time to add in details that are not present in the original design.  If the pattern is extra large, do it in sections.  Remember this is a rough outline, which can be changed when you start to lay down specific tiles. If you are using an original design, simply draw it directly onto the base.  However, don't over plan.  Spontaneity is key to creating artistically stunning art. Summary:","output":"Mosaic art is made with little pieces called tesserae, which can be made from things like glass, stones, and even seashells. You can also use other items like buttons and metals. You'll need to pick tesserae and items that match what you're trying to make, like shells for a beach scene. You need a sturdy base to put your mosaic on, and you can use stuff like tables or walking stones. The base should be mostly flat so your mosaic fits. You also need a pattern, which can be totally made up by you or found on the internet. Start by sketching your pattern with a pencil so you can fix mistakes, then trace it with a pen. Remember to relax and be spontaneous when creating your art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The review would highlight various aspects of the stay that were unsatisfactory, disappointing, or problematic for the guest. Below is a detailed and long example of a negative review: --- Title: Disappointing and Uncomfortable Stay – Will Not Be Returning! I recently spent a weekend at the [Hotel Name], and I am sad to say that my stay was far from the pleasant experience I had hoped for. Arriving on a Friday evening after several hours of travel, my first encounter with the hotel's staff was a receptionist who seemed indifferent to my arrival and more focused on finishing a phone conversation with a friend. Check-in took far longer than necessary due to the receptionist struggling to locate my reservation, despite the fact that I had both a printed confirmation and provided the booking reference number. Eventually, after much frustration and confusion, I was finally given the keys to my room. Upon entering the room, I was disappointed to find that the accommodation seemed nothing like the luxurious pictures featured on the hotel's website. The room was small, dimly lit, and had a musty odor that suggested poor ventilation. The carpet was heavily stained, and some areas were even torn. The walls sported a tired, faded paint job and were marred by scuffs and marks. The bed, which was advertised as a comfortable, high-quality mattress, was in fact lumpy and very uncomfortable, leading to restless nights and little sleep. The linens were rough, and I was only provided with a thin, insubstantial blanket that did little to keep me warm in the chilly room. The bathroom was no better. The showerhead was poorly fitted, resulting in weak water pressure and an uneven spray that made showering an unsatisfying experience. The towels, like the bed linens, were rough and lacked an adequate level of softness. To make matters worse, the room was not well-soundproofed, and I was consistently disturbed by noise from neighboring rooms and the hallway. During my stay, I visited the hotel's restaurant in the hopes of finding some solace in a good meal. Sadly, the dining experience also fell short of expectations. The menu was limited, and the food I ordered was bland and unappetizing. The service was slow and unprofessional, and the high price of the meals felt unjustified given the overall quality. Throughout my stay, I encountered several staff members who were dismissive and unhelpful. Despite my numerous complaints regarding the room's many shortcomings, very little was done to rectify the situation or ensure a more comfortable stay. The general atmosphere of the hotel seemed to lack warmth and hospitality, making it an unwelcoming place to stay. In conclusion, my stay at the [Hotel Name] was an undeniably negative experience, and I cannot in good faith recommend this establishment to others. The poor service, substandard accommodations, and all-around disappointing experience have led me to decide that I will not be returning to this hotel in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: In the past ten years, many scientists have studied the differences between men and women. And they all got the same answer: The sexes  are different, because their brains are different. And this, the scientists say, makes men and women see the world in different ways. Boys, for example, generally are better than girls at mathematical ideas. Boys also generally are better than girls at the kind of hand and eye movements necessary for ball sports. Girls, on the other hand generally start speaking earlier than boys. And they generally see better in the dark than boys and are better at learning foreign languages. What makes men and women better at one thing or another? The answer is the brain. The brain has two sides connected by nerve  tracks. The left side generally is used for mathematics, speech and writing. The right side is used for artistic creation  and the expression for emotions . In men and women, different areas in each side of the brain develop differently. In boys, for example, it's the area used for mathematics. In girls, it is the area used for language skills. Another interesting difference is that the two sides of a man's brain are connected by a smaller number of nerves than the two sides of a woman's brain are. Question: 60.

Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm.

During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In February 1992, Mielke was put on trial for the first degree murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as well as the attempted murder of Senior Sergeant Willig. The evidence for Mielke's guilt was drawn from the original police files, the 1934 trial transcripts, and a handwritten memoir in which Mielke had admitted that, \\"the Bulowplatz Affair,\\" had been his reason for fleeing Germany. All had been found in Mielke's house safe during a police search in 1990. Mielke was believed to have kept the files for purposes of \\"blackmailing Honecker and other East German leaders.\\" Former Associated Press reporter and White House Press Secretary John Koehler also testified about how Mielke had boasted of his involvement in the Bulowplatz murders during a confrontation at Leipzig in 1965.  During his trial, Mielke appeared increasingly senile, admitting his identity but otherwise remaining silent, taking naps, and showing little interest in the proceedings. In a widely publicized incident, Mielke appeared to mistake the presiding judge for a prison barber. When a journalist for Der Spiegel attempted to interview him in Plotzensee Prison, Mielke responded, \\"I want to go back to my bed\\" (German: \\"Ich mochte in mein Bett zuruck.\\"). Opinion was divided whether Mielke was suffering from senile dementia or was pretending in order to evade prosecution.  After twenty months of one-and-a-half hour daily sessions, Erich Mielke was convicted on two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. On 26 October 1993, a panel of three judges and two jurors sentenced him to six years' imprisonment. In pronouncing sentence, Judge Theodor Seidel, told Mielke that he \\"will go down in history as one of the most fearsome dictators and police ministers of the 20th century.\\" Did the interview happen","output":"Yes, the interview with the journalist from Der Spiegel did happen. While Erich Mielke was in Plotzensee Prison, the journalist tried to talk to him, but Mielke only responded by saying, \\"I want to go back to my bed\\" (German: \\"Ich mochte in mein Bett zuruck.\\"). This showed that Mielke was either genuinely confused and possibly dealing with senile dementia, or he was pretending in order to avoid answering questions and facing the consequences of his actions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: All I Want is the first solo studio album by The Reverb Junkie - producer moniker for musician Michelle Chamuel.

Title: Charade Movie plot: The Paris-Bordeaux express speeds through the French countryside--and suddenly a dead man, clad only in pajamas and a bathrobe, tumbles off the train and down an embankment.The scene shifts to Mégève, the premier ski resort in the French Alps, where Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is sitting at a table on a platform overlooking the mountain. Before her is food sufficient for three adults, not just one. She is totally oblivious as an automatic pistol, held by a gloved hand, takes direct aim at her. The hand pulls the trigger--and out shoots a harmless water jet that sprays all over her face. Taking off her glasses, Regina looks at young Jean-Louis Gaudet (Thomas Chelimsky), age 8, who suddenly looks very guilty. \\"Don't tell me,\\" says Reggie, \\"you didn't know it was loaded.\\"She calls out for her friend, Sylvie Gaudet (Dominique Minot), who sends the boy to find some other place to play while she helps Reggie to dry off. Noting the table full of food, Sylvie asks Reggie what's wrong. The answer: Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, Charles. The two stroll through the resort as Reggie says that she is frustrated with Charles' incessant secrecy and lies. Sylvie, a \\"modern woman\\" to the core, suggests that Reggie simply have affairs on her husband's money, but Reggie doesn't think that way.Just then a dapper gentleman (Cary Grant) approaches, with Jean-Louis in tow, saying that Jean-Louis was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. As Sylvie takes Jean-Louis back to apologize to the Rothschilds, the mystery man, giving his name out as Peter Joshua, strikes up a conversation with Reggie. Reggie flirts with him almost outrageously, and \\"Peter Joshua\\" plays along.

Of Bill and Barack Bill Clinton takes to the Charlotte stage Wednesday night to do what he does best—talk . . . about the virtues of Democratic economics. He'll certainly make a better witness than President Obama, and his goal will be to burnish the last four dreary years with fonder memories of the 1990s. Which means it's a good moment to remind everyone about the real economic history of the Clinton years, and why the results differ so much from those of Obamanomics. Aside from Barack Obama, Bill Clinton is perhaps the Democratic party's most prominent figure. WSJ's Naftali Bendavid checks in on Mean Street, previewing Clinton's address to DNC delegates tonight. Photo: Associated Press. In the nostalgic Democratic telling, Mr. Clinton got elected, raised taxes on the rich in 1993 to close the budget deficit and reduce interest rates, and thus kicked off one of the great booms in history. The truth is very different, starting with the fact that there really were two Clinton economic Presidencies. Much like Mr. Obama, in his first two years the Arkansan bowed to the priorities of House Democrats and tried to govern from the left. He raised income and gas taxes while trying to impose a BTU energy tax, a government takeover of health care (HillaryCare) and a 31 billion stimulus, but putting off welfare reform. Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton failed to get his main agenda other than a tax hike through a Democratic Congress. This turned out to be an economic blessing for the country because it didn't weigh on growth, and a political benefit for Mr. Clinton, who didn't have to defend an unpopular agenda in 1996. Republicans rode opposition to the early Clinton agenda to take Congress in 1994, and that's when the second Clinton Presidency began. Mr. Clinton moved sharply to the political middle. Remember \\"triangulation\\"? He embraced the goal of a balanced budget, using it to outmaneuver Newt Gingrich and Republicans over a government shutdown. After two vetoes and shortly before the 1996 election, he signed a GOP welfare reform. As for economic growth, Mr. Clinton inherited an economy that grew 3.4% in 1992, including 4.3% in the fourth quarter. The expansion stumbled in the first nine months of 1993, no doubt in part due to the uncertainty of the Clinton tax hike. In 1994 stocks were flat and interest rates actually rose throughout the year, peaking on the very day in 1994 that Republicans took Congress. As the nearby chart shows, that's when the real 1990s boom began. On policy, the rest of the decade was defined by a virtuous Beltway gridlock. Washington did little to interfere with private investment, and Congress even helped by restraining spending growth. Only toward the end of the decade did both parties began to spend like politicians again as surpluses rolled in. Consider the policy contrasts between Messrs. Clinton and Obama. Under Mr. Clinton, federal outlays as a share of the economy fell to 18.2% of GDP in 2000 from 21.9% in 1992. Nearly two percentage points of that was from the post-Cold War cut in defense spending, but domestic spending also fell as a share of the economy. For his part, Mr. Obama has presided over the largest spending binge since World War II, increasing outlays to 25.2% of GDP in 2009 and close to 24% of GDP for the next three years despite an economic recovery. Deficits have been above 1 trillion for four years. Mr. Clinton did raise the top income-tax rate to 39.6% from 31% in 1993, and Democrats credit that with shrinking the deficit. But even two years after that tax hike, the Congressional Budget Office was estimating annual deficits of 200 billion a year. Only as rapid growth continued in the later part of the decade did the deficits vanish. President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton in June Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton agreed to cut the capital-gains tax rate to 20% from 28% in 1997. Revenue rushed into the Treasury as investors cashed in their pent-up gains. Mr. Obama says he only wants to return to the Clinton-era tax rates, but he's already raised investment tax rates by 3.8 percentage points as part of Obamacare. Combined with the expiration of the Bush rates, that would leave some tax rates higher than in the 1990s. Arguably the most memorable phrase (not related to a scandal) that Bill Clinton uttered during his Presidency came in his 1996 State of the Union address: \\"The era of big government is over.\\" And for a few years, it was over. By contrast, Mr. Obama's four years have been spent expanding the government willy-nilly—with more spending, the promise of higher taxes, and intervention across the economy. His only economic plan now is still-more spending. So as Mr. Clinton tries to lay hands on Mr. Obama and rewrite the history of the 1990s, the real story isn't how much policy the two Democrats have in common. What matters is what they did differently. Bill Clinton learned from the mistakes of his first two years. Mr. Obama has doubled down on his—and, on all available evidence, he will double down again if he's re-elected. A version of this article appeared September 5, 2012, on page A16 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Of Bill and Barack. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. The article discusses the economic policies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during their respective presidencies and contrasts their policies and the outcomes of them.     2. It suggests that Bill Clinton initially tried to govern left-leaning policies including tax hikes and attempted healthcare reform, which didn't pass through the Congress. However, failing to get his full agenda through became something of an economic boon, as the article argues that it prevented policies that might have hindered growth. 3. Clinton then pivoted towards the center, embracing a balanced budget and welfare reform, which according to the article helped fuel an economic boom. This period also saw restrained government spending and decreased federal outlays as portions of the GDP. 4. In contrast, the article asserts that Obama's tenure was marked by substantial spending and increased federal outlays as a portion of the GDP. The fiscal deficits remained over the 1 trillion mark for four years under his leadership. 5. Clinton’s agreement to cut the capital-gains tax rate also had a beneficial effect on revenue, whereas Obama has already raised investment tax rates. 6. Clinton's best-remembered phrase from his presidency is quoted: \\"The era of big government is over\\", contrasting this to Obama's expansion of government influence and spending. 7. The conclusion the article draws is that while both are Democrats, the significant economic differences between their presidencies lie in their approach to fiscal policies, spending, and government's role in the economy. While Clinton learned from his initial mistakes and adjusted his policies, Obama has continued down the path of his initial policy choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The documentation regarding Raciborz and Albert's tenure is the earliest surviving of the use of the clan name and cry defining the honorable status of Polish knights. The names of knightly genealogiae only came to be associated with heraldic devices later in the Middle Ages and in the early modern period. The Polish clan name and cry ritualized the ius militare, i.e., the power to command an army; and they had been used some time before 1244 to define knightly status. (Górecki 1992, pp. 183–185).

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Urinalysis (urine analysis) often provides clues to renal disease. Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas! These food-caused odors are harmless.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Does the sentence \\"The First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final Armistice in 1918.\\" answer the question \\"What were the Allied powers referred to before 1917?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"The First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final Armistice in 1918.\\" does not answer the question \\"What were the Allied powers referred to before 1917?\\" This sentence only provides information about the timeframe of the First World War. It does not mention anything about the Allied powers or their name before 1917. To answer the question, we need to provide information about the names or terms used for the Allied powers in World War I before 1917.  The Allied powers, also known as the Entente Powers, were comprised of countries that opposed the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) in World War I. Before the entry of the United States into the war in 1917, the major members of the Allied powers were France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, along with other smaller countries such as Belgium, Serbia, and Italy, which joined the Allies in 1915. Before 1917 and the United States' involvement in the war, the Allied powers were typically referred to as the Triple Entente. The Triple Entente was a term used to describe the alliance between France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, which was formed by a series of diplomatic agreements in the early 20th century. The formation of the Triple Entente was a response to the Triple Alliance, a similar agreement that brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The term \\"Entente\\" was derived from the French word \\"entente cordiale,\\" which means \\"cordial understanding\\" or \\"friendly agreement.\\" The agreements that formed the Triple Entente sought to solidify friendships, reduce tensions, and promote cooperation between the three major powers. The Entente was not a formal military alliance but rather an understanding between countries that they would support each other in case of conflict involving the Triple Alliance. Italy's entry into the war on the side of the Allies in 1915 added another major power to the Triple Entente, though the term itself did not change to reflect the added partner. Importantly, the broader collective of countries fighting against the Central Powers was still referred to as the Allied powers or the Entente Powers during this time. In summary, before 1917, the main countries of the Allied powers were called the Triple Entente, which highlighted the alliance between France, Russia, and the United Kingdom. While the specific sentence provided does not answer the question relating to the Allied powers' name before 1917, having this background information about the Entente and the evolution of the alliance throughout World War I provides a more comprehensive response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, it is essential to understand the variables and factors that might affect the national savings rate. National savings is the sum of private savings (composed of individual and business savings) and government savings. Various factors, such as economic growth, inflation, interest rates, fiscal policies, and social behaviors, play a crucial role in shaping the national savings rate over time. It is mentioned that a reference point was simulated assuming that national saving remains constant at the 2000 level of 18. However, holding the national savings constant at the 2000 level overlooks the multiple factors that could drastically affect the savings rate between 2000 and 22 years later. As an example, consider the following scenarios: 1. If there is significant economic growth between 2000 and 22, both private and government savings may increase due to higher income levels and increased tax revenue, respectively. As a result, national savings could be higher in 22 compared to the 2000 level. 2. Conversely, if there is an economic downturn during the same period, national savings might be lower than the 2000 level. High inflation or negative interest rates might discourage people from saving, and worsening fiscal balances may lead to increased government borrowing or spending, reducing government savings. 3. Additionally, changes in fiscal policy, such as introducing a new tax regime or altering government spending plans, could have significant implications for national savings, both positively and negatively. Considering these factors and many others that could occur during a 22-year period, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement \\"National savings in 22.\\" solely based on the reference point information provided.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose work was dismissed by some critics? , can you please find it?   Nixon in China is an opera in three acts by John Adams, with a libretto by Alice Goodman. Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip. To create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action. Following the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera. Answer:","output":"John"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She learns to type, and begins to work as a secretary for an eccentric attorney, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), who hires her despite her stilted social skills, unprofessional appearance and scoring higher than anyone he's ever interviewed, therefore being overqualified. Edward explains that it's dull work and they don't use computers; however, Lee remarks that she is okay with these conditions. Though at first Edward appears highly irritated by Lee's typos and other innocuous mistakes, it soon becomes apparent that he is sexually aroused by her obedient behavior. After he confronts her about her propensity for self-injury and commands that she never hurt herself again, the two embark on a BDSM relationship. Lee experiences a sexual and personal awakening, and she falls deeply in love. Edward, however, displays insecurity concerning his feelings for Lee, and he shows shame and disgust over his sexual habits. During this period of exploration with Edward, Lee has also been attempting to have a more conventional boyfriend in Peter (Jeremy Davies), even engaging in lukewarm sex with him. After a sexual encounter in Edward's office, he fires Lee. After Lee is fired from her job, Peter proposes to Lee, who reluctantly agrees to marry him.

I know that the answer to the question \\"How are humans similar to birds?\\" is in \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"Humans are similar to birds in that both engage in monogamous relationships for varying durations, including lifelong partnerships, and share parental responsibilities in raising their offspring. Additionally, infidelity can also occur in both human and bird relationships, with some potential benefits for the offspring.

Answer: Plato (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) thought private property created divisive inequalities, while Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) thought private property enabled people to receive the full benefit of their labor. Question: what is a form of legal ownership Answer:","output":"A form of legal ownership refers to the manner in which an individual or entity possesses rights over a particular asset or property. The concept of ownership is essential to understanding various legal systems and the rights and responsibilities involved in possessing, transferring, and controlling property. There are several forms of legal ownership, including the following: 1. Sole ownership: Sole ownership is when an individual possesses exclusive rights to a property or asset, with no other person or entity having any claim on it. The owner has the liberty to use, sell, rent, or transfer the property as they see fit, within legal bounds. 2. Joint ownership: Joint ownership occurs when two or more individuals or entities possess rights to the same property or asset. This form of ownership can take several forms, including joint tenancy, tenancy in common, and tenancy by the entirety. - Joint tenancy: In a joint tenancy, each owner has an equal share of the property, and upon the death of one owner, their share automatically passes onto the surviving owner(s). - Tenancy in common: In a tenancy in common, each owner holds a separate and distinct share of the property, which can be of different proportions. Upon the death of an owner, their share is transferred to their heirs, rather than the surviving owners. - Tenancy by the entirety: This form of ownership is applicable only to married couples and offers similar rights as joint tenancy, with added protection against individual creditors. 3. Corporate ownership: Corporate ownership occurs when a legal entity, such as a corporation, owns property or assets. This ownership structure is distinct from individual ownership and offers advantages like limited liability and the ability to raise capital through issuing shares. 4. Trust ownership: Trust ownership involves a legal arrangement wherein a trustee holds and manages property or assets on behalf of one or more beneficiaries. The trustee is obligated to manage the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries, following the terms laid out in the trust agreement. 5. Community property: In some jurisdictions, married couples may hold property as community property, meaning that each spouse has an equal interest in the property acquired during the marriage, with a few exceptions. Upon the death of a spouse or in case of divorce, the property is typically divided equally between the parties. These are some common forms of legal ownership that grant individuals or entities the right to possess, use, and control property while adhering to the laws and regulations governing such rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That is because extra costs, such as the fees for accommodation, do not count towards the cap. Labour said the public was being conned, but ministers said they had been clear about what the cap covered. The research also suggested that the majority of people - six out of seven - who end up in a home will die before they hit the cap. That is because the average length of stay in a care home is just over two years whereas it will take five years for most to reach the cap. The £150,000 figure is based on how much a person would pay if so-called hotel costs, which include accommodation, food and bills, are factored in. This will be set at £12,000 a year to start with. It also includes the higher costs individuals face when purchasing care home places compared with the price councils get, which is what will count towards the cap. As councils buy places in bulk, they are able to get cheaper deals. Figures from analysts Laing and Buisson suggest the gap is about £90 a week. According to the Labour analysis, that would mean individuals paying £610 a week for a care home place but only £292 counting towards the cap. Labour itself is not proposing to cover accommodation costs, but said it was highlighting the figures because the government was not being \\"straight\\" with the public. Shadow care minister Liz Kendall said: \\"Families deserve to be told the facts rather than being conned so they can properly plan for the future and not have the government attempt to pull the wool over their eyes.\\" Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: \\"Many older people and their families who have assumed they will benefit from the social care reforms will be shocked and disappointed to find they may not receive much help. \\"It is crucial that the public understands what costs are included under the cap and the impact the proposals will have.\\" Ministers said they had always been upfront about the accommodation costs and said one of the aims of the cap was to encourage the insurance industry to develop policies for old age that could cover much more of the fees. They also pointed out that once a person's assets - including house and savings - started to drop below £118,000 the state would start contributing towards the cost of care which would mean those people would not have to pay the full amount towards the cap anyway. This has been incorporated into the policy to protect the less well-off. What is more, they are also looking at allowing individuals to purchase care home places through their local authority to allow them to benefit from the lower rates. A Department of Health spokeswoman added: \\"The government is introducing the first ever cap on care costs so that people no longer have to live in fear of unlimited care costs. \\"Our changes will help hundreds of thousands and give peace of mind to many more.\\" What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a cap on care costs for elderly people in the UK, set to start in 2016.

You are presented with the quiz \\"The ground shakes as a result of the movement of what?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"an earthquake causes the ground to shake\\" and \\"earthquakes are caused by movement of the tectonic plates\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","output":"The tectonic plates.  The shaking of the ground can be attributed to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, whose interaction, particularly along plate boundaries, stimulates seismic activities which we perceive commonly as earthquakes.  To understand this in depth, it is important to examine the structure of the Earth's lithosphere. The Earth's outer shell or lithosphere is not a single, solid mass but is divided into several large and small pieces termed as tectonic plates. These plates include the crust and the solid, outermost part of the mantle and they float on the semi-fluid layer of the mantle known as the asthenosphere.  There are several major tectonic plates such as the Pacific Plate, North American Plate, Eurasian Plate, African Plate among others and many minor plates. These plates are always in motion but the movement is in millimeters per year, which is incredibly slow by human standards but has a massive impact over geological timescales.  The boundaries where these plates meet are often sites of seismic and volcanic activities. There are three types of plate boundaries - divergent, convergent and transform. In divergent boundaries, the plates move away from each other leading to creation of new crust as magma rises from the mantle. This can cause shallow but significant earthquakes.  Convergently, plates move towards each other and in most cases, one plate is forced or subducted under the other into the mantle where it melts. This can cause powerful earthquakes and volcanoes.  In transform boundaries, the plates slide past each other horizontally. This slide is not smooth but happens in a jerky manner which releases stored energy in the form of earthquakes. An example of a transform plate boundary is the San Andreas fault in California. So, knowing that earthquakes cause the ground to shake and the connection between earthquakes and tectonic plate movements, there is consistency in the thesis that the movement of the tectonic plates causes the ground to shake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers  drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell  along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200.  - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000.   - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success.  - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\"  - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners.  - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records .  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley.

To provide an appropriate answer to the question, we need to discuss the concept of the ground state and its relation to photons. In quantum mechanics, the ground state refers to the lowest possible energy level that a quantum system can occupy. For photons, which are particles of light and the force carriers of electromagnetic interactions, their lowest energy state depends on the specific system and the constraints at play.  Photons are massless particles and can have any energy value, depending on their frequency, following the Planck-Einstein relation: E = hf, where E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon. In a quantum system where the energy levels are quantized (having discrete values), the lowest energy state of a photon would be the energy level closest to zero that the specific system allows. An example to clarify this concept comes from a quantum system like the hydrogen atom. When an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon with energy corresponding to the difference between those two levels. The lowest energy photon emitted corresponds to the smallest possible energy transition between two adjacent levels (n=1 to n=2, the Balmer series). In conclusion, the initial statement does not adequately address the question about the lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons. The lowest energy state of photons depends on the particular system and its quantization of energy levels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have been a member with massage envy for over 4 years and never had a BAD massage.  Sure, I've had therapists that weren't my favorite but never a massage I could not wait until it was over!  Last week that was the case!  I booked an hour and half massage because work had been so stressful!  The therapist was late by about 5 minutes and then took forever to get going.  Once she got going it was seriously just like someone was lightly applying sunscreen on my back.  She would rub a few circles on my back; switch sides do the same thing, then switch back and do the same thing - for 90 minutes!  Meanwhile the whole time sighing like she hated being there!  She never did any other part of my body than the small circle rubs on my back.  It felt like time was going by so slowly all I wanted to do was leave!  I finally called back the next day and talked to the manager about this poor experience.  She assured me that this was a onetime mistake and invited me to come back in and give their location another chance.  She offered to give me a one hour massage with one of their \\"best and most requested\\" therapists free of charge.  I agreed and went back in.  I went in for my re-do last night.  First, I checked in with the receptionist who was clearly reading the notes from the manager after I called her.  She brought one of her friends in the back office out to read it as well.  At one point there were 3 people reading the notes about me calling in and complaining.  They were all talking about it which was so awkward because I was sitting 4 feet away and could hear everything!  Ten minutes after my massage was supposed to start the girl finally came and got me.  The massage itself was better, but not by much.  When she finished I thought to myself, \\"That was short\\" and then looked up at the clock.  It was still 10 minutes until 7 O'clock when my massage was supposed to be over!  So I really only got a 40ish minute massage!   I went to check out and there was a new girl at the front who made a very bratty comment of \\"was everything up to your standards this visit?\\" I said it was OK and left.  Do not waste your time or money by going to this location!  You will regret it!

This is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back, and then some, like the time you spent accidentally picking it out, the time you spent getting to the video store, etc. First off, the look: It's grainy, it's low budget. Now that in itself doesn't make for a bad film. But the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so that's kind of distracting. Then, the story. 3 gals go on a gal's weekend away from guys. Of course, as EVERYONE does when going on a camping trip, they stop on the way to get earrings. When they arrive at the area in which they're going to stay, they get pulled over by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season, and then drives them where they're going (a remote cabin). Of course, 2 \\"cute guys\\" wander into their vicinity, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately smitten, but apparently Bambi is smitten by anything with two legs. Mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh**-faced and stoned with her gal-pals. Oh, and I almost forgot, there's a mean old hermit that lives up that way, that's perhaps someone to not tangle with, and the area & cabin in which they're staying have a sort of \\"reputation\\". So of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, MUCH later) some of our weekend wood-visitors begin to die, and find various booby traps (although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that) and of course, the remaining campers are understandably upset.

First, you should begin by softening the orange. This is achieved by applying pressure to the orange. You can perform this action by using the palm of your hand to roll the orange over a flat surface like a table or a countertop. This action helps to break down the internal segments of the orange, allowing the juice to be more easily extracted later on. It's important to be gentle during this process so as not to burst the orange open.  Once the orange is softened, the next step is to slice the orange in half. It's best to perform this action on a cutting board using a sharp knife. Cut through the center of the orange from the stem end to the bottom end. This will give you two halves that are equal in size, providing an equal amount of juice. It's a good idea to make the cut as smooth as possible, to extract maximum juice from the orange. Following the slicing process, the seeds within the orange should be removed. You can achieve this by using your fingers or a small spoon to gently pick out any visible seeds from each half. Some oranges may have a large number of seeds, while others may have few or none at all. It's important to ensure the removal of the seeds so that they do not interfere with the juicing process, or end up in the final product. The final stage of the juice extraction process begins after the seeds have been removed. In this stage, the cut and de-seeded orange half should be twisted on a juicer. A juicer can either be a simple handheld tool or a more complex electronic machine. If you're using a handheld juicer, place the orange half on the juicer spike or center and press down firmly while also turning or twisting the orange back and forth. The motion forces the citrus juices from the fruit and funnels them into the groove or reservoir of the juicer.  If you're using an electronic juicer, make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions to secure the orange half in place, and then let the machine do the twisting and pressing work for you.  Continue the pressing and twisting motion until you've extracted as much juice as possible from the orange half. Repeat the process with the remaining orange half. After you have finished with both halves of the orange, you can pour the juice into a glass or pitcher. It's recommended to strain the juice through a strainer or cheesecloth to remove any remaining pulp or unwanted bits. Thus, the correct method of obtaining juice from an orange is to first soften the orange by applying pressure, cut the orange in half and remove the seeds, then twist the orange on a juicer until the juice is all out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday determined that the Islamic State group is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria, as he acted to meet a congressional deadline.      Kerry’s finding does not obligate the United States to take additional action against IS militants and does not prejudge any prosecution against its members.      Advertisement      A day after the State Department said Kerry would miss the deadline, Kerry said he had completed his review and determined that Christians, Yazidis and Shiite groups are victims of genocide and crimes against humanity by IS militants. The House earlier this week passed a nonbinding resolution by a 393-0 vote condemning IS atrocities as genocide.      ‘‘In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control’’ Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.      He outlined a litany of atrocities that he said the militants had committed against people and religious sites, as well as threats. ‘‘Daesh is genocidal by self-acclimation, by ideology and by practice.’’      Saying that he was ‘‘neither judge nor prosecutor nor jury,’’ Kerry added that any potential criminal charges against the extremists must result from an independent international investigation. Kerry said the U.S. would continue to support efforts to collect evidence and document atrocities.      While his determination does not carry such weight, Kerry said he hoped that groups he cited as being victimized would take some comfort in the fact that the ‘‘the United States recognizes and confirms the despicable nature of the crimes committed against them.’’      Advertisement      Lawmakers and others who have advocated for the finding had sharply criticized the State Department’s initial disclosure Wednesday that deadline would be missed. U.S. officials said Kerry concluded his review just hours after that announcement and that the criticism had not affected his decision.      On Thursday, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, the author of the House bill, commended Kerry’s decision.      ‘‘The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority,’’ Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. ‘‘I sincerely hope that the genocide designation will raise international consciousness, end the scandal of silence, and create the preconditions for the protection and reintegration of these ancient faith communities into their ancestral homelands. Christians, Yezidis, and others remain an essential part of the Middle East’s rich tapestry of religious and ethnic diversity.’’      Kerry’s determination marks only the second time a U.S. administration has declared that a genocide was being committed during an ongoing conflict.      The first was in 2004, when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell determined that atrocities in Sudan’s Darfur region constituted genocide.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Associated Press) FIL - In this March 9, 2016, file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry speaks to reporters at the State Department in Washington. U.S. officials say Kerry has determined that the Islamic State group... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State John Kerry has determined that the Islamic State group is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. officials, as he acted to meet a congressional deadline.      But Kerry's finding, set to be announced Thursday, will not obligate the United States to take additional action against IS militants and does not prejudge any prosecution against its members, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview Kerry's decision.      A day after the State Department said Kerry would miss the March 17 deadline, the officials said Kerry had completed his review and determined that Christians, Yazidis and Shiite groups are victims of genocide. The House this week passed a nonbinding resolution by a 393-0 vote condemning IS atrocities as genocide.      Lawmakers and others who have advocated for the finding had sharply criticized the department's disclosure Wednesday that deadline would be missed. The officials said Kerry concluded his review just hours after that announcement and that the criticism had not affected his decision.      The determination marks only the second time a U.S. administration has declared that a genocide was being committed during an ongoing conflict.      The first was in 2004, when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell determined that atrocities in Sudan's Darfur region constituted genocide. Powell reached that determination amid much lobbying from human rights groups, but only after State Department lawyers advised him that it would not — contrary to legal advice offered to previous administrations — obligate the United States to act to stop it.      In that case, the lawyers decided that the 1948 U.N. Convention against genocide did not require countries to prevent genocide from taking place outside their territory. Powell instead called for the U.N. Security Council to appoint a commission to investigate and take appropriate legal action if it agreed with the genocide determination.      The officials said Kerry's determination followed a similar finding by department lawyers.      Although the United States is involved in military strikes against IS and has helped prevent some incidents of ethnic cleansing, notably of Yazidis, some advocates argue that a genocide determination would require additional U.S. action.      In making his decision, Kerry weighed whether the militants' targeting of Christians and other minorities meets the definition of genocide, according to the U.N. Convention: \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\\"      His determination, however, does not carry the legal implication of a verdict of guilt or conviction on genocide charges, the officials said. Such decisions will be left to international or other tribunals.      In a bid to push the review process, several groups released reports last week documenting what they said is clear evidence that the legal standard has been met.      The Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians, which had applauded Monday's House resolution, said they hoped the delay would ensure that Kerry makes the determination.      \\"There is only one legal term for this, and that is genocide,\\" said Knights of Columbus chief Carl Anderson.      The groups' 280-page report identified by name more than 1,100 Christians who they said had been killed by IS. It detailed numerous instances of people kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and driven from their homes, along with the destruction of churches. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has declared that ISIS is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: WJMF-LP is a low-power television station in Jackson, Mississippi. The station, which currently operates on Channel 6, is owned by Rainey Radio. The station currently acts as a radio station broadcasting a Oldies & Classic Hits format as \\"EZ 87.7\\", taking advantage of that station's audio signal on 87.75 MHz FM. Hypothesis: WJMF-LP will play new songs on request.","output":"Although the context provided does not explicitly mention WJMF-LP playing new songs on request, we can analyze the information to infer the likelihood of such a hypothesis. The provided context mentions that WJMF-LP currently operates as a radio station under the ownership of Rainey Radio. Its programming mainly focuses on an Oldies & Classic Hits format, broadcasted as \\"EZ 87.7\\". This suggests that WJMF-LP's primary content consists of older music and hit songs, making the station's playlist predominantly focused on tracks from earlier eras. Radio stations are known to cater to their target audience's preferences and often follow a specific theme or format. WJMF-LP's focus on Oldies and Classic Hits suggests that its target audience is more interested in music from the past rather than contemporary hits or new releases. Therefore, the station's programming and content strategy might not be geared toward playing new songs, as it could potentially deviate from its established format. However, it is possible that WJMF-LP may consider playing new songs on request under certain conditions. Radio stations sometimes organize special programs or slots dedicated to listener requests, during which they might play songs outside their usual format. it would be important to know the station's policies and practices regarding listener requests during such events. Additionally, if a new song is in line with the Oldies and Classic Hits genre, the station might be more inclined to accommodate such requests. In summary, while the context does not explicitly state that WJMF-LP will play new songs on request, it does suggest that the station primarily focuses on Oldies and Classic Hits. Although the possibility of playing new songs on request cannot be entirely ruled out, it might depend on factors such as the song's alignment with the station's format, special programming events, or the station's willingness to fulfill listener requests outside of its established content strategy. To reach a solid conclusion, further research on the station's programming policies and its approach to listener requests would be required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: sharwoods curry powder Product review: I have been making curries most of my adult life. I have tried curry powders from many different sources and also made my own.

The report lists several major human rights abuses that occurred in CAR with impunity: 1. Extrajudicial executions by security forces: This refers to the unlawful and deliberate killing of individuals by security forces and law enforcement agents acting outside their legal authority. 2. Torture: The practice of inflicting physical or mental pain and suffering on detainees or prisoners, often as a means of interrogation or punishment, which is a violation of human rights and international law. 3. Beatings: The use of physical force against detainees and prisoners, often with the intent to cause pain, injury, or humiliation, violating their rights to security and dignity. 4. Rape of suspects and prisoners: The report mentions the sexual abuse, including rape, of suspects and individuals in custody, which is not only a severe violation of their rights but also a despicable crime that inflicts long-lasting emotional and physical trauma on the victims. 5. Harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons and detention centers: This refers to the substandard, unsanitary, and overcrowded conditions in which detainees and prisoners were held, leading to disease, malnutrition, and a lack of access to basic necessities like clean water and medical care. 6. Arbitrary arrest: The arrest and detention of individuals without a legitimate legal basis, violating their right to liberty and security. 7. Prolonged pretrial detention: The practice of detaining individuals for extended periods before their appearance in court, often without evidence or justification, which undermines the right to a fair and speedy trial. 8. Denial of a fair trial: The lack of access to impartial and competent judicial authorities, a fair process, or adequate representation that would ultimately lead to a just outcome. 9. Restrictions on freedom of movement: Limitations placed on the ability of citizens to travel within or outside the country as well as to choose their place of residence, impacting their fundamental rights and opportunities. 10. Official corruption: Misconduct and abuse of power by government officials for personal gain, often at the expense of citizens and the public interest. 11. Restrictions on workers' rights: Interference and limitations on the ability of workers to exercise their rights to form and join labor unions, negotiate fair working conditions, and access legal protections against unfair treatment and workplace abuses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the context provided, the EU refers to an economic and political organization consisting of 27 member countries in Europe. The core idea behind the formation of the European Union is to foster integration, collaboration, and cooperation among its members, which includes various aspects such as politics, trade, environment, culture, and digitalization, among others. In the passage described, Greece, as a member of the European Union, is compared to other EU partners in terms of internet use and digital infrastructure advancements. Throughout the years, Greece has been trying to catch up with the average EU standards in the internet and broadband penetration. The statistics reveal a significant increase in internet access, broadband connections, and a decrease in the number of people who have never used the internet. While considering the rapid growth in internet usage within Greece, it is evident that the EU's influence and policies have played an essential role in accelerating the country's digital transformation. The European Union often provides guidelines, framework, funding opportunities, and resources to support the member countries' digitalization journeys. By doing so, the EU aims at reducing disparities, promoting inclusiveness, and achieving better-connected economies and societies among its member states. Moreover, the EU emphasizes the importance of the Digital Single Market, which strives to provide equal opportunities for all EU citizens and enterprises by enforcing a borderless digital environment for various services, including internet access, e-commerce, digital business, and cybersecurity.

To isolate r, we need to move the constant term, -212, to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 212 to both sides: 0 + 212 = -53*r 212 = -53*r Step 3: Solve for r. To find the value of r, divide both sides of the equation by -53: 212 / -53 = (-53 * r) / -53 By dividing, we get: r ≈ -4 So, the solution for the given equation 0 = -53*r - 51 - 161 is r ≈ -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's factor it out: a*(623 - 630) = -7 Step 4: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses Now we will simplify the expression inside the parentheses: a*(-7) = -7 Step 5: Solve for 'a' We can now solve for 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by -7: a*(-7) / -7 = -7 / -7 a = 1 The answer is a = 1."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a \\"a).\\" movie review (Available options:  a). negative  b). positive).","output":"a). Negative movie review: Oh dear, the movie we watched wasn't very good. It was like having to eat yucky vegetables when you really want to have a yummy ice cream. The story in the movie was very hard to follow, like trying to put together a puzzle with missing pieces. The characters were not very nice, and some of them were even a little bit scary. They didn't seem to be very good friends and didn't make us want to laugh or cheer for them. The colors and the pictures in the movie were not very pretty, and sometimes it was too dark to even see what was happening, like being in a room without any lights. The music was not very fun to listen to; it was more like listening to someone playing the same note again and again on a piano for a really long time. So, overall, I don't think this is a movie we would want to watch again, like how we would not want to eat yucky vegetables again. Maybe next time we can find a better movie with a fun story and characters we can laugh with and fall in love with."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
