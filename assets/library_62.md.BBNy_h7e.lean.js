I would like to share an \\"outside the box\\" idea that I believe could positively impact our work environment. The idea I propose is a monthly team-building \\"Mystery Challenge.\\" Every month, employees would be divided into small groups and tasked with solving a mystery or completing a unique challenge created by a different department, promoting collaboration and creative problem-solving. These challenges could range from escape-room style activities to brainstorming sessions where employees invent new products or services for the company. To implement this initiative, we could designate one afternoon each month as the \\"Mystery Challenge Day.\\" The challenges can be designed by assigned department representatives, who would collaborate with HR to ensure the activities are inclusive and appropriate for the workplace. This initiative would require modest investments in resources while providing a unique and engaging opportunity for employees to connect. I believe this approach would have several benefits, including promoting camaraderie, fostering cross-departmental understanding, and stimulating creative thinking. Moreover, employees would have the opportunity to showcase their problem-solving skills in a fun and friendly environment, ultimately boosting morale. I would appreciate your thoughts and feedback on this idea. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask. I am open to exploring this further or adjusting the proposal as necessary. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, [Your Name]"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the story begins, seasoned Agent Martin Grey receives an anonymous tip hinting at Death Nell's next target: a high-ranking government official attending a prestigious international conference in New York CIty. The Agency assigns Martin and his new partner, the young and unproven Agent Hannah Banks, to locate and apprehend Death Nell before she strikes again. As the intense cat-and-mouse game unfolds, Martin and Hannah work tirelessly to put together the pieces of Death Nell's mysterious past and her modus operandi.

The sporophyte stage is a part of the life cycle of certain organisms, especially plants, that alternate between a multicellular haploid stage (the gametophyte) and a multicellular diploid stage (the sporophyte). In this life cycle, the diploid sporophyte develops from the fusion of haploid gametes, and it is during this stage that the organism grows and produces spores through meiosis. These spores then develop into the gametophyte generation, which in turn produces gametes that can fuse to form a new sporophyte.

Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  and a hint : Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Please answer this question : Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0? Answer:","output":"Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0.  This is because Group Yellow followed a normal diet, which means that they were possibly consuming an appropriate amount of calories to maintain their weight and energy needs.

According to Teman, when he returned to his apartment building he saw David in the lobby and heard him saying, 'they're shutting us down.' Asking David what that meant, Teman claims that that he look on in horror as the saw David total panic about his return. Rushing to his apartment to see it in a state of disarray, he googled David's telephone number to see what came up. The orgy, which was billed online as a 'BBW Panty Raid Party' advertized a cellphone number which matched the one provided by David in his AirBNB profile.

As such, I’m going to be evicted.' Police from the NYPD's 10th precinct were eventually called to clear the apartment. Phoning the telephone number listed online, Gawker said they spoke to David who insisted he did nothing wrong, that there was no party and that Teman has said that he could have up to 50 guests to the apartment. Anger: When Ari realized what had occurred he instantly demanded an explanation from Airbnb.

Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere: These chemicals, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are mainly released by burning fossil fuels. If less conservation occurs, it is likely that more fossil fuels will be burnt, releasing more SO2 and NOx into the atmosphere. 2. Falls onto the ground: With more chemicals in the atmosphere, a higher concentration of acid rain will fall onto the ground. 3. The acid rain starts scouring rocks: Acid rain reacts with the minerals in rocks, causing them to break down. With an increased amount of acid rain falling onto the ground, more rocks are exposed to this process, leading to a higher amount of rock scouring. 4. Destroys vegetation: Acid rain can lead to the destruction of vegetation, further exacerbating the issue of a lack of conservation. 5. The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment: With less vegetation, the environment becomes more vulnerable to the negative effects of acid rain, including soil erosion and landslides.

Well, when a car battery is dead, you can jump start it by connecting it to another car's battery. After the jump start, driving around can help recharge the dead battery. However, it might not get completely recharged, especially if it's old or has a problem. It's a good idea to use a battery charger when you get home to ensure proper charging. 2. The second question is asking how someone knows if a car battery needs to be replaced or just needs a jump start. If a car doesn't start, it could be because of a dead battery. In that case, try jump starting the car. If it starts and runs fine, then the battery might have just needed a jump start. But if this keeps happening, or the car struggles to start even after a jump, the battery might be old or damaged and needs to be replaced.

Carrie purchased her razor two years ago and has been using it consistently since then, while Patricia only bought hers a few months ago.  Step 1: Assess the context provided in the given text. In the text, we are comparing the dullness of razors owned by Carrie and Patricia. Step 2: Identify the reason for the difference in dullness between the two razors. In this case, the reason is that Carrie's razor has been in use for a longer period of time as compared to Patricia's. Step 3: Elaborate on the difference in razor usage between the two individuals. Since Carrie's razor has been in use for two years, the blade has most likely faced significant wear and tear, leading it to become dull. On the other hand, Patricia's razor is relatively newer, having been used for just a few months. Step 4: Highlight the possible consequences of the difference in razor dullness. A dull razor can lead to an ineffective and potentially uncomfortable shaving experience. This means that Carrie might not be getting as close or as smooth a shave as Patricia, and she may even experience skin irritation due to the dull blades pulling on her hair. Step 5: Suggest a solution or provide advice. To improve her shaving experience, Carrie should consider replacing her razor more frequently or opt for better quality blades that could last longer without becoming dull.

Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), there is no general federal common law. Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law, such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision, statute, or regulation (which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after). Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law, which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which county experienced more infiltration?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Dirk County experienced more infiltration as compared to Saulk County.  Dirk County was subject to heavy precipitation and a steady rainfall throughout the last month, which led to a significant amount of water infiltrating the soil. This consistent and persistent presence of rain caused the soil to become highly saturated, leading to additional problems like flooding, as described in the paragraph. The water infiltrating the soil and creating a more saturated groundwater table ultimately resulted in the aforementioned disastrous effects on the county, such as an influx of flood events and massive water infiltration. On the other hand, Saulk County experienced a few thunderstorms during the same period. Although these storms did result in some amount of runoff, the infiltration and subsequent soil saturation levels were comparatively much lower than Dirk County. The reduced number of storms and less intense rainfall allowed the soil in Saulk County to better handle the water infiltration without reaching saturation levels that would have caused widespread problems. In conclusion, Dirk County experienced a higher infiltration rate and increased soil saturation levels compared to Saulk County due to a stronger and more continuous weather phenomena. The significant difference in the intensity and duration of rainfall between the two counties is the primary factor that contributed to the notable variance in infiltration and soil saturation levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oranges are freezing and millions of tropical fish are dying in Florida, and it could be just the beginning of a decades-long deep freeze, says Professor Mojib Latif, one of the world's leading climate modelers. Latif thinks the cold snap Americans have been suffering through is only the beginning. He says we're in for 30 years of cooler temperatures -- a mini ice age, he calls it, basing his theory on an analysis of natural cycles in water temperatures in the world's oceans. Latif, a professor at the Leibniz Institute at Germany's Kiel University and an author of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, believes the lengthy cold weather is merely a pause -- a 30-years-long blip -- in the larger cycle of global warming, which postulates that temperatures will rise rapidly over the coming years. At a U.N. conference in September, Latif said that changes in ocean currents known as the North Atlantic Oscillation could dominate over manmade global warming for the next few decades. Latif said the fluctuations in these currents could also be responsible for much of the rise in global temperatures seen over the past 30 years. Latif is a key member of the UN's climate research arm, which has long promoted the concept of global warming. He told the Daily Mail that \\"a significant share of the warming we saw from 1980 to 2000 and at earlier periods in the 20th Century was due to these cycles -- perhaps as much as 50 percent.\\" The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSICD) agrees that the cold temperatures are unusual, and that the world's oceans may play a part in temperatures on land. \\"Has ocean variability contributed to variations in surface temperature? Absolutely, no one's denying that,\\" said Mark Serreze, senior research scientist with NSIDC. But the Center disagrees with Latif's conclusions, instead arguing that the cold snap is still another sign of global warming. \\"We are indeed starting to see the effects of the rise in greenhouse gases,\\" he said. Many parts of the world have been suffering through record-setting snowfalls and arctic temperatures. The Midwest saw wind chills as low as 49 degrees below zero last week, while Europe saw snows so heavy that Eurostar train service and air travel were canceled across much of the continent. In Asia, Beijing was hit by its heaviest snowfall in 60 years. And as for the cold weather? \\"This is just the roll of the dice, the natural variability inherent to the system,\\" explained Serreze. Editor's note: An earlier version of this article erroneously reported that the NSIDC reports concluded that the warming of the Earth since 1900 is due to natural oceanic cycles. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"A top scientist, Professor Mojib Latif, says that we might be entering a mini ice age that could last for 30 years. This is based on his study of natural water temperature cycles in the world's oceans.

Additionally, while Americans rally behind the notion of decisively dealing with ISIS, there remains a strong desire to avoid deploying large numbers of US ground troops, preferring a more measured approach that relies on a combination of air power, special forces, and support for local forces.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rocket does not break down happens, how will it affect fewer waves hit the coast.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To answer your question, it is important to clarify the perturbation hypothesis mentioned in your question. It seems that there is some confusion as rockets do not directly relate to the coastal process described. There must be a clear understanding of the perturbation and the potential factors to evaluate the direct or indirect effects on the process. The coastal process you described is as follows: 1. Waves hit the coast. 2. Waves have energy that pushes water and sediment. 3. The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper. 4. Water washes the sediment back. 5. Some sediment is left as sand. For the sake of providing an answer, I will make an assumption about the perturbation hypothesis. Let's assume that the perturbation is \\"fewer waves hitting the coast,\\" as this would be more relevant to the coastal process.  With the perturbation hypothesis established as \\"fewer waves hitting the coast,\\" I will now analyze the direct or indirect effect it may have on the coastal process. Effect of \\"fewer waves hitting the coast\\" on the coastal process: 1. With fewer waves hitting the coast, the overall energy transferred to the water and the sediment would be reduced. 2. This reduction in energy would slow down the movement of sediment on the coastline. 3. As a result, the rate of coastal erosion would decrease. This could potentially slow down the reshaping of the coastline. 4. With less sediment being washed back into the water, the sediment accumulation on the shoreline would decrease. This might result in a less defined beach or shoreline. 5. This decrease in the amount of sediment left as sand could lead to smaller or narrower sand deposits on the beach. From this analysis, we can conclude that the perturbation hypothesis of \\"fewer waves hitting the coast\\" does have a direct effect on the coastal process by reducing erosion, sediment movement, and sand deposition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who does Sarah kill ? the other beast A:","output":"Title: The Veiled Shadows Genre: Fantasy/Thriller Plot: In the mystical land of Elarys, humans live among magical creatures- beasts with mighty powers some benevolent, while others malevolent. Sarah, a young and prodigious huntress, belongs to the village that greatly values protecting humans from these treacherous creatures. However, deep inside her heart, Sarah possesses a hidden gift, an exceptional ability to understand and communicate with these mythical beasts. As the story unfolds, Sarah encounters a troubled duo: Kael, a beast tamer, and Lyra, a benevolent half-human half-beast on a quest to uncover a powerful relic that projects the most potent magical energy across the realms. The artifact, known as Zyfus' Orb, has been stolen by a diabolical villain, Thornstal, who desires to subvert the Orb's radiance to augment the power of a demonic creature known as 'The Other Beast.' Thornstal believes that by using the Orb, he can gain control over every beast in Elarys and instigate an era of tyranny. Upon learning of Thornstal's nefarious intentions, Sarah, Kael, and Lyra join forces to avert the impending catastrophe. Their journey is filled with testing obstacles, unexpected friendships, and epic battles, challenging not only their physical abilities but their moral compass as well. As they delve deeper into the plot, Sarah discovers her bond with the beasts runs deeper than merely communicating with them. She holds the key to decipher the ancient manuscript called 'The Chronicle of Shadows,' a text that reveals the secrets of controlling the power within the Zyfus' Orb. In the movie's climax, Sarah confronts Thornstal, who has successfully summoned and possesses control over 'The Other Beast.' The epic battle ensues, showcasing the battle between good and evil, where Sarah displays newfound abilities in tandem with the mystical beasts on their side. Despite their best efforts and an intense struggle, it becomes apparent that the only way to subdue the overpowering force of 'The Other Beast' is for Sarah to unleash her true powers and make an ultimate sacrifice. With tearful goodbyes and a heavy heart, Sarah courageously embraces the decision to use her power to exterminate 'The Other Beast' even when it means putting her life at stake. During the final encounter, Sarah's iconic kill severs the tie between Thornstal and 'The Other Beast,' destroying both antagonists. The Orb, released from the malevolent grasp, returns to a state of purity and equilibrium. In the movie's closing scenes, Sarah's selfless action is commemorated through a memorial in her village. Elarys is once again a realm filled with harmony, where humans and magical creatures coexist, forging friendships and prospering together. The legacy of Sarah's bravery transcends generations, perpetually reminding inhabitants of Elarys of love, loyalty, and the importance of understanding the world beyond the veil of shadows."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Black Cauldron Context: In the land of Prydain, Taran is an \\"assistant pig-keeper\\" on the small farm of Caer Dallben, home of Dallben the Enchanter. Dallben learns that the Horned King is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the \\"Cauldron-Born\\". Dallben fears the Horned King may try to steal his pig Hen Wen, which has oracular powers, and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by the Horned King's forces. Taran follows them to the Horned King's stronghold. Along the way, he encounters the small, pestering companion Gurgi, who joins Taran on his search. Taran leaves Gurgi to sneak into the castle and rescues Hen Wen, who flees, but all too soon he is captured himself and taken to the courtroom, found guilty and thrown into jail. A fellow captive named Princess Eilonwy frees Taran as she is trying to make her own escape. In the catacombs beneath the castle, Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king, where Taran arms himself with the king's sword. It contains magic that allows him effectively to fight the Horned King's minions and so to fulfill his dream of heroism. Along with a third prisoner, the comical, middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are soon reunited with Gurgi. Upon discovering that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his dwarf companion Creeper to send the Gwythaints to follow Taran and bring him back alive.

Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Moreover, comet A is categorized as a bright comet, but comet B is categorized as a faint comet.  and a hint : A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.  Please answer this question : Whcih comet would be visible to naked eye, comet A or comet B? A:","output":"Given the information provided, we can analyze the visibility of the comets from Earth. Comet A is described as a bright comet, while comet B is categorized as a faint comet. In the context provided, brightness is a critical factor when considering the visibility of a comet to the naked eye. Additionally, both comets A and B are said to enter the inner solar system, which further facilitates the possibility of visibility. The hint provided explains that a comet's tail and coma become visible when the comet is illuminated by the Sun. When comets enter the inner solar system, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out, allowing the formation of a tail and coma. The hint also states that most comets are too faint to be seen without a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Based on this information, it is more likely that comet A, which is described as a bright comet, would be visible to the naked eye when it enters the inner solar system. The combination of its brightness and proximity to the Sun would allow it to display a visible tail and coma, enabling those on Earth to observe it without the aid of a telescope. On the other hand, comet B, being categorized as a faint comet, may not be easily visible to the naked eye due to its lower brightness. It would likely require a telescope or other observational aid to be seen from Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"Two people enjoying a drink next to their bikes.\\" This statement tells us that there are two individuals having a drink near their bikes. It identifies what the people are doing (enjoying a drink) and where they are (next to their bikes), but it does not provide information about the context or reason for their actions.

Millicent Owuor, 20, delivered her twins, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, at a district hospital in the town of Siaya in southwest Kenya, according to Kenya’s The Standard newspaper. Owuor told reporters that she had named her twins after the winning and losing presidential candidates in order to remember the day of the election.

As the residents of the town of Siaya gathered to celebrate the birth of the twins, a local man held a bowl of traditional Kenyan porridge against a poster of Barack Obama, symbolizing the joy and pride the residents felt for the re-elected U.S. President, who has a deep connection with Kenya through his father's ancestry. The naming of the twins after the presidential candidates showed the level of interest and enthusiasm that Kenyans had in the U.S. election, as well as their admiration for Obama, as he embarked on his second term. The town of Siaya, situated in southwest Kenya, celebrated the news as local and international reporters flocked to the district hospital to cover the unique story. The Standard, a Kenyan newspaper, reported on the special event, highlighting the connection between the U.S. and Kenya through the election. Millicent Owuor, the young mother, shared her thoughts on the importance of naming her twins after the presidential candidates. She stated that she wanted to immortalize the memory of the election day for her family and the world. Despite the vast difference in the political ideologies of Obama and Romney, the twins will forever remind their mother and their community of the historical event that took place on November 6, 2012. As the news of the birth spread across the globe, many people pondered the significance of such an event, showcasing both the interconnectedness of today's world and the profound influence that the U.S. and its elections have on people and communities worldwide.

As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related films, The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939). The film centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager George Allison was given a speaking part. More recently, the book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball's Boston Red Sox.

For years, Kathy Broussard flew her single-engine Piper Cherokee across Texas, bringing critically ill patients to Houston for life-saving medical treatments. \\"I would pick up patients and drop them off ... and they would call a cab, and that was how it was done,\\" said Broussard, who was part of a group of volunteer pilots who flew in patients from all over Texas. In 1999, one of her frequent-flyer patients, Eva, called Broussard and said she wouldn't be coming in. \\"She started crying and says, 'Kathy, I don't have cab fare.' \\" Houston, Texas, is home to many medical centers, including MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the world's premier cancer treatment facilities. But cab fare from Houston's main airports to the treatment centers can range from 50 to more than 100 each way. For patients struggling financially, that expense alone can keep them from getting the treatments they need to stay alive. \\"People lose everything. They lose their cars; they lose their homes. They're living with relatives. They wouldn't have cab fare. A lot of people would just stay home and die,\\" said Broussard, 60. \\"And that's just not acceptable.\\" So Broussard started a group she called Houston Ground Angels, organizing volunteers to drive patients to and from Houston's airports and treatment centers for free. Today, driving her red pickup along Texas highways, Broussard credits Eva -- who passed away in 2001 from colon cancer -- as the inspiration for the program. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes. \\"I said, 'Eva, I'll drive you down.' I put her in my truck and went downtown. And then, all of the sudden, it just popped in my head, 'I wonder if [other people in] Houston would be interested in this?' \\" Broussard placed an ad in the Houston Chronicle calling for volunteer drivers, and the response was overwhelming. About 300 people called to sign up. At the time, Broussard was a single mother of five working full-time at an oil refinery. She spent her spare time coordinating the drivers, or \\"ground angels.\\" When pilots alerted Broussard that they were flying in a patient, she would arrange for a ground angel to meet them. \\"I was on the phone all the time. I carried a spiral notebook with all the volunteers' names and numbers in it,\\" Broussard said. Ultimately, the pilots liked the program so much that they asked to join, and the organization became the Houston Ground Angels and Pilots. Today, the group includes nearly 50 pilots and 300 drivers. Patients contact the organization to request ground transportation from a Houston airport or a flight from their regional airport. Requests are posted on the group's website, and volunteers sign up for each \\"mission.\\" Missions take place seven days a week. Rides are provided to patients who arrive into the Houston area on a commercial flight or who've been flown in to a regional airport by one of the program's pilots. The group also helps fly in patients from the Gulf Coast, Oklahoma and Arkansas by working with other volunteer flying organizations whose pilots cover part of the distance. Since 2001, the group has completed about 6,000 missions -- most of them rides, along with hundreds of flights. Broussard says many volunteers are drawn to the group because they have lost loved ones to cancer. Cathy Laflen, 62, has been relying on the group for eight years. After she was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2001, the cost of treatment crippled her financially. Unable to work, she lost her home and her car. Laflen, who lives about 4½ hours from Houston by car, was referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center but lacked the funds or transportation to get there. With the help of Broussard's team, Laflen has been able to fly into Houston and get treated. She credits the volunteers with giving her hope. \\"They've saved my life,\\" Laflen said. \\"Anytime that I need to come up here, they do it. The ground angels have everything set up. I don't have to worry. I would have died a long time ago, because they have nothing like this down where I live.\\" Patients receiving transportation from Broussard's group must submit proof of their medical need. Those requesting flights also must have a letter from their doctor saying that they need air transport and that they are well enough for it. Recently retired, Broussard is now a full-time volunteer. She and her team aim to make sure that patients coming into town for treatment travel without stress. \\"There's no worry, because there is going to be somebody that's going to fly them,\\" she said. \\"There will be somebody that will pick them up. They're not thrown to the wolves in the big Houston metropolis, of being afraid of where to go.\\" Broussard -- who has also opened her house to patients who can't afford a place to stay -- said the program hits home the most when she sees patients thriving despite being told they had a limited life expectancy. \\"They tell us all the time that they get their strength through us,\\" she said. \\"If they only knew it's the other way around.\\" Want to get involved?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango.  Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? A:","output":"Candied plums will have a higher sugar content than fresh oranges due to the preservation process involved in making candied fruit.  In the candying process, the fruit is soaked in a sugar syrup solution, absorbing sugar and becoming saturated with it. This results in significantly elevated sugar content compared to the fruit's natural state.  In contrast, fresh oranges have not been subjected to any preservation process and contain only their natural sugars. As a result, fresh oranges will have a lower sugar content compared to candied plums. Considering the nutritional values, a medium-sized fresh orange has approximately 12g of sugar, while a serving of candied plums (about 28g or 1 ounce) can contain upwards of 20g of sugar or more, depending on the specific recipe and concentration of the sugar syrup used. So, fresh oranges have a lower sugar content than candied plums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube.

Philadelphia News From CBS3 Philly      Four-month-old Journi Black is on a long road to recovery after a raccoon attacked her inside a home on the 2100 block of North 22nd Street on Wednesday night.      “It’s just ridiculous,” said Samuel Black, the girl’s father. “My daughter could have lost her life.”      Animal control officers set a trap for the raccoon to prevent this from happening again. Doctors told the family it will take at least a year for the baby to fully recover.      “My daughter was laying on the bed sleeping and I went to take my son to the bathroom. We heard a sound upstairs and we see a raccoon run down the steps,” said Ashley Rodgers, the child’s mother. “When I finally got to her, she was laying on the floor so it had dragged her off the bed, across the room, and she was bleeding and crying and her whole face was red.”      100 Million Grant Sending Sesame Street To The Middle East      It’s been mere days since Rodgers moved into the home with her daughter and 6-year-old son, Jordan.

A spokeswoman for the city’s Licenses and Inspections Department tells Eyewitness News the homeowner, who purchased the property in May, does not have a rental license and that if he is renting rooms, he is doing so illegally.      “It needs to be shut down. Everybody needs to leave out of there,” Rodgers said.      Rodgers says she contacted her landlord after the first raccoon sighting earlier in the evening, something neighbors say is common, especially with trash in the area.      “It’s terrible around here with these raccoons, yes it is,” said Barbara Butler.      Rodgers says her landlord told her he had chased the raccoon out. But after the raccoon attacked the baby, the landlord rushed her to the hospital.

Given the question: An aquatic animal requires great amounts of water to survive, and fish and other small aquatic animals can be placed in the aquarium for visual purposes. Given these facts, what do fish require to survive among the following options: - food particles  - ocean water  - salt and water.  - Getting eaten  - Heavy boots  - aerobic capacity  - Great amounts of water  - Wait staff The answer is:","output":"Great amounts of water. Fish require a suitable aquatic environment to survive and thrive, which translates to having an adequate amount of water in their habitat. Although the other options listed have some relevance within specific contexts, none are as essential as the primary requirement of water for fish survival. Let's briefly review the other options and understand why they are not as crucial: 1. Food particles: While fish do need food to survive, the question asks about the essential element among the given options that fish require. The presence of water is more fundamental than having food particles since fish cannot survive without water even if there's food available. 2. Ocean water: Although many fish species live in ocean water, not all fish require ocean water to survive. There are various species of fish that thrive in freshwater or brackish environments. 3. Salt and water: Saltwater is essential for marine fish species, but there are numerous freshwater fish that do not require salt in their water. Therefore, while salt may be necessary for a specific fish habitat, it is not universally essential. 4. Getting eaten: Fish getting eaten is not a requirement for their survival; in fact, it is quite the opposite. 5. Heavy boots: Heavy boots hold no relevance to fish survival. 6. Aerobic capacity: Although aerobic capacity refers to an organism's ability to take in, transport, and utilize oxygen efficiently, this term is not a direct requirement for fish survival. A proper aquatic environment with sufficient oxygen levels is essential, but fish have evolved various ways to extract and utilize oxygen from the water. 7. Wait staff: Wait staff is irrelevant to the survival requirements of fish. In conclusion, among all the options provided, fish require great amounts of water to survive. The aquatic environment in which they live must maintain suitable water quality, temperature, and oxygen levels for fish to thrive. Other factors like food availability, water type (freshwater, saltwater, or brackish), and specific water parameters are essential but not as universally critical as having a sufficient volume of water to create a suitable habitat for fish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who directed the spaghetti Dollar westerns","output":"The Spaghetti Westerns, also known as Italian Westerns, gained popularity in the 1960s, and the Dollar Trilogy is widely regarded as the most successful and influential series within this genre. The director behind the Dollar Trilogy, and hence the person who directed the spaghetti Dollar Westerns, was the acclaimed Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone. The Dollar Trilogy consists of the following three movies: 1. A Fistful of Dollars (1964) 2. For a Few Dollars More (1965) 3. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966) Sergio Leone was born on January 3, 1929, in Rome, Italy, and is considered one of the pioneers of the Spaghetti Western genre. His distinctive style heavily influenced many other filmmakers, and his works have garnered immense attention and admiration over the years. Leone's path towards directing began with him working as an assistant director and screenwriter in the Italian film industry alongside notable directors like Vittorio De Sica. In 1960, he directed his first feature film, The Colossus of Rhodes. However, it was his venture into the Spaghetti Western genre that truly cemented his position in cinematic history. In 1964, Leone directed A Fistful of Dollars, which starred Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name, a wandering gunslinger. The film was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Japanese samurai movie, Yojimbo (1961). A Fistful of Dollars became an international success, launching both Leone's and Eastwood's careers in the global film industry. Following the success of A Fistful of Dollars, Leone directed its sequel, For a Few Dollars More, in 1965, once again featuring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. The film also starred Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volonté. For a Few Dollars More expanded on the themes and the stylistic elements of the first film and garnered even more commercial success. In 1966, Leone directed the third film of the trilogy, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which starred Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach. The film was a critical and commercial success and is widely considered one of the greatest movies in the Western genre. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was unique for its time, as it presented a more nuanced and morally ambiguous perspective on the characters and the world they inhabited, which was a departure from the black-and-white morality prevalent in American Westerns. Sergio Leone's spaghetti Dollar Westerns have left an indelible mark on the history of cinema. His innovative storytelling techniques, unconventional cinematography, and characteristic use of music, particularly in collaboration with composer Ennio Morricone, transformed the Western genre and continue to influence modern filmmakers. Leone passed away on April 30, 1989, leaving behind a rich and unforgettable cinematic legacy."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

Dr Owen was an internationally renowned artist – mixing photography and printmaking – and at the same time a scholar in medieval Italian literature. As Retained Lecturer, she used to teach Dante’s Divine Comedy to Pembroke’s finalists in Italian.      Dr Owen’s parallel passion for art and literature was already established in her university years at Exeter, where she studied Italian and Fine Art. She then moved to Royal Holloway, London, where she completed a PhD on the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy.      Each year, her Pembroke students enjoyed the pleasure and the privilege of a guided tour through the manuscripts of the Divine Comedy held at the Bodleian Library.

Owen continued to teach into her last months despite her ailing health.      Yorke and Owen led a very private life, and were rarely seen together in public. However, fans believe that the lyrics and video for Daydreaming, a single from A Moon Shaped Pool, made reference to the impact of the end of their relationship on Yorke. The repeated phrase \\"half of my life\\" is believed to refer to the time the then-47-year-old had spent with Owen. ||||| \\"Daydreaming\\" lyrics      RADIOHEAD LYRICS      Dreamers      They never learn      They never learn      Beyond the point      Of no return      Of no return            And it's too late      The damage is done      The damage is done            This goes      Beyond me      Beyond you      The white room      By window      Where the sun goes      Through            We are      Just happy to serve      Just happy to serve      You            efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH            efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      efil ym fo flaH      Visit www.azlyrics.com for these lyrics.

She used to be the partner of Thom Yorke, a singer from the band Radiohead, and they have two children together. Sadly, she got sick with cancer and has died at the age of 48. Thom wrote some songs on Radiohead's latest album that were about their break-up. Rachel was a brave lady because she continued teaching even though she was sick, and her last art project will be shown at the college where she worked."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cristiano Ronaldo has once again trained for Portugal ahead of their Group G clash with USA on Sunday - despite being warned that he risks his career by playing on at the World Cup. The 29-year-old Real Madrid forward has been struggling with a knee injury and doctors have told him that he could shorten his career by playing for Portugal in the short-term. However, Ronaldo seems determined to star for his country in Brazil and showed few signs of his injury during training on Friday.

Q:Information:  - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used.  - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Commuter rail, also called suburban rail, is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates between a city centre, and the middle to outer suburbs beyond 15 km (10 miles) and commuter towns or other locations that draw large numbers of commuterspeople who travel on a daily basis. Trains operate following a schedule, at speeds varying from 50 to 200 km/h (30 to 125 mph). Distance charges or zone pricing may be used.  - Shosholoza Meyl is a division of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) that operates long-distance (intercity) passenger rail services. It operates various train routes across South Africa, carrying approximately 4 million passengers annually. Before 2009, Shosholoza Meyl was a division of Spoornet, but it was transferred after the formation of PRASA.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa.

It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies?  Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

However, we should consider the context and supporting evidence before drawing a final conclusion. In the premise, the speaker discusses feeling stiff and uncomfortable while wearing a suit, which seems to hinder their ability to work on writing training material. Also, they mentioned that they prefer to be more comfortable while working unless there is a customer meeting later during the day. This suggests that, without the constraints of formal attire, the speaker would be more at ease and better positioned to focus on their work. To support the hypothesis, we can consider the following points: 1. Comfort and productivity: Numerous studies have shown that comfort is important for productivity in the workplace. If the speaker is more comfortable while working on training material, it is likely they can produce better quality work and complete tasks more efficiently. 2. Dress code: The premise suggests that the speaker's comfort level is impacted by their attire, specifically when wearing a suit. It is reasonable to assume that if the speaker is allowed to dress more casually when working on training material, their comfort and productivity will increase. 3. Physical environment: Apart from clothing, other aspects of the physical environment can influence a person's comfort level, such as ergonomic furniture, lighting, and temperature. It would be beneficial to explore if any of these factors contribute to the speaker's comfort while working on training material. 4. Work schedule and meetings: The speaker mentions that needing to meet with a customer later in the day influences their attire and comfort. It may be valuable to assess if adjusting the work schedule or separating tasks requiring formal attire from those related to creating training materials can improve the speaker's comfort. While the hypothesis appears to be true based on the provided premise, it is important to consider additional factors that may impact the speaker's comfort and productivity while working on training material. By examining the factors mentioned above, we can better assess the overall validity of the hypothesis and identify ways to support the speaker's comfort during their work process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.  But I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  What is an answer for this question: Which test would need higher temperature, case A or case B? A:","output":"Case A would need a higher temperature because it involves changing the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. Polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the additional energy needed to break the hydrogen bonds and allow the molecules to move apart from one another."},{"instruction":"Q:Process: - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left -   Question: suppose more erosion occurs happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER ravines forming.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"A: more"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea and its neighbors in the region reacted with caution to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision Thursday to cancel the U.S.- North Korea nuclear summit. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement released by the North’s central news agency (KCNA) that his country remains open to resolving problems with the United States “whenever and however,” and offered praise for President Trump’s diplomatic engagement efforts. “We had held in high regards President Trump’s efforts, unprecedented by any other president, to create a historic North Korea-U.S. summit,” said the vice foreign minister in a statement released Friday by KCNA. The conciliatory tone that came from Vice Foreign Minister Kim stands in sharp contrast to earlier criticisms, insults and threats made by another North Korean official that prompted Trump to cancel the June summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Thursday North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui called U.S. Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” and threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the U.S. over comments made by Pence calling for North Korea to follow the Libya denuclearization model. The Libya model refers to the rapid and complete dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program in 2003 and 2004, before the easing of any sanctions. But North Korea is acutely aware that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by his own people a few years later, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the United States. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until its undefined security demands are met. Trump blamed the “tremendous anger and open hostility” from Pyongyang for forcing the cancelation of the summit, but many analysts say the issue was more about substance over tone and the unbridgeable gap between the two denuclearization positions. But... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is the U.S. trying to obtain from North Korea? Options:  A. an end to any diplomatic effort  B. a nuclear showdown  C. denuclearization  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"C. denuclearization Justification: The text states that Vice President Mike Pence called for North Korea to follow the \\"Libya denuclearization model.\\" This indicates that the U.S. is attempting to obtain denuclearization from North Korea. Furthermore, the text details how North Korea has responded to these calls, indicating that the topic of denuclearization is a central issue between the two countries.

Given the question: Background: During the 1670s, the Dutch tradesman Antony van Leeuwenhoek, shown in Figure below , used microscopes to observe many microbes and body cells. Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker. Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoek’s time.  Paragraph: John is interested in the history of science. He went to a science museum to learn more about microscopes.

Background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

In which American state does Coca-Cola have its headquarters????","output":"Coca-Cola, one of the world's most iconic beverage companies, has its headquarters in the state of Georgia, specifically in the city of Atlanta. The history of Coca-Cola dates back to 1886 when a pharmacist named John Stith Pemberton formulated the original Coca-Cola syrup and sold it at the Jacobs' Pharmacy soda fountain. Dr. Pemberton's bookkeeper, Frank Robinson, was the one who came up with the name \\"Coca-Cola\\" and also designed the distinctive script logo that we still recognize today. The beverage quickly gained popularity, and Asa Griggs Candler, another Atlanta pharmacist and businessman, acquired the formula and the rights to the Coca-Cola brand in 1888. Candler officially founded The Coca-Cola Company in 1892. Under his leadership, the company continued to grow and started its global reach. The 20th century saw Coca-Cola becoming a symbol of American culture and a highly successful brand. Today, the company is a multinational corporation that offers a wide range of beverages, including soft drinks, juices, and bottled water. The headquarters, located at One Coca-Cola Plaza, Atlanta, Georgia, is home to the company's executive leadership and various departments that drive its business operations. Among these are marketing, research and development, human resources, and finance. Atlanta's role as a transportation and business hub in the southeastern United States made it a strategic location for Coca-Cola's headquarters, allowing for efficient production, distribution, and expansion over the years.

The rise of the Amorite kingdoms in Mesopotamia brought about deep and lasting repercussions in its political, social and economic structure, especially in southern Mesopotamia.  The division into kingdoms replaced the Babylonian city-states in southern Mesopotamia. Men, land and cattle ceased to belong physically to the gods or to the temples and the king. The new Amorite monarchs gave or let out for an indefinite period numerous parcels of royal or sacerdotal land, freed the inhabitants of several cities from taxes and forced labour, which seems to have encouraged a new society to emerge: a society of big farmers, free citizens and enterprising merchants, which was to last throughout the ages. The priest assumed the service of the gods and cared for the welfare of his subjects, but the economic life of the country was no longer exclusively (or almost exclusively) in their hands.  In general terms, Mesopotamian civilization survived the arrival of Amorites, as the indigenous Babylonian civilisation had survived the short period of Gutian dynasty of Sumer's domination of the south during the restless period after the fall of the Akkadian Empire that had preceded the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur (the \\"Neo-Sumerian Empire\\"). The religious, ethical, technological, scientific and artistic directions in which Mesopotamia had been developing since the 4th millennium BC were not greatly affected by the Amorites' hegemony. They continued to worship the Sumero-Akkadian gods, and the older Sumerian myths and epic tales were piously copied, translated, or adapted, generally with only minor alterations. As for the scarce artistic production of the period, there is little to distinguish it from the preceding Ur III era.  The era of the Amorite kingdoms, c. 2000 - 1595 BC, is sometimes known as the \\"Amorite period\\" in Mesopotamian history. The principal Amorite dynasties arose in Mari, Yamhad, Qatna, fairly briefly in Assyria (under Shamshi-Adad I), Isin, Larsa and Babylon.  Babylon, originally a minor state at its founding in 1894 BC, became briefly the major power in the ancient world during the reign of Hammurabi in the first part of the 18th century BC, and it was from then that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia, the north long before it evolved into Assyria.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? merely pretentious --","output":"The phrase \\"merely pretentious\\" can be considered as having a negative connotation for various reasons. To understand the negativity behind this phrase, one must first analyze both \\"merely\\" and \\"pretentious\\" separately and then examine their combined meaning. “Merely” is an adverb that is usually employed to downplay the importance or significance of something. It can be used to indicate that the subject matter is of little consequence, unimportant, or negligible, often creating a sense of unworthiness or insignificance. In this case, merely serves as a minimizer, diminishing the value of what comes after it. \\"Pretentious,\\" on the other hand, is an adjective that describes a person or situation that displays an exaggerated sense of importance or worth, often with the intent of impressing others. Pretentiousness is commonly seen as a negative trait because it implies a kind of dishonesty or lack of authenticity. This term is often used in situations where someone tries to appear more knowledgeable, cultured, or sophisticated than they genuinely are for the sake of impressing others or appearing superior. When we combine these two words into the phrase \\"merely pretentious,\\" the negative connotations are quite evident. It suggests that whatever is being referred to not only lacks real value or importance (due to the use of \\"merely\\"), but also tries to give off a false impression of worth (through the use of \\"pretentious\\"). This phrase implies that the object or person in question is superficial, insincere, and of limited value due to their pretentious nature. To put it into context, if a movie or a piece of art is described as \\"merely pretentious,\\" it means that it not only fails to live up to its potential or promises but is also overtly attempting to appear more intellectual or significant than it actually is. This double blow of superficiality and dishonesty makes the phrase \\"merely pretentious\\" decidedly negative. In summary, the phrase \\"merely pretentious\\" carries a negative connotation, primarily due to the combined effect of the words \\"merely\\" and \\"pretentious.\\" It suggests a situation or person that is inauthentic, insincere, and of little value, qualities that are generally perceived unfavorably in most contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing.

US director William Friedkin speaks on May 18, 2016 during \\"La Lecon de Cinema\\", a masterclass at the 69th Cannes Film Festival (AFP Photo/Anne-Christine Poujoulat)      Cannes (France) (AFP) - William Friedkin, the director of the horror classic \\"The Exorcist\\", has revealed that he was allowed to film a real exorcism at the Vatican earlier this month.      The 80-year-old American filmmaker told a masterclass at the Cannes film festival late Thursday that he was invited by Rome's exorcist to record the event.      \\"I was invited by the Vatican exorcist to shoot and video an actual exorcism which... few people have ever seen and which nobody has ever photographed,\\" he said.      Friedkin said he was taken aback at how close the ceremony was to the exorcism depicted in his 1973 film.      \\"I was pretty astonished by that. I don't think I will ever be the same having seen this astonishing thing.      \\"I am not talking about some cult, I am talking about an exorcism by the Catholic Church in Rome,\\" he added.      But the Vatican denied \\"making any such invitation. The Vatican (itself) does not have an exorcist,\\" a spokesman told AFP.      Each Catholic diocese has an exorcist and papal universities regularly organise training for the exorcism.      \\"People often confuse any Catholic initiative/organisation/person with the Vatican. Perhaps this is the case here,\\" he added.      The director said he intended to shoot \\"The Exorcist\\" -- based on a bestselling novel by William Peter Blatty -- as a horror movie, but the more he learned the more it became a story of the supernatural instead.      While the book was based on the 1949 case of an American teenager called Roland, Friedkin said the Catholic \\"archdiocese of Washington DC asked Blatty to change the gender (in the novel) so as not to draw attention to the young man.\\"      - Demonic possession -      But in reality, the director said, \\"it was a young man of 14 years, not a girl\\" who was allegedly possessed.      The film recounts the demonic possession of a 12-year-old girl and her mother's attempts to win her back through a rite conducted by two priests.      Friedkin said he believed the boy was genuinely possessed. \\"I'm convinced that there was no other explanation. I read the diaries not only of the priest involved (in the exorcism), but the doctors, the nurses and the patients at Alexian Brothers Hospital in Saint Louis where this case was carried out,\\" he added.      \\"Everything having to do with medical science and psychiatry was attempted. This young men suffered from afflictions very similar to what's in the film, as hard is that is to believe.\\"      The exorcism scenes in the film has been repeatedly voted among some of the scariest ever shown in cinemas.      \\"When I started I thought I was making a horror film and then the priest, who was the president of Georgetown University (in Washington DC), let me read these diaries and I knew that it was not a horror film,\\" Friedkin said. \\"This was a case of exorcism.\\"      - 'I believed' -      \\"I believed in this story,\\" Friedkin told the audience in Cannes, referring to the original possession of the boy. \\"I made this story as a believer. I'm not Catholic, I don't go to church, I don't belong to a church or a synagogue.      \\"I do believe in the teachings of Jesus,\\" Friedkin added, whose parents were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine.      \\"I believe they are incredibly profound and beautiful and we know that this character existed... the supernatural aspect I leave to each person's conscience and belief system,\\" he added.      \\"I don't intend to join a church and yet what amazes me... is the fact that this man (Jesus) over 2,000 years ago preached in the desert, on street corners and in synagogues and there is no recording of his voice... yet billions of people have believed in the idea of Jesus Christ.      \\"There must be something in there,\\" said Friedkin, who also made \\"The French Connection\\", and was with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich one of the leaders of the \\"New Hollywood\\" group of filmmakers in the early 1970s. |||||       (The Exorcist/Fox Broadcasting Co.)      William Friedkin, acclaimed director of “The Exorcist,” says he’s now seen the real thing — and filmed it.      Talking to an audience at the Cannes Film Festival in France on Thursday, the 80-year-old filmmaker said that the Vatican invited him to film an exorcism earlier in May. The version he constructed for the 1973 supernatural horror film, Friedkin added, was not that far from the actual rite he recently documented.      “I don’t think I will ever be the same having seen this astonishing thing,” he said, according to Agence France-Presse. “I am not talking about some cult, I am talking about an exorcism by the Catholic Church in Rome.”      A representative for the Vatican countered the claim that it had invited Friedkin, noting that it currently does not have an official exorcist. However, the spokesman told the AFP that it is possible Friedkin was confusing another Catholic initiative with the Vatican.      That’s not to say the Catholic Church lacks exorcists. In 1999, the church updated its manual on exorcisms: De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam, or Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications. It was, perhaps, overdue — its predecessor had been written in 1614.      The recent revision emphasizes that exorcists must first rule that possession is not mental illness, through medical and psychiatric evaluation. De Exorcismis also opines that media coverage and other spectacle be eschewed. According to Friedkin, “nobody has ever photographed” an official exorcism, making his purported documentation of the event all the more momentous.      De Exorcismis, of course, still refers to devils and a sentient Satan on the hunt for souls. As Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez said in a presentation in 1999, however, it has “more sober language, with fewer adjectives than in the previous one,” according to the Guardian.      [An exorcist told us how to rid Ted Cruz of Lucifer, just in case John Boehner is right]      Official exorcisms are few and far between. But demand for exorcisms, to hear the Church tell it, jumped in the latter half of the last century and picked up steam toward its end. By 2004, Pope John Paul II called for every bishop to have an exorcist in his diocese. Ten years later, the Vatican officially recognized the 250-strong International Association of Exorcists. And by 2015, the Catholic Register reported that the “once dying trade” now claims over 100 North American members.      Exorcist and Toronto priest Gary Thomas, who told the Register he’d performed about a dozen exorcisms in the past decade, says exorcisms have drama, though they are not a “Ghostbusters”-style race to the scene. “Some of what you would see in a movie, some of it is accurate and some of it is not.” But spectacle is not the point, he noted at Vice — the ministry of exorcism is an exercise in healing.      Pope Francis has been a frequent and outspoken critic of Satan, also stoking support for exorcisms. “Pope Francis never stops talking about the Devil; it’s constant,” an anonymous bishop told the Washington Post in 2014. Catholic critics say Francis is catalyzing superstition within the Church; others, like Thomas, argue that it’s a reaction to growing evil influences. “Society is becoming rapidly more pagan,” as the exorcist said to the Register.      Friedkin is not Catholic but says he believes in Jesus’s teachings. He also believes in the validity of the exorcism at Saint Louis University that served as a basis for his movie.      “When I started I thought I was making a horror film and then the priest, who was the president of Georgetown University (in Washington DC), let me read these diaries and I knew that it was not a horror film,” Friedkin said, according to AFP. “This was a case of exorcism.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"William Friedkin, the director of the famous horror movie \\"The Exorcist\\", recently said that he was allowed to film a real exorcism at the Vatican.

I’ve admitted to drinking too much, OK? so I’m dealing with it. I am training every day. I’m in the gym for two hours every day. I’m seeking professional help,' he said. 'I’m not an alcoholic. I’m not a drug addict.' Ford has remained defiant despite an increasingly-embarrassing list of public statements and admissions about bad behavior. Most recently, he made crude comments about his sex life with his wife - while she was standing with him. He was attempting to dismiss allegations that he had propositioned a female staffer for oral sex. He was wearing a jersey for his beloved Toronto Argonauts at the time - a custom shirt that reads 'Major Ford' on the back. Taunted: A woman holds a sign mocking the rival team's city mayor Rob Ford who was in the crowd watching the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats in Toronto. Spectacle: Rob Ford's appearance Sunday was greeted with significant attention - and some amount of bemusement by football fans. That prompted Argonauts CEO Chris Rudge to call Ford's ongoing calamities 'an unfortunate situation for the city.' CFL Commissioner Mark Cohon asked that Ford to stay away from Sunday's Eastern. Conference final between the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He ignored the calls and Sunday afternoon, shortly after halftime, he took a seat a seat about 20 rows back from the field. His arrival caused a stir in Section 129 of the Rogers Centre, with fans clogging the aisle as they snapped photos and exchanged handshakes with the mayor who recently has acknowledged smoking crack cocaine and drinking excessively. Mocking: A Hamilton Tiger Cats fan holds a cut out poster of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's head during the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats in Toronto. Wearing a dark blue Argonauts jersey with 'Mayor Ford' and the number 12 across the back, Ford laughed and drew cheers as he held aloft a crudely constructed replica of the Grey Cup, Canadian football's championship trophy. Outside the downtown stadium before kickoff, fans of both teams said Ford should stay away from the game. 'He needs to take some time off and get help,' said Bob Walker, dressed in an Argonauts baseball cap and jacket. The city council is seeking to strip the mayor of nearly all of his powers tomorrow. Today he celebrated at football. 'It's definitely a distraction... He means well, he's done well for the city. It's just, it's enough, you know? We need to get on with the city and take his business somewhere else for a bit.' Hamilton fan Shawn Kowalyshyn, wearing a Tiger-Cats jersey, said the mayor has 'embarrassed' himself and his family. 'Unfortunately, I'd like to support him and his policies, but he's just gone too far over the top. ... It's gotten too ridiculous,' Kowalyshyn said. Brothers Kyle and Matt O'Connor of Hamilton held up a hand-lettered sign reading 'Our Mayor Doesn't Smoke Crack!!' as they lined up to wait for stadium gates to open. Earlier Sunday, the 44-year-old Ford was spotted outside the downtown studios of the tabloid Sun News Network, where he and brother Doug, a Toronto city councilor, were taping the first episode of their new current events television show, 'Ford Nation,' which is to air Monday night. Working up a sweat: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford mops his brow as he watches the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats. Meet and greet: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford gets close to a fan of the opposition. Recently released court documents show Ford became the subject of a police investigation after news reports surfaced in May that he had been caught on video smoking crack cocaine. In interviews with police, former staffers accused the mayor of frequently drinking, driving while intoxicated and making sexual advances toward a female staffer. Ford's erratic behavior was parodied in the opening segment of the U.S. comedy show 'Saturday Night Live,' with cast member Bobby Moynihan portraying the mayor who at one point ducks behind the lectern at a press conference to do a drug deal, exclaiming, 'Wow, that's a lot of crack.' Ford finally decides he needs to go on a TV show which would believe him, and then is shown being interviewed by CBS '60 Minutes' correspondent Lara Logan (Kate McKinnon) who accepts his denials that he did crack, smoked marijuana and used alcohol. Logan recently had to apologize on-air for a '60 Minutes' story about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, saying the network could no longer trust the testimony of a former security contractor who had claimed he was present during the attack.","output":"The Mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, has said that he is getting help for his emotional problems, but insists that he is not an addict and doesn't need drug treatment. He admitted to using illegal drugs and drinking too much in the past year, but denies being an alcoholic or a drug addict. The Toronto City Council is trying to take away some of the mayor's powers because of his behavior. Mr. Ford attended a football game to support his team, the Toronto Argonauts, even though some people did not want him there. Some fans at the game think he should take a break from being mayor and get help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Dr. Eric Zinthrop  for the following movie plot:  In Hill's prologue, a scientist, Dr. Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark), is fired from his job at a honey farm for experimenting with wasps. The founder and owner of a large cosmetics company, Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), is disturbed when her firm's sales begin to drop after it becomes apparent to her customer base that she is aging. Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the royal jelly of the queen wasp that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care. Janice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature. Eventually, Zinthrop throws a jar of carbolic acid at her face, and another character uses a chair to push her out of a window, killing her.

Add spaces: Howtomakekeyloggerundectectablebyanti-virus","output":"Creating a keylogger that is undetectable by anti-virus programs is a sensitive topic as it deals with questionable activities such as invading someone's privacy or potentially illegal activities. It's important to note that discussing ways to evade antivirus detection can be considered illegal and unethical. But if we considered discussing it only from a purely educational perspective and to be aware of such threats for personal cybersecurity, here is a more appropriate way to parse the sentence you've given: \\"How to make a keylogger undetectable by anti-virus\\".  Now, breaking this down: 1. How: This indicates a question is being asked for a method or instructions. 2. to make: These words together signal that someone wants to create or produce something. 3. a keylogger: This is a piece of software or hardware that records keyboard input without the knowledge of the user. 4. undetectable: This signifies something hidden or not visible. 5. by anti-virus: This term refers to a program designed to protect a computer system from various types of malware, such as viruses, trojans, etc. In this context, it suggests trying to make a keylogger that can avoid these defense systems. So the context of this text deals with developing a piece of malware (a keylogger) in such a way that it would not be picked up by conventional anti-virus software. Overall, it's extremely important to remember that creating such a tool for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. Proper online behavior, respect for others' privacy, and adherence to laws is paramount. This kind of conversation is important in understanding the length and breadth of cybersecurity threats that exist, which in turn can help in building stronger defenses and promoting safe, ethical digital practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the establishment, including the food quality, cleanliness, and hygiene. Here are some key points that support this negative review: 1. The reviewer expresses surprise at the good reviews they have seen for the place, implying that their experience did not meet the expectations set by the positive feedback others had given. 2. The reviewer uses strong language to describe their experience, such as \\"absolutely disgusting\\" and \\"horrid\\", which clearly indicates their dissatisfaction. 3. The food quality is described as poor, with the food being bland and potentially stale, as it tasted like it had been sitting for a couple of days. This is an important aspect of any dining experience and contributes significantly to the negative review. 4. The cleanliness and hygiene of the establishment are also highlighted as an issue. The owner was observed picking their ear, an unhygienic and unappetizing action, especially in a food service setting. 5. The reviewer also mentions that everyone in their party felt sick after eating at the establishment, further indicating that the food was not just poorly prepared but also potentially unsafe for consumption. 6.

Article:New legislation in the Queen's Speech will mean that the amount workers are allowed to earn before paying tax is likely to rise faster than inflation. The national minimum wage for adults is due to rise by 3% in October, the largest real-terms rise in seven years. Chancellor George Osborne has said it will rise from £6.50 to £8 by 2020. The personal allowance is currently £10,600, but is due to rise to £12,500 by 2020. As a result, the government is promising that no one working for 30 hours a week on the national minimum wage will pay tax. At the moment, an adult working for 48 weeks a year at that rate earns £9,360, so is below the tax threshold.

It is also expected that the increases will feed through to the higher rate tax threshold, suggesting that the higher rate could also rise faster than inflation. That will benefit workers who currently earn more than £42,385 a year. Such taxpayers have been affected by so-called fiscal drag, under which more people were dragged into a higher tax bracket, as the allowance failed to be uprated in line with inflation.

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

(447 - 407)*w = 40w So, our equation now looks like: 40*w - 600 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable (w) To isolate w, we need to get rid of the -600 on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 600 to both sides. 40*w = 600 Step 3: Solve for w To find the value of w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 40. w = 600 / 40 w = 15 So the solution to the equation is w = 15."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Make use of the article to answer the questions. Approximants are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence. This class of sounds includes lateral approximants like (as in \\"less\\"), non-lateral approximants like (as in \\"rest\\"), and semivowels like and (as in \\"yes\\" and \\"west\\", respectively).  Before Peter Ladefoged coined the term \\"approximant\\" in the 1960s, the term \\"frictionless continuant\\" referred to non-lateral approximants.  Some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms \\"semivowel\\" and \\"glide\\" are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels.  Vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with Indo-European ablaut. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel. A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, remarks that, for example, the final glides of English \\"par\\" and \\"buy\\" differ from French \\"par\\" ('through') and \\"baille\\" ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the syllable coda, whereas, in the former, they appear in the syllable nucleus. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like Italian (with the i-like sound of \\"piede\\" 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: , and that of \\"piano\\" 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: ) and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being \\"abyecto\\" 'abject' and \\"abierto\\" 'opened'). 1.

Write an article based on this \\"President-elect Donald Trump might come as a shock to many Americans - but for the 600 million people of South East Asia the reaction could well be: \\"Seen it all before.\\"\\" Article:","output":"Title: South East Asia's Familiarity with Trump-Like Leadership: A Closer Look Introduction In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential elections, President-elect Donald Trump's victory was met with a range of reactions from around the world. While a significant number of Americans were left shocked and concerned about the future of their country, over 600 million people of South East Asia had a different outlook, feeling a sense of déjà vu with the seemingly novel rise of Trump to power. Indeed, South East Asia has seen political figures similar to Trump in both ideology and leadership style that make his election unsurprising for them. This article aims to explore these striking resemblances and analyze why Trump's presidency feels so familiar to the people of South East Asia. Step 1: Identifying Trump-esque characteristics To truly understand why South East Asians feel like they've seen it all before when discussing Trump, we must first break down the key characteristics that define the US president-elect. Among them are his controversial statements, hard-line policies, volatile temperament, and the overarching belief in nationalist ideals. Step 2: Drawing parallels with South East Asian leaders With these characteristics in mind, it is clear to see how Trump's rise in politics mirrors that of several South East Asian leaders. For instance, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, known for his contentious policies and unpresidential demeanor, shares a similar set of qualities with Trump. Duterte made headlines for his brutal war on drugs, which has resulted in extrajudicial killings, as well as for his inflammatory remarks. In Indonesia, the election of President Joko Widodo was seen as a populist triumph, much like Trump's election. Widodo, a businessman who challenged the political establishment, rose from humble beginnings to become the leader of the world's third largest democracy. His focus on improving infrastructure and standing up to foreign powers resonates with Trump's \\"America First\\" policy. Another example can be seen in Malaysia, where former Prime Minister Najib Razak, was surrounded by corruption allegations, demonstrating the narrative of a businessman-like leader enmeshed in scandal - similar to Trump's own history of legal woes. Step 3: Analyzing South East Asia's familiarity with populist sentiment Throughout the years, South East Asia has faced multiple examples of populist sentiments taking root in the political sphere. The rise of authoritarian leaders in the region has historically been fueled by nationalist ideology and anti-establishment feelings, many of which are echoed in the United States through Trump's populist agenda. This familiarity with populist leaders and the disillusionment with traditional politics could explain why South East Asians are less shocked than others by Trump's election as president of the United States. Conclusion Ultimately, the key elements that define President-elect Trump's controversial character and political approach have been evident in various South East Asian leaders in recent years. From Duterte's strongman tactics to Widodo's populist appeal, South East Asian citizens have already seen and experienced a variety of leaders who mirror Trump's brash persona and nationalistic policies. As a result, the people of South East Asia may view Trump's presidency as less of a surprise and more of a continuation of a global political trend that they have already witnessed firsthand in their own region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, the subject 'The NBA' is performing an action - refusing to write up a new compromise with 'them' (which, again as per common syntax rules, refers to 'players' as it is used right after mentioning 'players'). Therefore, in this context, 'they' shows the entity that is refusing to draft a new compromise, which is 'The NBA'.

Options: - report for duty - wait for orders - fight for freedom - obay - receive orders  The answer is \\"report for duty\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"report for duty\\" because when a soldier is called back to active service, it typically means that they need to physically return to their assigned military base or post and check in with their commanding officers. At this point, the soldier will receive further instructions, briefings, and potentially undergo additional training or preparations depending on the specific requirements of their new assignment. The other options may be involved in the process but are not the immediate action the soldier needs to take. They are: - \\"Wait for orders\\": This may happen after reporting for duty, as a soldier will then be given specific instructions regarding their assignment or mission. - \\"Fight for freedom\\": While this phrase often inspires the purpose of military service, it does not specifically describe the action to be taken when called back to active service. - \\"Obey\\": This is a general characteristic expected of military personnel, but does not directly answer the question of what a soldier must do when called back to active service. - \\"Receive orders\\": This may also happen after reporting for duty, as the soldier is then given instructions about their specific assignment or mission.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that created the G minor Piano Sonata?  By the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist. Answer:","output":"The person who created the G minor Piano Sonata is Bedřich Smetana. He composed the sonata during his years of studying theory and composition under Josef Proksch while working as a music teacher for Count Thun's family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are a variety of speed test sites on the net, just search for \\"speed test\\" in Google and pick the top few results.  Different tests will give you different results. Even the same test may give you different results between tests. This is due to the location of test servers and the number of people sharing your connection. Take multiple tests and find the average speed you are getting. You may need to have Flash installed to run the test. If given the option, pick the test server closest to your physical location. This will help get you the most accurate results (on speedtest.net, this is chosen automatically based on ping) Check with your service provider to see what speeds you should be getting. Keep in mind that speeds advertised by your provider are \\"best case\\" speeds, and you may not be able to actually get that number on a regular basis, especially if using WiFi.  If you haven't upgraded your internet in a long time, you may be able to get better speeds for less money. Companies aren't usually keen to inform you of better deals, so check to see if new services are available that weren't when you signed up. Check with all the providers in your area. Be aware of the megabyte/megabit difference. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) advertise in megabits, not megabytes. There are 8 megabits (Mb) in a megabyte (MB), so if you are paying for 25 megabits per second (Mbps), then that's just over 3 megabytes per second (MBps) of actual maximum transfer speed. If your test result was measured in Kbps, then you divide that number by 1000 to attain your measurement in Mbps. Restarting your modem and router can help alleviate some network issues by cleaning up old data and re-provisioning your modem configuration from your internet service provider. If necessary, your modem will automatically download firmware updates from the ISP. See this guide for details on resetting your network. If you are using a wireless router, some devices can affect your connection due to interference. Wireless routers come in multiple varieties; 802.11 b, g, and n (2.4 GHz) or 802.11 a (5.8 GHz). Common devices that can interfere with your wireless connection are microwaves and cell phones, many of which operate in the 2.4 GHz range. In order to minimize interference, turn off data on your phone and move your microwave oven away from wireless devices and your router when you're using the connection. Sometimes you just have a bad connection that can only be fixed on your provider's end.

If necessary, they will send a line technician out to your house or neighborhood to check their infrastructure. If the problem is on your end, you might be charged a fee for the visit, so it's important to try troubleshooting over the phone or internet first. If you are connected to the internet via a Wi-Fi router, poor signal can lead to lower speeds and dropped connections. Move your router closer to your computer if possible, or move the computer so that it is closer to the router or keep the router on top of a cupboard to transmit better signal.

It is best to confine start your cat in one room of your house, particularly if it is a kitten. Be sure to put its litter box, food, and water dishes in the room.","output":"Caring for American Longhair cats involves several aspects such as grooming, diet, healthcare, and giving them a suitable environment. It's essential to give your cat the proper attention and resources it needs to ensure its health and happiness in your home. 1. Grooming: American Longhair cats have a thick, lustrous coat that needs regular grooming to prevent matting, knots, and to keep them looking their best. You should brush your cat's coat at least 2-3 times a week using a high-quality brush or comb that's designed for long-haired cats. This will help remove loose hair, dirt, and dead skin cells, as well as distribute the natural oils in their fur, promoting healthier skin and coat. Regular grooming also helps reduce hairballs and shedding in your home. 2. Diet: Provide a balanced and nutritious diet to your American Longhair cat that caters to their specific needs. A high-quality cat food brand, whether it's wet or dry food, should be given in appropriate portions as per your cat's age, size, and activity level. Make sure that the food has a good source of protein, such as chicken, turkey, or fish, and contains essential vitamins, minerals, and taurine. Don't forget to provide fresh water daily. Consult with your veterinarian if you have any concerns about your cat's diet or nutritional requirements. 3. Healthcare: Schedule regular veterinary checkups for your cat at least once a year. These checkups will help detect any potential health issues early on and ensure that your cat stays up to date with vaccinations and deworming treatments. Dental care is also crucial; your veterinarian can recommend cat-safe toothpaste and toothbrushes to maintain your cat's oral health. Keep an eye on any changes in your cat's behavior, appetite, or energy levels as these could indicate health problems and require immediate attention. 4. Litter Box: Maintain a clean and hygienic litter box for your cat. Choose a litter box that is large enough for your cat to move around comfortably, and place it in a quiet area of your home. Regularly scoop out waste, and change the litter completely at least once a week, or more if needed. This will help prevent unpleasant odors and encourage your cat to use the litter box. 5. Exercise and Mental Stimulation: Encourage your cat to engage in daily play and physical activity to maintain a healthy weight and active lifestyle. Provide interactive toys such as teaser wands, puzzle feeders, and scratching posts to keep your cat stimulated both mentally and physically. Regular playtime will strengthen the bond between you and your cat and help expel any excess energy that may trigger destructive behavior. 6. Socialization and Training: As you've mentioned, introducing a new cat to your home should be done gradually. Allow the cat to become accustomed to the new environment in a single room with its essentials. Once your cat feels comfortable, slowly introduce it to other pets and family members in the household. Positive reinforcement and patience are crucial during this process. If you have other cats, it's essential to provide separate feeding and sleeping areas to minimize territorial disputes. 7. Safety: Ensure that your home is a safe environment for your American Longhair cat. Remove any potentially hazardous items such as toxic plants, small objects that could be swallowed, and any cords or strings that the cat might get tangled in. You should also consider microchipping your cat and getting an ID tag with your name and contact information in case your cat goes missing.

Today, we will talk about a social media platform called Twitter. Imagine Twitter like a huge playground where millions of people can come, share their thoughts, and play together. But sometimes, a few people at the playground can misbehave and make others sad. So, Twitter has come up with a new helper tool, called a 'quality filter,' to protect everyone from the not-so-nice people. The quality filter is like a superhero! It watches over the playground and makes sure the people who are mean or bullying others stay away. With its special powers, the quality filter keeps harmful or unwanted messages out. That means people will have more fun playing on Twitter without being bothered by the bad people. Now, you may ask, \\"How does this superhero, quality filter, work?\\" Well, it's like a magical shield. It uses smart and secret ways to identify the mean people and blocks their messages from reaching the happy people on the playground. But don't worry! If you are a nice person who always plays well with others, the quality filter will let you continue to have fun and keep you safe from the mean ones. In conclusion, Twitter's new quality filter is a helpful superhero working hard to make sure everyone enjoys their time on the playground. It keeps the naughty people away and helps the nice people have more fun. So, the next time you're on the playground, remember to be kind and friendly like the quality filter, and help make Twitter a happy place for everyone to play!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A plane carrying the body of Korean War POW Glenn Schoenmann arrived at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday to be greeted by four emotional siblings, 62 years after their brother voluntarily left home to fight in the war. Private First Class Schoenmann died in a North Korean prison camp on December 29, 1950, at the age of 20. He was wounded and suffered days in the frigid cold alone during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, known to Korean War veterans as the ‘frozen Chosin.’ Not forgotten: Private First Class Glenn Schoenmann, who left his family farm in Tennessee to volunteer for the Korean War, is seen in this undated handout photo courtesy of the Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs. Long-awaited service: Schoenmann's personal items were put on display during a funeral for the Korean War veteran who died in a prison camp at the age of 19. The battle took place in late November 1950 as severe winter weather hit North Korea and hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese troops poured into the country to overturn what had been a largely successful American and United Nations advance. Injured and cut off from his unit, Schoenmann managed to avoid being captured for several days. But eventually, wounded and weakened from the cold, the young soldier was caught and detained in a North Korean prison camp, where he died. His remains were later recovered in 2004 during a brief period of cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea. Schoenmann’s corpse was identified by DNA taken from family members after a nephew’s online ancestry search came to the attention of U.S. authorities involved in recovering Korean War POW remains, the Leaf Chronicle in Tennessee reports. Closure: Sibling Raymond Schoenmann wipes his eyes during the funeral for his brother held at the Grundy County High School in Coalmont, Tennessee. Respects paid: Army Chaplin Ladislao Hernandez paid respects during the funeral for Korean War veteran Private First Class Schoenmann. Preparation for burial: The Army honor guard preparing to move Glenn Schoenmann's to the cemetery. His older brother says he remembers driving him to a bus station in Nashville more than 62 years ago. ‘He knew where he was going,’ Ernest Schoenmann, 86, of Creve Coure, Illinois, told the Chronicle. ‘He said, “I don’t think I’ll ever come home alive.\\" ‘That was hard. Those were the last words I can remember.’ Ernest Schoenmann, who was informed of the positive identification shortly before Thanksgiving, said his family learned a lot about what their sibling went through. ‘They gave me a booklet with an interview with one of the boys who was in prison with him,’ he said. ‘I started to read it, but I couldn’t. It was so horrible.’ Communal dedication: Locals lined the streets during the funeral procession. Proper ceremony: The honor guard carried Schoenmann's casket during the funeral in Palmer, Tennessee, on Saturday, January 12, 2013. Saying goodbye: Ernest, left, and Raymond, right, Schoenmann sat quietly during the funeral service for their brother who was 20 when he died in December 1950. As with thousands of other U.S. soldiers killed in action or by the harsh conditions of their captivity, Schoenmann’s remains were not returned to the U.S. after authorities signed an armistice with North Korea on July 27, 1953. Six decades after the signing of that armistice, over 8,000 U.S. military men and women remain unaccounted for. The Korean War, which was fought between June 25,1950, and July, 27, 1953, has often been referred to as 'The Forgotten War' and 'The Unknown War' due to the lack of public attention it received. Ernest Schoenmann said he wishes other families of missing Korean War service members will still be able to find closure as their loved ones remain half a world away. ‘I just wish more of them were home,’ he said. ‘There’s still so many of them missing over there.’Glenn Schoenmann’s long-awaited funeral was held in Tennessee on Saturday. A day to not forget: Final respects were paid before the burial. Flag folding: Members of the honor guards folded the flag during the funeral service.

Question: what do each of the friends desire?

Each of us desire love, and each of us desire a specific kind of love and a specific way of illuminating our lives through it. Abhi, Ashna, Prayash and Dibya are similarly in search of a special kind of love. Ashna and Prayash, two friends who have known each other forever, are separated by circumstance from Abhi, their mischievous but poetic friend who chooses ambition over friendship. Years later, at a fateful time in their lives, he realizes that he has to choose again, between keeping his friendship and going after the love of his life. Similarly, Ashna faces the choice between being true to herself and doing right by her family and society. Love demands sacrifice, they all learn: the bigger the sacrifice, the sweeter the reward, sometimes as freedom, and sometimes as the knowledge that the person you love has gained everything you'd wish for them. \\"Kohi Mero\\" is a story about the search for that special person and the special sacrifice it takes for us to show our love for each other.

In private, he has talked longingly of “going Bulworth,” a reference to a little-remembered 1998 Warren Beatty movie about a senator who risked it all to say what he really thought. While Mr. Beatty’s character had neither the power nor the platform of a president, the metaphor highlights Mr. Obama’s desire to be liberated from what he sees as the hindrances on him.      “Probably every president says that from time to time,” said David Axelrod, another longtime adviser who has heard Mr. Obama’s movie-inspired aspiration. “It’s probably cathartic just to say it. But the reality is that while you want to be truthful, you want to be straightforward, you also want to be practical about whatever you’re saying.”      The cinematic allusion seems striking given Mr. Obama’s rejection of Hollywood’s version of the White House, what one former aide calls “the Harry Potter theory of the presidency,” which suggests that he could wave a wand and make things happen. At the White House Correspondents Association dinner last month, he bristled at the idea that he should pattern himself after Michael Douglas’s assertive character in “The American President.”      Turning to Mr. Douglas, who was in the audience, he jokingly asked what his secret was. “Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy?” Mr. Obama asked. He added later, “I get frustrated sometimes.”      Mr. Obama was more scornful a few days later when a reporter skeptically asked about his prospects for further legislation. “As Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point,” he said.      This week, as Mr. Obama confronted a scandal frenzy unlike any he has faced, he let his guard down during fund-raisers in New York. “My thinking was after we beat them in 2012, well, that might break the fever,” he told donors. “And it’s not quite broken yet.”      He sounded almost plaintive in wishing he had more ability to advance his agenda. “I sure want to do some governing,” he told another set of contributors. “I want to get some stuff done. I don’t have a lot of time.”      Still, as he was traveling on Marine One on Monday, Mr. Obama took note of news reports describing last Friday as a terrible day. “You know what was actually a terrible day?” an aide recalled him saying. “The day Benghazi actually happened.” ||||| Senator Jay Bulworth is facing speculation-induced financial ruin, so he puts out a contract on his own life in order to collect a large, new insurance policy for his family. Living each moment on borrowed time, he suddenly begins spouting raw, unfiltered--and sometimes offensive in word but satirical in spirit -- thoughts to shocked audiences and handlers in the speech of hip-hop music and culture. His newfound uninhibitedness and new relationship with Nina carry him on a journey of political and spiritual renewal. Written by Stuart Hoffman |||||Summary:","output":"The article discusses the idea of \\"going Bulworth,\\" referencing a 1998 Warren Beatty movie about a senator who decides to speak his mind honestly without fear of consequences. The phrase has been used by President Obama in private to express his frustration with the restrictions placed upon him as president and his desire to speak more candidly about his thoughts and beliefs. David Axelrod, a longtime Obama adviser, notes that it is common for presidents to express such thoughts from time to time, as it is cathartic, but they must balance their honesty with practicality. Obama is described as rejecting Hollywood's portrayal of the presidency, especially the idea that he can easily make things happen, like the fictional president in \\"The American President\\" played by Michael Douglas. Despite this, Obama continues to face challenges in advancing his agenda, leading to frustration and a wish to \\"do some governing.\\" He has expressed disappointment in not being able to break the political fever and move forward with his plans, especially given his limited time left in office. \\"Going Bulworth\\" serves as a potent metaphor for the struggle between the pressures of being in office and the desire for honest, straightforward communication. President Obama, like many leaders before him, wrestles with the expectations placed upon him and his own aspirations for change and progress. The character of Senator Jay Bulworth, who faces political and financial ruin, serves as an interesting counterpoint to Obama, revealing a story of political and spiritual renewal that can resonate with those grappling with limitations in power and communication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and... Why are some teams not productive - Because some ideas are ten-a-penny - Because the work can be complex - Because its too easy - not enough information A:","output":"To help address these productivity challenges and foster a culture of best-practice in the Ubuntu community, we can follow these steps to create an effective roadmap for each cycle: 1. Identify goals and objectives: Start by determining the key objectives for the team during the upcoming cycle. What are the main priorities and projects that need to be completed? Encourage input and collaboration from team members to ensure everyone's ideas are considered. 2. Assign tasks and responsibilities: Once you have a clear set of goals, break them down into smaller tasks and assign each task to a team member based on their skills, availability, and resources. This ensures that everyone knows what they are responsible for and helps to create a sense of accountability. 3. Set deadlines and milestones: Establish deadlines for each task and its associated milestones, which will help to keep the team on track and ensure that the project stays on schedule. Be realistic when setting deadlines, taking into account the size and complexity of the tasks, as well as each team member's availability. 4. Define success: Determine what success looks like for the team in the context of the roadmap. This may include specific outcomes, deliverables, or performance metrics that must be achieved by the end of the cycle. This ensures that everyone has a clear understanding of the team's goals and can work toward meeting them. 5. Communicate regularly: Establish a system for consistent communication among team members, which will help to keep everyone engaged and informed about progress, setbacks, and other important updates. Communication tools like email, messaging platforms, or project management software can be beneficial in facilitating these discussions. 6. Monitor and update the roadmap: Regularly review the roadmap to track progress, identify potential roadblocks, and make any necessary adjustments. This keeps the team aligned and helps to ensure that everyone is working effectively toward the completion of the project. 7. Celebrate success: Recognize and celebrate the team's accomplishments upon reaching milestones and completing the project. This helps to foster a sense of pride and motivation for future projects.

They feel heavy pressure from their parents to do well in school. Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have a wonderful life. Though this may be a good idea for those very smart students, it can have terrible results for many students because they are not talented enough. As it is reported, a number of students killed themselves. Others try to get the feelings of taking drugs . Some join the groups of troublemakers and turn to crime . Many of them have tried very hard at school but have failed in the exams and have their parents lose hopes. Such students felt that they are hated by everyone else they meet and they don't want to go to school any longer. It is surprising that though most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any ways .Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to those school opening in the evenings and on weekends-- they only help students to pass exams and never teach students any real sense of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools. Many Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the students' hair to their clothes and the things in their bags. Child psychologists  now think that such strict rules are harmful  to the feelings of the students. Almost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them how to get on with others, how to tell right from wrong, how to show love for others, even for their parents.

Answer:","output":"Yellowknife, the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, is situated on the northern shore of the Great Slave Lake. This large lake is the second-largest lake entirely within Canada's borders, the deepest in North America with a maximum depth of about 614 meters (2,014 feet), and the ninth-largest lake in the world by volume. Great Slave Lake is known for its irregular shape, which consists of four large arms: the North Arm, McLeod Bay, East Arm, and the South Arm. The lake exhibits a unique mix of deep, cold water and vast, shallow bays that foster a rich variety of habitats. Its waters are home to many types of fish, including walleye, inconnu, lake whitefish, lake trout, northern pike, and Arctic grayling. The lake also supports a significant commercial fishing industry, providing both income and food for communities in the region. Yellowknife, as the capital of Northwest Territories, is the largest city in a territory that is known for its sprawling wilderness and natural beauty. Founded in 1934, the city is named after the Dene First Nations people, the Yellowknives, who called the region their home. The city became the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967, a role it has retained even after the creation of a separate territory, Nunavut, in 1999. The settlement of Yellowknife began as a gold mining town, and in more recent years has evolved into an important center of government and administration, as well as a hub for tourism and transportation. Major industries in Yellowknife today include mining, transport, and support services for remote communities. As a city situated near the Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife offers numerous recreational activities, such as fishing, boating, and canoeing during summers. During winters, with its location being close to the Arctic Circle, it offers a spectacular view of the stunning Northern Lights. The city's cultural scene reflects its diverse population, which includes Indigenous peoples, settlers from other parts of Canada, and newer arrivals from across the globe. Festivals such as the Long John Jamboree and the Snowking Winter Festival, engaging outdoor attractions like the Ingraham Trail and winter sports opportunities, all contribute to the city's vibrant community atmosphere. In summary, Yellowknife, the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, is located on the northern shore of the breathtaking Great Slave Lake. The city's history, natural beauty, and diverse community make it an important and distinctive part of Canada's far north."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Place these three ingredients in a heavy, medium saucepan. Set the saucepan over medium heat. Heat the sugar mixture on the stove, stirring continuously, until the sugar granules dissolve and the mixture reaches a boil.  This will usually take about 10 minutes. If the mixture reaches a boil but sugar crystals are still present on the side of the pan, cover the pan and continue boiling the syrup for 1 to 2 minutes. During this time, the steam should help wash the crystals away. Alternatively, you can wash down the sides of the pan by scraping them with a wet pastry brush. Continue cooking the syrup mixture over medium heat until your candy thermometer reads the ideal temperature. For soft nougat, the temperature should reach the soft ball stage and read 238 degrees Fahrenheit (114 degrees Celsius). For hard, chewy nougat, the temperature should reach the soft crack stage and read 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).  This will usually take anywhere from 6 to 12 more minutes. When preparing soft nougat, you can actually cook the sugar syrup up to 245 degrees Fahrenheit (118 degrees Celsius). Similarly, you can allow the sugar syrup to reach 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) when preparing hard nougat.

Like all versions of Chinese opera, it is a traditional Chinese art form, involving music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics, and acting. History. There is a debate about the origins of Cantonese opera, but it is generally accepted that opera was brought from the northern part of China and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong in late 13th century, during the late Southern Song dynasty. In the 12th century, there was a theatrical form called the Nanxi or \\"Southern drama\\", which was performed in public theatres of Hangzhou, then capital of the Southern Song. With the invasion of the Mongol army, Emperor Gong of the Song dynasty fled with hundreds of thousands of Song people into Guangdong in 1276. Among them were Nanxi performers from Zhejiang, who brought Nanxi into Guangdong and helped develop the opera traditions in the south.  - Infernal Affairs III is a 2003 Hong Kong crime thriller film directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak. It is the third and final installment in the \\"Infernal Affairs\\" film series, and is both a sequel and a semi-prequel to the original film, as it intercuts events before and after the events in the first film.

The Iroquoian wars brought fear and urgency for the French to attempt to save what was left of their trade alliances.:143 Their alliances were in jeopardy, and also, in 1697 the western posts were closed as a result of the termination by Louis XIV of the fur trade west of Montreal.:218 Historian Richard White illustrates central Wisconsin at the end of the seventeenth century as \\"a vast refugee center, its situation constantly changing, nations socializing, cooperating, feuding, fighting, constantly adjusting their strategies to shift in French trading policy, which was always the dominant reality.\\":52 Thus, when the Peace Conference of 1701 finally took place in Montreal, the French were quick to establish a French protectorate in the Great Lakes region.:97 Nevertheless, the question still remained as to how they would facilitate trade with their southern partners, when their main trading posts had been closed.

Movie title: A Lizard in a Woman's Skin Context: Carol Hammond (Bolkan) is the daughter of a wealthy lawyer and politician named Edmund Brighton (Leo Genn). Her husband Frank (Jean Sorel) is a lawyer working for Brighton's practice. They all live together in a large apartment with Joan (Edy Gall), Frank's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams she's been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet excite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies. During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst. Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations. Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies (Mike Kennedy and Penny Brown) who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening. The following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) from Scotland Yard arrives to take charge of the investigation. The room and condition of the dead body are identical to their depiction in the dream sequence. To make matters even more incriminating, there is a discarded fur coat near the body.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? excellent companion piece","output":"The phrase \\"excellent companion piece\\" can be predominantly considered positive. In this detailed answer, we will break down its components and analyze its meaning and context to establish why it has a positive connotation. 1. \\"Excellent\\": The first word, \\"excellent,\\" is an adjective that describes something as being of the highest quality or being extremely good. The word signifies an object or situation which surpasses just being good, and instead stands in the realm of exceptionally good. Therefore, the use of \\"excellent\\" adds a strong positive connotation to the phrase. 2. \\"Companion\\": The word \\"companion\\" generally refers to a person, thing, or entity that accompanies, goes hand-in-hand, or harmonizes with another. It often has positive connotations as well, as a good companion is described as being supportive, compatible, and helpful. In the context of this phrase, \\"companion\\" suggests that the subject being referenced complements or enhances another primary piece or work. 3. \\"Piece\\": In this context, \\"piece\\" refers to a work of art, literature, music, or any other creative material. It's a neutral term that carries no inherent positive or negative connotations. The term simply denotes the object or creation being discussed. When combined, \\"excellent companion piece\\" refers to a work that is of high quality and serves as a fitting and enhancing supplement or accompaniment to another primary work. It implies that the creator of the companion piece has done an exceptional job in complementing, improving, or providing additional depth to the other work. This can be evident in various forms of media such as films, books, artworks, and even academic works. For example, if someone discusses a documentary as an \\"excellent companion piece\\" to a book on the same subject, it means that the documentary provides insightful and valuable content that goes well with the book. It could offer a different perspective, additional information, or provide a new context for readers, ultimately adding a richer experience for those engaged with the primary work. In conclusion, \\"excellent companion piece\\" is considered a positive phrase as it emphasizes the high quality, compatibility, and supportive nature of the work it describes. Its use indicates that the piece adds value, depth, and a harmonious connection to another primary work, which enriches the overall experience for the audience or reader."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees?, using the article: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

Bob's egg carton would not fit in his shopping bag from the store, the","output":"carton was slightly too large. He carefully balanced it on top of his other groceries, hoping to make it home without any accidents. Step 1: Analyze the situation Before continuing, it is essential to understand the context of the story and the character's current predicament. Step 2: Build tension  To engage the reader in the story, the protagonist should encounter some complications or obstacles. As Bob walked down the sidewalk, the egg carton teetered precariously on top of his groceries. He knew one wrong move could send the eggs crashing to the ground.  Step 3: Introduce a new character or event Introducing new elements can help extend the story and add additional dimensions to the plot. Just then, a neighbor's dog bounded over, excited to see Bob. The dog jumped up, knocking into the egg carton as Bob tried to swerve out of the way. Step 4: Further the protagonist's struggle To make the story more interesting, the main character should need to overcome challenges or setbacks. Bob managed to catch the egg carton in mid-air, but the sudden movement caused him to drop one of his shopping bags. Canned goods rolled out onto the pavement, drawing the attention of passersby. Step 5: Show growth or learning If the character learns from their experiences or setbacks, it can make for a more gratifying story. Slightly embarrassed, Bob took a moment to reassess his situation. He realized he had been careless in trying to carry everything at once. Determined not to make the same mistake again, he made a plan. Step 6: Implement a solution The protagonist should attempt to solve their problem, offering the reader a sense of progress. He put the egg carton in the now-empty shopping bag and then placed the canned goods around it. This way, the bag provided a protective barrier for the delicate eggs. Step 7: Resolution and reflection A resolution helps to tie up the story, while offering the reader an opportunity to reflect on the events and lessons learned. Carefully balancing the improved arrangement, Bob made his way home without further incident, grateful for the lesson he had learned. From then on, he vowed to be more mindful of the way he carried his groceries.

A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

Q:I have a new situation: A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo.  But I can use this background: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.  What is an answer for this question: Which markalong was produced asexually? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step-by-step: 1. A species of animal called a markalong can reproduce either sexually or asexually. 2. Animal A has only one parent, while Animal B has two parents. As mentioned in the provided background information, asexual reproduction involves only one parent, while sexual reproduction involves the mixing of traits from two parents.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

In summary, the proposed perturbation of more greenhouse gases will directly contribute to an enhanced greenhouse effect and its associated impacts on Earth's climate and environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Q: Which process acts as a natural complement for cellular respiration?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are connected through an important relationship. This relationship enables life to survive as we know it. The products of one process are the reactants of the other. Notice that the equation for cellular respiration is the direct opposite of photosynthesis :.   Choices:  - glycolysis  - atherosclerosis  - absorption  - photosynthesis   A: A:","output":"Photosynthesis acts as a natural complement for cellular respiration. Both processes play crucial roles in the sustenance of life, particularly for plants and animals, as they make up the basis of energy transformation throughout ecosystems. The two processes are connected through a significant relationship in which the products of one serve as the reactants for the other. Photosynthesis, primarily occurring in plants, algae, and some bacteria, is the process by which light energy is absorbed and converted into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other organic compounds. This process also consumes carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), while releasing oxygen (O2) into the atmosphere as a byproduct. The general equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 On the other hand, cellular respiration is the process by which organisms, including both plants and animals, break down glucose and other organic compounds to release stored energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide and water as waste products. The general equation for cellular respiration is the reverse of that for photosynthesis: C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP (energy) Therefore, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary processes because they rely on each other to function. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen, which are then utilized in cellular respiration to generate energy, carbon dioxide, and water. This cycle maintains the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the environment and ensures the availability of energy for living organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Bamboozled Movie plot: Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for the television network CNS. At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show.

Article:Mr Trump has described the agreement - implemented a year ago - as \\"the worst deal ever\\" and threatened to scrap it. But Hassan Rouhani said the comments were just \\"slogans\\" and that there was no chance of any renegotiation. Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its sensitive nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. Outgoing US President Barack Obama says the deal will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy - and stresses that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. During the US presidential election campaign last March, Mr Trump told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that his \\"number-one priority\\" would be \\"to dismantle the disastrous deal\\". He said his biggest concern was not that Iran would violate the agreement, but that it could \\"keep the terms and get to the bomb by simply running out the clock\\". At a news conference marking the first anniversary of the lifting of sanctions on Tuesday, Iran's president was asked about Mr Trump's comments. \\"The respected president-elect has so far expressed the opinion that he is unhappy about it [the deal], or that it is not a good deal, or the worst deal ever,\\" he answered. \\"These are all slogans and I deem it unlikely that he would act on it once he enters the White House. Since this is not a bilateral agreement, it is not up to him to say whether he likes it or dislikes it.\\" Mr Rouhani went on to stress that \\"any renegotiation\\" was \\"out of the question\\". On Monday, Mr Obama issued a statement saying the deal had \\"achieved significant, concrete results in making the United States and the world a safer place\\" by rolling back Iran's nuclear programme and \\"verifiably\\" preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon. He noted that Iran had reduced its uranium stockpile by 98% and removed two thirds of its centrifuges, which are needed to separate out the fissile isotope U-235 from uranium hexafluoride gas. Low-enriched uranium, which has a 3%-4% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. But it can also be enriched to the 90% needed to produce nuclear weapons. Iran was also not enriching any uranium at the underground Fordo facility, nor using advanced centrifuges to enrich, according to Mr Obama. In an apparent warning to Mr Trump, he said: \\"The Iran deal must be measured against the alternatives. A diplomatic resolution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is far preferable to an unconstrained Iranian nuclear programme or another war in the Middle East.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"President-elect Donald Trump has previously described the Iran nuclear deal as \\"the worst deal ever\\" and threatened to scrap it.

Aquarium representatives said they were trying to treat a parasite that they had detected in the tank. When they added medicine to the water, they believe it may have caused a bad reaction in the animals.            The treatment they used is commonly used at other Aquariums, and was tested beforehand in a smaller thank with no adverse reactions.            Late Tuesday night, workers noticed that the fish were dying. More workers were called in to try and save the animals in that exhibit, but most could not be saved.            Aquarium representatives said that the incident affected the Islands of Steel, Flower Gardens and Lionfish exhibits. They are sending the water to be tested to find out what it is that killed the fish.

Question: What is the name of pluto's moon? Answer: charon A:","output":"Supporting Fact 1: Charon was discovered in 1978 by astronomer James Christy when he noticed a bulge in Pluto's image while examining photographic plates taken by the US Naval Observatory. This discovery led to further investigations, ultimately confirming Charon as Pluto's largest moon. Supporting Fact 2: Charon is about half the size of Pluto, making it the largest satellite in the solar system relative to the size of the planet it orbits. This distinct ratio led scientists to classify Pluto and Charon as a \\"dwarf planet and moon system\\" or a \\"binary (dwarf) planet.\\" Supporting Fact 3: Charon and Pluto are tidally locked with each other, meaning that they always show the same face to each other as they rotate. This unique characteristic implies that they share a common center of mass, further solidifying the concept of a binary (dwarf) planet system. Supporting Fact 4: Charon's surface is primarily composed of water ice, with evidence of ammonia hydrates and other organic compounds possibly present. This information suggests that both Pluto and its moon have similar origins, possibly interacting early in their formation and evolving together. Supporting Fact 5: Observations from NASA's New Horizons mission in 2015 provided a wealth of information about Pluto and Charon, including detailed images of their surfaces, composition, and atmosphere.

If we move away, the ball takes longer to reach me, and the time between catches is longer. With the galaxy, instead of a ball, we have electromagnetic waves (like light). As the galaxy moves away from Earth, the waves take longer to reach us. This means that the frequency, which is how often the waves come, decreases.

Is the cat afraid or scared of people? Is it angry? If you think they may be dangerous you shouldn't try handling them. Instead, call animal control or a human society who will be able to professionally capture and handle the cat if you think they pose a danger. Cats communicate their feelings with body language that can be rather obvious. For example:  An angry or upset cat will have ears that are flattened back, dilated pupils, a tail which is switching back and forth, an arched back, and fur standing on end. The cat will typically be growling. This is a sign to back off. If it hasn't run away, a scared cat will typically lay flat or have its tail between its legs. Proceed with caution in trying to tame these cats. In contrast, a contented and relaxed cat's ears will be forward and alert, and its tail will be straight up in the air. Its fur will be flat (not standing on end), and the cat may even stretch, lay down, and roll onto its back. While you will not be close to the cat, you will be able to observe its overall health from afar.  Check to see if it looks skinny or bony. It may be hungry. Look at its fur to see if it looks healthy, or if it looks matted, patchy, bald, or otherwise unhealthy. See if the cat has any other obvious issues, such as limping, cuts, sores, or other problems. Feral cats and kittens are generally unvaccinated and carry a slight risk for carrying the deadly rabies virus. While very uncommon, rabies in cats can occur primarily in outdoor, unvaccinated cats and kittens. The symptoms of rabies can vary and may take months to develop after a cat or kitten was exposed to the virus.  Classic signs of rabies in cats and kittens include an ill cat (lethargic, not eating, weakness) and/or changes in behavior (aggressive, restless, disoriented, paralysis, seizures).  If you encounter a feral cat with these symptoms, call animal control and do not attempt to handle the cat or kitten. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, when observing a cat to determine its nature, pay close attention to its body language and physical condition. Look for signs of fear or aggression, such as flattened ears, arched back, or growling, and proceed with caution if attempting to approach the cat. Also, assess its overall health by checking for a healthy appearance or any signs of injury or illness.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What system pairs the eight songs off against each other?  Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (deltävlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The...

The BF and I went in here last night to get the summer sampler, and we were excited to try this new place for less money. Well what we paid was STILL too much for what we got. We ordered the caprese salad, a pizza with pepperoni and arugula, and two glasses of chardonnay. The caprese salad was not what was expected. Usually it's just basil, tomato, mozz, balsamic, and evoo. This was a salad (like lettuce) with hidden chunks of mozz and tomato in it, as well as some soggy pieces of bread. The mozz was the most flavorless mozz cheese I have had in a long time.... not so good. Otherwise, the salad was a plain old salad, but not what I wanted when I ordered it.... oh well. The pizza came out ridiculously fast. This leads me to believe that they are all sitting back there made and waiting to be shoved in the oven real quick and brought out. Our pizza had some spots that were covered in black burnt crust and some that seemed like they'd barely been in an oven (droopy, chewy, meh tasting). The pizza also lacked a lot of flavor, the sauce was almost non existent in taste, and it could have been a frozen pizza for how it tasted. The wine we got was also not pleasant.... although, chardonnay is not my usual wine, I have had it and this was particularly bad. The people who work there were very friendly, however, so that is a plus. I suppose if you want expensive fast food pizza....come here. For 'italian' style pizza, there are just too many other (good) restaurants in the valley to waste your time here.","output":"This review is negative.

Movie plot: Raj Khanna (Hrithik Roshan), Pooja Sahani (Rani Mukherjee) and Tina Kapoor (Kareena Kapoor) are childhood friends. While Raj has always been attracted to the vivacious and beautiful Tina, he is completely unaware of the quiet Pooja's love for him. Raj's father (Kiran Kumar) decides to move to England with his family to take up a new job. Before leaving, Raj makes Tina promise to write to him via e-mail. But Tina soon becomes occupied with other things, so it's the loyal Pooja who writes to Raj with Tina's name to help Tina keep her promise. Raj and Pooja have many things in common, and their e-mails bring them close to each other. A decade and a half later, Raj returns to India for a short vacation. By now, he's in love with the girl he has been writing to, and believes he can recognize her at first sight. When the three of them finally meet, Raj, to Pooja's disappointment, completely ignores her and is besotted with Tina, who is as vivacious as ever. However, during the two weeks of his vacation, he cannot help but notice that the real Tina is completely different from the Tina he knew from the e-mails. He also starts to like Pooja, without realizing she is the one he is really in love with. He returns to London, where Pooja coincidentally arrives for an interview, and there he discovers that Pooja was the one who had been writing to him all those years. They confess their love for each other and decide to get married, but fate plays an unexpected trick on them. Back in India, Tina's father (Sachin Khedekar) has died, leaving Tina alone in the world. Pooja now refuses to marry Raj, as she does not want to break Tina's heart. Raj's parents also agree to the marriage, but Raj wants to tell them that he really loves Pooja. Pooja, however, still refuses to marry Raj and so he angrily vows to her that he will only marry Tina if Pooja marries someone else on the same day. Enter a friend of Raj, Rohan Verma (Uday Chopra).

The White House said Monday that President Donald Trump \\"doesn't believe any of these accusations\\" made by adult film actress Stormy Daniels that she had a one-night affair with the future U.S. leader in 2006 and five years later was threatened to keep quiet about their alleged liaison. Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\\" Trump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy. Daniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted 130,000 from Trump...

Hypothesis: The little girl is sitting cross legged. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Given the premise provided, we cannot directly conclude that the little girl is sitting cross-legged, as there is no explicit information given about her posture or position. To deduce a conclusion about her posture, we need to incorporate context clues, observations, and reasoning based on the information we have at hand. Firstly, let's analyze the available information: 1. A little girl seems pretty bored: This statement informs us about the girl's emotional state, but it doesn't provide direct information about her physical posture. 2. A male friend is having a lot of fun with the toy tea set: This statement informs us about the male friend's activity and emotional state; however, it doesn't give clear information about the girl's posture. To attempt to make a reasonable conclusion regarding the girl's posture (specifically, if she's sitting cross-legged or not), we have to consider typical behaviors and settings where children might play with a toy tea set. In many cases, children may sit on the floor (indoors or outdoors) to engage with such an activity. Sitting cross-legged is a common posture when sitting on the floor, particularly for young children who find it comfortable and easy. Although this analysis raises the possibility that she might be sitting cross-legged as it is a common posture in such a situation, it is still not a definitive conclusion. There are various other ways a little girl could be sitting or standing while feeling bored around her friend who is playing with a toy tea set. For instance, she could also be sitting with her legs stretched out or standing beside him with folded arms. In conclusion, given the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the little girl is sitting cross-legged. However, based on context and typical behaviors, it is a plausible hypothesis, but more information would be needed to confirm her posture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what is fuel oil used for A:","output":"No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about fuel oil usage. Fuel oil, also known as residual oil or heavy oil, is a byproduct of crude oil refining. It is a viscous liquid that has several uses: 1. Heating: Fuel oil is primarily used in furnaces and boilers to generate heat in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. It serves as a reliable and efficient fuel source for centralized heating systems. 2. Power generation: Fuel oil is used as a fuel source for power generation, particularly in areas with limited access to natural gas or other energy resources. Fuel oil-fired power plants convert the heat released from the combustion of fuel oil into electricity. 3. Marine fuel: Known as bunker oil, fuel oil is used to power large vessels such as cargo ships and ocean liners. It is a popular choice in marine transportation due to its energy density and low cost. 4. Industrial processes: Some industrial processes require the high heat output that fuel oil can provide, such as in cement production and steel manufacturing.

The more they learn about pet food, the better able they will be to make an informed decision that will keep their pet healthier and safer.\\" Here are several tips that consumers may want to keep in mind when it comes to choosing a pet food that will help reduce the risks. Get to know the company. Most people may know a company name simply because they spend millions on advertising. But that doesn't mean they know much about the company or their morals. Research companies to find one that offers high standards, quality products, and great customer service. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to get in touch with a pet food company and ask them where something was made, where ingredients  came from, or any other questions. They should have no problem answering questions about their products, or with being able to provide proof of their quality standards. Read reviews. Do some searches to read some reviews about various brands of pet food. Keep in mind that some reviews can be one-sided and even planted by the company itself, so look for fair third-party sources giving the review. Investigate  ingredients. The source of ingredients is of major concern when it comes to reducing the risks of pet food recalls and keeping pets healthy. Read the labels and ask questions to determine where the ingredients are coming from. Understand pet foods. Cat and dog food should contain 100 percent protein, which will supply them with the nutrients their bodies require. The problem with many commercial pet foods is that it is full of numerous fillers, such as cheap fillers and grains.

A First World War bomb killed two construction site workers when it exploded 100 years after being fired at a Belgian battlefield. The bomb had laid dormant for a century at an industrial site in the former area of Flanders battlegrounds, killing two and injuring two more. Johan Lescrauwaert of the Ypres prosecutor's office confirmed that the armament from the 1914-1918 war exploded near the workers, but did not say whether it was a shell or a grenade. Emergency personnel remove evidence near a covered body after a World War One armament exploded in Ypres, Belgium. It was not confirmed whether the bomb was a grenade or a shell, but it has been confirmed that it killed two and injured two more. The circumstances were unclear because there was apparently no digging at the site - the usual cause of such accidents. Every year the battlefields in western Belgium throw up hundreds of armaments from the Great War, and most are destroyed without incident by a special Belgian army bomb squad. In a nearby city, the army was completing the destruction of over 800 gas canisters. More and more unexploded shells are discovered every year in the areas in and around the former Flanders field battleground. Evacuation works are the common cause of exploding the dormant shells, as the heavy machinery used in the process can jostle the delicate armaments back to life, although this case was peculiar because no digging took place. The Flanders battlefields cover dozens of cities where allies clashed with German forces for most of the war. Earlier this year, members of the bomb disposal unit managed to disarm an unexploded shell at a construction site in Ypres, Northwestern Belgium. Also earlier this month, a large amount of ammunition from the First World War was discovered on the border of the West Flemish municipalities of Passchendaele and Moorslede, for which the Belgian bomb squad is still working to clean up the site. Earlier this month members of the bomb disposal unit in Ypres, Belgium, were lucky as they managed to evacuate and disarm a WWI-era bomb before it exploded. The unexploded bomb from January 2014 was found during similar evacuation works to the ones that caused a bomb to explode this month. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

The game can be played for free, but nearly all in-game activities require personal resources that you have available to use.Although there are various activities to keep you busy on Calypso, what most people do first is to find themselves a profession, such as hunting the fierce animals on Calypso, mining the precious minerals and making tools.Then they can think about buying their virtual house or paying a visit to a virtual nightclub or doing any of the other activities that make life bearable. Entropia has its very own economy   and its own currency, the PED (Project Entropia Dollars).Players move real world money into PED which they then use to pay for their life on Calypso.However, the virtual things inside Entropia do have a real value in the outside world, and careful business deals mean that players can actually make real money there.PED can be changed into dollars any time at a rate of 10PED to 1US. What's so impressive about The Entropia Universe is the number of players; currently more than 600,000 representing over 220 countries from planet Earth.A number of players insist that it's a good way to make money.However, the reality of Entropia's economic system is that most people end up paying more than they earn and it's not uncommon to find players who are paying up to 200 a month into their PED account.This might not be the most economical way of spending one's free time.However, some people say that for them the fact that they can escape the realities of the earthbound life and become a different person with a completely different life for a few hours every week is...

Between 35°N and 35°S, glaciers occur only in the Himalayas, Andes, Rocky Mountains, a few high mountains in East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran. Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth's land surface. Continental glaciers cover nearly 13,000,000 km2 (5×10^6 sq mi) or about 98 percent of Antarctica's 13,200,000 km2 (5.1×10^6 sq mi), with an average thickness of 2,100 m (7,000 ft). Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the provided context, the majority of glaciers on Earth are found within the polar regions, which contain approximately 99% of all glacial ice. These extensive ice sheets are primarily located in Antarctica and Greenland.  Antarctica is by far the most abundant in its glacial presence, with nearly 13,000,000 square kilometers of ice, representing about 98% of its total land surface. The average thickness of these massive continental glaciers is around 2,100 meters. Apart from that, the region also experiences extreme temperature which makes it ideal for the formation and preservation of these giant ice bodies. Greenland, while not as extensive as Antarctica, is known for its significant glacial expanses. Like Antarctica, the environmental conditions of Greenland, with its constant low temperatures, make it conducive to glacier development and maintenance, producing some of the biggest glaciers outside of Antarctica. In addition to these polar regions, glaciers can also be found in mountainous zones across the different continents, except Australia. These mountains provide the required altitude, low temperature and adequate precipitation, conditions necessary for the formation and survival of glaciers. Among these, the main clusters of glaciers between 35°N and 35°S latitude can be spotted in the Himalayas, Andes, and Rocky Mountains. Also, a few high-altitude locations within East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea, and Iran (Zard Kuh) host glaciers. Finally, a few oceanic islands present at high latitudes also house glaciers. These islands primarily lie within the polar circles. In total, glaciers cover about 10% of Earth's land surface, with continental glaciers covering large areas like Antarctica and Greenland. Despite their substantial concentration in these regions, we can expect to find glaciers in surprisingly diverse locations across the globe, from the equator-reaching heights of the Himalayas and Andes to the remote cold of polar oceanic islands."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her. She works as a waitress in a coffee shop, she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. It is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. One day Phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. He dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. He is constantly thinking about her. His med school grades are even failing. So what the nookie is too good. He wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. She always lets Phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time. He is heart broken but he meets another woman. They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo. Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. Phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. She does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. Oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. He meets another girl named Sally we have a March of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for Mildred. Well he has no school tuition, can't find a job. Finally Sally and her dad takes him in. Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill. Soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again. She has TB. meanwhile he is still leading Sally down the Primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. Finally the bimbo dies and Phillip declares he is free now and he will marry Sally. I wished she told him to stuff it. Now I know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. But I feel Phillip was the bad guy. Yes Mildred is a Strumpet BUT he knows it, and he keeps coming back. Mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. I guess the sex wasn't as good. But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred. Not only that but the man who gets Mildred pregnant is already married and when Philip asks him what he intends to do about Baby ( apparently the baby's name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and Baby and he is wealthy. Sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. Philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either. Men are using Mildred as a Boy Toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain.

Please answer the following question: -  Bread absorbs water from the air - Bread absorbs warmth from the air - Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread - Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy - Mold colonies grow until they are visible.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process is bread absorbing water from the air. To provide a detailed explanation of the mold growth process on bread, let's break down each step: 1. Bread absorbs water from the air: The process begins with bread absorbing moisture present in the surrounding air. Bread contains water-soluble starches and sugars which makes it hygroscopic, meaning it can easily absorb water molecules from the air. The environment's relative humidity plays a significant role in this process. Higher humidity allows bread to absorb more moisture, consequently helping to create favorable conditions for mold growth. 2. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: Apart from moisture, warmth is another crucial factor that contributes to mold growth on bread. Most mold species thrive in temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (approximately 21°C to 32°C). However, some species can grow at lower or higher temperatures. Bread can absorb warmth from the surrounding air, which in turn accelerates mold growth. 3. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: Mold spores are microscopic fungi particles that are present in the air. They can easily be transported by air currents or even a slight breeze, settling on various surfaces, including bread. Dust particles often carry these mold spores and can introduce them to the bread's surface. 4. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: Once the mold spores are in contact with the moist and warm bread, they can begin to grow and multiply. They release enzymes that break down the bread's carbohydrates, sugars, and proteins into simpler compounds, which the mold uses for energy and growth. This process causes the bread to become spoiled and inedible. 5. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: As the mold consumes nutrients from the bread and multiplies, it forms visible colonies on the bread's surface. These colonies can appear in different colors and textures, depending on the mold species. Some common mold colors include green, black, white, and blue. Preventing mold growth on bread involves limiting the factors that contribute to its development, such as reducing exposure to humidity and warmth, and keeping the bread in a clean and protected environment. Storing bread in airtight containers or refrigerating it can help maintain its freshness and delay the onset of mold growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: A Trip to the Moon Movie plot: At a meeting of the Astronomic Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes a trip to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers: Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of \\"marines\\" (most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits). The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing.

Friend recount the details of to Connie? from the following article ?  Connie Wyatt is a restless 15-year-old who is anxious to explore the pleasures of her sexual awakening. Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \\"A. Friend\\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \\"pull out the phone,\\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover. She starts to get scared and tells him to go, but he coerces her into going with him, threatening to burn down the house, while his friend remains at the house, supposedly to watch over it while they are gone. The answer is:","output":"The event that Arnold Friend recounts the details of to Connie is her family's barbecue plans. He demonstrates his knowledge about her life with amazing accuracy, which makes her feel scared and uneasy.

The senior office supervisor, Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin), introduces Judy to the company and staff, including mail room clerk Eddie, alcoholic Margaret Foster, the opportunistic boss Franklin Hart, Jr. (Dabney Coleman), and Roz Keith (Elizabeth Wilson), Hart's executive assistant. Violet reveals to Judy that Hart is supposedly involved with his buxom secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton). Hart exploits and mistreats his female subordinates, with backstabbing and sexist remarks. He takes credit for Violet's ideas, cruelly yells at and threatens Judy on her first day after an equipment malfunction and sexually harasses Doralee, spreading rumors about an affair that never happened. When Violet discovers that a promotion she was hoping to receive was instead given to a man because of sexist hiring practices, she confronts Hart about it, as well as the rumors about Doralee (who enters Hart's office just in time to hear, and now realizes why she has become unpopular with the other secretaries).

Let's analyze the function of these important words in the sentence: 1. Pizza: This is the primary subject, around which the sentence is built and aims to provide information. By mentioning \\"pizza,\\" we know that the sentence is describing a specific type of food and sets the context for understanding the variety and ingredients that follow. 2. Cheese: As an ingredient, \\"cheese\\" serves to give the reader a clearer understanding of the type of pizza being described. Cheese is an essential and foundational pizza topping, providing both flavor and texture. As a widely popular pizza ingredient, its mention in this sentence contributes to an increased comprehensibility of the pizza's characteristics. 3. Onions: \\"Onions\\" is another crucial ingredient mentioned in the sentence. Adding onions to a pizza introduces a distinct flavor profile that may sway one's preference towards or away from this particular variety. As a recognizable and often-used pizza topping, it plays an essential role in further illustrating the specific nature of the pizza being described. 4. Hot peppers: The last key ingredient listed, \\"hot peppers\\" denotes the spice level and potentially the predominant flavor element of this pizza. Hot peppers can bring about a significant taste distinction, causing this pizza to vary notably from other options. As a deciding factor for many people when choosing their preferred pizza toppings, hot peppers' mention in this sentence amplifies the necessary details for understanding the pizza's composition. In conclusion, the important words in the sentence, \\"A pizza with cheese, onions, and hot peppers\\" - pizza, cheese, onions, and hot peppers - work cohesively to convey the central theme and provide a comprehensive picture of the specific kind of pizza being described. These words hold the highest degree of importance in the sentence due to their direct relation to the subject matter and their impact on the reader's understanding and visualization of the pizza."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink.

Article: Show was seen as a barometer for free speech in Egypt, but Youssef claims he is no longer safe to work      The television satirist seen as the barometer for free speech in post-revolutionary Egypt, Bassem Youssef, has ended his show because he feels it is no longer safe to satirise Egyptian politics.      \\"The present climate in Egypt is not suitable for a political satire program,\\" the former surgeon told reporters in a press conference at his studio on Monday afternoon. \\"I'm tired of struggling and worrying about my safety and that of my family.\\"      Youssef's announcement followed a decision by his host channel, MBC-Misr, to suspend his show during Egypt's recent presidential election campaign – in what was perceived as an attempt to stop him mocking Egypt's incoming head of state, field marshal Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.      The suspension was Youssef's second in less than a year. In September, his previous employers, CBC, terminated an earlier incarnation of the show after he lightly criticised supporters of Egypt's government – and on Monday Youssef said he and his team lacked the stamina to move to a third channel.      The announcement marks a sharp reversal in fortunes for a man who was once the poster-boy for Egypt's post-revolutionary gains. Following the fall of Hosni Mubarak, he took advantage of the freer political climate to post homemade satire shows on YouTube. He came from obscurity to first earn millions of YouTube hits, and then later his own slick TV show – the first of its kind to feature a live audience in Egypt.      He became known outside the country as Egypt's Jon Stewart, after the American comedian whom Youssef aimed to emulate.      But he first ran into trouble during the tenure of the now-ousted Mohamed Morsi, whose prosecutor-general investigated him for insulting the president. Matters turned worse after Sisi ousted Morsi last July, and the country was swept by a wave of nationalism that left little space for government critics – including, as of Monday, Youssef himself.      At his farewell speech, Youssef did not specify exactly who had pressured his employers to end his show. But in a recent interview with the Guardian's Sunday sister paper, Youssef made it clear that Egypt's military-backed government had created an environment in which censorship was possible.      \\"You can always implement some sort of a mood, without actually giving direct orders,\\" Youssef said at the time. \\"It is about creating a certain atmosphere that would make this acceptable or doable, and I think it reflects badly on everybody. Even if the people in authority do not do it, it reflects badly on the freedom of speech in Egypt.\\" ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption The satirist posed with his writers and producers as he announced the show would end after almost three years      One of Egypt's most popular TV satire shows has come to an end, its creator Bassem Youssef has announced.      The satirist said he was \\"tired of struggling\\" and worried about the safety of his family.      His \\"al-Bernameg\\" (The Programme) show came under pressure after poking fun at Egypt's military establishment.      The show has been sued dozens of times since it began in the wake of ex-President Hosni Mubarak's downfall in 2011.      Mr Youssef, a former heart surgeon, told a news conference on Monday that the channel that carried the show had been pressured to drop it.      \`The present climate in Egypt is not suitable for a political satire programme,\\" he added.      He denied that he was capitulating to pressure, saying: \\"Stopping the programme sends a much stronger message than if it continued.\\"      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The show is inspired by US satirist Jon Stewart, who appeared on the programme last year      At its height, the show was watched by an estimated 8 million viewers inside Egypt and many millions more abroad.      Household name      The show began as a series of amateur YouTube clips filmed in Mr Youssef's Cairo flat in the days following Egypt's 2011 revolution.      Inspired by Jon Stewart's Daily Show, Bassem Youssef went on to develop al-Bernameg, a satirical show filmed in front of a studio audience.      Its success made him a household name throughout the Arab world and he was named as one of the world's top 100 most influential people by Time Magazine in 2013.      However, the show's sharp satire repeatedly angered the authorities, who tried to close it down.      Under the presidency of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi, Mr Youssef faced charges of insulting Islam.      The charges were later thrown out of court, shortly after which Mr Morsi was too thrown out of office by Egypt's military.      In November the private Egyptian CBC channel refused to broadcast one episode because it had \\"violated editorial policy\\".

In February, prosecutors filed fresh complaints, accusing Mr Youssef of insulting the armed forces, the will of the Egyptian people and the \\"symbols\\" of Egypt.      The show had been on temporary hiatus during Egypt's presidential election, which Mr Sisi won by an overwhelming margin.      Before its cancellation, the show had been due to return later this week. ||||| Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Freedom Awards after accepting an award in New York City, on November 26, 2013.      Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists'... Read More      Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Freedom Awards after accepting an award in New York City, on November 26, 2013. Close      Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef said his popular political satire show won’t return to Egyptian television screens, amid a crackdown on media as former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi prepares to take over the presidency.      Youssef, known as Egypt’s Jon Stewart, said at a Cairo press conference that the Saudi-owned channel MBC, which has been broadcasting his show, has come under pressure to take it off the air. Youssef said the program won’t be shown on another channel because of “the atmosphere surrounding the media,” the state-run Ahram Gate website reported.      El-Sisi, who won a landslide victory in last week’s presidential election, has presided over restrictions on media since he led the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in July last year.      Journalists from the Qatar-based news channel Al-Jazeera are being prosecuted on terrorism-related charges. Human Rights Watch said in February, when the Jazeera trial began, that it showed “how fast the space for dissent in Egypt is evaporating.”      Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood were among the favorite targets for Youssef’s satire. After an interlude, he returned to the airwaves in October and poked fun at the army-worship that gripped the country after El-Sisi led the military takeover.      His then-broadcaster CBC suspended the show for attacking “symbols of the state.” MBC picked up the program in February.      Youssef said his team has taped a final episode of the show, Al Bernameg, without expecting that it will ever reach the country’s screens because it “won’t be allowed to continue on any channel inside Egypt.”.

Youssef's announcement came after his host channel, MBC-Misr, suspended his show during Egypt's recent presidential election campaign. This marks a significant change for Youssef, who was once the poster-boy for Egypt's post-revolutionary gains, and highlights the current issues surrounding free speech in the country."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime. Australian computer software designer Sarah Huang is seven months pregnant but still working full-time in her Bangkok office. She says the city is \\"definitely a place I want to stay for the next five, ten years\\". Nannies and home help are affordable, but high fees for quality... Question: The main purpose of the passage is to - explain the reasons for Bangkok's rapid economic growth over the past 30 years - promote the many attractions Bangkok has to offer tourists visiting the city - describe the attractions of living in Bangkok for foreign business people - compare the lifestyles of Burmese workers and foreign business people in Bangkok","output":"describe the attractions of living in Bangkok for foreign business people"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Imagine looking for your lost dog. You step into a cave . But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags  and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned   animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros  , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck? There is one thing the paintings seem to tell us. The Cro- Magnons were interested in the world. They looked at beauty and they understood it. Question: Most of the drawings in the caves are about   _  . Options: A: boys B: tools C: dead men D: animals Answer:","output":"Most of the drawings in the caves are about D: animals. The article describes the cave paintings found in the Lascaux caves, which were created by the ancient Cro-Magnon people 17,000 years ago. The majority of paintings mentioned in the article feature animals such as horses, deer, bison, bulls, cows, stags, a bear, and a thinoceros. There are also some other scenes depicted, like a dead man and a bird, but these are less common compared to the numerous depictions of animals. In the Great Hall of Bulls, for example, there is a picture of bulls and horses in many colors, with some of the animals being as large as 18 feet long. Other paintings mentioned include the Little Horses and various drawings of multicolored animals on the ceiling. While the Cro-Magnon people's motive behind creating these beautiful drawings on cave walls is not entirely clear, it is apparent that most of the drawings depict animals, which seems to suggest their fascination and connection with the natural world and its beauty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The paint was peeling off the schoolhouse, but not the gymnasium because the  OPT: [i] schoolhouse is in indirect sunlight.. [ii] gymnasium is in indirect sunlight..","output":"The paint was peeling off the schoolhouse, but not the gymnasium because the gymnasium is in indirect sunlight.  Step 1: Understand the context of the text. Step 2: Determine the most appropriate option (i or ii) based on the given information. Step 3: Verify the correctness of the chosen option for maintaining the flow and continuity of the text. Step 4: Continue the text while keeping the focus on the chosen option. The indirect sunlight helped protect the gymnasium's paint from the harsh effects of direct exposure to UV rays, which can cause fading, chalking, and eventually peeling. This was an essential asset for the preservation of the gymnasium's appearance and structural integrity. Step 5: Add relevant information to further elaborate on the chosen option. Step 6: Ensure that the new information is consistent with the existing text and adds value to the story. On the other hand, the schoolhouse, located on the opposite side of the campus, faced the brunt of direct sunlight. This prolonged exposure led to the deterioration of its once vibrant colors and caused cracks in the exposed wood. Step 7: Continue describing the condition of the schoolhouse to clarify the contrast between the two buildings. Step 8: Illustrate the effect of sunlight on the paint and structure. Unfortunately, the budget for maintenance had been limited, and repainting the schoolhouse was not a top priority. As a result, students, teachers, and visitors were often struck by the striking difference between the well-maintained gymnasium and the aging schoolhouse. Step 9: Introduce a possible reason for the situation. Step 10: Describe the reaction of people interacting with the buildings. In an effort to raise funds for the schoolhouse's much-needed renovation, the community came together to organize a series of fundraising events. These events were held in the gymnasium, showcasing its pristine condition and highlighting the urgency of restoring the schoolhouse. Step 11: Describe a possible resolution to the problem. Step 12: Explain how the fundraising events use the gymnasium's condition to emphasize the need for renovation. With every dollar raised and every volunteer's hard work, the hope for a brighter future for the schoolhouse grew. Eventually, it would receive a fresh coat of paint, sealing its cracks and preserving its history, as a testament to the power of community and the importance of maintaining educational environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: An anthropologist gathered observations for two native tribes from southern Africa.  He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin.  But I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  What is an answer for this question: Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","output":"Members of tribe A, with darker skin, will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency. This is because their skin contains a higher amount of melanin, which is the brownish pigment responsible for the color of the skin. Although both tribes spend the majority of the day outside and are exposed to high amounts of UV light, the increased amount of melanin in the skin of tribe A members acts as a natural barrier that blocks UV light from penetrating the skin. The melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, are present in the epidermis of both tribes. However, the melanocytes of tribe A members produce more melanin due to their heredity. This darker pigmentation serves as a protective mechanism against the harmful effects of UV radiation, such as skin damage and increased risk of skin cancer. Despite the protective qualities of melanin, it can pose a challenge when it comes to vitamin D synthesis. Exposure to UV light stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D, which is essential for several bodily functions, including calcium absorption and bone health. Since melanin in tribe A members prevents UV light from reaching the inner layers of their skin, they may not produce sufficient vitamin D levels compared to tribe B, whose lighter skin allows for more efficient vitamin D production. However, it is important to note that this is a generalized observation and that individual risk factors and lifestyle choices play important roles in determining a person's overall risk for vitamin D deficiency. For example, diet and access to vitamin D supplements may influence the levels of this essential nutrient among members of both tribes in the long run. Climate, season, clothing, and cultural practices may also influence exposure to UV light and therefore impact their ability to produce vitamin D. In conclusion, members of tribe A with darker skin are at a higher risk of developing vitamin D deficiency compared to members of tribe B with light skin. This is primarily due to the higher melanin levels in their skin which block UV light from stimulating vitamin D production. However, external factors, such as diet and access to supplements, can play a role in mitigating this risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Who was the wife of the Greek hero Agamemnon who murdered him on his return from Troy?","output":"The wife of the Greek hero Agamemnon, who murdered him upon his return from Troy, was Clytemnestra.  Clytemnestra is a significant character in Greek mythology and literature. Primarily known for her role in the narrative of the Trojan War, her character also appears in various myths, epic poems, and dramatic tragedies. She was the daughter of Tyndareus, King of Sparta, and Queen Leda, making her the sister of Helen of Troy, whose abduction instigated the Trojan War. Clytemnestra married Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae and a key figure in the war against Troy. Her infamous motivation for murder stems from a complex web of deceit, power struggles, and retributive bloody vengeance. Before the Trojan War, faced with unfavorable winds that prevented the Greek fleet from setting sail, Agamemnon was told by the seer Calchas that the winds would only change if he sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to the goddess Artemis. Agamemnon deceived Clytemnestra into thinking that their daughter was to be married to the hero Achilles, but instead, upon their arrival, Iphigenia was tragically sacrificed. This is widely taken to be the root of Clytemnestra's abhorrence for Agamemnon, and her eventual decision to plot his murder. During the ten years of Agamemnon's absence in the Trojan War, Clytemnestra began an affair with Aegisthus, who was the cousin and mortal enemy of Agamemnon. Aegisthus felt he was the rightful heir to the throne of Mycenae, as Agamemnon's father, Atreus, had killed Aegisthus's brothers. Fueled by her resentment towards Agamemnon and influenced by her lover's thirst for power, Clytemnestra formed a plot to murder her husband. Upon his victorious but weary return from Troy, Agamemnon was greeted by an apparently dutiful Clytemnestra, who prepared a lavish bath for him. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, Clytemnestra had placed a net or a robe over the bath, which entangled Agamemnon when he arose, leaving him helplessly trapped. Clytemnestra then murdered him, with some sources stating she struck him with an axe.  This act of treachery caused outrage among the Greek society of the time, and Clytemnestra’s actions are often discussed in light of an early debate about femininity, power, and morality. Her reputation in subsequent Greek tragedies is frequently that of a manipulative, deadly woman whose actions led to her own downfall, typically portrayed as being murdered in retaliation by her and Agamemnon’s son, Orestes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Take the soot-stained fabric outdoors and gently shake off any excess soot. Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don’t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary. If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric – ultimately making it harder to clean. For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible. Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process. If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours. If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture. Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine.  Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method. Don’t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed. Otherwise, this could permanently set the stain in the fabric.","output":"The article provides detailed step-by-step instructions on how to effectively remove soot stains from fabric by shaking off excess soot, rinsing with cold water, soaking in laundry detergent, washing with bleach, and making sure the stain is fully removed before drying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hand-washing is the cheapest way of controlling disease but less than one third of men and two thirds of women wash their hands with soap after going to the toilet, a British study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine showed. But when prompted by an electronic message flashing up on a board asking: \\"Is the person next to you washing with soap?,\\" around 12 percent more men and 11 percent more women used soap. Health authorities around the world are stepping up efforts to persuade people to be more hygienic and wash their hands properly to help slow the spread of H1N1 swine flu, which was declared a pandemic  by the World Health Organization in June. \\"Hand-washing with soap has been ranked the most effective way for the worldwide control of disease,\\" the study's authors wrote. \\"It could save more than a million lives a year from diarrhoeal diseases, and prevent respiratory  infections -- the biggest causes of child mortality  in developing countries.\\" In developed nations, hand-washing can help prevent the spread of viral infections like flu and sickness and diarrhea bugs like norovirus and rotavirus, as well as hospital-acquired infections like MRSA and C-difficile, the authors said.

Please answer the following question: Background: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot.  Paragraph: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to  2 1/2 inches high. The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta? Answer:","output":"Given the information in the paragraph above, Jack would enjoy playing golf more at the Aurora Country Club. The reason for this is that the grass at the Aurora Country Club is cut to a height of 2 1/2 inches, which is shorter than the 4-inch grass at the Augusta Country Club. As mentioned, Jack prefers to play on turf where the ball rolls easier, and shorter grass generally provides a smoother surface for the ball to roll on.

In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate  but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan. He heads out to search the car yards to find his dream machine.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Bure was born in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. At age 16, Bure began his professional hockey career playing for CSKA Moscow. He was invited to the senior club's training camp for the 1987-88 season. Although he was deemed too young, and not yet ready, for the Soviet League, Bure earned minimal playing time filling in for absent regulars. He made his debut in September 1987, and played five games for the senior team, scoring his only goal in his first game.  Bure joined the club full-time in 1988-89 and amassed 17 goals, a Soviet League record for rookies. The record would last for 18 years until Alexei Cherepanov scored 18 goals in 2006-07. Bure added 9 assists for 26 points to earn the league's rookie of the year honours. His individual success helped CSKA Moscow capture their thirteenth consecutive Soviet championship and twelfth consecutive IIHF European Cup in 1989 (they repeated as European champions the following year).  As a member CSKA, Bure joined a lineup that featured several future NHL players, including linemates Sergei Fedorov and Alexander Mogilny, as well as Igor Larionov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Sergei Makarov, and Vladimir Konstantinov. The combination of Bure, Fedorov and Mogilny formed a promising combination for head coach Viktor Tikhonov, with expectations to replace the previous top Soviet line, the K-L-M combination of Vladimir Krutov, Larionov and Makarov. The trio was short-lived, as Mogilny defected to play for the Buffalo Sabres in 1989, and Fedorov joined the Detroit Red Wings the following year.  In his third and final season with the Red Army, Bure tied for the lead in team-scoring with Valeri Kamensky, tallying 46 points. His 35 goals was second in the league, one goal behind Ramil Yuldashev of Sokil Kyiv. Bure turned down a three-year contract extension in August 1991, which resulted in him being left off the roster of the Soviet team for the Canada Cup. Was it the Rangers?","output":"No, it was not the Rangers. Pavel Bure played for the CSKA Moscow hockey team when he started his professional hockey career at age 16.

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about  Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.

Summarize the following: hoose the right beer. Gone are the days when you thought beer only came out of a keg and into a red plastic cup. There are an infinite amount of varieties out there, meaning there's a beer out there that matches your ideal taste. Here's a brief and not-at-all comprehensive rundown (that would take ages):   Ales. These ferment quickly and are generally a bit sweeter, fuller-bodied, and have a fruity flavor. Indian Pale Ales (IPAs) have more hops and are generally bitter. This category includes pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, barley wines, brown ales and tripels. Watch out for tripels – they've been fermented several times and can knock you off your feet.  Lagers. These ferment slowly and tend to have a \\"crisper\\" flavor than ales and are, in general, less \\"hoppy.\\" Think of  Heineken, Bud Light, Natural Light, Harp, Corona, Miller Genuine Draft – these are all light lagers. This category also includes pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks and marzens.  Stouts. These really fall under the \\"ale\\" umbrella, but they are their own beast. A stout is dark and often creamy, with tastes of chocolate and coffee undertones. There's also oatmeal and oyster stouts, too. For these, think Guinness, Beamish, and Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stouts.  Bitters. These are English ales that have a deep bronze look and a well-hopped flavor (in other words, bitter). In general, they have greater depth than IPAs. It's hard to qualify their taste beyond that as there are several categories: session or ordinary bitter, best or regular bitter and premium or strong bitter (often called Extra Special Bitters (ESB)).  Wheat Beer (or Hefeweizen). This is an ale with a light yet hazy appearance. It often has a slight banana or clove flavor. Sometimes it's spicy or apple-y, too. It's not bitter and it's often served with a wedge of lemon. Just like red wines and white wines (and hard liquors) need to be treated differently and put it in different glasses, the same goes for different varieties of beer. Here's a few things to consider:   Mugs – good for IPAs, red, black, brown, and blonde American Ales, Pilsner, English Stouts, smoked beer, witbier, American and English Porters  Pint glasses – good for American Ales, IPAs, Pale Ales, English Bitter and mild English Ales, cream ales, dark Lager and Stouts.  Goblets: Belgian IPAs and strong, dark ales, quadruples and tripels  Pilsner glasses: Vienna and Japanese lagers, Euro dark and strong lagers, American malt liquors, pale and red lagers, doppelbocks  Weizen glasses: Dark and pale wheat ales, and all \\"weizens\\" Beer pairs just as well – if not better – with food like wine. And in general, it's the same idea: lighter foods like salads and fish go with lighter beers. Heavier foods and meatier meats go with darker beers. You should also pair \\"regional\\" beers with food of that region. Apart from that, here are a few things to remember:  Does your beer have a caramel, cocoa or coffee flavor? Pair it with a smokey flavor, like with char-grilled foods. Is your beer hoppy? This can provide an herbal contract to fattier foods, like salmon, pizza, and fried foods. Is your beer sweet and fruity? Think appetizer plates, like grapes, cheeses, and bruschetta.","output":"There is a vast array of beer varieties available, each with unique tastes and characteristics. Ales ferment fast, are a bit sweeter and fuller-bodied with a fruity flavor. Indian Pale Ales have a higher hops content and are bitter, with types including pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, and others.  Lagers ferment slowly and have a crisp flavor, generally less hoppy. Examples include Heineken, Bud Light, and other light lagers, alongside pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks, and marzens.

Bitters denote English ales with a deep bronze look and well-hopped bitter flavor. Wheat Beer, or Hefeweizen, is a light, hazy ale with banana or clove flavors. The type of glassware also matters, with mugs suited for IPAs and ales, pint glasses for American Ales and IPAs, goblets for Belgian IPAs, Pilsner glasses for lagers, and Weizen glasses for ales and 'weizens'.  Lastly, the pairing of beer with food can enhance the dining experience. Similar to wine, lighter beers compliment salads and fish, while darker beers are ideal with heavier meats. Regional beers also pair well with dishes from their area. Key flavor pairing includes caramel, cocoa, or coffee-flavored beers with smokey foods, hoppy beers with fatty foods and sweet and fruity beers with appetizers like cheese and bruschetta."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pearson and Son' in 1964 and was incorporated into the 'Allied English Potteries Group.' Later on, 'Royal Doulton' became a part of this group. On the other hand, the second statement expresses, \\"In 1964 the company became S. Pearson and Son and was part of the Allied English Potteries Group, later acquired by Royal Doulton.\\" This suggests that the company transformed into 'S. Pearson and Son' in 1964 and was a component of the 'Allied English Potteries Group.' Later, it states that 'Royal Doulton' acquired the entire group, which is quite a divergence from the first statement. Therefore, these statements do not convey the same meaning. The primary point of divergence is the role of 'Royal Doulton,' which, according to the first statement, joined the group, while as per the second statement, acquired the group.  These subtleties significantly affect the historical consequences and relations within these organizations. Consequently, complete clarity in such information is crucial for accuracy and should not be mistaken as achieving similar meaning.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What authority did Neilston remain under until 1975?, using the article: Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire County Council, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of Strathclyde. In 1903, Neilston was within the Paisley Small Debt Court District and Poor Combination. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the Renfrew District of Strathclyde until the two-tier regions and districts of Scotland were abolished. Since 1996 it has formed part of the unitary East Renfrewshire council area; East Renfrewshire Council is the local authority.

Movie title: Wanted Movie plot: In Chicago, 24-year-old Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) works at a dead-end desk job with an overbearing boss, takes anti-anxiety medication for panic attacks, and has an unfaithful live-in girlfriend who cheats on him with his friend and colleague, Barry (Chris Pratt). One night at the pharmacy, Wesley is told by a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) that his recently murdered father was an assassin, and the killer, a man named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), is now hunting him. Cross and Fox engage in a shoot-out with hi-tech guns. Wesley panics and runs into the parking lot followed by Cross who steals a truck and attempts to run Wesley down. Fox flips Wesley into her car and then calmly executes a spectacular escape. Wesley awakens in the headquarters of the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins. The group's leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), explains that Wesley's panic attacks are actually the untrained expression of a rare ability that allows Wesley's body to distribute massive amounts of adrenaline, granting superhuman strength, speed, and heightened perception. Sloan wants to teach him to control this ability, and to become an assassin and join their cause. Wesley initially panics and returns to his former life. The next morning, he discovers that his bank account now contains several million dollars. The discovery changes his outlook on life, and during a tirade from his boss, Wesley snaps and delivers a public diatribe. Afterward, he picks up a keyboard and during his exit, hits Barry's face with it. Fox arrives while Wesley is outside looking at newspaper headlines of the previous night's events. Wesley is trained for his new life and is soon shown the Loom of Fate, which gives the names of future targets through errors in the fabric.

Answer:","output":"The group's leader in the movie \\"Wanted\\" is Sloan, portrayed by Morgan Freeman. He is in charge of the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins that recruits and trains Wesley Gibson, played by James McAvoy. Sloan is the one who explains Wesley's unique abilities and offers him the chance to join their cause as a trained assassin. He is also the person who has the ability to interpret messages from the Loom of Fate, which dictates the targets for the assassins to eliminate. The movie's title, \\"Wanted,\\" likely refers to the fact that Wesley Gibson goes from his mundane life to becoming a hunted and sought-after individual, both by the killers who are after him and the group who wishes to recruit him. The movie's plot revolves around Wesley's discovery of his hidden abilities and his transformation into a skilled assassin. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey as Wesley learns to harness his newfound powers, and starts to question the true intentions of the Fraternity and its mysterious leader, Sloan. To decide whether to invest in this film proposal, you may want to consider the following factors: 1. The film's genre and target audience: \\"Wanted\\" can be categorized as an action thriller, likely catering to an audience that enjoys fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping movies with complex plots. 2. Cast and crew: The movie features well-known actors such as James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, and Morgan Freeman, which can help attract viewers and generate interest. Additionally, consider the reputation and past works of the film's director and production team in evaluating the likelihood of the movie's success. 3. Commercial and critical success potential: Analyze the market trends for similar movies, and research potential reception by critics and audience members. This will help you understand if the film has the potential to become a profitable venture. 4. Budget and revenue projections: Carefully review the film's proposed budget and revenue projections, ensuring they are realistic and in line with industry standards. Consider factors such as production costs, marketing expenses, and potential box office performance. 5. Overall appeal and uniqueness: Assess the movie's plot, characters, and general themes to determine if they are engaging, innovative, and capable of standing out from other films in the same genre.

Mike Mussina pitched three-hit ball for eight innings and struck out a season-high 11, leading the New York Yankees over the Kansas City Royals 4-0 Tuesday night. Pick your answer from: a. World b. Sports c. Business d. Science/Tech","output":"This passage is about Sports. The text describes a baseball game in which Mike Mussina, a pitcher for the New York Yankees, performed exceptionally well by pitching three-hit ball for eight innings and striking out a season-high 11 players. This outstanding performance contributed to the New York Yankees' victory over the Kansas City Royals with a score of 4-0 on a Tuesday night. Baseball is a widely-followed sport, particularly in the United States, where it is considered a national pastime. It involves two competing teams with nine players each, taking turns to bat and field. The objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents by successfully striking a pitched ball, running around the bases, and reaching the home plate. In this specific game report, Mike Mussina's standout performance as a pitcher played a crucial role in the Yankees' win. In baseball, the pitcher is a defensive player whose primary task is to throw the ball from the pitching mound toward the catcher behind the home plate, with the intent of getting the opposing batters out. Achieving a high number of strikeouts, as Mussina did by striking out 11 players, can be particularly influential in determining the outcome of a game, as it prevents the opposing team from scoring runs. Overall, this passage showcases the impact of an individual's performance in a baseball game, illustrating the significance of skilled athletes within the larger context of a sports event. As it highlights a baseball game and its impressive outcome, this passage can be classified within the Sports category."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Fuel mixes with air - Mix gets inducted into cylinder - Piston compresses the mix - Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion - Combustion gases expand - Pushes piston during power stroke - Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose power stroke will push piston happens, how will it affect MORE power being generated by the engine.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis and evaluate its effect on the overall process step-by-step. Perturbation hypothesis: If more power is generated during the power stroke when the piston is pushed down. 1. Fuel mixes with air: No direct effect on this step. The proportion of fuel and air can be adjusted to deliver more power, as long as it's within the engine's capabilities and tolerances. 2. Mix gets inducted into the cylinder: No direct effect, but to generate more power, a larger volume of the fuel-air mix might have to be inducted into the cylinder, which may require adjustments in the intake system. 3. Piston compresses the mix: No direct effect, although higher compression ratios could lead to more power generation due to increased efficiency in the combustion process. 4. Spark plug emits a spark that ignites the mix causing combustion: No direct effect. However, optimal ignition timing is critical for maximizing power. Too advanced or delayed ignition can reduce power output and efficiency. 5. Combustion gases expand: This is where the perturbation hypothesis takes effect. If the power stroke generates more power, it means the combustion gases expand with more force, leading to increased piston movement and subsequently more mechanical energy being produced. 6. Pushes piston during the power stroke: Directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. A more powerful power stroke will push the piston down with greater force, converting more of the combustion energy into mechanical energy. 7. Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tailpipe: No direct effect, but a more powerful combustion process might lead to increased exhaust gas pressure, potentially requiring adjustments in the exhaust system to maintain efficiency. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have a direct effect on the power stroke, which can lead to more power being generated by the engine. This can, in turn, affect other aspects of the engine operation (intake system, compression ratio, ignition timing, and exhaust system), which can be adjusted to optimize the overall performance and efficiency of the engine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Story is here to find the Author, a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber, Bell, Dury, and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran, who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Vick meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden Story from being attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that because Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To recover from her wounds and return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast émigré turned film critic, to help him figure out the others' identities.

This is simultaneously flirty and straightforward, a perfect combination. Instead of asking a yes-or-no “can I have your number?” question, offer two choices. “Could I have your phone number or email?” This way, they are more likely to give you a definite means of contacting them. Although business cards are less commonly held by today's youth, swapping business cards is a great way to get someone’s contact.

Today, we're going to talk about a cricket game. Do you know what cricket is? It's a fun sport where two teams try to score points by hitting a ball with a bat and running. The team with the most points at the end wins the game. Now, let's talk about a game between Scotland and Sri Lanka.  Once upon a time, Scotland and Sri Lanka were getting ready to play a cricket game. This wasn't just any game; it was a \\"warm-up game\\" in Kent. Warm-up games are like practice games before the big, important games. Scotland and Sri Lanka played this warm-up game on a Tuesday. Scotland is a country full of mountains, castles, and people who wear clothes called kilts. Sri Lanka is an island shaped like a teardrop, with beautiful beaches, forests, and animals like elephants and leopards. Both countries have cricket teams that are full of players who want to be the best. In this warm-up game, Scotland didn't do very well. They lost by a big number: nine whole points! In cricket, that's called a \\"nine-wicket hammering.\\" This means Sri Lanka's team played really well and scored a lot of points, while Scotland's team couldn't keep up. Both teams played two warm-up games, and this was the second one. The players probably learned a lot from these games and will try to do better in their big, important games that will come later. Even though Scotland didn't win this time, they'll keep practicing and try their best in the future. And remember, kids: it's not about winning or losing, it's about having fun and learning how to get better at something you enjoy.

Price of crude leaps after false reports lane had already been closed off. Cheney calls for airstrike after Iran's refusal to hand back downed spy plane. Iranian fury over Congress calls to assassinate key members of their Revolutionary Guard.","output":"Title: Crisis Looms Over the World's Most Important Oil Shipping Lane The world's most important oil shipping lane, a four-mile-wide strait that serves as a crucial transit point for crude oil, has recently become the center of a growing international crisis. The situation escalated rapidly following false reports of the lane being closed off, triggering a dramatic leap in the price of crude oil. It further intensified with the former US Vice President Dick Cheney's call for an airstrike in response to Iran's refusal to return a downed spy plane. In a separate, yet related occurrence, Iranian officials expressed fury over calls from the US Congress to assassinate key members of their Revolutionary Guard. At the heart of this crisis lies the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which an estimated 20 million barrels of oil pass every day. Accounting for roughly a third of the world's seaborne oil trade, this narrow strait serves as a critical lifeline for the global economy, connecting major oil producers in the Middle East to key markets across the world. The strait's importance makes it a potential flashpoint for tensions between Iran and Western powers, particularly the United States. The situation began spiraling out of control when false reports surfaced claiming that the strait had already been closed off. While the source of these reports remains unclear, the impact on global oil markets was immediate, with the price of crude oil skyrocketing. This further underscored the strait's vital role in maintaining the stability of world oil prices and highlighted the potential consequences of its disruption. Adding fuel to the fire, former US Vice President Dick Cheney called for an airstrike following Iran's refusal to hand back a downed American spy plane. This demand intensified the already strained relationship between the two nations, raising concerns that an armed conflict could potentially break out in the region. The United States has been known to maintain a strong military presence in the area, with naval forces constantly patrolling to ensure the free flow of oil through the shipping lane. In an alarming series of events, Iranian officials became increasingly furious over calls from some members of the US Congress to assassinate key figures in their Revolutionary Guard. This elite military force, responsible for defending the Iranian government and its interests at home and abroad, has long been regarded as a formidable power in the region. The call for their assassination not only infuriates Iranian officials but also risks further destabilizing the situation in the Strait of Hormuz. As tensions continue to rise, the stakes for all parties involved grow ever higher. With millions of barrels of oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz daily and economies around the world relying on its smooth operation, any disruption could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. Furthermore, an armed conflict in the region could lead to unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences, affecting not only the supply of oil but also global security and stability. In conclusion, the significance of the Strait of Hormuz in the global oil market makes this brewing crisis especially alarming. The recent developments, including false reports of lane closure, calls for airstrikes, and proposed assassinations, have heightened tensions and created an increasingly precarious situation in this vital area. As the world watches closely, it is essential for all involved parties to exercise caution, adopt diplomatic approaches, and work toward a peaceful resolution to protect and preserve the region's stability, as well as the world's interconnected economies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The number of people killed in Haiti by the devastating effects of Hurricane Matthew was reported to have risen to at least 478 on Friday as rescue workers and aid agencies battled to reach remote areas of the country, assess the damage and deliver relief. The hurricane, which hit Haiti on Tuesday, brought 145mph winds and torrential rains that destroyed more than 3,200 homes, displaced 15,000 people, ruined plantations and drowned animals. With communications still down in many of the worst-affected areas, it will take days before a definitive death toll can be established. The government puts the number of dead at 122, Radio Television Caraibes at 264, while Hervé Fourcand, a senator for the Sud department, said more than 300 people had died in the region and local officials speaking to Reuters put the toll at 478. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimates that more than one million Haitians have been affected, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. It has launched an appeal for £5.8m to help provide medical relief, shelter, water and sanitation over the next year. By Friday morning Matthew was battering Florida, becoming the first major hurricane threatening a direct hit on the United States in more than 10 years. Efforts to access the worst-affected areas of Haiti – including the Grand’Anse and Sud departments – were at first hampered by flooding, the collapse of communications networks and the destruction of a key bridge. As the weather cleared, Haitian authorities, the UN and national and international non-governmental organisations were getting a better idea of the scale of the destruction. The airport in the capital, Port-au-Prince, reopened for humanitarian flights and communication was being restored to cut-off areas. “Several dozen” were killed in the coastal town of Les Anglais in Sud Department, said Louis Paul Raphael, the central government’s representative in the region. Inland in nearby Chantal, the toll rose to 90 late in the evening, the town’s mayor said. Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, the head of the country’s civil protection directorate, warned the death toll was likely to rise as emergency workers reached the stricken regions. “We do know there’s a lot of damage in the Grand’Anse, and we also know human life has been lost there,” she told the Associated Press. The port city of Les Cayes in Sud was also feared to have suffered badly. “The situation in Les Cayes is catastrophic, the city is flooded, you have trees lying in different places and you can barely move around,” its deputy mayor, Claudette Regis Delerme, told Reuters. The devastation in Haiti prompted authorities to postpone a presidential election scheduled for Sunday. Many victims were killed by falling trees, flying debris and swollen rivers when Matthew hit on Tuesday with winds of 145 miles per hour (230 kph). Most of the fatalities were in towns and fishing villages around the western end of Tiburon peninsula in Haiti’s south-west, a region of white Caribbean beaches and rivers backed by hills. The storm passed directly through the peninsula, driving the sea inland and flattening homes on Monday and Tuesday. Yvonne Helle, the UN Development Programme’s Haiti director, said while the lack of access made getting precise numbers impossible at this stage, the scale of the damage was clearly enormous. She said the UNDP had received reports that up to 98% of the city of Jérémie, in Grand’Anse department, had been destroyed. “It has an old historical centre and the old houses have been completely destroyed, ripped to shreds,” she said. “There are aerial pictures of the level destruction and it’s mind-boggling.” Aid groups struggled to communicate with people in Grand’Anse. The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) said agricultural fields in Jérémie had been “decimated”. “Houses in some areas like Jeremie and Dame Marie, which are difficult to access in normal times, are almost entirely destroyed and there are other areas where we don’t know how bad the damage was yet,” said CRS’s senior regional information officer for Latin America and the Caribbean, Robyn Fieser. “Shelter is a huge concern”. Fieser said there was also an immediate need for food and water in the southern port town of Les Cayes as there are “scores” of people in shelters without access to them. Enzo di Taranto, the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Haiti, said the agency was also waiting for a report on the northwest, where it was impossible for aircraft to fly until Thursday. “There has also been some damage in the northwest, but we have no information whatsoever at this stage,” Taranto said. The UN described the hurricane as Haiti’s worst humanitarian crisis since the devastating earthquake six years ago. The rains and flooding have prompted fears of a surge in the cholera epidemic that has killed almost 10,000 people since the disease was accidentally introduced to Haiti by UN peacekeepers. Helle said the 50-60cm of rain that had fallen in some areas had caused graves to open and flooded pit latrines. “I think there are going to be serious, serious health concerns that will lead to communicable diseases related to water and sanitation,” she said. “I’m very worried about that and obviously we still have cholera and this will have an effect on our ability to control that.” Action Aid issued a similar warning. Its country director, Yolette Etienne, said that more than 500,000 men, women and children urgently needed food, clean drinking water and safe shelter. “Cholera is now a real danger as the already extremely poor sanitation system has been totally overwhelmed by flooding and heavy rainfall meaning the disease could spread quickly,” she said. “The situation is even worse in the shelters which often don’t even have enough toilet and are short of clean drinking water.” According to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 15,263 people displaced by the hurricane have been placed in 152 shelters. World Vision, which managed to get staff out to remote areas by helicopter on Wednesday, said sanitation, food and looking after children were its main concerns. “Our teams are seeing a lot of damage, a lot of destruction and a lot of distress,” said Julie Lee, the charity’s spokeswoman in Haiti. “Our biggest worry is children, who are most vulnerable in these times of disasters. We’re also worried about the crop damage … right now, this hurricane is wiping out the Congo bean crop, the sorghum crop – basically staples of the Haitian diet.” The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) and its children’s agency, Unicef, began mobilising resources. WFP arranged enough food supplies to feed 300,000 people for a month, with a further 34 tonnes of food on standby in Miami. Unicef was preparing life-saving aid for 10,000 people in Haiti, while World Vision is to provide water and sanitation help to 50,000 families. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation was poised to deliver seeds to affected areas to help farmers rebuild their livelihoods. US military personnel and nine helicopters were expected to arrive in Port-au-Prince over the coming days to help the relief effort. In Aquin, a town outside Les Cayes, people braved the mud to see what Matthew had done to their clapboard houses and tiny shops. Like many Haitians who were reluctant to leave their homes for fear of losing their personal belongings, Cenita Leconte had initially ignored official calls to evacuate as the hurricane hit. Eventually, however, she gave in – and in doing so probably saved her life. “We’ve lost everything we own,” Leconte, 75, told AP. “But it would have been our fault if we stayed here and died.” In 2010 a magnitude 7 earthquake wrecked Port-au-Prince, killing upward of 200,000 people. However, the impact of this tragedy has been felt most in remote but populated areas far from the capital’s support. “We have nothing left to survive on, all the crops have gone, all fruit trees are down, I don’t have a clue how this is going to be fixed,” said Marc Soniel Noel, the deputy mayor of Chantal.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. has manual shutter speed Make this proper case","output":"Manual Shutter Speed Manual shutter speed refers to the ability of a camera to allow the user to manually set the time for which the sensor or film is exposed to light during the process of capturing an image. It is an integral feature of photography, as it permits the user to control the amount of light that enters the camera and reaches the sensor or film. This control, in turn, affects the image's brightness, color, and sharpness. Shutter speed is commonly measured in seconds and fractions of a second. A faster shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000 of a second) allows less light to enter the camera, resulting in a sharper capture of fast-moving subjects and minimizing the chances of motion blur. Conversely, a slower shutter speed (e.g., 1/10 of a second) permits more light to enter the camera, which can create a desirable motion blur for artistic purposes or reveal greater detail in low-light conditions. In addition to its artistic benefits, manual shutter speed grants photographers the ability to capture specific types of photos that are difficult or impossible to achieve using automatic settings. Some examples of such situations include: 1. Action photography - Sports, wildlife, and other fast-moving subjects require the ability to freeze motion by using a faster shutter speed to obtain sharp images without blur. 2. Low-light photography - In dimly lit environments, slowing down the shutter speed can help to gather more light and capture details that would otherwise be lost in darkness. 3. Long exposure photography - Utilizing a slow shutter speed with a tripod can produce stunning images of star trails, light painting, or smooth water effects in a waterfall or river scene. 4. High dynamic range (HDR) photography - Combining multiple exposures at different shutter speeds can lead to images with a broader range of tonality, detail, and color in high-contrast scenes. When using manual shutter speed settings, it is essential to understand the relationship between shutter speed, aperture (f-stop), and ISO. Collectively known as the \\"exposure triangle,\\" these three factors work together to determine the overall exposure of a photograph. Balancing these parameters is crucial to achieve the desired artistic result while maintaining optimal image quality. In conclusion, using manual shutter speed empowers photographers to explore and create unique images by controlling the time the camera sensor or film is exposed to light. It enables them to capture captivating photos of various subjects and under different lighting conditions, which might be difficult to accomplish with automatic camera settings. Having a solid understanding of the exposure triangle allows photographers to achieve stunning results with complete creative control."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Compare the statement with the given question The question asks if \\"Privilege is the normal.\\" In other words, is privilege something that is typical or usual? Step 3: Analyze the answer options Option 1: \\"yes\\" Saying \\"yes\\" would mean that privilege is typical or usual. However, the statement clearly states that privilege is beyond the normal, indicating that it is not typical or usual. Option 2: \\"it is not possible to tell.\\" This option is irrelevant because the statement explicitly states that privilege is above and beyond the normal. So, it's possible to tell whether privilege is the normal or not using the statement. Option 3: \\"no.\\" Saying \\"no\\" would mean that privilege is not typical nor usual, which agrees with the original statement that privilege is above and beyond the normal. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the statement and the provided options, the most appropriate answer is: (3). no."},{"instruction":"Being prepared for the unknown is something most people know we should do, but the majority of us don’t take time to actually do it! We have lived in a state prone to hurricanes for eight years and didn’t really have anything ready in case of a natural disaster. Recently, we moved closer to the coast in this region which forced us to make a hurricane emergency kit. If you don’t feel like putting together your own kit, you can order one from Amazon! Here’s an affiliate link to one that’s for four people. (Four Person Perfect Survival Kit Deluxe) They have several variations to choose from. Preparing a Hurricane Emergency Kit I will walk you through a few things to consider when preparing an emergency kit. Saving Money I would be lying if I didn’t say that I was financially driven to prepare a kit. The state of Virginia has one three-day sales tax holiday weekend beginning the first Friday in August. Yes, saving on tax pushed me to buy a bunch of stuff that I just may need one day. In addition to saving taxes on emergency preparedness items, customers can save tax on clothing, footwear, school supplies, and Energy Star and WaterSense products. For complete details on qualifying items and more, please go to Virginia’s Government Tax Page. Not in Virginia? Search “your state” + “emergency preparedness” or “emergency kit.” You can replace “hurricane” with “earthquake” or “tornado” or any other applicable term for your area. Depending on how much you purchase, the saving on taxes can add up pretty quickly. Be Prepared Before Preparing Heading out on a tax-free shopping spree won’t save you much money if you’re buying items that don’t qualify for the tax-free holiday, or you buy a bunch of items you don’t actually need or won’t use.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware, the software, and to the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How can a computer be attacked?","output":"A computer can be attacked in various ways. Attackers, often referred to as hackers, exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system to gain unauthorized access, corrupt data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious activities. Below are some of the common methods through which a computer can be attacked: 1. **Malware Attacks:** These are among the most common types of attack. Malware is software that is designed to cause damage to a computer system. Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can be introduced to a system via email attachments, software downloads, operating system vulnerabilities, among others. 2. **Phishing Attacks:** In phishing attacks, attackers attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. This is usually done through email spoofing or instant messaging and it often directs users to enter their personal details at a fake website that looks and feels almost identical to the legitimate one. 3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** These occur when attackers insert themselves in the communication between two parties to eavesdrop, steal data or tamper with it. These attacks can happen in any form of online communication, like email or a web browser session.  4. **Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** In these attacks, attackers overwhelm the victim's network, computer, or service with traffic or requests. This causes the system to slow down significantly or even crash, making it impossible for users to access it. 5. **Zero-Day Exploit:** Zero-day attacks occur during the vulnerability window that exists in the time between when a software vulnerability is discovered and when a patch to fix the vulnerability has been developed and deployed. During this time, hackers can exploit the vulnerability to create significant damage. 6. **SQL Injection:** In an SQL injection attack, an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's database query software to gain unauthorized access to information in the database. 7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This type of attack happens when an attacker injects malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts can bypass access controls and can be used to compromise the user's data and privacy. 8. **Password Attack:** There are several types of password attacks, including brute-force, dictionary attacks, keyloggers, and credential reuse attacks. In any case, the attacker's goal is to gain unauthorized access by cracking the user's password. These different types of attacks highlight the need for robust computer security measures, including up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, secure network configurations, regular software updates, and the use of strong, unique passwords. Moreover, user education on identifying potential security threats like phishing attempts is also paramount to maintaining computer security."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can see that \\"Strada\\" appears to be the central subject of this data. It is highlighted repeatedly, suggesting that we're focussing on a location or entity named Strada. From the context, \\"Strada\\" is most likely a restaurant. 2. The 'eatType' attribute is assigned as 'restaurant' for Strada, confirming my previous assumption that Strada indeed is a restaurant. 3. The 'food' category states 'Indian', which is a significant feature. This means that Strada is a restaurant specializing in Indian cuisine. 4. The 'priceRange' is defined as 'cheap'. This indicates that eating at Strada is inexpensive or affordable compared to other restaurants, perhaps making it a good choice for budget-conscious diners. 5. The 'familyFriendly' status is 'no'. This might imply that the restaurant might not offer facilities or an environment suitable for family dinners, kids or could be more oriented towards adult guests. 6. Finally, the 'near' attribute says 'Rainbow Vegetarian Café'. This suggests that Strada is located near another venue known as the Rainbow Vegetarian Café. This may be useful for providing directions or understanding the geographical context of Strada. Based on all these data elements, a comprehensive description can be made: \\"Strada is an affordable restaurant specializing in Indian cuisine. Despite its appeal to those on a budget, it should be noted that the restaurant is not family-friendly, possibly catering more to adults or individuals.

We do this by adding 2874 to both sides of the equation. -479 * g - 2874 + 2874 = 0 + 2874 This simplifies to: -479 * g = 2874 Step 3: Divide both sides by -479 To solve for g, we need to isolate g. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is -479.

Movie plot title: State of Play Movie plot: One night, a thief fleeing through Georgetown in Washington, D.C., is shot by a man carrying a briefcase. A pizza delivery man who witnesses the incident is also shot by the killer and is left in a coma. The following morning, a young woman is killed by a Washington Metro train in what seems to be suicide. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is distraught to hear that the woman was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a lead researcher on his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defense contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. Collins tells his former college roommate and old friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he says is inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide. Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), a reporter and blogger with the online division of Cal's newspaper and its editor, Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren), discover that Sonia's death occurred in one of only three CCTV blind spots in the Metro camera system. Cal believes the shootings are related to Sonia's death and finds a link between the petty thief and a homeless girl who sought out Cal. The girl gives him photographs that the thief, a friend of hers, had stolen from the killer's briefcase. The photos show surveillance images of Sonia talking to a well-dressed man. Della visits the hospital where the pizza delivery man is regaining consciousness. While at his room, she witnesses the pizza delivery man shot dead by an unseen sniper. Later, she reviews CCTV footage and recognizes a man she saw at the hospital.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Most debates have more than one rebuttal, and you should always start with new arguments. They will be fresh on the judge’s mind, so you need to address them as soon as possible.  Make sure to save room in your time allowance to briefly review your other arguments. If you believe you have already won an argument or that the other team dropped one, you can briefly summarize those points at the end of the speech, reminding the judge that they go to you. Provide a one-sentence summary of what your opponent has said. Take it one argument at a time, starting with the one that is either easiest to defeat or the most crucial to your case. Say, “My opponent wants to allow one of the most common allergens into our nation’s schools, regardless of how many students are at risk.” Remind the judge what your argument is, positioning it as the clear better choice over your opponent. Choose your words carefully so that your argument appears to be the most reasonable choice. Say, “A safe educational environment is necessary for all students. We stopped sending students to schools that have asbestos; now we need to stop sending them to schools that have peanuts.” Present the breakdown with your argument framed as the best choice. Make the case seem simple to the judge, but say it in a way that makes it seem like picking the other side is preposterous.  For example, “The choice is simple: We can protect students from life-threatening allergy attacks, or we can allow a few students to eat peanut butter for lunch.” This argument makes it seem like critical health emergencies are being pitted against something as trivial as a sandwich. Link your argument back to the topic, and provide evidence to back it up. Tell the judge why this evidence proves that your argument is superior to your opponent’s argument. This should take several sentences and possibly several minutes, depending on how many arguments you plan to address in your rebuttal.  Never list off your reasons without offering an explanation. Your rebuttal depends on your explanation of the argument. Say, \\"My plan to remove peanut products from schools fulfills the resolution to provide a safe learning environment for kids by removing a known, common hazard. The evidence shows that the threat to allergic individuals is great and that every day the number of allergic students walking the hallways increases. The easiest, least expensive way to protect students is to ban peanut products. Please vote for safe schools by voting for me.\\" You and your opponent may both win arguments within the debate, but the judge still has to pick a winner. Voting issues are the arguments that could make or break a case, so showing that your argument is a voting issue could make the judge choose your side.  For example, relevancy is often a good voting issue because if an argument is not relevant, then it is ineffective. If you show the judge that your opponent has no relevancy on the topic, then that could be a voting issue that goes your way. Say, \\"My opponent argued that we should ban sugary foods instead of peanut butter, but that is not relevant to my case. None of the evidence she provided about the dangers of sugary food should be considered.\\" Briefly summarize your arguments and the voting issues, then urge the judge to vote for you. Say, “The evidence I’ve provided proves that my opponent’s argument lacks relevancy and fails to address the topic. Additionally, my opponent has falsely assumed that peanuts must be ingested to be harmful, which is factually untrue. For these reasons, you should vote for my case.” If you don’t address an argument, it could go to the other team. Even if you are losing an argument, it’s best to offer a short concession in your rebuttal before moving on to your stronger arguments. If your opponent points out that you dropped an argument, it will look worse than if you concede it yourself. You should also watch for arguments that your opponent has dropped. Make sure to point this out to the judge and tell them that you have clearly won that point. Summary:","output":"In a debate, you should start with new arguments and address them quickly. When you speak, briefly review your other points and remind the judge of your argument. Choose your words carefully and make your argument seem like the best choice. Provide evidence to support your argument and explain why your side is better. Show the judge the other side's weaknesses, like if their argument is not relevant. Remember to talk about all points in the debate, even if you're losing. In the end, summarize your arguments and ask the judge to vote for you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds and maybe thousands will gather in Gary, Ind., the Jackson family hometown, to witness the unveiling of a statue to honor the pop icon; his mother Katherine is expected to attend. In Los Angeles fans will gather at Forest Lawn Memorial Park where the King of Pop is entombed. And in Detroit, where it all started, Motown announces today the opening of an exhibit, which will feature photographs from concert performances, television appearances, international tours and the TV cartoon series featuring the Jackson 5. Motown Museum curator Lina Stephens was online Friday, June 25, at Noon ET to talk about the early days of the Jackson 5, the emergence of Michael Jackson as a solo artist and stories of of their lives on the road and on the charts. Lina Stephens: Hello, I'm Lina Stephens, Chief Curator of the Motown Museum. Bethesda, Md.: How was Michael offstage..during the Motown years..his demeanor Lina Stephens: He was a shy, child, he enjoyed playing with his brothers. Los Angeles, Calif.: What would be your thoughts about either moving or having a second museum honoring Michael Jackson in Los Angeles? I ask this because it would be more accessible to more fans than would Gary, and Michael also had strong roots to southern California. Lina Stephens: I have heard that there is to be a Jackson 5 museum in their hometown of Gary, Indiana. However, I do think that Michael is a big enough talent to support a museum anywhere. Fairfax, Va.: Back in the day were the Jackson 5 enamored of the big Motown stars before they themselves became stars? What did the old guard at Motown think of the new young guys? Lina Stephens: They thought that they were talented kids. It was also the beginning of a new era for Motown since the company had moved to LA. Therefore, they were handled in a different manner than the older artists. Washington, D.C.: What will the Motown Museum be doing special today to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Michael's death? Lina Stephens: We have local television and radio stations doing live interviews; we have a Michael Jackson impersonator performing; and, we have the Jackson 5 exhibit in the Museum. We also have Michael Jackson items in the gift shop. Annapolis, Md.: Did Michael and his brothers ever come back for a visit to Motown in Detroit? Lina Stephens: Michael has been to the Museum several times. However, we have no record of his brothers visiting. Orlando, Fla.: What's your fondest memory of Michael? Lina Stephens: Michael Jackson had a way of capturing his audience with a flair that can not be justly described. It is clear that he was a very old soul. Washington, D.C.: What was the reaction at Motown and in Detroit when Michael Jackson had died? Lina Stephens: Pure and utter shock. We got the news by 5:20 p.m. (EST) and by 5:30 p.m., his fans had started to leave tributes in his honor on the steps of the Museum. Washington, D.C.: I just have a comment about Michael Jackson. To me he was a man who loved people and just was not accepted for what he was. He was kind and gentle and in this world that should be the norm but it's considered weird. He was one of if not the best entertainer of all time. His fans seem to see him in a better light than others who made fun of him and made his life a living hell. I don't think we will see anyone of his talent for years to come. Annandale, Va.: Who discovered the Jackson 5? Diana Ross, Gladys Knight? Suzanne de Passe? Lina Stephens: Actually, it was Bobby Taylor of the Vancouvers. Then, Gladys Knight had witnessed the Jackson 5 during a performance at the Apollo Theater in New York. What the?: Am guessing I was born/raised between the two \\"icons\\" of music -- Elvis and MJ -- and so do not quite \\"get\\" their importance. Given this is a MJ chat, what was his definitive contribution to music/culture? Lina Stephens: Michael Jackson achieved a 'first' in a lot of musical milestones: He was the youngest performer to have a #1 hit song and four consecutive #1 hit songs; his album, \\"Thriller\\" is still the best-selling LP of all time; he has had awards created in his name and likeness to award other performers; he was the first African-American artist to have his music videos played on MTV. He also changed the scope of how music videos are traditionally made in that, they were like movie productions that each told a story. His messages of peace and love in his songs and in his philanthropy were not fake. Therefore, millions of people could identify with him and embraced his philosophy as, it did not attack anyone's religious, political or moral views, but it just had a universal appeal. This is what I think makes Michael a phenomenon and why he has so many people, globally, that absolutely adored him. Perryville, Md.: Where the Jackson 5 \\"good boys\\" or were they misbehaved? I've heard stories that MJ was mischievous. Lina Stephens: Yes, all of the Jackson 5 members were good boys. And, yes, Michael liked to play practical jokes, but I think that was to keep things lighthearted on the road. West Palm, Fla: Michael was obviously an profoundly talented child, a prodigy of sorts, but did you have any idea he would become an entertainment icon? Lina Stephens: No, I don't think anyone had an idea that Michael would become all that he did. However, in his musical evolution, his iconic status seemed almost inevitable. Washington, D.C.: What happens at Motown now? Is any recording ever done there anymore? Or is it basically a museum? Lina Stephens: Motown is a Museum. Hollywood, Calif.: Do you remember where you were when MJ died? I do! There is a CNN/HLN host, Jane Velez -- who has covered MJ from the beginning. She should have some fantastic guests on her show \\"Issues\\" tonight. Apparently Michael's father has finally filed a lawsuit -- and I think he could win. So sad.... Lina Stephens: Yes. I had just left work and I had received a call from a local reporter with a confirmation of Michael's passing. That info was the last thing I expected to hear. Hopefully, the events that have occurred after his passing will come to a quick and just resolution and not blemish the memory of Michael. Baltimore, Md.: Did you have any indication back then that Michael Jackson might turn into the person he did and that his end would be tragic? Lina Stephens: Again, I'm not sure that anyone could have predicted the person that Michael would have become. It is very sad that his life would be cut so short. But, as we've seen in history, some of the brightest stars seem to leave us way too soon. Chicago, Ill.: Will anybody move into their home? Lina Stephens: If you are referring to the home in which Michael died, there is someone already occupying it. I believe it is Christian Audigier, the designer of the Ed Hardy line. Neverland Ranch? Not anytime soon. Washington, D.C. : What other Motown stars have come back to visit their old digs? I realize many are dying off and I'm saddened by that. Lina Stephens: Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Joe Billingslea (of the Contours), Duke Fakir (last living original member of The Four Tops), Otis Williams (last living original member of The Temptations), just to name a few!

Summarize this article: For years before the Boston Marathon suspects were identified, American presidents have avoided talking about Chechnya — it’s been a prerequisite demanded by Russia’s leaders for maintaining strong relationships.      President Barack Obama and his administration have been quiet on the continued tensions between Vladmir Putin’s government and the area that is its federal subject. That follows the pattern of his predecessors: Bill Clinton pushed Boris Yeltsin to find a peaceful settlement to what began in 1994 as a war to gain independence from Russia, as did George W. Bush.      Text Size -      +      reset Gov. Patrick: Boston on lockdown Boston Marathon suspects photos      Since taking office, Obama hasn’t said the word “Chechnya” publicly.      But on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry declined to comment on the suspects’ apparent Chechen ties and on whether their involvement would effect relations with Russia. “I’m not going to get into speculation, I’m not going to deal with a hypothetical,” he said.      (PHOTOS: Search for Boston Marathon bombing suspects)      The Obama administration hasn’t done much on Chechnya, but the Treasury and State Departments have taken some action against Chechans.      Defying Putin’s requests, Treasury last week released a list of 18 Russian “specially designated nationals” who face economic sanctions from the United States. The list included two Chechens, Letscha Bogatirov and Kazbek Dukuzov, both of whom are linked to murders.      In 2010, State designated Doku Umarov, the leader of Al Qaeda affiliate Islamic Caucasus Emirate, as a global terrorist in 2010. The designation came after Umarov’s group took responsibility for a double suicide bombing on the Moscow Metro, in which at least 40 people died and more than 100 were injured.      (Also on POLITICO: Reports: Suspects came from abroad)      Umarov’s leadership of Chechen insurgents has “intensified the split between national separatists and radical jihadists and led to a movement seeking to create an Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus with Umarov as the Emir,” the department said in a statement when announcing the move.      The White House referred questions to State, which advises that U.S. citizens not travel to Chechnya and the rest of the North Caucasus region.      Daniel Benjamin, who was then the department’s coordinator for counterterrorism said in 2010 that the designation was “in direct response to the threats posed to United States and Russia.”      “The recent attacks perpetrated by Umarov and his operatives illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem we face today. We stand in solidarity with the Russian people in our condemnation of these deplorable terrorist acts,” Benjamin added.      (Also on POLITICO: Bombing motive: Far from obvious)      Umarov’s group has also taken responsibility for a January 2011 explosion at a Moscow airport that killed 36 people.      Soon after the attack, Umarov said his group would bring “a year of blood and tears” to Russia, though his group was modest in size. “I won’t tell you there are hundreds of us prepared for jihad. But 50 or 60, God willing, we will find,” he said then.      In March 2011, the United Nations Security Council’s Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee added to its list of people associated with Al Qaeda.      Since then, in early 2012, Umarov told his followers to stop attacking Russian civilians and focus on military and security targets.      (Also on POLITICO: Timeline: Search for Boston Marathon bombing suspects)      The Kremlin, meanwhile, has since Sept. 11, 2001, characterized its conflict with Chechens as part of the global war on terror. But Washington has tended to characterize the conflict as an internal issue.      “As regards [to] Chechnya, we still hope a solution can be found in a peaceful way,” Bush said in a 2002 interview. “This is Russia’s domestic problem. In my work with Vladimir Putin, I’ll be trying to direct him towards a peaceful solution to the problem.”      Follow @politico ||||| A Soviet-made tank is seen near the town of Agdam, controlled by Nagorno Karabakh, and which was completely destroyed during fighting between Karabakh and Azerbaijan forces in 1990s, October 29, 2009.      LINE OF CONTACT, Azerbaijan (Reuters) - A dusty trench, interrupted every few meters by lookout posts and gun positions, winds its way as far as the eye can see.      \\"Put your head above the trench and they'll shoot you,\\" says a young ethnic Armenian soldier, peering through a narrow slit in a concrete watchtower at Azeri lines 400 meters away where he says snipers lie in wait.      The bullets fly both ways. On the other side of the minefields, Khosrov Shukurov's daughter was recently shot in the arm. The 70-year-old Azeri farmer keeps his cows on leashes to stop them straying beyond the wall built to protect his village.      Sporadic firefights have intensified along the front line around Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave within Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus controlled by ethnic Armenians since a war in the early 1990s that killed about 30,000 people.      Azerbaijan has stepped up threats to take the region back and its decision to give a hero's welcome to a soldier convicted of hacking an Armenian to death on a NATO course has highlighted the risk of a war that could draw in Turkey, Russia and Iran.      When the ethnic Armenian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence as the Soviet Union collapsed, and took over more Azeri territory outside the region than within it, Christian Armenia avoided direct war with Muslim Azerbaijan.      It now says it would not stand aside if the enclave it helped establish was attacked.      Both it and Azerbaijan have more powerful weapons than two decades ago and if pipelines taking Azeri oil and gas to Europe via Turkey or Armenia's nuclear power station were threatened, war could spread.      Armenia has a collective security agreement with its regional ally Russia, while Azerbaijan has one with Turkey, itself a member of NATO for which an attack on one member state is an attack on all 28.      U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned of a \\"much broader conflict\\" when she visited Armenia in June and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Friday he was \\"deeply concerned\\" by the Azeri soldier's pardon last month.      UPHILL BATTLE      Political and military analysts say war is not inevitable, and that the potential for destruction and a regional war serve as a deterrent. But they are increasingly discussing how a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan might play out.      The most likely trigger is seen as a particularly deadly skirmish on the line of contact between Nagorno-Karabakh-held territory and the rest of Azerbaijan or on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border. Nine people died in clashes in June.      \\"At some moment the crossfire will not be limited to the use of small weapons. One side will hit the other with heavy weapons,\\" said Rasim Musabayov, an independent member of parliament in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.      \\"Then you can see a scenario in which the other side responds with air power and then it all goes from there.\\"      Less likely would be a political decision to go to war - despite Azerbaijan's threats to regain control of Nagorno-Karabakh - or a pre-emptive strike by Armenia or Nagorno-Karabakh if an attack by Azerbaijan seemed imminent.      If a conflict did break out, Azerbaijan would likely try to besiege Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of about 160,000 people linked to Armenia by a narrow land corridor, since the enclave's troops dominate the high ground and have mined elsewhere.      \\"A key factor is the topography, the extent to which Nagorno-Karabakh has created defenses in depth. This could make the lower land killing fields. Progress would come at a high cost,\\" said Wayne Merry, a former U.S. diplomat and an expert on the region at the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington.      The Azeris could also attack the towns of Jebrail and Fuzuli to the south and southeast, outside the enclave before the 1991-94 war but part of the 20 percent of Azerbaijan under ethnic Armenian control since.      \\"SPASMS OF MUTUAL DESTRUCTION\\"      Azerbaijan's annual defense spending is more than Armenia's entire budget, but Armenia has warned of an \\"asymmetrical\\" response to any attack, threatening what Merry called a \\"spasm of mutual destruction\\" fuelled by bitterness from the last war.      Abbas Aliyev, 66, was forced out of Fuzuli as it was seized by ethnic Armenian troops and settled with his wife and four children in the cramped basement of an apartment bloc in Baku where one toilet is shared by 16 families.      He is one of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them Azeris, who cannot return home until the conflict is resolved. \\"I want to breathe the fresh air of my region again,\\" he said.      Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh use similar words to explain why they would not give the region up.      \\"I got all the paperwork I needed to go to the United States but decided not to go. It's marvelous here. Look around you, breathe the air,\\" said Samvel Gabrielyan, an artist in Stepanakert, a quiet city of nearly 57,000 in the mountains.      Smart new apartment blocs stand on the rubble of buildings destroyed there during the war. A few still have bullet marks.      \\"We'd be ready to fight again if we had to. Otherwise what did all those deaths in the last war mean?\\" Gabrielyan said.      Such passions, and a belief on both sides that they can win a war, risk encouraging the politicians and military.      Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said a war now would be much more destructive than the low-tech conflict of the 1990s.      \\"It would be much more bloody and become a full state-state conflict with unpredictable consequences.\\"      Obvious targets in Azerbaijan would be the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) natural gas pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) crude oil pipeline. Both are in northwest Azerbaijan, within range of Armenian forces, and have a role in Europe's attempts to reduce its reliance on Russia for energy supplies.      A consortium of Western oil companies operates the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields in the Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea, as well as Azerbaijan's large Shah Deniz gas field.      Led by British Petroleum and including Norway's Statoil and two U.S. companies, Chevron and ExxonMobil, it has plenty to lose if war breaks out.      Each side can hit the other's capital, and Armenia's, Yerevan, is only 30 km from its Metsamor nuclear power plant. Northwest Azerbaijan contains a water reservoir and power station as well as an international highway and railway.      REGIONAL ALLIANCES      \\"We think that if hostilities resume, they could not be limited to a local or regional framework. I think they would have a wider geographical spread,\\" Bako Sahakyan, the self-styled president of Nagorno-Karabakh, said in an interview.      Turkey closed its border with Armenia in a gesture of solidarity with ethnic kin in Azerbaijan during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and rejects Armenia's insistence it recognize the killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey during World War One as genocide.      Russia has a military base at Gyumri in northwest Armenia.      Neither, however, would want to rush into a war that would damage their own, fragile relationship and Russia would not want to upset its efforts to deepen ties with Baku.      Iran, another regional force, was neutral during the 1991-94 war and would be likely to remain so. But its relationship with Azerbaijan has soured, especially since Baku started buying arms from Israel, and it might be sucked into a conflict if it allowed goods to keep flowing through its border with Armenia.      Efforts to find a political solution led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have had little success, and political concessions are hard for leaders who would risk losing power if they looked weak.      \\"Nagorno-Karabakh is an integral part of Armenia. This is how ordinary people see it,\\" said Archbishop Pargev Martirosyan, the Armenian Apostolic Church's senior official in the enclave, which is still part of Azerbaijan under international law.      \\"We will do everything to save our land.\\"      On the other side of the line of conflict, farmer Shukurov will not move from the village of Ciragli, despite his daughter's injury and the bullet holes riddling his house. \\"That is what the Armenians want, but I will not give up,\\" he said.      Diplomats and analysts say that if another war breaks out, it is likely to end in stalemate. \\"The Azeris can't retake Karabakh now. They are militarily incapable of doing it,\\" said Matthew Bryza, a former U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan.      \\"I don't think they could dislodge the Armenian forces from the high ground. I think that's extremely difficult.\\"      Yusif Agayev, an Azeri military expert and veteran of the war, said there was no mood for a protracted fight.      \\"I think it would be a month or two, that is the amount of time our armed forces could fight for. If it drags on longer then it will become a war that society will have to participate in, not just the army,\\" he said. \\"I don't think the society of my country is ready for war.\\"      (Additional reporting by Thomas Grove in Azerbaijan, Hasmik Mkrtchyan in Yerevan, Fredrik Dahl in Vienna and Justyna Pawlak in Brussels; editing by Philippa Fletcher) ||||| Author: Preeti Bhattacharji      Updated: April 8, 2010      Introduction      Chechens are an ethnic minority living primarily in Russia's North Caucasus region. For the past two hundred years, they have generally been governed by Moscow, though they have had varying degrees of de facto autonomy. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Chechen separatists launched a coordinated campaign for independence, which resulted in two devastating wars and an ongoing insurgency in Russia's republic of Chechnya. Militants in and around Chechnya continue to agitate for independence, though the death of separatist leader Shamil Basayev in July 2006 weakened the separatist movement. However, violence in the North Caucasus has escalated since 2008, and Moscow experienced its most serious attack in six years with the bombing of a metro station in March 2010.      Share      Who are the Chechens?      The Chechens are a largely Muslim ethnic group that has lived for centuries in the mountainous North Caucasus region. For the past two hundred years, Chechens have resisted Russian rule. During World War II, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin accused the Chechens of cooperating with the Nazis and forcibly deported the entire population to Kazakhstan and Siberia. Tens of thousands of Chechens died, and the survivors were allowed to return home only after Stalin's death.      Has Chechnya ever been independent?      Chechnya has experienced several brief periods of de facto independence. In January 1921, four years after the Russian Revolution, Chechnya joined Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia to form the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. But the following year, the Soviet Union seized control of Chechnya and turned it into a Soviet province called the Chechen Autonomous Oblast. In January 1934, Soviet officials merged the Chechen Autonomous Oblast with the neighboring Ingush Autonomous Oblast, largely to dilute each region's ethnic identity.      During World War II, as German forces moved into the Soviet Union and toward the North Caucasus, many ethnic minority groups subject to Soviet and Russian rule for generations seized on the opportunity presented by the war to try and break free. German forces never reached Chechnya, but Chechen nationalist Khasan Israilov led a revolt against Soviet rule which lasted from 1940 to 1944. After Soviet troops crushed the rebellion, Stalin accused the Chechens of collaborating with Nazi invaders. In 1944, Stalin disbanded the Chechen-Ingush republic altogether and forcibly deported the entire Chechen population to Siberia and Kazakhstan. Chechens were not allowed to return to their homeland until 1957, when Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, restored the province amid de-Stalinization.      What is the post-Soviet history of violence in Chechnya?      In the early 1990s, following the Soviet collapse, separatists in the newly formed Russian Federation Republic of Chechnya started an independence movement called the Chechen All-National Congress. Russian President Boris Yeltsin opposed Chechen independence, arguing that Chechnya was an integral part of Russia. From 1994 to 1996, Russia fought Chechen guerillas in a conflict that became known as the First Chechen War. Tens of thousands of civilians died, but Russia failed to win control of Chechnya's mountainous terrain, giving Chechnya de facto independence. In May 1996, Yeltsin signed a ceasefire with the separatists, and they agreed on a peace treaty the following year.      But violence flared again three years later. In August 1999, Chechen militants invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan to support a local separatist movement. The following month, five bombs exploded in Russia over a ten-day period, killing almost three hundred civilians. Moscow blamed Chechen rebels for the explosions, which comprised the largest coordinated terrorist attack in Russian history. The Dagestan invasion and the Russian bombings prompted Russian forces to launch the Second Chechen War, also known as the War in the North Caucasus. In February 2000, Russia recaptured the Chechen capital of Grozny, destroying a good part of the city center in the process, reasserting direct control over Chechnya. Tens of thousands of Chechens and Russians were killed or wounded in the two wars, and hundreds of thousands of civilians were displaced. Since the end of the second war, Chechen separatist activity has diminished, and the July 2006 death of separatist leader Shamil Basayev--in an explosion many see as the work of Russia's internal security services--seems to have stifled the movement. Since 2008, however, violence has markedly increased in the North Caucasus, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Incidents of violence rose from 795 in 2008 to 1,100 in 2009, and suicide bombings quadrupled in 2009, the majority of which occurred in Chechnya.      Which terrorist groups operate in Chechnya?      Information about groups linked to the conflict in Chechnya is hard to confirm, but experts say the struggle is between local separatists--a loosely organized group with semi-independent commanders--and the Russian army. According to the U.S. State Department, the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB) is the primary channel for Islamic funding of the Chechen guerillas, in part through links to al-Qaeda-related financiers on the Arabian Peninsula. The United States also defined the Chechnya-based Special Purpose Islamic Regiment (SPIR) and the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs as terrorist entities in February 2003.      Chechnya's long and violent guerrilla war has attracted a small number of Islamist militants from outside of Chechnya--some of whom are Arab fighters with possible links to al-Qaeda. Among the Islamist militants, the most prominent was Basayev, Russia's most wanted man. Basayev fought for Chechen independence for more than a decade, and was the mastermind behind the worst terrorist attacks on Russian soil. On July 10, 2006, Basayev was killed in an explosion in neighboring Ingushetia. His death cast doubt on the future of the Chechen separatist movement, and allegedly led to the surrender of five hundred militants. Four months later, Russian security forces killed Abu Hafs al-Urdani, the Jordanian-born commander of foreign fighters in Chechnya. Since then, violence in Chechnya has ebbed, though terrorism in the areas of Dagestan and Ingushetia has increased.      What major attacks are the Chechen groups responsible for?      The most notorious and devastating attack came in September 2004, when Basayev ordered an attack on a school in Beslan, a town in North Ossetia. More than three hundred people died in the three-day siege, most of them children. There were thirty-two militants, though only three or four were Chechens. All but one of the militants were reportedly killed during the siege. Since then, violence has generally targeted individual officials and government offices rather than large groups of civilians. Attacks include:      An August 1999 bombing of a shopping arcade and a September 1999 bombing of an apartment building in Moscow that killed sixty-four people.      Two bombings in September 1999 in the Russian republic of Dagestan and southern Russian city of Volgodonsk. Controversy still surrounds whether these attacks were conclusively linked to Chechens.      A bomb blast that killed at least forty-one people, including seventeen children, during a military parade in the southwestern town of Kaspiisk in May 2002. Russia blamed the attack on Chechen terrorists.      The October 2002 seizure of Moscow's Dubrovka Theater, where approximately seven hundred people were attending a performance. Russian Special Forces launched a rescue operation, but the opium-derived gas they used to disable the hostage-takers killed more than 120 hostages, as well as many of the terrorists. Basayev took responsibility for organizing the attack, and three Chechen-affiliated groups are thought to have been involved.      A December 2002 dual suicide bombing that attacked the headquarters of Chechnya's Russian-backed government in Grozny. Russian officials claim that international terrorists helped local Chechens mount the assault, which killed eighty-three people.      A three-day attack on Ingushetia in June 2004, which killed almost one hundred people and injured another 120.      Street fighting in October 2005 that killed at least eighty-five people. The fighting was in the south Russian city of Nalchik after Chechen rebels assaulted government buildings, telecommunications facilities, and the airport.      An attack on the Nevsky Express, used by members of the business and political elite, in November 2009 killed twenty-seven people.      In March 2010, two female suicide bombers detonated bombs in a Moscow metro station located near the headquarters of the security services, killing thirty-nine people. Islamist Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for the bombing; he had also claimed responsibility for the derailment of the Nevsky Express.      Two days after the metro station bombing in March 2010, two bombs exploded in the town of Kizlyar, in Russia's North Caucasus, killing at least twelve people.      Are there links between Chechen groups and al-Qaeda?      Experts say there are several ties between the al-Qaeda network and Chechen groups. A Chechen warlord known as Khattab is said to have met with Osama bin Laden while both men were fighting the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Alexander Vershbow, a U.S. ambassador to Russia, said shortly after September 11, 2001, \\"We have long recognized that Osama bin Laden and other international networks have been fueling the flames in Chechnya, including the involvement of foreign commanders like Khattab.\\" Khattab was killed in April 2002.      Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted for his involvement in the September 11 attacks, was reported by the Wall Street Journal to be formerly \\"a recruiter for al-Qaeda-backed rebels in Chechnya.\\" Chechen militants reportedly fought alongside al-Qaeda and Taliban forces against the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in late 2001. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan was one of the only governments to recognize Chechen independence.      Russian authorities, including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly stressed the involvement of international terrorists and Bin Laden associates in Chechnya--in part, experts say, to generate Western sympathy for Russia's military campaign against the Chechen rebels. Russia's former defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, claimed that a videotape of Khattab meeting with bin Laden had been found in Afghanistan, but Russia has not aired the tape publicly.      Julia Jeffrey contributed to this report. |||||","output":"For many years, American presidents have avoided talking about Chechnya. This is because Russia's leaders have demanded it as a condition for maintaining good relationships. When Chechnya wanted to gain independence from Russia, Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush encouraged peaceful settlements. Since becoming president, Barack Obama has not mentioned Chechnya in public. However, there have been some actions against Chechens by the Treasury and State Departments. Chechnya is an area that has faced much violence and conflict, and it is currently part of Russia. Presidents from the United States try not to get involved in the problems between Russia and Chechnya so that they can have a strong friendship with Russia's leaders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is \\"the most overturned court in the country.\\"      Fox News host Sean Hannity says it’s no surprise that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against President Donald Trump and his executive order on immigration.      \\"We have both been predicting for days now the 9th Circuit — the most liberal court of appeals, the most overturned court in the country — it would act this way,\\" Hannity said on his show Feb. 9, speaking with a guest.      Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending.      So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States and Alaska and Hawaii. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge’s decision. (The court didn’t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.)      It’s possible the administration will try to appeal their case again, this time to the Supreme Court. Right after the judges handed down their decision, Trump tweeted, \\"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\\"      As Hannity noted, the 9th Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. But we wondered if he was correct when he said the Supreme Court overturns more cases from the 9th Circuit than any other appeals court in the country — the implication being that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court.      In our research, we found that the 9th Circuit has a higher-than-average reversal rate, but not the highest. Additionally, experts told us that counting reversals doesn’t necessarily say much about the quality or substance of the 9th Circuit’s work.      The numbers      To evaluate this claim, we turned to SCOTUSBlog’s Supreme Court statistics archive, specifically their Circuit Scorecards, which track how often the Supreme Court justices agree or disagree with the lower court decisions.      The Supreme Court hears cases from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there’s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court’s decision was wrong.      In fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent.      The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit is in third place.      6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent.      We also found that the 9th Circuit never had the highest reversal rate in any individual term between 2004-15. (That’s the farthest back we could go.)      A spokesperson for Hannity pointed us to a 2014 article in National Review titled, \\"Ninth Circuit Leading the Pack for ‘Most Reversed.’ \\" But the evidence presented in the article does not support the headline.      So Hannity’s claim that the 9th Circuit is the \\"most overturned court in the country\\" is incorrect.      The Supreme Court only hears a handful of cases from each circuit each year, so the rate of reversal is highly variable, said Jonah Gelbach, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a statistician. In 2014, for instance, the 2nd Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 percent, which sounds pretty bad until you find out that the Supreme Court only heard one case from the 2nd Circuit that entire season.      The 9th Circuit is by far the largest circuit. In the 12 months leading up to March, 31, 2015, just under 12,000 cases were filed in the 9th Circuit — more than 4,000 more than the next-largest circuit, the 5th Circuit. Despite that gigantic docket, the Supreme Court heard just 11 cases from the 9th Circuit in 2015, reversing eight.      This means the Supreme Court generally reverses far less than 1 percent of all the cases the 9th Circuit (and other circuits) decide.      \\"Given the small numbers of cases involved, it can be difficult to draw any serious conclusions from such statistics about the quality of the courts involved,\\" Gelbach said. \\"Having said that, the 9th Circuit does seem to consistently have a high reversal rate over time.\\"      It’s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more \\"outlier decisions,\\" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits — leading to a higher reversal rate, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt.      Roosevelt said there might have been a time in the past when the 9th Circuit was considerably more liberal than the Supreme Court, stemming from the fact that Democratic President Jimmy Carter didn’t get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, though he did appoint several judges to the 9th Circuit.      Today, the 9th Circuit might still have the highest number of Democratic appointees of any appeals court, but there’s been enough turnover in the past few decades that it’s not as much of an outlier, Roosevelt said.      Our ruling      Hannity said the 9th Circuit is \\"the most overturned court in the country.\\"      While the 9th Circuit has a higher than average reversal rate among cases it sends to the Supreme Court, it has not had the highest rate since at least 2004 (the oldest data point we could find).      Even if it did, experts told us that the massive size of the 9th Circuit compared to the handful of cases it sends to the Supreme Court every year make reversal rates an imperfect measure of the quality of the 9th Circuit’s decisions. More broadly, experts say this statistic is a poor way of comparing courts.      We rate Hannity’s claim False. ||||| President Donald Trump also suggested that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is biased against him and his policies. | Getty Trump attacks judiciary for blocking order on sanctuary cities      President Donald Trump accused the “outrageous” 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday of being “semi-automatic” with rulings against his administration.      “Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit,” Trump complained in an interview with the Washington Examiner. “And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that's like, semi-automatic.”      Story Continued Below      Trump said he is “absolutely” considering proposals to split up the three-judge panel, insisting that “there are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit.”      Earlier on Wednesday, the president renewed his attacks on the nation’s judiciary, blaming the 9th Circuit for the ruling by a federal district court judge that blocked his administration’s move to deny federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities.      “First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.      “I’m never surprised by the 9th Circuit,” Trump told a reporter later Wednesday during a signing ceremony for an unrelated executive order. “As I said: We’ll see them in the Supreme Court.”      Judge William Orrick, who handed down Tuesday’s injunction, is a U.S. district court judge based in San Francisco and does not sit on the 9th Circuit, although that is the next court that would hear the case should the Trump administration appeal the decision. Some observers consider all federals courts in the states where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to be collectively the 9th Circuit.      he ruling was panned by the White House, which released a statement from press secretary Sean Spicer’s office declaring that “today, the rule of law suffered another blow, as an unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our Nation.”      “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” the White House statement continued. “Today’s ruling undermines faith in our legal system and raises serious questions about circuit shopping.”      Before Wednesday’s tweets, Trump’s most recent tirade against the judicial branch was also targeted at the 9th Circuit, which upheld a district court’s stay that blocked his executive order banning immigrants from certain Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. The 9th Circuit has yet to hear arguments on Trump's revised travel ban. Those arguments are slated for May 15.      Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

Trump also suggested that the 9th Circuit is biased against him and his policies, tweeting in subsequent posts that “Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the ‘ban’ case and now the ‘sanctuary’ case is brought in the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ‘judge shopping!’ Messy system.”      In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News, Spicer was critical of the federal district judge's ruling to block Trump’s sanctuary cities order. By basing his decision in part on rhetoric from Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Spicer said, Orrick had stepped outside the bounds of what should have been considered. “The idea that any judge or any jurisdiction would not be wanting to help make sure that we can protect our citizens runs counter to, frankly, what we should all be looking for,” Spicer said.      “Do you think the 9th Circuit’s got it in for the White House?\\" Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer asked Spicer.      “Well, I don’t know that they have it in for the White House,” he replied. “They have a horrible record of interpreting that law. And that’s just a fact.”      Nolan D.

He called the administration's position on the order \\"schizophrenic.\\" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)      When a long list of comments from President Trump, his surrogates and his spokesmen shows up in a federal court ruling, it’s fair to say it can only mean one thing: a constitutionally questionable executive order is about to get a judicial smackdown.      That was true in March, when federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland suspended Trump’s travel ban, saying the administration had showed a clear animus toward Muslims, despite government lawyers’ claims to the contrary.      And it was true Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick of California temporarily froze Trump’s executive order on sanctuary cities, ruling that a case could be made that it violated the Constitution.      [Trump blasts federal court ruling that blocks his ‘sanctuary city’ order]      Trump’s order, signed Jan. 25, threatens to cut off funding from local governments that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities. Santa Clara County and the city of San Francisco challenged the order, arguing, among other things, that the president doesn’t have the power to withhold federal money. Orrick found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on all their claims, as The Washington Post reported.      San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera praised the ruling by a U.S. District judge in San Francisco that blocked President Trump's executive order that sought to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities. (Reuters)      The 49-page ruling focused largely on an all-too-familiar theme for the young administration: the consequences of bragging and bluster by Trump and top administration officials.      Just like the judges who ruled on Trump’s travel ban, Orrick homed in on the vast discrepancies between what government lawyers defending the sanctuary cities order argued in court and what administration officials said about it in public.      In court, the government tried to make the case that the order doesn’t actually do anything, at least not at the moment, because the administration has yet to define what exactly a sanctuary city is or threaten any particular jurisdiction with a loss of funds. It was their way of convincing the judge to toss out the lawsuit on the grounds that no city or county has yet suffered any harm.      But in public, administration officials boasted about how the order would force sanctuary cities to their knees, singling out particular places. The order described in court as essentially an empty shell was portrayed in news conferences, briefings and television interviews as a powerful tool to protect the public from dangerous undocumented immigrants being shielded by wayward cities and counties.      It was that gap that disturbed Orrick.      In his ruling, the judge pointed to a February interview between Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, in which Trump called the order “a weapon” to use against cities that tried to defy his immigration policies.      “I don’t want to defund anybody. I want to give them the money they need to properly operate as a city or a state,” Trump said in the interview. “If they’re going to have sanctuary cities, we may have to do that. Certainly that would be a weapon.”      The judge also cited news conferences in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to “claw back any funds” awarded to a city that violated the order.      And the judge brought up remarks by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who said in no uncertain terms that “counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities don’t get federal government funding.”      On top of that, the judge said, Trump and Sessions had repeatedly held up San Francisco as an example of the supposed dangers sanctuary cities pose to ordinary, law-abiding citizens because of the killing there of Kathryn Steinle in July 2015, allegedly by a man deported five times.      It was more than enough to show the intent of Trump’s order, Orrick wrote.      But government lawyers sang an entirely different tune.      According to Orrick, the government contended that the order was merely an example of Trump using the “bully pulpit” to “highlight a changed approach to immigration enforcement” — in essence, something much more benign than what Trump and company had described.      The argument was lost on the judge, who ridiculed the government’s position as “schizophrenic.”      “If there was doubt about the scope of the Order, the President and Attorney General have erased it with their public comments,” Orrick wrote.      “Is the Order merely a rhetorical device,” he added, “or a ‘weapon’ to defund the Counties and those who have implemented a different law enforcement strategy than the Government currently believes is desirable?”      The ruling continued: “The statements of the President, his press secretary and the Attorney General belie the Government’s argument in the briefing that the Order does not change the law. They have repeatedly indicated an intent to defund sanctuary jurisdictions in compliance with the Executive Order.”      If all that sounds familiar, it’s because other federal judges reached similar conclusions about the administration’s credibility in lawsuits challenging Trump’s travel ban.      In March, judges in Hawaii and Maryland issued rulings that temporarily halted parts of the executive order, which seeks to bar new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. In both cases, judges found that what government lawyers said in court about the ban being religiously neutral didn’t line up with remarks from Trump and some of his closest advisers, who had previously called for a “Muslim ban.” The administration’s intent was obvious, the judges said.      “Plainly-worded” statements by Trump and his surrogates “betrayed the Executive Order’s stated secular purpose,” one judge wrote, using language strikingly similar to Orrick’s.      As long as the administration continues to issue broad executive orders, it should expect to have statements by its top officials to come up in court, said Jayashri Srikantiah, an immigration law professor at Stanford Law School.      “It’s hard to imagine not seeing more of these kinds of legal challenges,” she said. “The president is the president and the attorney general is the attorney general, and we have to take seriously what they say about an executive order with such sweeping implications.”      President Trump has threatened to go after sanctuary cities, which provide protections for illegal immigrants. Chicago announced on Aug. 6 they plan to sue the Trump administration over threats to withhold public safety grant money from sanctuary cities. This is how other state and local governments with sanctuary policies have responded. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)      The Trump administration has vowed to fight rulings on the travel ban and sanctuary cities.      In a series of tweets Wednesday, Trump vowed that the White House was ready to bring the case to the Supreme Court and blasted the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which was part of legal decisions blocking Trump’s travel restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries.      “First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities — both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” Trump wrote.      Orrick is a federal district judge in San Francisco. He does not serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, although those judges would review his decisions.      In an earlier statement, the White House took aim at Orrick, saying his ruling “unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation.”      “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” the White House statement said.      The ruling puts the executive order on hold while the judge weighs the full evidence in the case. At issue is whether the order violates the Constitution by giving the president spending powers reserved for Congress and by infringing on state sovereignty by “commandeering” local officials to enforce federal immigration laws.      White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the government’s lawyers were reviewing their options.      “It’s the 9th Circuit going bananas,” he told reporters Tuesday. “The idea that an agency can’t put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these monies are spent is going to be overturned eventually, and we’ll win at the Supreme Court level at some point.”      More from Morning Mix      With self-deprecation on menu for presidents at correspondents’ dinner, it’s no wonder Trump is skipping it      More lawsuits aimed at Fox News — this time for race discrimination      Texas lawmaker on hunger strike in protest of ‘sanctuary city’ bill ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -24 = 16*q - 22*q for q, you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. The equation given is -24 = 16*q - 22*q. Since both 16*q and -22*q have the same variable (q), we can combine these like terms. 16*q - 22*q = (16 - 22)*q = -6*q Now the equation is -24 = -6*q. Step 2: Isolate the variable (q). To isolate q, we need to get rid of the coefficient -6 in front of it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. -24 / (-6) = -6*q / (-6) On the left side of the equation, we have: -24 / (-6) = 4 On the right side of the equation, the -6 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving us with: q = 4 So, the solution to the equation -24 = 16*q - 22*q for q is q = 4."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When our food came, I started walking towards an empty table. By bad luck, my purse strap   got caught on a chair and the tray   that I was holding slipped from my hands and went flying in the air. The tray, and its contents, fell on a man who was just about to take a bite of his sandwich. I stared, greatly shocked , as the drinks soaked   his white shirt. Then I closed my eyes and prepared myself for his burst of anger. Instead, he said \\"It's OK\\" to comfort me before he disappeared into the washroom. Still shaky and unsure what to do next, my friends and I went to a table and sat there, trying our best to look calm. A moment later, the man came out of the washroom and approached our table.

To my surprise, he merely smiled at us, handed us some cash and said, \\"Buy yourself new hamburgers.\\" He then walked away without even finishing his food.

The eastern half of the state, especially the Tidewater region, developed a slave society based on a plantation system and slave labor. Many free people of color migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser.

(AP) — A Missouri man accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old schoolmate when he was 17 was charged Thursday with a misdemeanor child endangerment charge.      The charge against 19-year-old Matt Barnett was filed in Nodaway County Court in Maryville. He is scheduled to be arraigned later Thursday. His lawyer, J.R. Hobbs, didn't immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.      Special prosecutor Jean Peters Baker has been re-examining Daisy Coleman's allegations that Barnett raped her at a January 2012 house party, when he was a Maryville High School senior and she was a freshman. Barnett says the sex was consensual.      The Associated Press generally doesn't name alleged victims of sexual assault but is naming Daisy because she and her mother have granted public interviews.      A spokesman for Baker, Mike Mansur, referred questions to a news conference planned for after the court hearing.      Baker stepped in after the local prosecutor, Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice, was criticized for dropping the case. He alleged that Daisy's family had stopped cooperating — a claim Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman, deny.      Before dropping the case, Rice had been pursuing the same misdemeanor child endangerment charge filed Thursday by Baker.      Melinda Coleman says authorities didn't do enough to push the investigation forward, and she has alleged that Rice's decision to drop the case was politically motivated — Barnett's grandfather was a four-term Missouri state representative who was a state trooper for 32 years. Rice has denied the accusation.      Coleman said her daughter was harassed mercilessly on social media sites and at school after going to the authorities, and that it forced the family to move back to Albany, about 40 miles west of Maryville.      Barnett was a 17-year-old senior at Maryville High School on Jan. 8, 2012, when he and some other boys picked up Daisy and her 13-year-old friend from Daisy's house and took them to the home of one of the boys.      The girls admitted drinking alcohol in Daisy's home before sneaking out of the house and leaving with the boys, some of whom were friends with her older brother. Daisy claimed that when she got to the party, she was given a clear liquid that she drank before being taken into a bedroom and raped while a second boy recorded the act on his cellphone.      The 13-year-old was taken into a different room by a 15-year-old boy who forced her to have sex, something the boy admitted doing. His case was handled in the juvenile system and is not public record.      Daisy said she blacked out and doesn't remember much after arriving at the boy's home. Melinda Coleman has said she believes her daughter was given a date-rape drug.      Coleman said she awoke around 5 a.m. to a clawing sound at the front door and found her daughter shivering in sub-freezing temperatures. She said she was giving Daisy a bath to warm her up when she noticed signs that she had been assaulted.      The case and resulting publicity shook the small college town of Maryville, which was deluged with negative reactions after The Star published the results of a seven-month investigation into claims made by the Colemans. Many people condemned the town on social media — and continue to do so — for seemingly abandoning sexual assault victims.      The outcry led to a protest on Maryville's courthouse square in which a few hundred people showed up to show their support for Daisy and lambaste what they labeled as a \\"rape culture\\" that allowed the girl's assailant to go unpunished.      The story gained national attention after The Kansas City Star published a lengthy account of Daisy's claims in October. ||||| — Two years and a day after an alcohol-infused house party led to sexual assault allegations, a 19-year-old Nodaway County man pleaded guilty Thursday to a charge of misdemeanor child endangerment.      Matthew Barnett of Maryville also apologized to his victim, who was 14 at the time.      Facing reporters after the 20-minute plea hearing, prosecutors said they did not have the evidence to file a felony sexual assault charge.      There was insufficient evidence, said Jean Peters Baker, the Jackson County prosecuting attorney appointed special prosecutor in a case that has garnered international attention. In this case, and every case, it boils down to the evidence.      Baker filed the endangerment charge Thursday morning, just hours before Barnett, accompanied by his parents, entered court to plead guilty.      As part of a plea agreement, Barnett admitted that he endangered Daisy Coleman when he left her, barefoot and incoherent in freezing temperatures, in her front yard at 2 a.m. Jan. 8, 2012. She was found there three hours later. Her brother told Missouri Highway Patrol investigators that her face was blue, her hair was frozen and she didnt look alive.      The incident, which Baker described as a horrible night, followed a party at Barnetts home, where he and Daisy had sex. Daisy has said she was so intoxicated at that time that she has no recollection of the encounter. Barnett maintains that the sex was consensual.      Nodaway County Associate Circuit Judge Glen Dietrich sentenced Barnett on Thursday to 120 days of confinement but suspended the sentence and placed Barnett on two years of probation. Additionally, he ordered Barnett to avoid alcohol, bars and liquor stores, verbally apologize to Daisy, have no more contact with her, perform 100 hours of community service and reimburse Daisys family for her mental health treatment, a total not to exceed 1,800.      Though the sentence was suspended, the conviction will remain on Barnetts permanent criminal record.      Thursdays plea agreement had been under discussion for more than a month, Baker said.      Baker met with Barnett, a student at the University of Central Missouri, before the hearing to receive the apology, which she will pass along to Daisy.      This was the outcome we believe was the right and just outcome in this case, Baker said during a news conference after the hearing.      Barnett sat quietly for much of the hearing, answering most of Dietrichs questions with a simple yes, sir or no, sir.      His lawyer, J.R. Hobbs of Kansas City, did most of the talking on Barnetts behalf.      Matthew Barnett accepts full responsibility for the conduct charged, Hobbs said afterward. To be clear, the misdemeanor charge ... accurately reflects the conduct for which he should be held accountable.      The case generated outrage in October after The Kansas City Star published a detailed account of Daisy Colemans allegation that Barnett sexually assaulted her. Not long after the party, Barnett faced a felony sexual assault charge as well as a child endangerment misdemeanor count. Nodaway Countys prosecutor later dropped both charges.      The endangerment charge Baker filed Thursday is the same count that Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice dropped in the summer of 2012, citing lack of cooperation from the Coleman family.      Without referring to Daisy or her mother, Melinda Coleman, by name, Baker said both supported this resolution of a case that focused a harsh light on teenage drinking and its too-often brutal consequences.      Baker read a statement from Daisy that said: Today I am grateful that the defendant took responsibility by pleading guilty to the charges. I am ready to move forward.      Daisy, now 16, was hospitalized in Kansas City earlier this week after a purported suicide attempt, a family friend told The Star. That friend, Robin Bourland, said Daisy ingested pills Sunday evening in an incident that stemmed from online harassment. She said Thursday that Daisy, though still hospitalized, was recovering well.      A statement released Thursday from Daisys mother said: I hope that todays resolution of this criminal case brings some closure for my family, especially my children, and for the community. These last two years have been extremely painful. But today I hope somehow, some way that something good will come from this.      Baker asked that the public give the victim an opportunity to heal and create a new narrative in her life.      Court records filed Thursday gave this account of the incident:      The defendant acted with criminal negligence in a manner that created a substantial risk to the life, body and health of D.C., a child less than 17 years old, by providing D.C. with alcohol until she was substantially intoxicated and impaired, and then leaving D.C. outside of her home in the below-freezing temperatures when D.C. was incapable of protecting or caring for herself.      Daisy stayed on the lawn for about three hours, the records said, during a time that the temperature fell to 21 degrees. She was wearing only a T-shirt and yoga pants.      Earlier, after Daisy had gone to the Barnett residence, she was provided vodka and was taunted by the other males present to drink from the bitch cup, which she did, the records said. After drinking from it, Daisy did not recall any subsequent events. (She) advised the next thing she remembered was waking up in her yard.      About 8 a.m. that morning, more than six hours after she had been left in the cold, Daisys blood-alcohol content tested at 0.13 percent, court records said.      A six-page Missouri Highway Patrol report summarized the agencys investigation of the case, which the patrol did at Bakers request. It includes parts of an interview with Daisy, during which she was asked whether Barnett could have been under the impression the reported sexual contact could have been consensual.      According to the report, Daisy answered: He was drinking, too, so yeah, he could have.      At the time, Barnett was on probation for driving while intoxicated.      In the original Nodaway County sheriffs report, which was sealed following the dismissal of the original charges but obtained by The Star, multiple witnesses told authorities that Daisy  incapacitated, crying and unable to walk  had to be carried from the Barnett residence. She was driven home, where, two witnesses said, she was left on her lawn.      According to two boys in the car, Barnett and a friend then talked about calling one of Daisys brothers and telling him they had found Daisy drunk at a party and had dropped her off at home. The goal, according to one of the youths, was to keep anybody from finding out theyd had sex with Daisy and her 13-year-old friend.      A 15-year-old Nodaway County boy later admitted in juvenile court that he had sex with the 13-year-old, despite her protests. He spent two weeks in the custody of state juvenile authorities and was released for further treatment at home.      A third youth initially faced a charge of sexual exploitation of a minor after admitting to taking a cell-phone video of Daisy and Barnett. Authorities never found the video.      We tried to obtain the video, and without the video, there is no charge, Baker said Thursday.      Local interest in the case was fed, in part, by a suspicion that political influence had played a part in Rices decision to drop the charges, an accusation Rice repeatedly has denied.      Rice is a Republican. Barnett is the grandson of a once-prominent Nodaway County Republican state legislator.      Baker is a Democrat, as is the judge who appointed her.      Asked whether Thursdays court hearing vindicated Rice, she told reporters, That would be your analysis.      Barnetts attorney responded more strongly.      Two highly skilled prosecutors from two different jurisdictions have now independently concluded that felony charges are not appropriate in this matter, Hobbs said. Further, there is absolutely no evidence that political favoritism played a role in the decision of either prosecutor. |||||","output":"A Missouri man, Matt Barnett, was charged with a misdemeanor child endangerment after being accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old schoolmate when he, himself, was 17.

An alleged terrorist leader suspected of plotting the bombing of a Philippine superferry more than four years ago, killing at least 116 people, has arrived in Manila after his arrest in Bahrain, a Philippine justice official said Saturday. Authorities suspect Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. was behind the 2004 superferry bombing. Authorities in Bahrain arrested Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. last month, said Ricardo Blancaflor, undersecretary at the Department of Justice. Lavilla was deported Saturday to Manila, where police arrested him and briefly paraded him in front of local media crews before locking him inside police headquarters, Blancaflor said. Lavilla is one of the top ideologues in the Rajah Solaiman Movement, a group of former Christians who converted to Islam and claim affiliation with the al Qaeda-linked regional terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf, Blancaflor said. Blancaflor said authorities suspect Lavilla helped plot the bombing of a superferry near Manila on February 27, 2004, in which at least 116 people died. They believe Lavilla also helped plan the bombing of a bus behind the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila on February 14, 2005, an attack that killed at least four people and came to be known as the Valentine's Day Bombing. The bus bombing was part of a trio of attacks that happened that day. The two other blasts, both fatal, happened in the southern cities of General Santos and Davao. Blancaflor said he suspects Lavilla was also involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Manila, all of which were thwarted by Philippine police. In describing Lavilla's arrest in Bahrain, Blancaflor said only that police there arrested him as they were enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1276, which imposed air travel and financial sanctions on the Taliban. Jemaah Islamiyah aims to create a Muslim \\"superstate\\" across much of Southeast Asia. Authorities blame the group for the Bali, Indonesia nightclub bombings of 2002, which killed more than 200 mostly Western tourists. The group is also suspected of subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The Abu Sayyaf group is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the government in and around the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. CNN's Rory Suchet contributed to this report.

When Anne announces that she will be having a baby, Scott is distrustful to notice how Alex reacts with doubt about the news.

The Bengals dominated the first half time of possession by more than a 2-1 margin. The Bengals took the opening possession of the game and marched down the field, with quarterback AJ McCarron, playing in place of the injured Andy Dalton, throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver A. J. Green in the corner of the end zone. The Bengals later added to their lead in the second quarter, with wide receiver Mohamed Sanu rushing for a 6-yard touchdown, in a \\"wildcat\\" formation. The Bengals were threatening to add to their lead just before the two-minute warning, but placekicker Mike Nugent missed wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus just before halftime. The Broncos took the initial possession of the second half, and pulled to within 14-10, with quarterback Brock Osweiler connecting with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders on an 8-yard touchdown pass, which was the only scoring play of the third quarter. After having trouble stopping the Bengals' offense in the first half, the Broncos' defense forced the Bengals to punt on their first four possessions of the second half. The Broncos grabbed a 17-14 lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson scampering down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown. A 52-yard field goal by Nugent helped the Bengals tie the game at 17-17 with 6:51 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had reached the Bengals' 27-yard line on the next possession, and were attempting a game-winning drive, but Bengals' defensive end Michael Johnson forced a fumble off Anderson, which was recovered by safety Reggie Nelson. However, the Broncos' defense forced a Bengals' punt, and the Broncos' offense began their next drive at their own 20-yard line with 1:40 remaining. However, McManus badly missed wide left on a potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Broncos won the overtime coin toss, and took a 20-17 lead on their initial possession, with a 37-yard field goal by McManus. The drive was aided by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Bengals' linebacker Vontaze Burfict for a late hit out-of-bounds. The Bengals started their first offensive possession of overtime at their own 33-yard line, and on their first play, McCarron attempted a pass that was incomplete, as his arm was hit by Broncos' linebacker Von Miller. Broncos' head coach Gary Kubiak called a timeout, thinking the play should have been ruled as a game-ending fumble, however, the initial ruling was upheld by instant replay. On the very next play, McCarron fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Broncos' linebacker DeMarcus Ware to end the game and send the Broncos to the postseason for the fifth consecutive season. This was the third game of the season that the Broncos won after trailing 14-0 &#8212; the other two were Week 2 at the Kansas City Chiefs and Week 12 vs. the New England Patriots.

Maintain a positive body language – Stand tall, make eye contact, and maintain an open posture while interacting with others. This will convey a sense of self-assurance and positivity, making others perceive you as being happy. 3. Keep the conversation light – Avoid discussing heavy or overly personal topics that could prompt others to inquire about your true emotions. Instead, engage in friendly small talk and focus on topics that are light-hearted and entertaining. 4. Practice active listening – Show genuine interest in what others are saying by listening attentively and responding enthusiastically. This not only helps to project happiness, but also demonstrates empathy and encourages better communication. 5.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

The content begins with the user mentioning @scrowder, indicating that they are addressing Steven Crowder directly. This provides context for the tweet and its sentiment. The main part of the tweet consists of two parts: \\"I would but it is FAR\\" and \\"have fun though.\\"  In the first part, \\"I would but it is FAR,\\" the user implies that they would have liked to join or attend an event, but the distance appears to be a substantial obstacle. The use of the word \\"FAR\\" in capital letters may emphasize the extent of the distance or the inconvenience it poses. The sentiment expressed in this part is a mix of desire to participate and regret about not being able to do so due to the distance. In the second part, \\"have fun though,\\" the user displays a positive attitude and wishes Steven Crowder to enjoy the event. This friendly gesture contributes a positive sentiment to the overall tweet. Taking these components into account, the sentiment of the tweet can be considered as mixed or neutral-leaning positive.

We thought for sure he would not like wearing it, however he has yet to acknowledge that it's even on him. We received the item only a few days after ordering which was a giant plus for us. One thing to note before ordering is size. I originally ordered a size Small and it was significantly too small for our 10-lb toy poodle. We ended up ordering a size Medium for him. It fits pretty good circumference wise, however it is a little too big for him as it covers a larger area than needed. Even though it is slightly too large for him, there has been no leaks.

A West Tennessee nonprofit organization will use a 300,000 federal grant to hire an attorney and a Spanish-speaking paralegal to help provide legal assistance to domestic violence victims. The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement. The organization doesn't have a staff member who speaks Spanish and the need is increasing with growing Hispanic populations, said the organization's executive director Steven Xanthopoulos. He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.

Forest: While some squirrels might live in a forest, the question specifically asks for the location of a \\"brave squirrel\\". In a forest, squirrels may not typically need to exhibit bravery, as they are well-adapted to their natural habitat and face fewer unexpected challenges. c. Tree: Squirrels live in trees, but similarly to the forest, trees don't necessarily provide a context for squirrels to exhibit bravery. d. Yard: While a yard could serve as a habitat for squirrels, it is still a relatively safe environment, offering fewer opportunities for a squirrel to demonstrate bravery. e. Park: Parks are public spaces that can provide a balance of natural elements and human presence. In this environment, a brave squirrel would have the chance to interact with humans, face potential dangers, and navigate complex situations. 3. Select the most appropriate answer: Comparing the options, I find that a brave squirrel is most likely to be found in a \\"park\\". 4. Final answer: A brave squirrel would most likely be found in a park. This is because parks provide opportunities for squirrels to face challenges and demonstrate bravery in their interactions with both natural elements and humans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, decide if you want an upright or chest model. Uprights are more convenient. Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area. However, chest models are more energy-efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open.    If you are buying an upright, you'll have to choose between frostless  or manual  defrost . Chest freezers are always manual. Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals  and remove the water. Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch.    To help your freezer reach a ripe old age, try to find a spot that's cool, dry, and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer's cabinet temperature, which makes it work harder to keep cool. That means wasted energy. That means wasted energy and a shortened life.    Dry air is important because highhumidity  can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside. With proper care, a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more. Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero-degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new.    Frostless models requires less care than manual defrost freezers. The inside of a frostless unit should be washed periodically with warm water and baking soda or a mild soap, rinse, and dried.   Good habits go a long way toward a freezer that runs efficiently. To get the most from your freezer, check regularly to make sure it's providing a true zero-degree temperature.   Keep the freezer at least three-quarters full. The emptier it get, the more energy is wasted. If more than three pounds of food per cubic foot of storage space is added every 24 hours, the resulting high or low temperature can damage the food. Question: In order to get the best results, you should  _  .

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... Question: Following the summit, what does Trump likely believe about North Korea's intent to honor the new agreement? === The answer to the above question is Choose your answer from: -- not enough information -- that the agreement will definitely be broken at some point -- probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations -- that the agreement will not likely bear meaningful results The answer is:","output":"probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations. Following the summit, it is likely that Trump believes that North Korea intends to honor the new agreement. This belief is based on several factors, including what has transpired leading up to the historic summit and the messages conveyed during the summit itself. Prior to the summit, North Korea had demonstrated a shift in its approach to foreign relations, suspending further missile tests and expressing a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. This change in attitude was significant enough for Trump to accept the offer to meet with Kim Jong Un. Furthermore, during the summit, the two leaders discussed the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and committing to peace between their respective countries. The first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader resulted in a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty aimed at ending long-standing hostilities between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump's description of the agreement as \\"very comprehensive\\" suggests that he is optimistic about the prospects for progress in the coming negotiations. While there is still some skepticism, particularly from those who recall past broken agreements, it is important to consider the strides that have been made thus far and the potential for progress as negotiations continue. It is likely that Trump has more confidence in the potential for success with this agreement, given the unprecedented nature of the summit and the direct talks between the two leaders. In conclusion, based on the information available, it is likely that Trump believes North Korea intends to keep its promises and continue engaging in good faith negotiations. However, the challenge lies in the implementation and resolution of differences on denuclearization and sanctions relief, which will require ongoing dialogue and sustained effort from both sides."},{"instruction":"Question: Answer the question based on the following text.

Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \\"deeply moved\\", and \\"at once saddened and ashamed\\" that he could not accept it.

News article: Amnesty International announced today that it has withdrawn its highest honour, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, from Aung San Suu Kyi, in light of the Myanmar leader’s shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.      Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights. Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General, Amnesty International Share this Twitter      Facebook      Email      On 11 November, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo wrote to Aung San Suu Kyi to inform her the organization is revoking the 2009 award. Half way through her term in office, and eight years after her release from house arrest, Naidoo expressed the organization’s disappointment that she had not used her political and moral authority to safeguard human rights, justice or equality in Myanmar, citing her apparent indifference to atrocities committed by the Myanmar military and increasing intolerance of freedom of expression.      “As an Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience, our expectation was that you would continue to use your moral authority to speak out against injustice wherever you saw it, not least within Myanmar itself,” wrote Kumi Naidoo.      “Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights. Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.”      Perpetuating human rights violations      Since Aung San Suu Kyi became the de facto leader of Myanmar’s civilian-led government in April 2016, her administration has been actively involved in the commission or perpetuation of multiple human rights violations.      Amnesty International has repeatedly criticized the failure of Aung San Suu Kyi and her government to speak out about military atrocities against the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, who have lived for years under a system of segregation and discrimination amounting to apartheid. During the campaign of violence unleashed against the Rohingya last year the Myanmar security forces killed thousands, raped women and girls, detained and tortured men and boys, and burned hundreds of homes and villages to the ground. More than 720,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. A UN report has called for senior military officials to be investigated and prosecuted for the crime of genocide.      Her denial of the gravity and scale of the atrocities means there is little prospect of the situation improving for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya living in limbo in Bangladesh or for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State. Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General, Amnesty International Share this Twitter      Facebook      Email      Although the civilian government does not have control over the military, Aung San Suu Kyi and her office have shielded the security forces from accountability by dismissing, downplaying or denying allegations of human rights violations and by obstructing international investigations into abuses. Her administration has actively stirred up hostility against the Rohingya, labelling them as “terrorists”, accusing them of burning their own homes and decrying “faking rape”. Meanwhile state media has published inflammatory and dehumanizing articles alluding to the Rohingya as “detestable human fleas” and “thorns” which must be pulled out.      “Aung San Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out for the Rohingya is one reason why we can no longer justify her status as an Ambassador of Conscience,” said Kumi Naidoo.      “Her denial of the gravity and scale of the atrocities means there is little prospect of the situation improving for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya living in limbo in Bangladesh or for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State. Without acknowledgement of the horrific crimes against the community, it is hard to see how the government can take steps to protect them from future atrocities.”      Amnesty International also highlighted the situation in Kachin and northern Shan States, where Aung San Suu Kyi has failed to use her influence and moral authority to condemn military abuses, to push for accountability for war crimes or to speak out for ethnic minority civilians who bear the brunt of the conflicts. To make matters worse, her civilian-led administration has imposed harsh restrictions on humanitarian access, exacerbating the suffering of more than 100,000 people displaced by the fighting.      Attacks on freedom of speech      Despite the power wielded by the military, there are areas where the civilian-led government has considerable authority to enact reforms to better protect human rights, especially those relating to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. But in the two years since Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration assumed power, human rights defenders, peaceful activists and journalists have been arrested and imprisoned while others face threats, harassment and intimidation for their work.      Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration has failed to repeal repressive laws – including some of the same laws which were used to detain her and others campaigning for democracy and human rights. Instead, she has actively defended the use of such laws, in particular the decision to prosecute and imprison two Reuters journalists for their work documenting a Myanmar military massacre.      Aung San Suu Kyi was named as Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience in 2009, in recognition of her peaceful and non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights. At the time she was held under house arrest, which she was eventually released from exactly eight years ago today. When she was finally able to accept the award in 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi asked Amnesty International to “not take either your eyes or your mind off us and help us to be the country where hope and history merges.”      “Amnesty International took Aung San Suu Kyi’s request that day very seriously, which is why we will never look away from human rights violations in Myanmar,” said Kumi Naidoo.      “We will continue to fight for justice and human rights in Myanmar – with or without her support.” ||||| Amnesty International has withdrawn a prestigious human rights award from Aung San Suu Kyi, following what it described as a “shameful betrayal” of the values she once stood for.      It is the latest in a series of accolades to be withdrawn from Aung San Suu Kyi, including the US Holocaust Museum’s Elie Weisel award and Freedom of the City awards, which were revoked by Edinburgh, Oxford, Glasgow and Newcastle.      Amnesty International said on Monday that Aung San Suu Kyi, now Myanmar’s civilian leader, was no longer a symbol of hope, and that it had withdrawn its highest honour, the ambassador of conscience award. It cited her “apparent indifference” to atrocities committed against the Rohingya and her increasing intolerance of freedom of speech.      Aung San Suu Kyi received the ambassador of conscience award in 2009, while under house arrest, for her role in championing peace and democracy. She was described as “a symbol of hope, courage and the undying defence of human rights” by Irene Khan, Amnesty International’s then secretary general.      Kumi Naidoo, the organisation’s current secretary general, said in a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi that her ambassador title could no longer be justified.      “Our expectation was that you would continue to use your moral authority to speak out against injustice wherever you saw it, not least within Myanmar itself,” Naidoo wrote in the letter.      Aung San Suu Kyi has been widely accused of being apathetic or complicit in the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, who, the UN has warned, continue to be targeted in an “ongoing genocide”.      Who are the Rohingya and what is happening in Myanmar? Read more      More than 700,000 Rohingya people remain in Bangladesh, having fled a brutal military crackdown that began in August 2017. UN investigators said that during the campaign, Myanmar’s military carried out killings and gang rapes with “genocidal intent”, and called for the commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law.      Yanghee Lee, the UN special investigator on human rights in Myanmar, said she believed Aung San Suu Kyi was in “total denial” about accusations of violence.      “Without acknowledgement of the horrific crimes against the community, it is hard to see how the government can take steps to protect them from future atrocities,” said Naidoo.      Amnesty International added that Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration had stirred up hatred against Rohingya by labelling them “terrorists”, obstructed international investigations into abuses, and failed to repeal repressive laws used to silence critics.      In September, Aung San Suu Kyi defended the imprisonment of two Reuters journalists who were given seven-year jail terms after investigating the massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Rahkine state. The sentences were widely condemned by international governments, human rights groups and the UN as a miscarriage of justice and a symbol of the major regression of freedom of expression in Myanmar. ||||| YANGON: Myanmar authorities and citizens leapt to the defence of Aung San Suu Kyi Tuesday (Nov 13) after Amnesty International stripped her of its top award over indifference to atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims, doubling down on support for the civilian leader in the face of global ire.      Aung San Suu Kyi's international reputation as a rights icon is in pieces and Amnesty's move is the latest in a string of rescinded accolades.      Advertisement      Canada revoked her honorary citizenship last month and the US Holocaust Museum in March took back an award named after concentration camp survivor Elie Wiesel.      Institutions that once showered Aung San Suu Kyi with titles are rapidly distancing themselves from a leader they argue is doing little in the face of alleged genocide and ethnic cleansing against its Rohingya minority.      Amnesty's Ambassador of Conscience Award was bestowed in 2009 and other recipients include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and Ai Wei Wei.      \\"Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights,\\" Amnesty International chief Kumi Naidoo said in a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi released by the group.

The stripping of awards not only harms the \\"dignity\\" of Aung San Suu Kyi, but also that of all NLD members, the party's spokesman Myo Nyunt told AFP, adding he thought this was all part of a wider conspiracy.      \\"All these organisations are working for the Bengalis who have left the country in order to get citizenship,\\" he said, using a pejorative term for the Rohingya that is widely accepted in Myanmar and falsely implies they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.      Deputy Minister for Information Aung Hla Tun told AFP he was personally sad and disappointed by Amnesty's announcement and said Aung San Suu Kyi was being treated \\"unfairly\\".      Such moves would only \\"make the people love her more\\", he added.      People on the street in Yangon were defiant.      \\"Their withdrawal is pretty childish. It's like when children aren't getting along with each other and take back their toys,\\" 50-year-old Khin Maung Aye said.      \\"We don't need their prize,\\" said Htay Htay, 60.      More than 720,000 Rohingya were driven over the border to Bangladesh in a crackdown that started in August 2017, and refugees have detailed horrific testimony of murder, rape, torture and arson.      The military says it was defending itself against Rohingya militants.      UN investigators have called for top generals to be prosecuted for genocide and accused Aung San Suu Kyi's government of complicity, though has stopped short of calling for her to be hauled before a court.      Aung San Suu Kyi became a democracy icon after spearheading the opposition movement to the feared military junta, which resulted in her spending some 15 years under house arrest before her release in 2010.      She has yet to comment on Amnesty's decision herself but has in the past shrugged off questions about withdrawn awards.      Calls to revoke Aung San Suu Kyi's 1991 Nobel Peace Prize have been rebuffed by the committee that oversees it.      Some think, however, that Amnesty's move will be taken more personally because she became a cause celebre for the rights group during her house arrest.      \\"This is effectively an excommunication of Aung San Suu Kyi from the pantheon of human rights champions,\\" Yangon-based independent analyst David Mathieson said, adding that the decision would \\"sting\\". ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Amnesty International has withdrawn its Ambassador of Conscience Award from Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's leader, for her failure to address the Rohingya crisis.

Spacey was born in South Orange, New Jersey, to Kathleen Ann (nee Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a technical writer and data consultant. He has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a limo driver and Rod Stewart impersonator in Boise, Idaho, and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker. His family relocated to Southern California when Spacey was four years old. Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is estranged) has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist \\"Nazi supporter\\", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become \\"very sly and smart\\" to avoid whippings. Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of Henry VI, Part 1 in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, starring Liv Ullmann. Then he portrayed Philinte in Moliere's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre.  His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to him and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. He made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of Crime Story, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.  Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on L.A. Law, the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the comedy See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series Wiseguy. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple in the dark comedy film The Ref (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire Swimming with Sharks, and the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in 1995's The Usual Suspects won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film Seven, making a sudden entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in Seven, The Usual Suspects and Outbreak earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards. He remarked in 2013: \\"I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.\\" Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in A Time to Kill (1996), and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film Albino Alligator (1996). The film was a failure at the box office, grossing 339,379 with a budget of 6 million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film A Bug's Life (1998).

Pantyhose are typically sheer and lightweight, ranging from 10 to 30 denier, and are designed to be worn with skirts or dresses. They cover the entire leg, extending up to the waist, and are often made of nylon or a nylon/spandex blend. On the other hand, tights are typically thicker and more opaque than pantyhose. They range from 40 to 100+ denier and can be made of various materials such as cotton, wool, or a nylon blend. Tights are often worn to provide extra warmth during colder seasons and can be paired with skirts, dresses, or even shorts. While both pantyhose and tights serve the purpose of covering and shaping the legs, tights offer more coverage and warmth due to their higher denier count."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following text in four sentences or less.: China's economy is in trouble - and its youth unemployment crisis is at the heart of the problem Jennifer Sor Sun, July 23, 2023 at 4:15 p.m. GMT-4·3 min read China economy A woman shops at a supermarket in Beijing, China, October 15, 2015.REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon China's youth unemployment problem is the root of its economic woes, according to economist Nancy Qian. Unemployment among workers aged 16-24 hit a record 21% last quarter. That's largely due to a shortage of high-skill, high-paying jobs, which will weigh on its economy. China's economy is in crisis – and the nation's youth unemployment problem could be at the root of its current troubles, according to Northwestern University economist Nancy Qian. \\"To stem the reversal of its economic fortunes, China must address the root of the problem: the lack of high-paying, high-skilled jobs,\\" Qian said in an op-ed for Project Syndicate this week. \\"If the economy is going to grow (or at least avoid a contraction) in the long run, the government must create the conditions for job creation in high-productivity sectors, and for greater investment in higher education.\\" Qian pointed to rampant unemployment among China's younger generation, with a record 21% of workers aged 16-24 out of a job in the second quarter, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. That's largely been driven by the lack of high-skill and high-paying jobs in China's employment market, which have left many college graduates unable to find work. It's also been exacerbated by a number of initiatives China has undertaken in the recent years. In 2021, the government banned online tutoring to reduce pressure on schoolchildren, but that's had the effect of reducing the number of available jobs in the tech industry, Qian said. The government has also pushed to increase China's fertility rate, which has made employers hesitant to hire younger women. \\"Young women's darkening employment outlook is just one of the many signs that the Chinese economy is headed in the wrong direction,\\" Qian warned, noting that China is now diverging from patterns typically seen in advanced economies. Advanced nations typically see higher education rates, smaller family sizes, and growing labor-force participation among women – trends that are now being reversed in China's socioeconomic fabric, especially as the lack of high-paying jobs in the nation lowers the cultural emphasis on education. Meanwhile, China's economy has been slowing, with the nation seeing a disappointing economic revival since dialing back its zero-COVID policies at the start of this year. Real estate and factory activity have slowed, and the nation now risks deflation as demand fails to pick up. GDP growth has already started to decline, and accelerated just 6.3% the past quarter, well-below economists' estimates of 7.1%. \\"The slowdown from 10% annual GDP growth was inevitable. But current patterns raise profound concerns for China's economic outlook, especially considering that the government's policies for addressing them have not worked,\\" Qian said. Other experts have said China's future could be grim if its economy doesn't pick up soon. China may be headed for a lost decade, according to one former International Monetary Fund official, and its weakening economy could end up impacting US firms that are heavily exposed to nation, experts say.","output":"China's economy is facing a crisis, and the high youth unemployment rate is at the center of the problem.

The food giant, which has six factories in Russia, refused to say whether it would intervene to stop staff being called up to fight in Ukraine. Questions have been raised following rival Unilever’s admission that it would allow Russian staff to be conscripted. The Swiss business said it is closely monitoring developments in Russia and would “act to safeguard the wellbeing” of its employees and “protect their fundamental rights”. However, when pressed further, Nestlé declined to say it would take action to stop the conscription of its staff. Russian law requires any company operating in the country to allow the conscription of workers should they be called upon. Nestlé and Unilever are among a handful of Western businesses that have remained in Russia following the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Both have cut back operations in the country and argue that they are providing vital goods to ordinary people who are not involved in the war. Nestlé said it continues to sell “essential and basic foods”. Products available in Russian supermarkets reportedly include chocolate bars, Nescafé, Purina pet food and Bystrow breakfast cereals. However, Western businesses are under growing pressure to exit Russia altogether as the war in Ukraine drags on. Valeriia Voshchevska, of the Ukraine Solidarity Project, a campaign group, said: “Companies basically gamble with the lives of their staff and with their reputation by staying there. “It’s not like operating in any other country. It’s operating in a country that has basically thrown out any rules and any kind of laws through the window.” Reginaldo Ecclissato, Unilever’s chief business operations and supply chain officer, has said continuing to run its Russian business with strict constraints was better than selling it with a potential benefit to the Kremlin, or closing down and seeing operations appropriated by the Russian state.

Mr Hargreaves said: “Those arguments don’t hold much water now, because it’s not really stopping the Russians doing whatever they want.” He pointed out that the Russian Government expropriated assets from Carlsberg and Danone last week under a decree aimed at companies from “unfriendly” countries. Mr Hargreaves said Unilever, Nestlé and other businesses are “being blackmailed into allowing their employees to be conscripted” because if they did not, they would be shut down or have their assets expropriated. He said: “By staying on it would risk losing more in reputation globally than they might save short term in monetary terms and continuing in Russia. “At the same time, they can’t really say that they’re safeguarding their employees or their well-being anymore.” A Nestlé spokesman said: “Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, we have implemented the actions we committed to take last year concerning our operations in Russia, and drastically reduced our portfolio in the country to refocus our efforts on continuing to provide access to essential and basic foods for the local people. “We continue to closely monitor developments in Russia, and act to safeguard the wellbeing of all our employees and to protect their fundamental rights. We have been clear that our employees in Russia should be considered essential workers given the critical nature of our sector: producing food. “Of course, we are fully complying with all applicable international sanctions on Russia.”","output":"Nestlé workers in Russia are at risk of being conscripted into the Ukraine war, with over 7,000 employees potentially affected.

Several methods have been proposed and utilized for non-isothermal reactor network synthesis. Some of these methods include: 1. Convex Programming: This method formulates the reactor network synthesis problem as a mathematical optimization problem with convex constraints. It involves using mathematical programming techniques, such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) or nonlinear programming (NLP), to simultaneously optimize reactor sizes, operating conditions, and heat transfer mechanisms. Convex programming methods account for temperature-dependent reaction kinetics, heat transfer, and the overall energy balance of the system. 2. Sequential Modular Approach: This approach divides the reactor network synthesis problem into sequential stages. Each stage involves determining the optimal design and operation of a single reactor, considering the heat transfer and temperature profiles. Subsequently, the outputs of one stage may serve as inputs for the next stage. This sequential modular approach accounts for the interactions between the reactors and the overall thermal behavior of the system. 3. Genetic Algorithms: Genetic algorithms (GA) have also been utilized for non-isothermal reactor network synthesis. GA-based methods involve encoding the design variables (e.g., reactor sizes, operating conditions, heat transfer coefficients) into a chromosome, which is then optimized using genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation. The fitness function in GA is typically defined based on the desired temperature profiles, conversion, selectivity, or other performance metrics. 4. Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP): MINLP methods address non-isothermal reactor network synthesis by combining integer and nonlinear programming techniques. MINLP formulations consider discrete decisions (e.g., the selection of reactors and heat exchangers) while simultaneously optimizing continuous variables (e.g., reactor sizes, temperature profiles). MINLP methods aim to find the best combination of reactors and heat exchangers to achieve the desired temperature profiles and optimize the performance of the reaction system. 5. Surrogate-Based Optimization: Surrogate-based optimization methods involve constructing approximation models, or surrogate models, to represent the behavior of the reactor network and its thermal characteristics. These surrogate models are computationally efficient and can be used in iterative optimization algorithms to search for the optimal reactor sizes, operating conditions, and heat transfer mechanisms. The surrogate models can be constructed using various techniques, such as response surface methodology or Gaussian processes. These are some of the methods commonly used for non-isothermal reactor network synthesis. Each method has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of method depends on factors such as problem complexity, computational resources, and the availability of information regarding reaction kinetics and heat transfer properties."},{"instruction":"Steps for synthesis of non isothermal reactor network by genetic algorithm","output":"Here are the steps for the synthesis of a non-isothermal reactor network using a genetic algorithm (GA): 1. Define the Problem: Clearly define the objectives, constraints, and design requirements for the non-isothermal reactor network synthesis problem. This includes specifying the desired temperature profiles, conversion/selectivity targets, reaction kinetics, heat transfer mechanisms, and other relevant factors. 2. Encoding: Determine the representation scheme for the individuals in the GA. This could involve encoding reactor types, sizes, operating conditions, heat transfer coefficients, and other relevant variables into a chromosome or genotype. 3. Fitness Evaluation: Define a fitness function that quantitatively evaluates the quality of each individual in the population. The fitness function should consider the desired temperature profiles, conversion or selectivity levels, energy consumption, and any other performance metrics relevant to the problem. 4. Generate Initial Population: Create an initial population of individuals randomly or using heuristics. The initial population should have a diverse range of solutions to explore the design space effectively. 5. Parent Selection: Select a subset of individuals from the population to act as parents for the next generation. The selection can be done using various methods, such as roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, or rank-based selection, based on the fitness scores of individuals. 6. Crossover: Perform crossover operations on the selected parents to create offspring individuals. The crossover can be applied at the chromosome level or specific design variables level. This step involves exchanging genetic information between parents to create potentially better solutions. 7. Mutation: Introduce random changes to the offspring individuals using mutation operators. Mutation adds diversity to the population and helps explore new areas of the design space that may not be reached through crossover alone. 8. New Population: Generate a new population by combining the parents and offspring individuals. Care should be taken to maintain an appropriate population size and diversity while incorporating the best individuals found so far. 9. Fitness Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of the new population based on the defined fitness function. This step involves calculating the fitness scores for each individual and determining their performance. 10. Selection: Select the best individuals from the new population to act as parents for the next generation. This selection process ensures that the fitter individuals have a higher chance of reproducing and passing their genetic material to the next generation. 11. Termination Criteria: Define termination criteria for the GA. This could be a specific number of generations, reaching a satisfactory fitness level, or a combination of both. If the termination criteria are not met, go back to step 6. 12. Output: Once the termination criteria are met, select the best individual(s) from the final population based on their fitness scores. This solution represents the optimal non-isothermal reactor network design that satisfies the defined objectives and constraints. It is important to note that the above steps can be customized and adapted based on the specific requirements and complexities of the non-isothermal reactor network synthesis problem.

Solve the MINLP Model: Apply an appropriate MINLP solver to find the optimal solution for the non-isothermal reactor network synthesis problem. This involves solving the formulated MINLP model and optimizing the design variables to meet the defined objectives while satisfying the constraints. 5. Check Feasibility and Optimality: Verify whether the obtained solution satisfies all the constraints and global optimality criteria. If the solution is not feasible or optimal, go back to step 3 and adjust the initial conditions or revise the MINLP model accordingly. 6. Post-Processing: Analyze and interpret the obtained solution to extract meaningful information about the optimal non-isothermal reactor network design. This includes examining the reactor types, their sizes, operating conditions, temperature profiles, energy consumption, and any other relevant variables. 7. Sensitivity Analysis: Perform sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of changes in the problem parameters on the optimal solution. This analysis helps understand the robustness of the design and identify critical parameters that influence the non-isothermal reactor network synthesis. 8. Iterate if Necessary: Depending on the analysis, problem complexity, and user requirements, it may be necessary to repeat steps 3-7 with revised parameters or enhanced formulations for further optimization or exploration of the design space. 9. Output: Document and present the optimal non-isothermal reactor network design, including reactor configuration, sizes, operating conditions, temperature profiles, and other relevant information required for implementation or further analysis.

詹姆斯·王是一个住在小镇上的普通人，过着平凡而单调的生活。他住在一间老式的小屋里，生活的唯一乐趣就是每天在他珍贵的图书馆藏书中寻找知识的快乐。然而，就在一个寂静的夜晚，他的生活突然发生了惊人的变化…… 那天晚上，詹姆斯感到一种奇怪的不安。他在自己的小屋中走来走去，摇摇晃晃地走进厨房。突然，他听到了一个密密麻麻的声音，好像有人在他旁边低声说话。他四处张望，寻找声音的来源，但却发现房间里只有他一个人。 不知所措的詹姆斯开始打量起自己的周围。他注意到厨房里的一切都好像出现了微妙的变化。椅子上的披风好像被人褶皱过，桌子上的餐具好像被人用过一样。而且，最令他感到惊讶的是，马桶上的盖子竟然自己打开了！ 这是怎么回事？詹姆斯想着。他走过去，小心翼翼地把盖子合上。可是，没过多久，马桶盖又自动弹了起来。詹姆斯大吃一惊，有点害怕地后退了一步。 正在这时，一个微弱的声音从马桶中传了出来。“请不要害怕。”声音说道。詹姆斯无法相信自己的耳朵，他看着马桶盖上方，寻找声音的源头。 “我是马桶幽灵。”声音再次出现。这次，詹姆斯看到了一个淡淡的蓝色光芒从马桶上升起，慢慢形成一个人的模样。 “你……你是谁？”詹姆斯结巴地问道。 “我曾经是这个小镇上的一位居民，名叫亨利·杜克斯雷。”幽灵继续说道。“不幸的是，我在家中的一次事故中失去了生命，但我的灵魂无法离开这个世界，只能被困在这个马桶里。” 詹姆斯吃惊地瞪大了眼睛。“你是说……你成为了一个马桶幽灵？”他难以置信地问道。 幽灵慢慢点了点头。“是的，我的灵魂被困在这个马桶里已经有很长一段时间了。直到今天晚上，我终于能够和你交流。” 詹姆斯心跳加速，他不知道该如何应对这个突如其来的情况。“你为什么选择和我交流呢？”他小心地问道。 马桶幽灵微笑着回答：“因为我知道你是这个小镇上唯一能够听到我的声音的人。只有你能帮助我解开这个诅咒，让我的灵魂得到解脱。” 詹姆斯陷入思考，他不敢相信自己会成为一个故事中的英雄。然而，他同时也感受到了责任与勇气的召唤。他决定接受这个挑战，帮助这个可怜的灵魂回到他属于的地方。 第二章：失踪的日记 经过与马桶幽灵的交谈后，詹姆斯决定要解开亨利·杜克斯雷灵魂的诅咒。为了寻找解决方案，他开始研究小镇历史上的关于亨利的事件和传说。 在他的图书馆中，詹姆斯找到了一本名为《小镇鬼魂与诅咒》的书。他将书放在桌子上，开始仔细阅读起来。书中记载了关于小镇各种神秘事件的揭秘，其中也包括了亨利·杜克斯雷的故事。 据说，亨利是一个受人爱戴的年轻人，在小镇上有着良好的声誉。然而，一天晚上，他神秘地失踪了。没有人知道发生了什么，他的家人和朋友都陷入了深深的担忧中。尽管搜寻了很长时间，但始终没有找到他的踪迹。 詹姆斯认为，这次失踪一定与亨利的灵魂诅咒有关。于是，他下定决心要找到亨利被困的地方，为他解脱。 翻看着书中的页面，詹姆斯突然注意到一页日记。那是亨利的日记，他在失踪前记录的最后几个日子的经历。詹姆斯心颤不已，他迫切地想知道这个日记中是否有关键的信息。 他紧紧握着日记，找到一把旧钥匙，据说是亨利的家人保存的。詹姆斯不确定这把钥匙是否能给他带来答案，但他相信这是个好的线索。 于是，詹姆斯来到亨利曾经居住的房子。房子年久失修，墙壁布满了青苔，打开尘封已久的门，他进入了空荡荡的客厅。 仔细搜寻四周，他找到了亨利房间的门。他把钥匙插入锁眼，松了一口气发现它奇迹般地打开了。当詹姆斯进入房间时，他被一种既熟悉又陌生的气息包围着。 房间里摆放着几件亨利的个人物品和破旧的家具。詹姆斯目光落在一本已经翻开的日记本上。他知道这正是他想找的东西。手轻轻地触摸着脆弱的页面，他慢慢阅读着。 日记中记录着亨利对一些奇怪事件的描述。他提到了一个神秘的符咒，据说它可以帮助人们与灵魂交流。亨利写道，他在自己家中某个特殊的地方埋藏了这个符咒。 詹姆斯心跳加快，他相信这个符咒应该就是解开亨利灵魂诅咒的关键。他决定要找到这个地方，并将符咒带回来。 随着夜幕的降临，詹姆斯开始在房子的每个角落寻找这个特殊的地方。墙壁、地板、天花板……他一个个地检查着。终于，在一个旧式壁炉的背后，他找到了一块破碎的墙壁。 他小心翼翼地拿起一把铲子，将墙壁轻轻地敲碎。碎石落地的瞬间，一把破旧的符咒从墙壁的缝隙中掉了出来。詹姆斯迅速抓住它，感受到一股神秘的能量流过他的身体。 符咒带回到亨利曾经被困的马桶旁，詹姆斯将其小心翼翼地放在马桶上。在他的想象中，这个符咒将会打开一道通向亨利灵魂的大门。 第三章：灵魂的解放 詹姆斯心怀期待地站在马桶面前，凝视着摆放着符咒的马桶盖。他知道，解开亨利·杜克斯雷的灵魂诅咒只有一次机会。 手颤抖着，他小心翼翼地把盖子打开，符咒随即散发出微弱的光芒。一股神秘的力量弥漫在房间中，马桶里开始涌出一股轻微的蓝色烟雾。 突然，烟雾在空气中缓缓升腾，凝结成一个模糊的人形。而就在下一刻，亨利·杜克斯雷的灵魂终于显现出来。 亨利的灵魂温暖而富有生机，他注视着詹姆斯，饱含感激的目光中透露出欣喜和解脱。“谢谢你，勇敢的朋友。你帮助我摆脱了多年的困境。”亨利的声音充满了感激之情。 詹姆斯深吸一口气，微笑着说道，“我只是尽了自己的力量而已，亨利。现在，你可以离开这个被困的地方，回到你属于的世界。” 亨利的灵魂缓缓上升，离开马桶，逐渐变得透明，最终消失在空气中。在消失之前，他向詹姆斯道别，表达了对他的无限感激。 留下的只是那片空荡荡的房间，没有了亨利的存在，却充满了詹姆斯满足感和成就感。通过他的努力，他成功解开了亨利的灵魂诅咒，帮助他得到解脱。 然而，就在詹姆斯准备离开房间时，他注意到书架上的一本书掉到了地板上。他弯下腰，捡起这本书，发现它是亨利留下的日记。 简单地翻阅着日记，詹姆斯的目光停留在一页上。亨利在日记中写道：我的失踪与一场邪恶的阴谋有关。有人企图利用我的强大灵魂力量来达成邪恶目的。 这个发现让詹姆斯感到震惊，他决定深入调查这个阴谋。他要向小镇的居民揭露真相，保卫他们的安全。 为了完成这个任务，詹姆斯决定寻找亨利失踪期间的见证人。他走访了整个小镇，与村民交谈，搜寻任何可能的线索。终于，在一个老年瘦弱的妇女那里，他发现了关键的信息。 这位妇女名叫玛格丽特，她是亨利失踪当晚的邻居。她向詹姆斯回忆起那个晚上的情景，描述了一个陌生人悄悄进入了亨利的家。这个陌生人看起来邪恶而阴险，他企图得到亨利灵魂的力量。 詹姆斯意识到，这个陌生人才是亨利失踪背后的幕后黑手。他决定与玛格丽特一起揭开这个惊人的阴谋，保护小镇居民免受邪恶势力的侵害。 在踏上新的冒险之前，詹姆斯取下了一块亨利的墓碑上的碎片作为纪念。以亨利的灵魂为动力，他信心满满地准备继续追寻真相，打破邪恶的阴谋，保护小镇的安宁。 接下来的旅程将会是艰难险阻的，但詹姆斯知道他不会孤单。他将与亨利共同努力，为小镇带来光明与正义，解开这个神秘阴谋。他们的冒险才刚刚开始。

What is a subnet in networking? a) A subnet is a unique identification number assigned to each device connected to a network. b) A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. c) A subnet is a physical device used for network connectivity. d) A subnet is a software program that controls network traffic. Answer: b) A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. Explanation: A subnet is a technique used to divide a single larger network into smaller, more manageable networks. It involves assigning a subset of IP addresses from the original network to each smaller network, creating logical subdivisions called subnets. This division helps in efficient network management, improved security, and optimized communication between devices within the same subnet. 2. How are subnets identified in IP addressing? a) Subnets are identified by a unique domain name assigned by the network administrator. b) Subnets are identified by their subnet masks. c) Subnets are identified by a specific port number. d) Subnets are identified by their default gateway IP address. Answer: b) Subnets are identified by their subnet masks. Explanation: In IP addressing, subnets are identified by their subnet masks, which are used to determine the network and host portions of an IP address. A subnet mask is a 32-bit binary number that contains a sequence of ones (representing the network portion) followed by a sequence of zeros (representing the host portion). When a device receives an IP packet, it checks the subnet mask to distinguish between the network and host portions for proper routing. 3. What is the purpose of subnetting? a) To hide the network from external access. b) To create multiple virtual networks on a single physical network. c) To allocate more IP addresses to a network. d) To improve network performance by reducing network congestion. Answer: b) To create multiple virtual networks on a single physical network. Explanation: The main purpose of subnetting is to divide a single physical network into multiple virtual networks called subnets. This division allows network administrators to logically separate different departments, floors, or locations while using a single physical network infrastructure. Subnetting offers improved network management, enhanced security, and efficient utilization of IP addresses in large networks."},{"instruction":"Ein Patient oder Patientin ruft beim Sekretr einer Arztpraxis an und soll ihr Geburtsdatum/Geburtstag sagen.

In fact, forgiveness can be seen as a choice to do what is morally right or just. Here are some reasons why forgiveness does not conflict with rightness: 1. Choice to let go: Forgiveness is a choice to let go of anger, resentment, and desire for revenge. It involves recognizing the wrong done to oneself or others and consciously deciding to release negative emotions. This act of letting go is often seen as the morally right thing to do, as it promotes emotional well-being and personal growth. 2. Promotes understanding and empathy: Forgiveness requires understanding the circumstances, motivations, and perspectives of the wrongdoer. By seeking to understand the reasons behind someone's actions, forgiveness promotes empathy and compassion. It encourages us to recognize the common humanity in others and consider their capacity to change and grow. 3. Breaking the cycle of harm: Holding onto anger and seeking retribution can perpetuate a cycle of harm and negativity. Forgiveness, on the other hand, interrupts this cycle by refusing to engage in a harmful response. By choosing forgiveness, individuals have the opportunity to break the chain of negative actions and promote a more positive and peaceful world. 4. Personal healing and growth: Forgiving does not mean condoning or forgetting the wrongdoing. Instead, it focuses on personal healing and growth. By letting go of negative emotions, individuals can move forward and rebuild their lives. This personal growth and emotional well-being contribute to individual and societal rightness. 5. Building relationships: Forgiveness can help repair damaged relationships. By forgiving, individuals create room for reconciliation and the possibility of re-establishing trust and understanding. Restoring relationships is often considered to be a morally right and virtuous action. It is important to note that forgiveness should not be seen as blindly accepting or overlooking the wrongs committed. Rather, it involves a thoughtful and intentional choice to move forward, promoting personal and societal well-being while recognizing the importance of justice and accountability."},{"instruction":"阅读正面管教这本书，写一篇读书心得，要求500字左右","output":"《正面管教》是一本关于家庭教育的指导书籍，通过阅读这本书，我收获颇多。本书的核心理念是用正面的方式引导孩子，培养他们的自尊心和合作能力，以建立良好的家庭关系。以下是我对这本书的读后感。 首先，本书提供了许多实用的育儿技巧。作者详细阐述了如何倾听孩子的心声，理解他们的感受，并以正面的态度回应。书中强调了表达爱和鼓励的重要性，指出了经常使用鼓励的话语会对孩子产生积极的影响。同时，作者还介绍了一些处理孩子错误行为的方法，例如使用“时间-空间“概念，即在孩子犯错时采取冷却处理，等双方冷静下来再进行正面引导。 其次，本书强调建立良好的家庭关系的重要性。作者认为，家庭应该是一个温暖、相互尊重和信任的地方。他提醒父母要保持自己的情绪稳定，不要因为工作压力或其他事情将不快情绪带回家中。此外，作者还介绍了如何与伴侣交流，以建立共同目标和规则，共同培养孩子良好的品行和价值观。通过阅读这些章节，我深刻理解到家庭关系对孩子的发展有着举足轻重的影响。 最后，本书强调了给予孩子自治的重要性。作者指出，孩子有权利做一些决策，并从中学习。他提醒父母不要过分控制孩子，而是要给他们提供合适的机会去发展自己的能力和独立思考的能力。通过与孩子共同制定规则，鼓励他们承担责任，培养他们独立解决问题的能力。这样的方式有助于孩子建立起自信心和责任感。 通过阅读《正面管教》，我对家庭教育有了更深入的理解。这本书不仅帮助我认识到父母对孩子的言行举止有着巨大的影响力，还让我意识到正面的互动和尊重是建立良好家庭关系的关键。我将学习书中的技巧，尝试用更积极的方式与孩子沟通，并关注他们的需求和感受，用鼓励和理解培养他们的自信和自尊。 总之，阅读《正面管教》给我带来了很多启示。这本书不仅提供了实用的育儿技巧，还强调了良好家庭关系的重要性以及给予孩子自治的意义。通过应用书中的理念，我相信我能够实现与孩子更良好的互动，建立起积极的家庭环境。我强烈推荐这本书给所有有孩子的家长，它将帮助他们更好地理解和引导孩子，以及培养积极的家庭氛围。"},{"instruction":"Ein Patient oder Patientin ruft beim Sekretr einer Arztpraxis an und soll ihr Geburtsdatum/Geburtstag sagen.

The impact of this pandemic on the markets and the role of corporate banking is significant. The pandemic has led to a slowdown in economic activities worldwide, with businesses facing various challenges such as supply chain disruptions, decreased consumer demand, and reduced profitability. This has resulted in volatile financial markets, as investors assess the potential long-term effects of the pandemic on companies and industries. In the context of corporate banking, the pandemic has increased the demand for financial support and advisory services. Businesses are seeking assistance in managing their liquidity, accessing financing options, and strategizing for recovery. Corporate banks play a vital role in providing essential financial services to companies during these challenging times. Furthermore, the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation across industries, including banking. Corporate banks are increasingly relying on technology to facilitate remote working, enhance digital services for customers, and streamline their operations. This shift towards digital banking may result in changes in the structure and delivery of various corporate banking services. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought uncertainty and disruption to the global economy and financial markets. As a result, corporate banking roles are critical in supporting businesses through these challenging times, providing financial guidance, and adapting to the changing landscape of the industry."},{"instruction":"Hi!","output":"Hello!

This global health crisis has significantly impacted the financial markets and has a direct relationship with the role of corporate banking. The pandemic has caused volatility and uncertainty in financial markets worldwide. Stock markets observed significant movements, with major indices experiencing sharp declines during the initial outbreak, followed by periods of recovery and subsequent fluctuations. The pandemic has also resulted in a contraction of economic activity in many sectors, causing a slowdown in business investment, job losses, and reduced consumer spending. As a result, companies have faced liquidity challenges, disruptions in supply chains, and difficulties in accessing credit. This situation has increased the importance of corporate banking as businesses require support and financial solutions to navigate these uncertain times. Corporate banks can play a crucial role by assisting companies in managing their cash flows, providing working capital, offering loan restructuring options, and facilitating access to government-backed relief programs. Additionally, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital banking solutions and remote working practices, with a greater emphasis on online transactions and cashless payments. Corporate banks have responded by enhancing their digital capabilities and providing secure platforms for business transactions. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the significance of corporate banking in supporting businesses during times of crisis. The role of corporate banking professionals is to provide tailored financial solutions, manage risk, and help businesses adapt to the ever-changing market conditions resulting from the pandemic."},{"instruction":"写一篇暑假实践报告，要求如下：1、字数不少于三千字；2、报告主题为东莞的发展；3、考察目标和场所是东莞国贸中心；4、️包括标题、摘要、正文️，正文部分需要包括研究内容和目标、研究方法、结果等，要描绘实践过程（研究内容就是各调研成员提交的图片及解说） ️实践报告里不要体现个人心得体会","output":"实践报告：东莞的发展 摘要： 本报告通过对东莞国贸中心的考察，全面了解了东莞的发展情况。研究内容主要包括对东莞国贸中心的规模、运营模式、发展历程等方面进行调研。通过采取问卷调查、实地观察等研究方法，得出了东莞国贸中心的发展潜力及对东莞经济发展的影响。本次实践过程中，我们团队成员共同进行了调研工作，收集了大量的实地照片，并结合解说，更加生动地描绘了东莞国贸中心的实际情况。 一、引言 东莞作为中国重要的制造业基地之一，近年来在经济发展方面取得了显著成果。为了更好地了解东莞的发展，我们选择了东莞国贸中心作为考察目标。本报告将通过研究内容、研究方法和研究结果等方面，全面展示东莞的发展情况。 二、研究内容与目标 1.研究内容： 对东莞国贸中心的规模、运营模式、发展历程等方面进行调研，并通过实地照片和解说，揭示其中的发展亮点和潜力。 2.研究目标： 通过对东莞国贸中心的考察，全面了解东莞的发展情况，探索其发展模式及对东莞经济的影响。 三、研究方法 我们采用了问卷调查和实地观察相结合的方法，对东莞国贸中心进行了深入了解。 1.问卷调查 通过设计问卷，对东莞国贸中心的运营模式、消费需求及发展方向进行调查。我们在调查过程中采访了相关工作人员，获取了较为准确的信息。 2.实地观察 在东莞国贸中心进行实地考察，深入了解其内部运营情况，观察其经营格局、顾客流量等方面，并通过拍摄照片以及解说，形成实践报告的内容。 四、结果 1.规模与运营模式 东莞国贸中心位于市中心区域，总占地面积达到30万平方米，拥有各类商户2,500余家。其运营模式多样化，融合了购物中心、商业综合体、食品街等多种业态，为消费者提供了综合化的购物、娱乐和休闲体验。 2.发展历程 东莞国贸中心自建成以来，不断进行改造和升级，提升了商业配套设施和服务质量。通过引入国内外知名品牌，吸引了更多的商户入驻，进一步提升了其影响力和竞争力，成为东莞市内一个不可或缺的商业地标。 3.对东莞经济的影响 东莞国贸中心的快速发展，带动了周边经济的繁荣，为东莞市的消费市场注入了活力。同时，东莞国贸中心还积极开展市场营销活动，吸引了大量国内外游客前来消费，提高了东莞市在国内市场的知名度。 五、实践过程 在本次实践过程中，我们团队成员共同进行了调研工作。我们首先设计了问卷，然后前往东莞国贸中心进行实地观察，同时进行问卷调查。通过问卷调查结果和实地观察所得的资料，我们形成了大量的实地照片，并结合解说，使报告内容更加生动有趣。 六、结论 通过本次对东莞国贸中心的考察，我们全面了解了东莞的发展情况。东莞国贸中心作为一个商业综合体，通过不断的改造和升级，成为推动东莞经济发展的重要力量之一。我们相信，在未来的发展中，东莞国贸中心将持续发挥其示范带动作用，为东莞经济的繁荣做出更大的贡献。 参考文献： 无 附录： 东莞国贸中心实地照片及解说"},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么我可以帮助您的？"},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！请问有什么我可以为您做的吗？"},{"instruction":"Write email for quality of transport use below points. rash driving to meet dedline. drivers and supervisors are rude, pick-up and drops are not on time.","output":"Dear [Transportation Company], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns regarding the quality of transport services provided by your company. Throughout my recent experiences, I have encountered a number of issues that I believe need to be addressed in order to ensure a more satisfactory and efficient transportation experience. Firstly, I have noticed a concerning trend of rash driving amongst your drivers. While I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, it is crucial that the safety of passengers is not compromised. I have observed instances where drivers exceed speed limits and display aggressive driving behaviors in an attempt to arrive at their destinations quickly. This not only puts the lives of passengers at risk, but it also tarnishes the reputation of your company. Additionally, I would like to bring to your attention the behavior of both drivers and supervisors. Their approach towards passengers is often rude and abrasive. A courteous and respectful attitude is expected when dealing with customers, and it is disheartening to experience otherwise. I believe it is essential for your staff to undergo training in customer service skills to create a more welcoming and pleasant atmosphere for passengers. Furthermore, I have encountered issues with the punctuality of pick-up and drop-off times. Timeliness is crucial, especially for those relying on your transportation services for work or appointments. In several instances, I have experienced delays, resulting in inconvenience and potential consequences for being late. Ensuring that drivers adhere strictly to the specified schedule and take into consideration the importance of punctuality would greatly improve the overall quality of your services. I understand that managing a transportation company can be challenging, with various factors affecting the daily operations. However, I believe these concerns must be addressed to enhance the service quality and maintain customer satisfaction. I kindly request that you take these matters seriously and implement suitable measures to rectify these issues promptly. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will strive to make the necessary improvements and restore the exemplary service that your transportation company has provided in the past.

I wanted to bring to your attention some concerns regarding the quality of our transport services. There have been several instances of rash driving reported, which not only poses a risk to the safety of our employees but also sends a negative message about our organization to others on the road. In addition, there have been complaints about the behavior of some of our drivers and supervisors. It is important for them to maintain professionalism and respect towards our employees, as they represent our company. Rude behavior not only hampers the overall experience of our employees but can also impact their productivity and morale. Another major concern is the punctuality of the pick-up and drop-off schedules. It has come to my attention that our employees have been facing delays or unexpected changes in their transport arrangements. This not only inconveniences them but also disrupts their daily workflow and productivity. To address these issues, I would like to propose implementing a feedback mechanism that allows our employees to provide regular input on their experience with the transport service. This will help us identify areas of improvement and ensure that our transport facility meets their expectations.

During a demanding professional period, one might encounter situations that require juggling multiple high-pressure tasks. Here's a hypothetical scenario along with some strategies one could employ to successfully complete all tasks: Imagine working in a fast-paced marketing agency where you are assigned to handle a major ad campaign, analyze market research data, and provide input on a client's social media strategy. All of these tasks are time-sensitive and require careful attention. To successfully manage this situation, here are some strategies you could employ: 1. Prioritize and organize: Start by assessing the urgency and importance of each task. Identify essential deadlines and allocate time slots accordingly. This will help establish a clear order and prevent feeling overwhelmed. 2. Break tasks into manageable sub-tasks: Divide each major task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. This allows you to focus on one component at a time, preventing mental overload. Prioritize the sub-tasks based on dependencies and deadlines. 3. Time management: Create a detailed schedule or to-do list, outlining specific time slots for each sub-task. Be realistic with your time estimates and build in buffers for unexpected issues. This will help maintain focus and ensure progress on all fronts. 4. Delegate or seek support: If possible, delegate non-crucial components of a task to competent colleagues, allowing you to focus on critical aspects. Alternatively, seek support from team members who can help handle certain responsibilities, easing your workload. 5. Communicate effectively: Inform relevant stakeholders or team members about your workload and deadlines. Communication fosters understanding and may enable adjustments, collaboration, or reprioritization when necessary. 6. Practice stress management: High-pressure situations can strain productivity, so ensure you take care of your well-being. Practice stress-management techniques like deep breathing exercises, short breaks, regular exercise, or meditation to stay focused and calm. 7. Learn from the experience: After successfully completing the tasks, reflect on the efficiency of your strategies and identify areas for improvement. Evaluate your time allocation, delegation choices, and the overall effectiveness of your approach. Use these insights to refine your management skills for future high-pressure situations. Remember that each situation is unique, and adaptability is key. By employing effective strategies, managing time efficiently, seeking support, and reflecting on the experience, juggling multiple high-pressure tasks can become more manageable and provide valuable lessons to enhance future performances."},{"instruction":"招标和投标的通俗理解","output":"招标和投标是指一个公司、组织或个人在需要采购某种产品或服务时，通过发布招标公告，邀请其他公司或个人提供报价和竞标，以选择合适的供应商。招标就像是发布招募通知，而投标则是响应这个通知进行竞争。 招标是指招标方根据自身需求和要求，编写招标文件，包括项目的详细描述、技术规格、质量要求、合同条款、评标标准等，并通过公告、报纸、网站等途径发布给可能的供应商。招标可以是开放招标（任何符合条件的供应商都可以参与竞标）、邀请招标（预先选择数个符合条件的供应商参与竞标）或者定向招标（只邀请特定供应商竞标）。 投标则是指符合招标条件的供应商，在规定的截止日期前，根据招标文件编写自己的竞标文件，并提交给招标方进行评估。投标文件通常包括报价、技术方案、公司资质、施工计划等内容。投标方需要按照招标方要求的评标标准和程序，提供最具竞争力的报价和解决方案。 招标和投标的目的是为了确保采购方能够选择到最合适的供应商，并获得最有利的合同条款。对于供应商来说，招标和投标则提供了一个公平竞争的机会，展示自己的专业能力和优势，争取获得合同并扩大业务。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This problem can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. The superstructure method is a commonly used technique in NIRN synthesis, where a set of potential reactor and heat exchanger units are included in the superstructure. The decision variables include the selection of units, the connections between them, and the operating conditions such as temperatures and flow rates. The objective function typically involves minimizing the total cost of the reactor network, which includes capital and operating costs. The capital cost is related to the number and size of the selected units, while the operating cost is related to the energy consumption and material usage. The constraints include mass and energy balances, temperature and pressure constraints, reaction kinetics, and equipment specifications. Additionally, binary variables are used to determine the presence or absence of each unit in the network. The MINLP problem is usually solved using optimization software packages that can handle mixed-integer variables and nonlinear constraints. Several techniques are available for solving MINLP problems, such as branch and bound, outer approximation, and spatial branch and bound. The solution to the problem provides the optimal configuration of the non-isothermal reactor network, including the types and sizes of the selected units, the operating conditions, and the overall performance of the system."},{"instruction":"Solved example of non isothermal reactor network synthesis using genetic algorithm","output":"Sure! Here's a simplified example of how genetic algorithm can be applied to solve the non-isothermal reactor network synthesis problem. Consider a system with three potential reactor units and two potential heat exchanger units. The objective is to find the optimal configuration of the reactor network that minimizes the total cost, while satisfying constraints such as mass and energy balances, temperature and pressure limitations, and reaction kinetics. 1. Encoding: Each potential reactor and heat exchanger unit can be represented as a binary string. For example, \\"001\\" represents using the first reactor unit and not using the second and third reactor units. Similarly, \\"11\\" represents using both heat exchanger units. 2. Initialization: A population of randomly generated binary strings is created as an initial population. 3. Evaluation: Each individual in the population is evaluated by simulating the reactor network using the corresponding configuration. The total cost is calculated based on the capital and operating costs. 4. Selection: Individuals with better fitness (lower cost) are selected for the next generation using selection operators like tournament selection or roulette wheel selection. 5. Crossover: Selected individuals undergo crossover, which involves exchanging genetic information between two individuals. For example, a one-point crossover may randomly select a position in the binary strings of two individuals and exchange the information after that position. 6. Mutation: A small percentage of the new population undergoes mutation, where bits are flipped to introduce genetic diversity. 7. Evaluation: The mutated and crossover individuals are evaluated by simulating the reactor network and calculating the total cost. 8. Elitism: The best individuals from the previous population are transferred to the new population to ensure the best solutions are not lost. 9. Termination: The algorithm iteratively repeats steps 4 to 8 until a termination criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or until the cost improvement becomes insignificant. The final output of the genetic algorithm is the configuration of the reactor network with the lowest cost obtained after many generations. This configuration provides the optimal selection of reactors and heat exchangers, along with their operating conditions, to minimize the total cost of the system while satisfying the given constraints."},{"instruction":"Generate code for genetic algorithm for synthesis of non isothermal reactor network","output":"Certainly!

SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) is a feature descriptor that detects and describes keypoints in images, which can be used for various computer vision tasks such as image matching, object recognition, and image stitching. SIFT features are invariant to scale, rotation, and affine transformations, making them robust against different image conditions. This makes them suitable for matching features across images with variations in viewpoint, lighting conditions, and scale. On the other hand, epipolar geometry is a concept used in stereo vision and 3D reconstruction. It involves the relationship between corresponding points in two images captured by two different cameras or viewpoints. Epipolar geometry allows us to determine the location and orientation of the cameras, as well as the 3D structure of the scene. It helps in solving the correspondence problem and finding the matchings between points in different images. So, SIFT feature descriptor is used for finding and describing distinctive image features, while epipolar geometry is used for geometrically relating corresponding points in stereo images. They serve different purposes in computer vision applications and are often used together in tasks such as 3D reconstruction using stereo vision, where SIFT features can be used for feature matching and epipolar geometry can be used for triangulation and depth estimation."},{"instruction":"a calibrated camera capture two images of a single object from two different locations. we know the projection matrices for both orientations as well as image coordinates. how can we determine the object location in world coordinate system?","output":"To determine the object location in the world coordinate system, given the calibrated camera and the projection matrices for both orientations, you can use the principles of triangulation. Here's a step-by-step process: 1. Obtain the camera matrices: You have the projection matrices (P1 and P2) for both camera orientations. These matrices represent the mapping between the world coordinate system and the image coordinate system. 2. Calculate the camera centers: The camera centers represent the position of the cameras in the world coordinate system. They can be extracted from the projection matrices as the last column, denoted as C1 and C2. 3. Compute the rays: For each point in the image coordinates, convert the image coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) into normalized homogeneous image coordinates by dividing by the focal length. - For the first camera: x1 = X1 / Z1, y1 = Y1 / Z1, where (X1, Y1, Z1) represents the 3D point in the world coordinate system. - For the second camera: x2 = X2 / Z2, y2 = Y2 / Z2, where (X2, Y2, Z2) represents the 3D point in the world coordinate system. 4. Compute the 3D point: Use the triangulation method to compute the 3D point in the world coordinate system. This can be done by intersecting the rays from the two camera centers (C1 and C2) with the normalized image coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively. 5. Obtain the object location: The computed 3D point (X, Y, Z) represents the location of the object in the world coordinate system. By performing this process for multiple point correspondences between the two images, you can obtain a dense 3D reconstruction of the object in the world coordinate system."},{"instruction":"What is epipole in epipolar geometry?","output":"In epipolar geometry, the epipole is an essential concept that helps establish the relationship between two images captured by different cameras or viewpoints. An epipole is a point in one image that corresponds to the position of the other camera's optical center in the other image. In other words, it represents the projection of the second camera's center onto the image plane of the first camera. The epipole can be different for each image, and it lies on the epipolar line. An epipolar line is the 2D projection of a 3D line in the world coordinate system onto the image plane. For every point in one image, its corresponding epipolar line in the other image connects to the epipole. Similarly, the epipolar line in the first image for a point in the second image also connects to the epipole of the first image. The epipole and epipolar lines are important concepts because they allow us to reduce the correspondence problem in stereo vision from a 2D search to a 1D search along a specific line. By estimating the epipole and epipolar lines, we can infer the corresponding points between the two images and perform 3D reconstruction by triangulating these correspondences using the epipolar constraint. In summary, the epipole is the image point that corresponds to the optical center of the other camera, and it plays a crucial role in establishing the geometric relationship between multiple views in epipolar geometry."},{"instruction":"What is epipolar line in epipolar geometry?","output":"In epipolar geometry, an epipolar line is a fundamental concept that denotes the projection of a 3D line onto the image plane. Specifically, it represents the possible locations of a corresponding point in one image given the location of a point in the other image. An epipolar line is associated with each point in an image and is determined by the epipole and the corresponding camera's intrinsic parameters. The epipolar line in one image connects to the epipole of the other image. Similarly, the epipolar line in the second image for a point in the first image also connects to the epipole of the first image. The epipolar line has several crucial properties: 1. Correspondence Constraint: For a given point in one image, its corresponding point lies on the epipolar line in the other image. This constraint helps establish the correspondence between points in stereo images. 2. Uniqueness: The corresponding point of a given point can be uniquely determined by intersection with its corresponding epipolar line. 3. Epipolar Plane: The epipolar lines lie on the epipolar plane, which is a plane passing through the camera centers and the 3D point of interest. This plane determines the epipolar geometry of the stereo vision setup. 4. Epipolar Line Constraints: The epipolar line is constrained by various properties such as collinearity, coplanarity, and the camera projection matrices. These constraints are used to derive algorithms and methods for stereo matching and 3D reconstruction. By using epipolar lines, the correspondence problem in stereo vision can be reduced from a 2D search to a 1D search along the epipolar lines, making it more efficient to find the corresponding points between images. In summary, epipolar lines provide a powerful geometric constraint in epipolar geometry that helps establish correspondence between points in stereo images and simplifies the process of stereo matching and 3D reconstruction."},{"instruction":"What is the degree of freedom of fundamental matrix?","output":"The fundamental matrix in computer vision and epipolar geometry represents the relationship between corresponding points in two images captured by different cameras. It defines the mapping between the points and their corresponding epipolar lines. The fundamental matrix F has a total of 9 elements, arranged in a 3x3 matrix. However, not all 9 elements are independent. The degree of freedom of the fundamental matrix is given by 9 - k, where k is the minimal number of equations required to determine the matrix. The minimal number of equations required to determine the fundamental matrix is 7. This means that we need a minimum of 7 correspondences between points in the two images to estimate the fundamental matrix. With 7 equations, the degree of freedom of the fundamental matrix is 9 - 7 = 2. The 2 degrees of freedom in the fundamental matrix correspond to the scale factor and the overall rotation between the two images. These two degrees of freedom represent the essential information required to establish the epipolar geometry and the relationship between the two images. It's worth noting that if we have more than 7 correspondences, we can perform an over-determined estimation of the fundamental matrix with more accurate results. Nonetheless, the fundamental matrix still has 2 degrees of freedom even with additional correspondences beyond the minimum requirement."},{"instruction":"bonjour !","output":"Bonjour !

Monika, what do we do next?” Monika: (thinking quickly) “First, we need to make sure Yuri is as comfortable as possible.

Just breathe and push with all your strength.” Monika: (calmly) “Remember to listen to your body and follow its cues. We’re right here with you.” Sayori: (holding Yuri’s hand) “You’re doing amazing, Yuri! Keep pushing, and we’ll meet your beautiful baby soon.” (Yuri pushes with determination, the pain and effort evident on her face. The girls continue to support her, guiding her through the process.)

In the case of a fundamental matrix in projective geometry, which represents the relationship between two sets of points in two different images, the degree of freedom is typically six. This is because there are six unknown parameters that need to be estimated, which include rotation, translation, and scale factors."},{"instruction":"What is the degree of freedom of essential matrix?","output":"The degree of freedom of an essential matrix is typically five. The essential matrix represents the relationship between two calibrated cameras in computer vision and is used to estimate the relative pose between the cameras. The essential matrix is defined up to a scale factor, which reduces its degree of freedom to five. This means that there are five unknown parameters that need to be estimated, which typically include rotation and translation components."},{"instruction":"Напиши квенту на 1500 символов для персонажа c имене си чженгжан. Распиши подробнее характер персонажа - хобби, фобии, мысли, цели, мечты, плюсы и минусы характера, повадки, привычки.","output":"Си Чжэнчэн – таинственная и загадочная личность, которую трудно проникнуть. Внешне он скромен и устремлен, в его глазах светятся независимость и озарение. Высокий, стройный и неописуемо привлекательный, он уже на первый взгляд привлекает внимание окружающих. Несмотря на свой привлекательный внешний вид, Си Чжэнчэн – закрытый и внутренне раздираемый человек. От него веет загадкой, и никто не знает, что происходит в его голове. Хотя он держит свои мысли и цели в секрете, есть несколько вещей, о которых можно сказать наверняка. Си Чжэнчэн – искусствовед и исследователь древних цивилизаций. Его направление – история искусства с фокусом на китайскую мифологию. Он отдает свою душу своей работе, без устали исследует археологические находки и старые манускрипты, чтобы воссоздать потерянные древние миры. Его исследования зачастую приводят его в глубины жестокости и тайн прошлого, но он непоколебим и продолжает свой путь. Он одержим открытием истины и считает, что она является ключом к пониманию нашего современного мира. Как и любой гений, у Си Чжэнчэна свои четкие привычки и повадки. Он привык работать долгие часы без еды и сна, полностью погружаясь в свою исследовательскую деятельность. Его фанатичная преданность своему делу может иногда закрывать ему глаза на другие аспекты жизни, что приводит к тому, что он становится социально неуклюжим и изолированным. Однако это не мешает ему быть вежливым и обходительным в общении с другими людьми. Одна из его главных фобий – социальные события и групповые сборы. Си Чжэнчэн никогда не чувствует себя комфортно на людных вечеринках или в крупных компаниях, и он предпочитает быть один, уединиться с собой и своими мыслями. Если речь идет о своей работе, он готов выйти за рамки своей комфортной зоны, но в общении со своими коллегами он иногда впадает в неловкие ситуации из-за своей неуклюжести и отсутствия общительности. Несмотря на все эти трудности, Си Чжэнчэн продолжает движение к своей цели. Он личность полна силы и выносливости, и никогда не прекращает бороться за свои мечты. Его мечтой является открытие потерянных тайн древних цивилизаций и прославление своего имени в мире науки и искусства. Он хочет быть признанным великим умом своего времени и оставить свой след в истории. Си Чжэнчэн – это загадочная и конфликтная личность, но именно такие люди часто вносят наибольший вклад в общественное развитие и исследования. Его привычки и фобии могут сдерживать его в социальных ситуациях, но его страстное отношение к науке и искусству делает его незаменимой личностью в своей области. Си Чжэнчэн гордо идет своим путем, несмотря на преграды, и его преданность и самоотверженность делают его впечатляющей и вдохновляющей личностью."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Natsuki: (absolutely fuming) “GAH!

The ability to purchase and maintain a superyacht depends primarily on one's financial means and legal obligations, rather than age.

So, it's important to consider the costs involved and ensure you have the necessary resources to fulfill these requirements."},{"instruction":"So I can get one as early as 25?","output":"While it is possible for someone as young as 25 to purchase a superyacht, it is relatively uncommon.

It is a system engineering software developed by National Instruments that provides a graphical programming environment for designing, controlling, and testing complex measurement and control systems. LabVIEW allows users to build applications using a visual programming language, where they can drag and drop predefined functions and components to create virtual instruments (VIs). VIs in LabVIEW are like building blocks that can be connected together to create a desired functionality. They can include data acquisition, signal processing, data analysis, and communication with hardware devices such as sensors and actuators. LabVIEW also supports various hardware platforms and can be used for tasks such as data logging, automated testing, and industrial automation. One of the key features of LabVIEW is its graphical programming language called G, which uses icons and wires to represent functions and data flow between them. This visual representation makes it easy for users to understand and modify their programs. In addition, LabVIEW provides libraries of prebuilt functions and tools for analysis, simulation, and visualization. LabVIEW is widely used in many fields such as research, academia, and industry for a range of applications including robotics, measurements and control systems, data analysis, and scientific research.

Das ständige Ein- und Ausschalten kann die Lebensdauer der Röhren beeinträchtigen. Leuchtstoffröhren haben eine begrenzte Anzahl von Zündungen, und jedes Mal, wenn sie eingeschaltet werden, wird eine kleine Menge ihrer Lebensdauer verbraucht. Daher ist es effizienter und kostengünstiger, sie eingeschaltet zu lassen, solange sie benötigt werden."},{"instruction":"wie steht es mit dem stromverbrauch?","output":"Der Stromverbrauch ist ein wichtiger Faktor bei der Entscheidung, ob man Leuchtstoffröhren dauerhaft eingeschaltet lassen oder häufig ein- und ausschalten sollte. Hier ist die allgemeine Regel: Wenn Sie eine Leuchtstoffröhre für weniger als 15 Minuten ausschalten, dann ist es effizienter, sie eingeschaltet zu lassen. Wenn Sie sie jedoch länger als 15 Minuten ausschalten, ist es energieeffizienter, sie auszuschalten. Der Grund dafür liegt in dem hohen Stromverbrauch beim Einschalten einer Leuchtstoffröhre. Beim Einschalten wird eine große Menge Strom benötigt, um das Gas in der Röhre zum Leuchten zu bringen. Wenn Sie die Röhre also nur für kurze Zeit ausschalten und dann wieder einschalten, wird jede erneute Einschaltung mehr Strom verbrauchen als das kontinuierliche Leuchten für längere Zeit."},{"instruction":"Das ist falsch!

In Bezug auf den Stromverbrauch bei Leuchtstoffröhren gibt es unterschiedliche Meinungen und Empfehlungen. Tatsächlich gibt es einige Experten, die argumentieren, dass der Stromverbrauch beim Einschalten einer Leuchtstoffröhre vernachlässigbar ist und es daher effizienter ist, sie auszuschalten, sogar für kurze Zeiträume. Die Aussage von Felix Nipkow von der Schweizerischen Energie-Stiftung (SES) basiert wahrscheinlich darauf, dass moderne Leuchtstoffröhren beim Einschalten eine geringere Menge an Strom verbrauchen als ältere Modelle. Neue Leuchtstoffröhren sind mit elektronischen Vorschaltgeräten ausgestattet, die den Einschaltstrom reduzieren. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass das Einschalten einer Leuchtstoffröhre immer noch etwas mehr Strom verbraucht als das kontinuierliche Leuchten. Die Menge des zusätzlichen Stromverbrauchs hängt jedoch von verschiedenen Faktoren ab, wie dem Alter der Röhre, dem Vorschaltgerät und der Einschaltdauer. Es kann also je nach Situation effizienter sein, eine Leuchtstoffröhre auszuschalten, wenn sie für kurze Zeiträume nicht benötigt wird. Es ist ratsam, sich auf energieeffiziente Beleuchtungstechnologien wie LED-Lampen zu konzentrieren, die einen sehr geringen Stromverbrauch während des Einschaltens und Betriebs haben."},{"instruction":"Who are all of the members of The Afton Family.","output":"The Afton Family is a fictional group of characters from the popular video game series, Five Nights at Freddy's.
