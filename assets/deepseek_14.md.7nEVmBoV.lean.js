The tweet refers to Pandora, a popular music streaming app, and compares it with other apps, namely Last.fm and imeem. The sentiment expressed in this tweet can be identified as frustration mixed with surprise. The user seems to be disappointed, possibly even annoyed, that the Pandora app is not available on a platform or device they are using, especially since other music streaming apps like Last.fm or imeem are available. This is apparent through the use of words and expressions such as \\"freaking,\\" which conveys a sense of exasperation, and the sheer number of exclamation marks used (!!!!!!!!!!!!!). Aside from indicating frustration, the tweet also conveys a level of shock or surprise, conveyed by the opening word \\"a freaking pandora app,\\" where mentioning Pandora with strong words like \\"freaking\\" and a multitude of exclamation marks suggests an astonished tone. This could possibly mean that the person was not expecting the app to be missing and was genuinely surprised by its absence. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mixture of frustration and surprise, rooted in the unavailability of the Pandora app when compared to the presence of other music streaming apps. The user might feel let down by the situation and might need to resort to alternative options to access their favorite music through Pandora."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed answer to help you understand why: 1. Ambiguity of the product: The review doesn't specifically mention the product, so it's unclear which product the reviewer is talking about. This makes it difficult for you to evaluate the actual performance or value of the product, as it lacks proper context. 2. Focus on payment issues rather than product quality: The review focuses more on problems related to removing credit card information from a Microsoft account, rather than the quality or features of the product in question. As a potential buyer, you want to know about the product itself, not just the buying process. 3. Negative impression about the purchase process: While this review does present Amazon as a better option compared to Microsoft for buying the unspecified product, it doesn't create a positive buying environment. The mention of difficulties in removing credit card information from a Microsoft account may raise concerns about security and user-friendliness, which might affect your decision-making process. 4. Lack of details about the product: The review doesn't provide any valuable information about how the product performs, its features, or its benefits.

John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem.  Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Answer:","output":"Patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A. This is because patient A has hyperopia (farsightedness), which causes nearby objects to appear blurry.

I used to take long walks along the water. The food in town was delicious and the people were very friendly. The area was very quiet and peaceful, and fairly deserted.  The last evening of our vacation, however, we all heard strange footsteps following closely behind us as we were walking up to our flat in the holiday centre. We turned around and noticed a fairly young man moving very rapidly across the beach and getting closer to us. He was tall and wore a baseball cap. We couldn't see his face and he was approaching us very rapidly. The man's actions made my dad very nervous. Dad warned us that we'd better try to make it to our flat as quickly as possible. I didn't like my dad's voice; I could hear fear in it. It was late and we were all alone. We didn't have any cell phones on us. I never saw Dad as worried as he was then and I knew that something was terribly wrong. The sense of fear started to overwhelm Mom and me. We had had such a good time in town. Now, the night was rapidly turning into a dangerous situation.  We could hear the man's footsteps getting closer. Dad's face was almost pale. The so-called intruder   had moved nearer and nearer when all of a sudden, the nearby vending  machine started going crazy and spitting out cans of soda! The noise actually scared the intruder and he ran out of sight. My parents were shaking, but we all turned around to see who had put money into the vending machine downstairs, and actually saved us, but no one was around at all. Not a soul.  It's one vacation I will never forget. What helped them get rid of the trouble? A) Their quick action. B) Other people's kind help. C) The noise from the vending machine. D) The young man's warning. A:","output":"C) The noise from the vending machine. In this story, the family was having a wonderful vacation at a quiet and peaceful location near the ocean. On their last evening, they encountered a fearful situation when a young man started following them closely as they walked back to their flat. The family was scared, and they didn't have any cell phones with them to call for help. As the man approached rapidly, it was the sudden, unexpected noise from the vending machine that scared the intruder away and saved the family. The vending machine started spitting out cans of soda, creating a loud noise that caused the young man to flee. While the quick action of the family in trying to reach their flat could have contributed to their safety, it was ultimately the noise from the vending machine that got rid of the trouble they were facing. There were no other people around to help them, and the young man did not provide any warning – in fact, his actions were what made the situation dangerous in the first place. Therefore, the answer is C) The noise from the vending machine. This unexpected event turned out to be a lifesaver for the family, and it is a vacation memory that will undoubtedly remain with them for a long time."},{"instruction":"Process:  - You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.

She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother,scared to look at each other. Soon we lost the shyness and started playing with each other. In the 7th grade ,I first lost touch with her. She was going through family problems and I _ her to be with the cooler people. None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house, watch soap operas and talk about all the boys we like. It was last year when I noticed the problem. I guess I was too doveted in high school to realizeshe needed someone there. Anyway ,she made a new best friend and so did I. Then I didn't know why, but she started cutting herself! She then was diagnosed with clinical depression .At first, I was very upset, but we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there with new her best friend basically deserted her and people were calling her crazy. Yesterday she came to me and said,\\"I never knew what a best friend was until you, the only person, would stop me cutting. I appreciate your help so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me.\\" We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is never to give up on your friends. Even if they aren't as cool as others, or people think they are crazy, they need someone there. If you desert them, you will only be guilty yourself. Question: Judy was diagnosed with clinical depression. The most probable cause is  _  . Answer: A:","output":"The family problems she was going through. This choice seems most probable because the article mentions that Judy was going through family problems around the same time the narrator first lost touch with her. The stress and trauma that can come from serious family issues might potentially contribute to the onset of clinical depression, making this a plausible cause. Personal life stressors are known contributing risk factors to mental health disorders like depression. However, it's important to note that an exact cause for depression can often be difficult to identify, as it can involve a complex interplay of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. The article doesn't provide conclusive evidence of any other cause, so given the available data, the family problems seem the most likely cause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Drivers are allowed to use only a maximum of four of the six constituent parts of an engine all season. Alonso's new engine will comprise his eighth turbocharger and MGU-H, the motor that recovers energy from the turbo,  and his sixth internal combustion engine and MGU-K. This is an addition to a new energy store - his fifth - that was fitted for Friday practice.

That puts them just over 62kw (83bhp) down on a customer Mercedes engine.

By Emma Thomas PUBLISHED: 04:45 EST, 2 November 2013 | UPDATED: 10:18 EST, 2 November 2013 A man was tortured in a terrifying 'trick or treat' robbery on Halloween. Two men wearing 'Scream' masks and armed with a knife and an axe shouted 'trick or treat' outside a Bedford flat before barging inside and carrying out a violent robbery. Inside they bound a 26-year-old man with tape and then tortured by being cut on his head, his legs and face to make the woman who lived at the property, hand over money. Grange Road: The man was tortured so the woman inside the Bedford flat would hand over cash she had from selling a car They were wearing dark clothes and hoodies as well as the","output":"'Scream' masks, making it difficult for the victims to identify their attackers. The intruders then ransacked the Bedford flat, demanding valuables and any available cash from the couple living there. It is believed that the woman had just sold a car, and news of the transaction had somehow reached the perpetrators. Neighbours reported hearing screams and loud noises coming from the flat, but initially dismissed them as part of the usual Halloween celebrations in the neighbourhood. However, as the sounds persisted, a few concerned neighbours ventured closer to the property to investigate. Realizing the severity of the situation, they quickly called the police, who arrived on the scene within minutes. The masked assailants, upon hearing the approaching sirens, attempted to flee the scene but were apprehended by the police officers shortly after. The robbers were identified as two local men, both with a history of criminal activities, including theft and assault. The 26-year-old victim, who sustained multiple cuts on his head, legs, and face, was quickly given medical attention by the paramedics and rushed to a nearby hospital for further examination. The woman, though unharmed, was visibly shaken by the events and provided a statement to the police about the harrowing ordeal. In a following press release, the Bedford Police Department stressed the importance of being cautious during Halloween festivities and encouraged residents to stay vigilant about their surroundings. The police also urged the public to report suspicious activities, as this could play a vital role in preventing similar crimes. Many in the community were left in shock by the severity of the attack, with some residents questioning the safety of celebrating Halloween in their neighbourhood. Local authorities responded by increasing police presence during the holiday and promising to review the safety measures in place for future events. In the months following the attack, the two suspects were tried and found guilty of the violent 'trick or treat' robbery. They both received lengthy prison sentences, sending a strong message to others about the repercussions of committing such heinous crimes. Furthermore, the community rallied together to show support for the couple, providing both financial assistance and emotional guidance as they attempted to put the traumatic event behind them. These acts of kindness served as a positive counterpoint to the dark actions of the two attackers, proving how the community's spirit could not be so easily broken. As the years went by, Halloween in Bedford gradually returned to its previously cheerful atmosphere, with the memory of the terrifying robbery serving as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance, safety, and community support in times of distress."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What key details about darren manning  can be extracted from the following bio?

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as \\"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\" This definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value, the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies, and because of the problem created by use of the word \\"complete\\". Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.  - Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logic, analytics, and experience to determine \\"cause and effect\\". In systems engineering and computer science, it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions.  - A medical device is any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, material, or other articlewhether used alone or in combination, including the software intended by its manufacturer to be used specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes and necessary for its proper applicationintended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of:  - Surgery (from the \\"cheirourgik\\" (composed of , \\"hand\\", and , \\"work\\"), via , meaning \\"hand work\\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum).  - In medicine , a nebulizer or nebuliser ( see spelling differences ) is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs . Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis , asthma , COPD and other respiratory diseases . Analytical nebulizers are another form of nebulizer and are used primarily in laboratory settings for elemental analysis . Nebulizers use oxygen , compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up medical solutions and suspensions into small aerosol droplets that can be directly inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device . The definition of an aerosol is a \`\` mixture of gas and liquid particles , '' and the best example of a naturally occurring aerosol is mist , formed when small vaporized water particles mixed with hot ambient air are cooled down and condense into a fine cloud of visible airborne water droplets .  - A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatmentknown as specialitiesor they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communitiesknown as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their treatmentthe \\"science\\" of medicineand also a decent competence in its applied practicethe art or \\"craft\\" of medicine.  - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - Health care or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in human beings. Health care is delivered by health professionals (providers or practitioners) in allied health professions, chiropractic, physicians, physician associates, dentistry, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, pharmacy, psychology, and other health professions. It includes the work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.

Collin, along with his short-tempered best friend Miles Turner, works for a moving company located in Oakland, a city in the Bay Area. One night while waiting for a red light, Collin witnesses a white police officer gun down a black civilian. As Collin is haunted by the incident, he begins to have nightmares and experiences hallucinations.  At the same time, Miles becomes distraught by the gentrification of Oakland, and a resulting sense of loss of identity, home, and belonging.   Miles purchases a gun from a friend on the basis of self-protection, an action which Collin strongly disapproves. As Miles continues to display erratic behavior, Collin's ex-girlfriend Val warns Collin of the dangers that may come from a continued friendship with Miles. Later that evening while having dinner, Miles' gun accidentally ends up in the hands of his young son Sean, an incident which horrifies Sean's mother Ashley, forcing both Collin and Miles to leave the house. At a party, an agitated Miles assaults a black man who misinterpreted Miles' persona as cultural appropriation, leading to a fight between the two. Miles uses his gun to terrorize the party guests before being stopped by Collin.

Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Television is a relatively stable advertising medium. In many ways, the television ads today are almost the same to those two decades ago. Most television ads still feature actors, still run 30 or 60 seconds, and still show a product. However, the different medium of the Internet causes unique challenges to advertisers, forcing them to adapt their practices and techniques. In the early days of Internet marketing, online advertisers used banner   and pop-up ads   to attract customers. These techniques reached large audiences, led to many sales leads, and came at a low cost. However, a small number of Internet users began to consider these advertising techniques annoying. Yet because marketing strategies relying heavily on banners and pop-ups produced results, companies invested growing amounts of money into purchasing these ad types. As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads. A major development in online marketing came with the introduction of pay-per-click ads. Unlike banner or pop-up ads, which originally required companies to pay every time a website visitor saw an ad, pay-per-click ads allowed companies to pay only when an interested potential customer clicked on an ad. More importantly, however, these ads are not affected by the pop-up and banner blockers. As a result of these advantages and the incredible growth in the use of search engines, which provide excellent places for pay-per-click advertising, a great number of companies began turning to pay-per-click marketing. However, as with the banner and pop-up ads, pay-per-click ads came with their shortcomings. When companies began pouring billions of dollars into this emerging medium, online advertising specialists started to notice the presence of what would later be called click fraud  : representatives of a company with no interest in the product advertised by a competitor click on the competitor's ads simply to...

Alternatively, the article discusses the Internet's continual evolution and the necessity for advertisers to adapt to new techniques like banner ads, pop-up ads, and pay-per-click ads, showing a much faster pace of development. Therefore, the primary difference between the two mediums is their rate of development.

Write an article with the title: \\"In a Tiny Brooklyn Kitchen, Room for Lots of Ideas\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"In a Tiny Brooklyn Kitchen, Room for Lots of Ideas\\" If you head over to Brooklyn and find yourself within the confines of a small, idyllic city apartment, you may just discover an epicenter of culinary innovation expanding boundaries within its tiny kitchen. Size isn’t always an indication of potential. Here, space limitations encourage creativity, innovation, and versatility, much like the culinary scene itself. The first aspect that catches your eye as you step into this petite kitchen would be its optimal usage of space. Drawers meticulously organized, hanging pots and pans, a magnetic strip for knives, and collapsible, space-saving furniture pieces complete the aesthetic visuals. Such an organization is not just a necessity borne out of constraint. It is a testament to the conviction that good things often come in small packages, and that a kitchen, no matter its size, can be an oasis for the propagation of culinary art. Within this small context, every inch of space is valuable. Owners of tiny kitchens can’t afford to have unnecessary clutter or appliances with single uses. Herein lies the credo: multifunctionality. This space constraint leads to ingenious ideas for multi-functional tools that do more than one job, and can be stored with ease. These might include a single appliance that works as a blender, food processor and mixer; or pots and pans that nest into each other, saving cupboard space. Next, innovation in this tiny kitchen isn’t just about objects, but also extends to the realm of recipes themselves. It lends to experimenting with various techniques, creating smaller versions of meals that pack as much flavor as their full-sized counterparts. The focus transitions from vast, elaborate meals to meticulously crafted, simple yet gourmet dishes. Storable and stackable cookware allow for a wider variety of cooking techniques, even in a smaller kitchen. The Bake-It-All and Steam-It sets, as well as small multi-cookers, inspire many to try new dishes they may not have considered in a more traditional kitchen setup. This in turn enables the creation of a diverse repertoire of dishes - from French pastries right down to authentic Taiwanese steamed bao. Moreover, tiny kitchens inspire an aspect of community-building within neighborhoods. The limitations of small kitchens often give rise to \\"kitchen swap\\" routines, where neighbors exchange tools, appliances, and even ingredients. This not only strengthen bonds but also promotes sharing and sustainability, reducing waste and promoting the use of locally-sourced products. Ultimately, the tiny Brooklyn kitchen is a testament to pushing boundaries and maximizing potential where resources are limited. It encapsulates the idea of making the best out of what you have, cherishing every square inch, and creating wonders within small confines. To put it simply, the magic in the tiny kitchen of Brooklyn isn't just about the dishes that come out from it. It’s also about the innovative ideas, the skillful organization, the curation of multifunctional tools – and the communal spirit that thrives within its minuscule size. Size and space, it clearly illustrates, should never be a barrier to culinary creativity, and even with the most modest of kitchens, the gastronomic world remains boundless."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Stay off your leg and do as little walking as possible.  Keep the knee elevated above your heart while lying down. Prop the knee and foot on pillows or on the arm of the couch. Use crutches if it hurts to straighten the leg or to put weight on it. If you need crutches for more than a few days, you should see a medical professional because it may be something serious enough to require more than home care. Apply ice directly on the swollen part of your knee for 10-20 minutes. Do this 3 times a day to reduce the swelling. You can also use a frozen cold pack or a bag of frozen vegetables like peas instead of ice. If you have sustained an injury that results in a swollen knee, avoid placing heat on your knee. This includes hot packs, hot showers, or hot tubs. Wrap your knee in an elastic bandage to apply compression. This will help decrease the swelling. Try an elastic bandage with a fastener that sticks to the bandage so that you don't need clips.  You can purchase a compression bandage at a local pharmacy. Be careful not to wrap your knee too tightly. If you notice any numbness, tingling, odd coloring, or increased pain, your bandage is wrapped too tightly. Massage at a very gentle rate may help increase blood flow to your knee. If anything hurts, refrain from massaging the painful area. Try an anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen or ibuprofen - all are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).   When taking this type of pain reliever, be sure to carefully follow dosing instructions on the label. You can also try a topical painkiller. Talk with your pharmacist for proper application. You can also try a patch that contains the analgesic lidocaine for pain relief.

The second method is written when the number of elements in each line is the same and is known at the time of using the program . The second method is written when the number of elements in each row is the same and known at the time the program is used .","output":"Yes, these two sentences from Wikipedia convey the same meaning, despite having some differences in wording and structure. Both sentences describe the conditions necessary for using a particular method in a given context. Below, I've provided a more detailed breakdown of each sentence to illustrate their shared meaning. 1. \\"The second method is written when the number of elements in each line is the same and is known at the time of using the program.\\" This sentence asserts that the second method should be employed under two conditions: (a) the number of elements per line must be consistent, and (b) the quantity of elements must be clear and recognizable during the program's use. Here, the term \\"line\\" is used to denote what could be a row or a series of items within the context of the program. The adverbial phrase \\"at the time of using the program\\" clarifies when this knowledge should be present. 2. \\"The second method is written when the number of elements in each row is the same and known at the time the program is used.\\" This sentence is structurally similar to the first and conveys parallel information. The two aforementioned conditions still apply: (a) a consistent number of elements per row and (b) this quantity's prompt recognition during the program's use. The word \\"row\\" is employed in lieu of \\"line,\\" but it serves an analogous purpose in the context of the content. Additionally, the sentence employs the adverbial phrase \\"at the time the program is used\\" to specify when this information should be accessible. Thus, although the two sentences feature some minor variations in wording and structure, their meanings are functionally identical. Both sentences explain that a second method is appropriate when two conditions are met: uniformity in element quantity per line or row and that this element count must be known when using the program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What were pedagogues in the first sense of the term? from the following article ?  Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother. Answer:","output":"Pedagogues, in the first sense of the term, were houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) responsible for taking the children of the household to school. The term pedagogue originated from Ancient Greece and was initially used to describe a specific type of slave whose primary role was to ensure the education and overall well-being of their master's children. These houseborn slaves often constituted a privileged class compared to other slaves within the household due to the trust and responsibility placed upon them by their masters. Their importance was not only based on the upbringing of the children but also providing guidance and mentorship, making them crucial to the child's development. It is important to remember that some of the pedagogues might have been the offspring of the master of the house. However, in most cities, notably in Athens, a child would inherit the status of its mother. This meant that if the mother was a slave, the child would also be considered a slave, regardless of the father's status. In the context of the article, the discussion on houseborn slaves and pedagogues highlights the complexity and variety in the roles and status of slaves in Ancient Greek society. Although the main focus of the passage is not specifically on the pedagogues, they serve as an example of how some slaves had more privileged or specific roles compared to others, depending on their origin, skills, or the trust placed in them by their masters. Overall, pedagogues in the first sense of the term were houseborn slaves in Ancient Greece, with their primary function being to accompany and support the children of their masters in both their education and daily lives. The mention of pedagogues in this article serves to illustrate the intricacies of a slave's experience and highlight the varying degrees of responsibility and privilege within the hierarchy of the ancient slave system."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: In the beginning this series was enjoyable.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Goals from Mohamed Salah and Abdallah Saied gave the Pharaohs the victory. The result means Egypt are two points clear at the top of Group E. Ghana are already in danger with just one point so far, but with four more qualifiers to come. Egypt's first goal came from the penalty spot after Black Stars defender Harrison Afful brought down Mohamed Trezeguet two minutes before the break. Roma's in-form winger, Salah, struck his spot-kick firmly into the middle of the goal to put his side ahead. Salah had also come close after 25 minutes with an effort from close range but Ghana came back strongly after half-time, with Egypt's 43-year-old goalkeeper Essam Al Hadari making key saves from Christian Atsu just after the hour mark and Emmanuel Agyemang Badu in the 79th minute. Saied then scored on the counter attack with five minutes to go to ensure the victory as Egypt bid for a first World Cup spot since 1990. In the play-off for a place at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Ghana hammered Egypt over two legs to qualify for a third successive finals appearance. Uganda are second in the group, two points behind Egypt, following their 1-0 win over Congo Brazzaville in Kampala on Saturday. Democratic Republic of Congo regained first place in Group A on goal difference from Tunisia after a 2-1 comeback victory over Guinea in Conakry. The match was won through two goals in quick succession during the second half from England-based attackers. Neeskens Kebano from second-tier club Fulham equalised on 54 minutes and Everton's Yannick Bolasie snatched the winner two minutes later. Seydouba Soumah had raised Guinean hopes of a first group win by converting a 23rd-minute penalty. DR Congo and Tunisia have six points each and Guinea and Libya are pointless in the only group where two teams have won both their opening two matches. Only the five group winners will qualify to represent Africa at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer a question about this article: Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures are a result of increased absorption of the Solar light by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and plant trees. Using these methods, a hypothetical \\"cool communities\\" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3 °C at an estimated cost of US1 billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US530 million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings. What materials absorb sunlight and create higher temperatures than natural materials?","output":"In urban areas, materials that absorb sunlight and create higher temperatures than natural materials primarily include asphalt, concrete, and dark-colored building materials. These materials, often present in large quantities in urban settings, are known for their lower albedos and higher heat capacities compared to materials typically found in the natural environment. 1. Asphalt: Asphalt, commonly used for roads, parking lots, and other surfaces, is a dark material that absorbs a significant amount of sunlight. The absorbed solar energy increases the surface temperature of the asphalt, which is then released back into the environment, contributing to the UHI effect. 2. Concrete: Concrete is another heat-absorbing material prevalent in urban areas, often used in buildings, sidewalks, and other infrastructures. Concrete's low albedo means that it reflects less sunlight back into the atmosphere and instead absorbs more, causing the surface to heat up and contribute to the overall urban heat island effect. 3. Dark-colored building materials: Dark-colored building materials, such as dark bricks, tiles, and roofing materials, also have low albedos and high heat capacities. These materials absorb more sunlight than lighter-colored or reflective materials, increasing the temperatures of the surfaces on which they are applied and subsequently contributing to the UHI effect. To mitigate the urban heat island effect, techniques like painting buildings and roads white, using cool roofing materials, and increasing green spaces can be employed. These methods help reduce the overall absorption of solar light by urban materials, resulting in lower temperatures in the urban environment. Such efforts can lead to energy savings, lower healthcare costs, and an overall improved quality of life for city dwellers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: “You either change of life or you change of man” When I was married, my wife had a very complicated life to handle outside. She was always stressed from her studies, pressure and job, so she would go out, most oftenly with me, to places and times we shouldn’t have been. She would just decide, in the middle of the night, even as early as 2 in the morning that we should just race the city, see places… She always had those cravings to do stuff at strange times, getting to sport events with me at the other bit of the country… This crazy kind of life got us in a big lot of troubles. People trying rape her, attack us and much many more. it was happening too often and I often had to be quite violent to these people so she stays in one piece. I had to fix a lot of crap in order for her to live fully her fantasy. But I was more worried for her than me and I wanted us settle down, calm and have children we could raise peacefully. There was that one night where, we both came back very late from a sport competition, we had to travel dangerous roads very late at night sometimes by bus, foot and other times subway. At one point that night, two drug addicts tried to rape her, so I did what I had to do, but still I didn’t kill them. Then I shoved her and I really mean shove, inside a taxi, got in there too and asked it back home. When I arrived, she was denying the danger, denying anything wrong with her way to behave.

Burges died, aged 53, in his Red Bed at the Tower House, at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday 20 April 1881. While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet.

Henry VIII was an influential figure in British history. Born on June 28, 1491, he reigned as the king of England from April 21, 1509, until his death on January 28, 1547. Henry VIII is best known for initiating the English Reformation and his marital affairs. He was married six times in efforts to secure political alliances and a male heir. The Royal Mint issued the commemorative coin in 2009 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his ascension to the English throne. The coin bears a portrait of a younger Henry VIII, reminiscent of the king in his early years of rule, an image based on contemporary, or near contemporary, works. The like-to-life image was approved by the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Culture, to ensure it adhered to tradition. On the other side, the coin features the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, in a classic effigy designed by Ian Rank-Broadley. Furthermore, the edge inscription reads 'HENRICUS VIII' and the reverse has the Latin inscription 'DG REX ANGL Z FRANC', translating to 'By the grace of God, King of England and France'.

As an addition to the usual 130 movies and 650 TV shows available on board, passengers will soon be able to enjoy the calming effects of 'Slow TV.' Already popular in Scandinavia, these programs feature soothing imagery and gentle tasks, allowing viewers to disconnect from stress and find serenity. Step 1: Introducing 'Slow TV' content: Slow TV is an emerging genre of television programming that focuses on long, calming, and low-stakes content. These shows immerse viewers in mundane activities such as knitting, walking, and bird feeding. As passengers unwind during their flights, they can tune into the on-screen equivalent of watching paint dry and feel the tranquility it provides. Step 2: Trial of the train journey show: As the first step, airline staff will trial a train journey show to evaluate its effectiveness in providing relaxation. This slow TV program will feature a long, real-time train journey, allowing passengers to get lost in the serene landscapes and peaceful visuals. The feedback from the trial will be carefully considered before expanding to include other 'slow' shows in the in-flight entertainment catalog. Step 3: Expansion to other 'slow' shows: Once the train journey show proves successful, the airline will continue its pursuit of relaxation for passengers by incorporating more slow TV content, keeping in mind the popular Scandinavian offerings. The wide variety of content will cater to different interests, maintaining the relaxing and unwinding aspect of slow TV while offering pleasant, calming distractions for all passengers. Step 4: Reinforcing the relaxation factor: Airline staff will continue to monitor the effects of this new entertainment addition and gather feedback from passengers. Slow TV aims to create a tranquil environment for passengers amidst the often-stressful experience of flying. The airline will strive to deliver the best possible methods of relaxation and may introduce other innovative solutions to enhance passengers' well-being during flights. Conclusion: As the trend of Slow TV gains traction across the globe, the inclusion of this unique form of programming in in-flight entertainment is a testament to airlines' commitment to promoting relaxation and well-being during air travel. With a diverse range of low-intensity content, passengers will find it easier than ever to unwind and enjoy a peaceful flight experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On a day when the weather finally bared its teeth at Royal Liverpool, so did the Northern Irishman. At one stage of this historic championship round -- with two tees in operation for the first time ever -- another dynamic 25-year-old threatened the fairytale Merseyside had been dreaming of. Rickie Fowler tied McIlroy for the lead as the two-time major champion toiled amid the thick and unforgiving rough of Hoylake's 12th hole. But that seemed the catalyst for the home favorite to turn on the afterburners, as two eagles on his final three holes wrested the famed Claret Jug ever closer to his clubhouse locker. \\"I was conscious that","output":"Rickie was making a move, but I knew that I still had the back nine and some opportunities left,\\" McIlroy reflected, his determination evident as he braved the challenging conditions.

As Fowler continued to apply pressure, the world watched with bated breath to see if McIlroy would falter or surge ahead. With both players displaying flashes of brilliance, it became clear that this would be a duel for the ages, ingrained in the memories of golf enthusiasts for years to come.

Sentence 2: Once the speaker thought about it, they were no longer enjoying themselves. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"First, let's analyze the two sentences given: Sentence 1: \\"It worries me that before I thought too hard about it, I was having a pretty good time.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing concern regarding the fact that they were having a pretty good time before they started thinking too hard about it. This implies that the act of thinking hard about the situation may have led to either a change in their overall enjoyment or, at the very least, self-reflection on their previous enjoyment. Sentence 2: \\"Once the speaker thought about it, they were no longer enjoying themselves.\\" In this sentence, it is explicitly stated that upon thinking about the situation, the speaker ceased enjoying themselves. Now let's examine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Entailment, in the context of language and logic, refers to a relationship between statements (or sentences) where if one statement is true, the other must also be true. In other words, the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of the other. In this case, the first sentence implies that the speaker was concerned about their initial enjoyment and it may suggest a change in their emotional state after thinking too hard about the situation; however, it doesn't guarantee that they stopped enjoying themselves completely. The speaker could still be experiencing some level of enjoyment while being worried or concerned about the reasons for that enjoyment. Therefore, the first sentence does not necessarily entail the second sentence. The second sentence is consistent with the idea presented in the first sentence, but it takes the notion a step further by claiming that the speaker was no longer enjoying themselves at all after contemplating the situation. This statement cannot be directly concluded from the information provided in the first sentence. The first sentence leaves open the possibility that the speaker may still be enjoying the situation to a lesser degree or may have mixed feelings about their enjoyment. In summary, while the two sentences are related and share similar ideas, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence suggests a potential change in the speaker's emotional state and a level of concern, but it does not guarantee that their enjoyment ended completely, as suggested by the second sentence. Instead of entailment, the relationship between the two sentences might be better described as coherence or compatibility, since the ideas presented in the second sentence could conceivably follow from those in the first."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Visiting the grave of Ana Mladic      The grave of Ratko Mladic’s daughter Ana lies in a well-trafficked section of the Topcider cemetery on the outskirts of Belgrade. A well-known Serbian gangster, killed in the internecine political squabbles of the post-Communist era, is buried just across the way. Around the corner is the last resting place of Ivan Stambolic, a former president of Serbia murdered by thugs allied to his protégé and later rival Slobodan Milosevic.      Like the politician and the gangster, Ana met a violent death, testimony to a dark decade in Serbian politics. On March 23, 1994, at the height of the Bosnia war, she killed herself with a ceremonial pistol that had been presented to her father when he graduated from his military academy. Her suicide was a major event in Mladic’s life that is key to understanding his dark and complicated personality.      By all accounts, the Bosnian Serb commander never quite recovered from Ana’s death. According to his lawyer and family friend, Milos Saljic, Mladic \\"worshipped his daughter, and she worshipped him.\\" He made several secret visits to Ana’s grave during the years that he was on the run, after being indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal for genocide and mass murder. After his arrest last May, the Serbian authorities permitted Mladic to make one final visit to the grave site before his extradition to The Hague.      The precise circumstances of Ana’s death have always been mysterious. The general himself has always insisted that she was murdered by his political enemies, but that version makes little sense, and is discounted by all but a handful of Mladic loyalists. What is known for sure is that she had just returned from a visit to Moscow with her graduating class from the Belgrade University medical school. According to Saljic, while Ana was in Moscow, she talked with Bosnian Muslim students for the first time, and was shocked to learn that they considered her father a war criminal.      \\"When she came back from Russia, she was a different person,\\" Saljic told me.      This version — or something close to it — seems plausible to me. I am very skeptical of a claim by the German news magazine Der Spiegel last September that Ana killed herself following an argument with a former boyfriend, identified only as \\"Goran M.\\" According to Der Spiegel‘s account, Goran was a human rights activist in Belgrade who worked as a doctor in a local hospital. Other Belgrade human rights activists (a tight-knit circle) say they never heard of such a person, and doubt that he exists. Saljic confirms that Ana had a boyfriend, but says he was close to the Mladic family, had nothing to do with her death, and was neither a doctor nor a human rights activist.      The conspiracy theory preferred by Mladic — that his daughter was murdered — is undermined by the pathologist who carried out the official autopsy. Now Serbia’s minister of health, Zoran Stankovic told me that he was eager to do a full investigation into the circumstances of Ana’s death, but Mladic refused permission. Had Mladic suspected foul play at the time, it seems most unlikely that he would have declined Stankovic’s request to carry out an investigation.      Whatever Ana’s real motivation for killing herself, her death had a shattering effect on Mladic. Video taken at the time shows him struggling to control his emotions in public, only to weep inconsolably over his daughter’s coffin (at 1:35 in the YouTube video below).      According to Saljic, Mladic suffered a serious stroke several weeks after his daughter’s death, and was unable to work for at least two months. His aides managed to conceal the general’s illness, and his disappearance from public view. It was reported at the time that Mladic had fallen out with the Bosnian Serb political leadership. When he reappeared in August 1994, journalists noted that he looked pale and tired.      As Mladic’s defense lawyer, Saljic has an obvious interest in painting a picture of his client’s reduced mental capacity at the time of the Srebrenica massacre a year later, in July 1995. His claims will have to be tested in court. The larger mystery is why a man who had known such tragedy in his own life was so cavalier in condemning thousands of others — fathers, husbands, sons, wives — to their deaths. ||||| He ordered many thousands of deaths and spent 14 years as a fugitive, then portrayed himself in court as a victim of conspiracies      Ratko Mladić had vowed never to succumb to the humiliation he suffered on Wednesday morning, of being judged by a foreign court. He told his officers he would not be taken alive and carried a duffel bag of guns through all his years on the run to ensure he would be as good as his word.            When the critical moment came however, the man who ordered many thousands of deaths could not bring himself to take his own. On 26 May 2011, when plainclothes officers from the Serbian interior ministry turned up at his final hiding place – a room in his cousin’s house in a remote northern village – the old general, enfeebled by two strokes and a heart attack, left his Heckler & Koch machine gun where he had stashed it, among his socks at the bottom of a cupboard.      “I suppose people will ask why I didn’t kill myself,” he grumbled to one of his supporters weeks later in jail. “But I was not psychologically able to, and I didn’t want them to say we are family of suicides.”      Play Video 1:55 Ratko Mladić, the 'butcher of Bosnia' – video profile      Some 17 years earlier, in February 1994, when the Bosnian conflict was mired in a bloody stalemate, Mladić’s daughter, Ana, used his favourite pistol to shoot herself. She was in love with a doctor, who was appalled at the slaughter in Bosnia being committed in the name of the Serb nation. He would only marry her if she renounced her father. She resolved the dilemma by removing herself.      Mladić never accepted that his own actions had anything to do with Ana’s death. Instead, he invented conspiracy theories which projected the blame outwards, on the historical enemies of the Serbs. His thirst for revenge redoubled. In a lifetime surrounded by death, Ana’s was one of the very few that mattered to him.      14 years a fugitive: the hunt for Ratko Mladic, the Butcher of Bosnia | Julian Borger Read more      Mladić was born into conflict. His name can be translated as “warlike youth”. His father, a partisan, was killed in battle in 1945, when he was two. His mother, Stana, raised three children on her own.      As a teenager, Ratko had a go at being a tinsmith’s apprentice before giving it up and dedicating his life to the Yugoslav national army. At the end of it all, after fighting in Croatia to keep a Serb-run Yugoslavia together and losing, and then fighting for a Serb-dominated Bosnia, and losing again after the death of 100,000 people, Mladić spent 14 years as a fugitive before finally losing that battle too.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters hold posters, including one of Radovan Karadžić, the Bosnian Serb former politician and convicted war criminal, as they wait for the verdict against Ratko Mladić. Photograph: Michel Porro/Getty Images      “You have found who you’re looking for,” he told the officers from the war crimes unit who had come to find him. Mladić sat in a rumpled black peaked cap in the back of the car on the drive south back to Belgrade. Once there, he had two requests for the judge. He wanted to go to his mother’s grave in Bosnia, and to Ana’s grave in Belgrade. The judge granted the second request. While government officials stood waiting to fly him to The Hague, he stood before her gravestone mumbling words to his daughter.      In his six years in detention in the seafront Hague suburb of Scheveningen, and through his more than 500 days in court at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Mladić has portrayed himself as a victim of foreign conspiracies to do down the Serb people. It is this cult of victimhood that powered his brand of aggressive nationalism. It proved a rocket fuel for sadism.      He repeatedly portrayed his “ethnic cleansing” campaign in Bosnia, targeted overwhelmingly against Muslim Bosniaks, as revenge for the Ottoman empire. In July 1995, when he strode with his military aides into Srebrenica, which had supposedly been a “safe haven” under UN protection which failed to materialise, he declared his “victory” as vengeance for an ancient massacre of Serbs at the hands of “the Turks”. He was filmed patting eight-year-old Izudin Alić on the head, handing the hungry Bosniak boy a chocolate bar and assuring the people of Srebrenica they would be safe. Within a few days, the boy’s father would be tracked down and killed by Mladić’s troops, along with more than 7,000 Bosniak men and teenage boys.      Srebrenica genocide: worst massacre in Europe since the Nazis Read more      For more than seven years, long after the bones of the dead had been dug out of mass graves, and the crimes of Mladić’s army had been laid out for the world to witness, Serbia’s army looked after him in the name of ethnic solidarity in the face of a hostile world.      The fragile fiction in Bosnia, as in eastern Ukraine today, was that Bosnian Serb forces were freedom fighters thirsting for their independence. In fact, they operated with the guidance and support of a stronger neighbour, Slobodan Milošević’s regime in Belgrade.      Mladić and other Bosnian Serb officers were paid by the 30th Personnel Centre of the Yugoslav army, run from Belgrade. And when Nato peacekeepers and western intelligence agencies operating in Bosnia began to get serious about tracking down war crimes suspects in 1997, Mladić was sheltered and catered for in army recreation compounds across Serbia.      “The Serbian government and army were clearly protecting Mladić,” said John Sipher, a former CIA officer who took part in the hunt for war crimes suspects when he was stationed in the Balkans.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ratko Mladić in the court of the UN tribunal in 2014. Photograph: ICTY / HANDOUT/EPA      “I remember Montenegrins telling us about trips he made down there to see old friends in the military. He was clearly being protected and felt comfortable living in Serbia.”      The CIA was aware Mladić spent some of his time as one of Europe’s most wanted men in his own house in a wealthy Belgrade suburb where some US embassy employees lived. There was nothing the agency could do.      After Milošević fell in 2000, the country’s new prime minister, Zoran Đinđić, offered the US and the UK the option of going to grab Mladić with their own troops. But Đinđić did not control the army, and the allies declined the offer rather than risk a gunfight on the strength of an uncertain tip-off from a precariously positioned politician. Đinđić himself was assassinated in 2003.      Timeline Ratko Mladić: the long road to justice Show Hide The breakup of the former Yugoslavia The breakup of the former Yugoslavia formally begins when Slovenia and Croatia declare independence. The Serb-led Yugoslav army withdraws from Slovenia after a 10-day conflict, but the war in Croatia that followed would last until 1995. War breaks out in Bosnia Bosnian Serbs swiftly take control of more than two-thirds of Bosnia and launch the siege of Sarajevo, headed by Ratko Mladić, who becomes the Bosnian Serb army commander a month later. The siege lasts 1,460 days, during which more than 11,500 people die. Srebrenica massacre Mladić's troops capture Srebrenica, where more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed. Nato bombs Bosnian Serb positions following reports of the slaughter. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicts Mladić and Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan Karadžić on charges including genocide. Dayton agreement signed The Dayton agreement is signed, ending the war and creating two mini-states in Bosnia: a Bosnian-Serb one and a Muslim-Croat one. Mladić goes into hiding Nato peacekeepers and western intelligence agencies operating in Bosnia step up attempts to track down war crimes suspects, but Mladić is sheltered by loyalists in Serbia. He is seen attending football games and eating at Belgrade restaurants. Mladić arrested Following intense pressure from the international community on Serbia, Mladić is arrested in Serbia. He appears in court at the UN tribunal for the first time in June but refuses to enter pleas to the charges against him. At a second hearing in July, judges enter not guilty pleas on his behalf. Trial hears closing statements The trial in The Hague is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. Over 530 days, the UN tribunal hears from 591 witnesses and examines nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. During closing statements, prosecutors urge judges to convict Mladić on all counts and sentence him to life in prison. Defence attorneys call for acquittal.      Mladić convicted More than 20 years after the Srebrenica massacre, the now 74-year-old Mladić is sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Delivering the verdicts, the judge said Mladić’s crimes “rank among the most heinous known to humankind and include genocide and extermination”.      Eventually, even the army had to bow to control from elected civilian governments, and Mladić was forced to rely on an ever dwindling circle of loyalists. He took refuge in anonymous apartments and rural family plots. Even then however, he stayed beyond his enemies’ reach.      “If you got a report that Mladić was at some place near the border where it might even be possible to go in, we had no sources that we had tested over a long time, so it would have been a complete gamble,” Sipher recalled.

Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images      In the end, Mladić was handed over by his fellow Serbs, weary of sanctions and isolation. But even with the culmination of his five-year trial and his conviction, the triumph of international justice over impunity is far from complete.      Nationalism is very much back in the saddle in Serbia and the Bosnian Serb republic, along with blanket denial of war crimes. The Serbian government announced last month that a convicted war criminal, Vladimir Lazarević, released from jail in 2005 after serving two-thirds of his sentence, would be lecturing at the country’s military academy.      One of the investigators in The Hague tribunal’s tracking team, which played a coordinating role in the hunt for Balkan war criminals, said he took a nostalgic motorcycle tour through Bosnia this summer and decided to make a detour to Mladić’s birthplace in the Serb-run municipality of Kalinovik. As he got off his bike, he was greeted by a two-word message spray-painted on a wall: “Mladić – Hero.”      Julian Borger is the Guardian’s world affairs editor.

He visited her grave multiple times during his years as a fugitive. Amid unproven conspiracy theories about Ana's death, it's suggested that she may have been deeply disturbed by the realization that many considered her father a war criminal.

Question: Information:  - Music notation or musical notation is any system used to visually represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols, including ancient symbols or modern musical symbols and including ancient symbols cut into stone, made in clay tablets or made using a pen on papyrus, parchment or manuscript paper; printed using a printing press (ca. 1400s), a computer printer (ca. 1980s) or other printing or modern copying technology. Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional classical music performers, sheet music using staves and note heads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional country music session musicians, the Nashville Number System is the main method.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - A string quartet is a musical ensemble of four string players  two violin players, a viola player and a cellist  or a piece written to be performed by such a group. The string quartet is one of the most prominent chamber ensembles in classical music, with most major composers, from the mid to late 18th century onwards, writing string quartets.  - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability.  - Giulietta e Romeo is a dramma per musica by composer Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli with an Italian libretto by Giuseppe Maria Foppa after the 1530 novella of the same name by Luigi da Porto . The opera premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 30 January 1796 . Giulietta e Romeo was composed by Zingarelli in only eight days and it is considered by many scholars to be his best work . The opera remained a part of the Italian repertory well into the nineteenth century and the role of Romeo was a favourite vehicle for Maria Malibran until c 1830 .  - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs  printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages  the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments.  - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.  - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.

Combine facts and answer this: Kentucky Truck Assembly is one of two plants operated by Ford in Louisville, the other being the plant that opened on 180 acres in what year? A:","output":"Kentucky Truck Assembly (KTP) is indeed one of the two Ford automotive plants located in Louisville, Kentucky. The other plant is the Louisville Assembly Plant (LAP). To answer your question, we need to look at the history of both plants. The Kentucky Truck Assembly (KTP) was officially opened in 1969 by Ford Motor Company. This plant primarily produces trucks and SUVs, and has had many production models throughout the years. Some of the notable models include the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, and Ford F-Series Super Duty trucks. Now, let's turn our focus to the Louisville Assembly Plant (LAP). LAP was initially opened in 1955 as a part of Ford's expansion within the post-World War II era. The plant utilized an existing facility that was built in 1947. However, the plant has gone through multiple renovations, expansions, and modernizations throughout its history.  One major change was in 2012 when Ford invested 600 million into the Louisville Assembly Plant for a massive modernization and retooling project. The plant also expanded from its original 180-acre property during this time. Since then, the plant has been focusing on the production of various models like the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.  To sum up, the original Louisville Assembly Plant was opened in 1955, and one of its significant expansions took place in 2012, which involved the 180-acre property. Nonetheless, the exact year when the plant first began operations on the 180 acres in question remains ambiguous without further historical research into the expansions and renovations of the Louisville Assembly Plant throughout its history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Whether narcissists mean it when they say \\"I love you\\" and whether they believe it when they say they love someone can be viewed as two separate queries, but they also can overlap in various ways. However, these questions aren't precisely paraphrased versions of each other, as they delve into two different aspects of a narcissist's emotional state: the expression of love and the belief in love.  Before we examine each question in more depth, let's first understand what narcissism entails. Narcissism is a personality disorder characterised by an inflated sense of self-importance, a constant need for attention and admiration, the lack of empathy towards others, and often a pattern of manipulative behavior to fulfill own needs. The first question, \\"Do narcissists mean it when they say they love you?\\" addresses the sincerity of a narcissist's words, more precisely, whether they mean it when they express love verbally. In many instances, a narcissist might use the expression of love as a tool to maintain control or gain what they want from the relationship. This behavior can be particularly true to manipulative, or malignant narcissists. These individuals can express love and affection when it serves their purposes, not because they feel genuine love as most people understand it. Narcissist's love often mirrors a type of love that psychoanalysts call \\"narcissistic love\\". In this scenario, a narcissist \\"loves\\" what the other person can offer to enhance their image, cater to their needs, or fill a void within them, rather than loving the person for who they are. In such cases, the term \\"love\\" becomes a tool for them, used to maintain emotional control over someone or a situation. The second question, \\"Do narcissists believe it when they say they love someone?\\" delves into a narcissist's self-perception about their emotions. This query explores whether a narcissist genuinely believes in their own feelings of love. The answer, again, is a bit complex. The narcissist's lack of empathetic understanding can create a scenario where they believe they love someone, but their love may not resemble a healthier, more commonly-accepted version of love. They may genuinely think they're in love, particularly if the relationship serves their self-focused needs and if they have an idealized image of their partner which feeds their ego. However, their love is often conditional, fragile, and largely centered on their needs. For instance, they would require constant admiration and reassurance, and if the partner fails to fulfill these expectations, the \\"love\\" might quickly turn into disdain or indifference. To sum it up, these two questions aren't strict paraphrases of each other. While they both interrogate a narcissist’s understanding and expression of love, one addresses the sincerity behind a narcissist's declaration of love, while the other explores the degree a narcissist believes in their own expressions of love. Both questions, nonetheless, shed light on the complex and often self-serving ways narcissists can potentially experience and communicate love."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.

Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

Options: - train station - house - cupboard - cricket stadium - surface of earth  Explain why a human would choose \\"house\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"house\\" to answer the question above because a house is a more confined and controlled space compared to the other options provided. In a house, only a limited number of occupants would be present, typically the residents and occasional visitors. Therefore, the air inside the house is more likely to have been breathed by a small number of people recently. Let's analyze the other options: 1. Train station: This is a public place with many people constantly coming and going. The air in a train station is generally circulated and mixed with outdoor air, making it very unlikely to find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently. 2. Cupboard: Although a cupboard is an enclosed space, it is not a place where people frequently breathe. It is usually filled with stored items, and people only open it briefly to access the contents. Therefore, while it may technically meet the criteria of few people breathing the air, it is not the focus of the question being asked. 3. Cricket stadium: A cricket stadium is another public venue designed to accommodate large crowds. With a high number of people attending matches and events, the air is constantly being breathed and mixed with outdoor air, making it improbable to find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently. 4. Surface of Earth: The surface of Earth is a vast and open area where air is constantly in motion, being mixed and dispersed with air in various regions. This makes it nearly impossible to find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently. Given these explanations, it is clear that a house is the most suitable answer to the question as it offers a more confined and controlled space where air has likely been breathed by only a few people recently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce... Question: It's an excellent idea to recycle old mobile phones because    _   .

Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"it reduces waste and can help others.\\" Recycling old mobile phones is an excellent idea because it not only helps in reducing waste and its negative impact on the environment, but also provides a useful resource for children in developing countries, contributing to their education and overall development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The user claims not to have received any assistance with their questions about recipes that did not produce the desired results. Given this negative experience, it is likely that the user would not recommend this product. The user's dissatisfaction stems from several factors. Firstly, the user encountered issues with some of the recipes, implying that they might have found the instructions or methods to be unclear or ineffective. This could lead them to question the overall quality and reliability of the cookbook. Secondly, they did not receive a response from the authors and the editor even after reaching out to them more than four months prior. This lack of engagement might make the user feel neglected and frustrated, further undermining their confidence in the cookbook and the people behind its creation. Lastly, the user's bitterness is evident in their comment, \\"Evidently, they don't really care enough as long as the book is bought and paid for.\\" This indicates their perception of the authors and editor as being uninterested in providing adequate support to their readers, which is a negative aspect that could discourage others from purchasing the cookbook.

He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

Article: The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason. That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way. Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences. Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments. Industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code. In particular, Calvin rejected luxury. Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology. As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other. The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors. The Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution. This idea is also known as the \\"Protestant ethic thesis.\\" Question: What work ethic was an influence on capitalism and the Industrial Revolution?","output":"The work ethic that had a significant influence on capitalism and the Industrial Revolution is the Protestant work ethic, also known as the \\"Protestant ethic thesis.\\" This work ethic is deeply rooted in the Protestant concept of God and man, which encourages believers to utilize their God-given faculties, such as reason, to explore and make use of God's creation responsibly and sustainably. The Protestant work ethic is characterized by values such as industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility. These values are derived from the believers' gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, prompting them to follow God's commandments. Notably, the Protestant reformer John Calvin rejected luxury, which led to a reinvestment of profits in more efficient machinery and modern production methods based on scientific and technological advancements. As a result, productivity increased, leading to higher profits and subsequently higher wages for workers. The economy, sciences, and technology saw continuous growth as they reinforced one another. The opportunity to participate in the economic success of these technological innovations served as a powerful incentive for both inventors and investors. In conclusion, the Protestant work ethic played a crucial role in shaping the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution. By promoting values that emphasized hard work, frugality, and responsibility, Protestant teachings inadvertently fostered an environment that stimulated economic growth, technological advancements, and ultimately, the transition to an industrialized society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: State media say two soldiers and six attackers died in clashes after an ambush on troops, which led to air support being called in. There are reports of villages burning in the northern region of Rakhine. Photos released by Human Rights Watch seem to show charred villages, with the group reporting 430 burnt buildings. The satellite photos were taken between 22 October and 10 November, following reports of fighting and civilians fleeing last month. Rohingya activists say the government is trying systematically to drive the Muslim minority from their villages. Attacking the Rohingya is a popular move for the military, the BBC's Jonah Fisher reports from Myanmar's largest city, Yangon. They are disliked by many, if not most, Burmese who consider them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, our correspondent says. Glimmer of hope for Myanmar's Rohingya? Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds The 'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election The latest outbreak in fighting was triggered by an attack on three police checkpoints just over a month ago. The Burmese government is not allowing independent journalists into Rakhine, so it is impossible to verify claims about the scale of the fighting. According to the latest official statement on Saturday, troops were ambushed and then clashed several times with armed men, presumably Rohingya Muslims, equipped with guns, knives and spears. At one point, when faced by about 500 men, the soldiers called in air support and two helicopter gunships fired on the Rohingya village. Casualty figures vary widely, our correspondent says. Brad Adams, the Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said the new photos showed \\"widespread destruction\\" that was \\"greater than we first thought\\". \\"Burmese authorities should promptly establish a UN-assisted investigation as a first step toward ensuring justice and security for the victims,\\" he said.

Answer the following question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

Parmi ces actions, on peut notamment citer la construction d'écoles et d'infrastructures adéquates dans les zones reculées, permettant à un plus grand nombre d'enfants d'accéder à l'éducation sans avoir à parcourir de longues distances. De plus, la mise en place de programmes de formation pour les enseignants, adaptés au contexte rural, permettra d'offrir une pédagogie spécifique aux besoins de ces communautés et contribuera à l'amélioration des compétences des éducateurs locaux. Le renforcement du système éducatif dans les régions rurales passe également par un meilleur suivi et une meilleure évaluation des performances scolaires, afin d'identifier les lacunes et les problèmes qui méritent d'être résolus. Les dons reçus par l'UNICEF contribueront à financer des projets pilotes et des chercheurs travaillant dans ce domaine, avec pour objectif de mettre en œuvre des solutions efficaces et pérennes. Par ailleurs, la décentralisation de l'éducation implique une plus grande autonomie et responsabilité des autorités locales en matière de gestion et de prise de décision. Les fonds alloués permettront ainsi de renforcer les capacités des acteurs locaux, en leur offrant des formations et des outils pour élaborer et mettre en œuvre des plans éducatifs adaptés à leurs contextes respectifs. Enfin, l'amélioration de la communication et de la collaboration entre les différentes parties prenantes du système éducatif est un autre objectif majeur de ces projets de décentralisation et de renforcement. Les dons serviront à mettre en place des plates-formes et des mécanismes permettant de partager les bonnes pratiques, les succès et les défis rencontrés, afin d'encourager une démarche d'amélioration continue et de mutualisation des ressources. En somme, grâce aux dons reçus par l'UNICEF, de nombreuses initiatives pourront être lancées pour favoriser la décentralisation et le renforcement de l'éducation en milieu rural. Cette approche holistique et intégrée permettra d'offrir aux enfants et aux enseignants des conditions d'apprentissage optimisées, tout en impliquant les acteurs locaux dans la gestion et l'évolution de leur système éducatif."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The day goes smoothly until Jack is visited by a collection agency, claiming that he owes 95,000 in debts to their online gambling site. He trusts a colleague to take care of it (as he is convinced of some form of identity theft, which is later found out to be true and used to later set up Jack with a motive for robbing the bank) and goes out for a drink with colleague Harry Romano and potential employer, Bill Cox. Harry leaves in a taxi and Jack gets in his car. Unexpectedly, Cox follows him into the back seat. Cox then goes on to tell Jack that his family is being held hostage at their home to ensure Jack's cooperation. He then points a gun to Jack's head and forces him to drive home. Upon their arrival, Jack sees that, although his family is unharmed, they are under heavy watch by Cox's henchmen. Jack is not told what to do until the next morning, when he is told that he must give Cox 10,000 each from the bank's 10,000 largest depositors (100 million total). He is outfitted with audio and video devices in the form of a pen and a body microphone, making any intentions to resist useless. Once at work, Cox makes a surprise visit, reintroducing himself as Bill Redmond to Jack's secretary, Janet Stone. Next, Jack gives him a tour of the facilities and security system. On the way back home, Jack attempts to bribe Willy, a henchman, into betraying Cox, yet this only results in Cox killing Willy. The Stanfields attempt an escape, but the plan fails just barely. In retaliation, Cox tricks the Stanfields' son Andy with a cookie containing nut products. Because he's allergic to nuts, Andy goes into anaphylactic shock.

Article: People who have a fear of ugly insects will want to stay far away from Lake Tawakoni State Park in north Texas, US. A giant spider web was recently found there. The thick web is swarming   with millions of little spiders. Stretching across several acres it blankets a number of trees, bushes and even the ground. While the web may make some people nervous, it has become a big attraction for others-especially for unlucky insects. \\"At first, it was so white that it looked like fairyland,\\" said Donna Garde, the park's manager. \\"Now it's filled with so many mosquitoes that it's turned a little brown.\\" Most spiders work alone, which is why the discovery of the huge web has caused such a stir. Scientists across the country have been debating its origin. Some spider experts' say the monstrous web may have been weaved by social spiders. Social spiders work together to build larger webs to catch small insects. However, those webs take years to build. Park officials say this web was formed in just a few months.  Others say it could be the work of millions of tiny ballooning spiders. These types of spiders 'fly' by throwing out thin threads of silk, which they use to ride air currents  . In 2002, a similar giant web made by ballooning spiders was discovered in a field in Canada. Texas entomologist   Herbert Pase says the giant web is very unusual. \\"From what I'm hearing, it could be a once-in-a-life-time event,\\" he said. But John Jackman, an entomologist and professor at Texas A&M University, disagrees. Jackman says he hears reports of similar webs, like the one in Canada, every few years. \\"There are a lot of folks that don't realize spiders do that,\\" he said. \\"Until we get some samples sent to us, we won't know what species of spider we're talking about.\\" Park officials expect the web to last until fall when the weather gets cooler. That's when the spiders begin dying off in the park. Question: Which of the following sentences about the web in north Texas is TRUE according to the passage? - It is not certain yet what spiders made the web. - What makes the web special is its color1. - It took years for the web to come into being. - The web is used by spiders to protect themselves.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Answer this question please: Which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move? A:","output":"A: Based on the provided information, Tree city experienced fewer earthquakes compared to Red city. It can be inferred that Tree city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. This is because convection is responsible for plate movement, and a lesser frequency of earthquakes in Tree city implies that there was less movement of the plates, which could be due to lesser convection. However, it is important to note that other factors such as local geological variations and the specific plate boundary type might also influence the frequency and intensity of earthquakes experienced in the cities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The ability to customize the appearance of the taskbar is also a nice touch, with various options available such as adjusting icon size and opacity. One of the standout features of this app is the freeform window support. This has made it incredibly convenient to have multiple apps open on my screen at the same time, enhancing my multitasking capabilities. Additionally, I commend the developer for offering a quick settings tile to easily toggle the taskbar on and off. However, there is room for improvement. While the app itself is efficient, I sometimes experience minor lag issues when switching between apps. This can be frustrating, especially when I need to move between apps quickly. Furthermore, I would appreciate the addition of more advanced options to further customize my taskbar experience, such as icon set support for customizing individual icons. In summary, com.farmerbb.taskbar is a valuable addition to any device, streamlining the multitasking experience and offering customization options to make the user experience more personalized.

The premise of this movie: African-American = Strong... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. The Jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life... but the big, strong, defiant Omar Epps stands strong with no fear. We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. The raped white girl, of course, begins considering lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl after all. When the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men. Wait... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE??? Yeah, right. Of course the black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps moves in with them easily. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out. This movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud. The overly long slow-motion between Epps and Banks gets hilarious with the faces they make -- it's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other (and they're all under 5).

Information:  - Azure Ray is an American dream pop duo, consisting of musicians Maria Taylor and Orenda Fink. The pair met at the age of 15 at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. They fronted a band called Little Red Rocket, often compared to Veruca Salt, in their hometown of Birmingham, Alabama in the mid and late 1990s and released two albums with the band on Tim/Kerr records.  - Art in Manila (formerly Art Bell) is an indie rock band consisting of Adrianne Verhoeven (The Anniversary), Dan McCarthy (McCarthy Trenching), Steve Bartolomei (Mal Madrigal), Ryan Fox (The Good Life), Corey Broman (Dance Me Pregnant), and Stefanie Drootin (The Good Life) led by a former member of Azure Ray, Orenda Fink. They are currently signed to Saddle Creek Records.  - The Anniversary is an American band formed in Lawrence, Kansas in 1997 by Josh Berwanger, James David, Christian Jankowski, Adrianne Verhoeven and Justin Roelofs. The Anniversary was the solidification of a line-up that had been in flux for a year. After two years of playing shows across with the Midwest with bands that included The Get Up Kids, Braid and Superchunk, The Anniversary signed to Vagrant Records.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement.   - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Set the Woods on Fire is the first full - length studio album from indie rock band Art in Manila .  - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.  - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.  - Orenda Fink (born September 18, 1975) is an American musician on Saddle Creek Records.

It is a phenomenon characterized primarily by members of most arachnid orders, as well as several insect orders. The adaptive foraging hypothesis, aggressive spillover hypothesis and mistaken identity hypothesis are among the proposed theories to explain how sexual cannibalism evolved. This behavior is believed to have evolved as a manifestation of sexual conflict, occurring when the reproductive interests of males and females differ. In many species that exhibit sexual cannibalism, the female consumes the male upon detection. Females of cannibalistic species are generally hostile and unwilling to mate; thus many males of these species have developed adaptive behaviors to counteract female aggression.  - The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West, the Far West, or simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Stand with a dumbbell in one arm stretched above your head while your other hand supports your elbow. Make this lower case","output":"To perform the given exercise with correct form, it's important that you understand each step clearly. Begin by selecting a dumbbell of a weight that is comfortable for you to lift. This choice will depend upon your personal strength level and fitness goals. If you're unsure of the ideal weight for you, start with a lighter dumbbell and gradually increase the weight as your strength improves. Now, position your body correctly to start the exercise. Stand up straight, keeping your feet shoulder-width apart for stability. Your focus during the exercise should be on maintaining an upright posture, without leaning forward or backward. Engaging your core muscles throughout will help you maintain this balanced stance. Once you're standing correctly, take the dumbbell in one hand. This will be your active hand for the exercise. Extend this arm fully above your head. The dumbbell should be skyward, while your arm is straight. This is your starting position. The other hand, which is your non-active hand for this exercise, will serve to support your active arm. Bend this arm at the elbow and use your hand to gently grasp your other elbow. Be careful not to grip too tightly or it may affect your balance or restrict the movements of your active arm. Now, you can start the exercise. Slowly bend your active arm at the elbow, lowering the dumbbell behind your head. Aim to get your forearm parallel to the floor, keeping the elbow of your active arm fixed throughout. Your supporting hand helps to stabilize this movement and keep your active arm in the correct position. It's important to stay control of the dumbbell throughout this movement, don't let it crash down towards your neck or shoulders.  Then, lift the dumbbell back to the starting position, straightening your active arm fully. Ensure to lift through the elbow, rather than using your shoulder muscles. The motion should be slow and controlled.  Repeat this series of movements for the desired number of repetitions. Once you've finished on one side, switch the dumbbell to your other hand and repeat the exercise, ensuring you perform the same number of repetitions on each side to maintain balance in your workout. This particular exercise, often referred to as a 'dumbbell tricep extension', is an effective way to target the triceps - the muscles at the back of your upper arms. Regularly including this exercise in your routine can help to strengthen and tone these muscles, as well as improve your upper body strength and endurance in general. As with any exercise, remember to warm up before you start and cool down afterwards to protect your muscles and joints from injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"In 2012, Lamar Odom was playing for the Los Angeles Clippers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Lamar Odom is a former professional basketball player who has had a successful career in the NBA. Born on November 6, 1979,  in Queens, New York, Odom played college basketball for the University of Rhode Island and was later selected in the first round of the 1999 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Clippers. Odom began his career with the Clippers, where he played for four seasons before being traded to the Miami Heat in 2003. After spending a year in Miami, he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004 as part of the trade deal that also brought Shaquille O'Neal to the Miami Heat. During his time with the Lakers, Odom played a key role in helping the team win back-to-back NBA championships in 2009 and 2010. Known for his versatility on the court, Odom was a skilled player who could contribute in multiple ways, from scoring and rebounding to passing and defending. In December 2011, Odom was involved in a proposed trade that would have sent him to the New Orleans Hornets as part of a package to acquire Chris Paul, but the trade was controversially vetoed by the NBA. In a subsequent move, Odom was traded to the Dallas Mavericks. However, his time in Dallas was short-lived and marred by personal issues and lackluster performance on the court. As a result, Odom was eventually deactivated by the Mavericks in April 2012 and didn't play for the remainder of the season. Following his stint with the Mavericks, Odom was determined to bounce back and signed with the Los Angeles Clippers in June 2012 in a four-team trade. This marked his return to the team where he began his NBA career. He played the 2012-2013 season with the Clippers, primarily coming off the bench as a valuable role player. During that season, Odom averaged 4.0 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game, providing solid contributions in minutes off the bench. After the 2012-2013 season, Odom became a free agent, but he did not sign with any team for the following season and eventually retired from professional basketball. Despite the turbulent end to his career, Odom will always be remembered for his unique skillset and contributions to the game, particularly during his championship years with the Los Angeles Lakers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two female hikers are breaking camp when they are suddenly attacked and killed by an unseen animal. The national park's chief ranger, Michael Kelly, and photographer Allison Corwin, daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a ranger to the primitive campsite to check on the female hikers. There, they discover the mangled corpses of the two girls, one of which has been partially buried. At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the girls were killed by a bear. The park supervisor, Charley Kittridge, blames Kelly for the attacks, saying that the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by Kelly and naturalist Arthur Scott before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, before deciding to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who tells him that all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear must be unknown to the forest.

So her father went out to look for her at the area she frequented.      There, authorities say, he found her two dogs, guarding what he first thought was an animal carcass.      “Much to his horror, discovered that it was not,” Goochland County Sheriff Jim Agnew told reporters at a news conference Friday.      Investigators in Goochland, Va., a rural community about 30 miles outside of Richmond, say the petite, 5-foot-1 young woman, who weighed a little more than 100 pounds, was mauled to death by her dogs, which had a combined weight of about twice hers, while out on a walk earlier this week. Her father found her Thursday evening in a wooded area that used to be a farm, about a half a mile from the main road, Agnew told The Washington Post.      [‘It’s my baby. It’s my baby’: Two pit bulls fatally maul 7-year-old boy in Mass., authorities say]      During the conference, Agnew described the dogs as “very large brindle-colored pit bull dogs,” although the specific breeds of the animals are unknown.      “The dogs clearly, at least in our estimation in a dark night, had something to do with this. It was an absolutely grisly mauling,” Agnew told reporters. “In my 40 years of law enforcement, I’ve never seen anything quite like it. Hope I’d never see anything like it again.”      Officials from the county’s animal control department and sheriff’s office spent at least an hour trying to tranquilize the animals, Agnew said. Investigators also found bloody articles of clothing scattered in the area.      “We spent a lot of time there at the scene and made some observations that, out of respect for the family, we’re not releasing,” Agnew said.      Agnew said investigators still do not know why the animals turned on Stephens. According to the medical examiner’s office, the 22-year-old had defensive wounds on her hands and arms, which indicated that she was attacked while still alive. Investigators say she was first attacked on her throat and face.      “It appears she was taken to the ground, lost consciousness and the dogs mauled her to death,” Agnew told reporters. “There were no strangulation marks. The victim had puncture wounds in the skull, and this was not a homicide.”      [A Bengal tiger was shot dead after it wandered into a Georgia neighborhood and attacked a dog]      Stephens’s friend, Barbara Norris, was not convinced by the authorities’ account of her death, saying the dogs, which Stephens had been raising since they were puppies, would never turn on her, ABC affiliate WRIC reported.      “They’d kill you with kisses,” Norris told NBC affiliate WWBT, adding that the dogs’ kennels looked as though they had been forced open. She suggested that something may have happened to Stephens after walking the dogs, and the dogs then forced themselves out to help her.      Norris has not responded to a Facebook message asking for comment.      Asked about Norris’s comments Saturday, Agnew said the evidence found at the scene, including the defensive wounds, clearly showed that the dogs were responsible for Stephens’s death.

Upon arriving on the scene, the authorities spent “about an hour, hour and a half” trying to catch the dogs, which Agnew described as “two very large, brindle colored pit bull dogs who were very reluctant to be caught.”      Agnew went on to say that they found “various articles of clothing…torn into small pieces” around her body. “It was very clear that the woman in the wounds had suffered some very severe injuries consistent with being mauled by these dogs,” he added.      • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

As president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, it’s his job to fight for the interests of the 4,000 businesses he represents. But when it comes to legalizing marijuana, he’s torn — as are many leaders of Boston-area business groups. “How can you separate your own personal feelings and experiences from the economic and political concerns?” Hurst said, acknowledging that he indulged a few times as a college student in the 1970s. “It’s unlike anything I’ve dealt with in 25 years in this business.” The campaign for a state ballot initiative that would allow the sale of marijuana to adults had little organized opposition until Thursday, when Governor Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, and House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo launched a political organization to defeat it. But so far, it seems they’re unlikely to get the active backing of the Retailers Association and other business groups, whose money and numbers could give the opposition more political muscle. Essentially, business leaders said, their members are just not that worked up over the initiative — pro or con. Activists say the politicians support the expansion of alcohol sales while backing an effort to stop the legalization of marijuana. “To be real honest, I haven’t spent any time thinking about this,” said James Rooney, chief executive of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. “It’s just not something that has created any amount of focus among my members or the larger business community.” Members of the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws rallied outside Quincy Market. So far, just one major statewide business group, the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, has decided to oppose the measure. “Our concerns are twofold,” said Chris Geehern, AIM’s executive vice president of marketing and communications. “On-the-job impairment, particularly at trucking and construction companies, and businesses getting caught in the netherworld between state law that permits [marijuana] use and federal law that prohibits its use.” But the leaders of other groups representing thousands of businesses, including Hurst’s and Rooney’s, the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Alliance for Business Leadership, said their members have other priorities and are likely to stay on the sidelines, despite sharing some of AIM’s concerns. In contrast, a ballot initiative that would lift the statutory cap on charter schools is strongly backed by a coalition of business groups, including AIM and the Boston Chamber. Opponents of legalization said that while business groups might not fight the measure, none is likely to endorse it either. “The fact that business associations are not supporting commercial marijuana contradicts the industry’s arguments that it is good for the Massachusetts economy,” said Corey Welford , a spokesman for the newly formed opposition group, Campaign for a Safe and Healthy Massachusetts. The marijuana initiative proposes legalizing sales to anyone older than 21 beginning in January 2018. It would also enact a tax on sales of cannabis products and create regulations that would be enforced by a newly formed Cannabis Control Commission. Proponents are gathering signatures to place it on the ballot in November. Recreational marijuana is legal in four states and the District of Columbia; a number of states, including California and Nevada, are poised to vote on recreational marijuana this year. If adopted in Massachusetts, proponents claim the industry would eventually generate 1.1 billion in annual sales. The Retailers Association conducted an informal poll of its members and found that 60 percent want the group to oppose the ballot measure. But, Hurst said, many of those same businesses admitted legal marijuana would probably not hurt their bottom line and could even help the state’s economy. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of his members called for the association to endorse legalization, with some predicting it would actually boost their profits. Lacking a clear mandate, and with polls of voters showing the initiative will probably succeed, Hurst said his group will “probably stay neutral.” “Even if we oppose it, I doubt we’d be out raising money or doing speaking engagements like we have on other initiatives.” The Massachusetts chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents about 8,000 small companies, also expects to stay out of the fray. “I call my small businesses the ‘leave me alone’ coalition,” said Bill Vernon, the group’s director and a former Republican state representative. “I think you’ll see they have a libertarian view” on marijuana. Vernon said he holds conservative values and is thinking about voting against the measure. On the other hand, he noted he attended college from 1969 to 1973, and that while he himself has never smoked, “I’m a product of my age: ‘Live and let live and let people do what they want.’ ” At the Boston Chamber, Rooney said he is personally leaning against legalization, but sounded nothing like a strident opponent. And he’s barely heard a peep from his 1,500 members about it. If the measure passes, Rooney said he would probably welcome marijuana businesses into the chamber. “Over time, if [marijuana] is a legal form of business and they want to join, why not?” Rooney shrugged. “In fact, it may be a good thing. What happens in organizations like ours is a great deal of dialogue and an exchange of ideas, interests, and concerns. That’s the right approach.” Proponents with the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol are eager to portray cannabis industry businesses as job-generators and responsible corporate citizens. Kris Krane, managing partner at a venture capital firm that invests in cannabis companies, 4Front Ventures, said the stigma around marijuana is quickly fading in the business community. “A lot of business people want to know how to get into the industry because they understand it could be huge,” Krane said. However, several business groups said they share a concern about legalized pot: what to do with employees who show up to work high. They said there doesn’t appear to be a reliable test to determine whether an employee is impaired by marijuana. Existing tests only detect whether someone has used the drug at some point in recent weeks. Academic researchers have proposed different “functional” tests of impairment, including a smartphone app that tests working memory. But none has gained widespread adoption, and it’s unclear whether such methods would stand up in court. “If a test existed now that could guide employers, that would be a significant development,” Geehern said. “But it doesn’t.” AIM hasn’t yet decided how much money to commit to the antimarijuana campaign. But its leaders have invited the other business groups to a meeting in May, hoping to persuade them to join the opposition. Another worry of business groups is that a marijuana shop next door could scare away their members’ customers. They also fear getting caught between state and federal law, which still bans marijuana. Krane, the venture investor, said those concerns are valid, especially regarding on-the-job impairment. He and other supporters want to discuss the issue with business leaders. “I don’t want my employees showing up impaired either,” Krane said. “But I think the vast majority of people in society recognize that regulation is the way to strike a balance between individual liberty, the liberty and comfort of others, and the efficiency of business.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about how businesses in Massachusetts are not taking a strong stand on the topic of marijuana legalization. Jon Hurst, the president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, says he is torn about the issue, like many other business leaders in the area. Some business groups are concerned about employees using marijuana and showing up to work while being high, while others think legalizing marijuana could help the economy. A public vote on legalizing marijuana sales to adults is planned for November.

Question 2: Which is the best world war era bolt action rifle ? Options: [-] no; [-] yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Could Oswald fire 3 shots in 5.6 seconds using the Carcano bolt action rifle from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository? In the investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, it was determined that Lee Harvey Oswald used an Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano Model 91/38 bolt-action rifle to fire the shots in question. This type of rifle has a bolt-action mechanism which requires the shooter to manually cycle the bolt after each shot to eject the spent cartridge and chamber a new one. The FBI conducted tests and found that a proficient marksman could indeed fire the Carcano bolt action rifle three times within 5.6 seconds if the rifle had already been prepped and aimed. Oswald, known to be a sharpshooter in the Marines, may have had enough skill to execute the shots within this timeframe, although it would be by no means easy. Additionally, it was found that Oswald had the advantage of using a 4x scope mounted on the rifle, which could have potentially increased his accuracy and speed in firing the shots. Some argue that the adrenaline rush and his experience as a sharpshooter may have allowed him to fire the three shots quickly and accurately, while others claim that more time would be needed to achieve the precision and accuracy required. The debate remains inconclusive even today. Question 2: Which is the best world war era bolt action rifle? It is difficult to determine the \\"best\\" bolt action rifle, as different rifles have various advantages and disadvantages based on the context, purpose, and the individual using the firearm. However, here are some notable bolt action rifles from the World War era: 1. Mauser Karabiner 98k (Germany): This rifle was the most common firearm used by the German military during World War II. It was known for its reliability, accuracy, and powerful 7.92x57mm round. 2. Lee-Enfield No.4 Mk I (United Kingdom): The Lee-Enfield rifles served as the primary rifle for the British military during both World War I and II. Known for their smooth and fast bolt-action, these rifles were chambered in the powerful .303 British round. 3. Mosin-Nagant M91/30 (Soviet Union): The Mosin-Nagant series of rifles were the primary long arms used by the Russian and Soviet forces during the World War era. The M91/30, an updated version of the original design, was chambered in 7.62x54mmR and was known for its durability and reliability in harsh conditions. 4. Springfield M1903 (United States): The United States used the Springfield M1903 as their primary rifle during WWI and it continued to see service in various roles during WWII. The M1903 had a smoother bolt action and finer accuracy compared to other contemporary designs, chambered in the .30-06 Springfield round. 5. Arisaka Type 38 (Japan): The Type 38 Arisaka was the standard rifle of the Japanese military during both World War I and II. Known for its sturdy construction and chambered in the 6.5x50mm Arisaka round, the rifle performed well in the difficult conditions of the Pacific Theater. Comparing these rifles directly is a challenging task, as each possesses unique qualities and features that made them suitable for their respective forces. The \\"best\\" rifle would depend on situational context and individual preference. To answer your last question, if the answer to both questions was either 'yes' or 'no,' then they would be the same. However, as you can see, the answers to the two questions are not simple 'yes' or 'no' responses, and they are not identical. The answer to Question 1 involves an analysis of Oswald's firing ability and remains inconclusive, while the answer to Question 2 lists five notable bolt-action rifles, encompassing factors that make each one unique or favorable in different contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The painting was referred to in the earliest inventories as La Familia (\\"The Family\\"). A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the  records of 1814.

Movie title: Fool's Gold Movie plot: \\"Finn\\" Finnegan is a treasure hunter looking for a treasure from a Spanish galleon, known as the Aurelia, that was lost at sea with the 1715 Treasure Fleet. In his search to find the treasure, his wife, Tess, divorces him. Tess has been working as a steward on a huge yacht owned by multi-millionaire, Nigel Honeycutt. Finn finds a clue to the location of the treasure and manages to get on Nigel Honeycutt's yacht The Precious Gem and convince him and his daughter Gemma to join (and fund) the search for the treasure. A local gangster named Bigg Bunny and Finn's mentor, Moe Fitch, are intent on finding the treasure first. The Precious Gem and Moe's vessel compete to find the treasure in The Bahamas. As Finn attempts to secretly take down Moe's search grid, Finn discovers a sword which is a clue to finding the treasure. Tess and Finn follow the clues to an ancient church and discover a diary describing the location of the treasure. Bigg Bunny and his associates, who have been following Tess and Finn, take Tess hostage and assume (incorrectly) that Finn was killed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Activated carbon is a special filter media that removes chlorine, chloramines, and organic compounds from water.  Some activated carbon filters can be connected to your home’s water supply, or you can buy a filtered pitcher that uses an activated carbon filter.  Activated carbon filters remove both chlorine and chloramine.  Choose an activated carbon filter that has been certified by NSF International, a nonprofit that tests and certifies water filtration products. Reverse osmosis refers to the process in which ions and particles are removed from the water.  Reverse osmosis systems can be installed directly beneath your kitchen sink or where your water supply enters your home, and are therefore very convenient relative to other dechlorination methods.  But they’re also very expensive, often reaching several thousand U.S. dollars. Additionally, reverse osmosis filters are energy-intensive and produce large volumes of wastewater. All filters need to be changed eventually.  The amount of time that passes between filter changes depends on your filter’s size and how heavily it’s been used.  Check the manufacturer’s directions to ensure you’re changing your filter with the appropriate frequency. Boiling creates heat and aeration (via bubbles), the combination of which is sufficient to remove volatile chlorine after 20 minutes.  If you’re trying to dechlorinate large batches of water, however, this method is probably not practical. Boiling for at least 20 minutes will also remove chloramine, which is added instead of chlorine in some areas.

Movie title: Visitor Q Context: The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.[5] The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner. The father announces that the man will be staying with the family for a while. The son comes down while they are eating and starts beating the mother again. This does not surprise or bother the father, or... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie Visitor Q, the bullies primarily target Takuya, the son of the protagonist family. They engage in various acts of harassment and torment. One of the main instances of their bullying behavior occurs when they come to the front of Takuya's house and shoot fireworks through his bedroom window. This act of aggression and intimidation causes further tension and distress within the already dysfunctional family. The bullies in this film serve as a representation of the various societal pressures and negative influences that are affecting the struggling family, contributing to the overall theme of chaos and disarray in their lives. As the story progresses, the strange visitor, known as Visitor Q, enters the family's life and starts to interact with each family member, exposing their darkest secrets and challenging their relationships with one another. While the bullies play a significant role in the film's depiction of the family's struggles, much of the dysfunction stems from underlying issues within the family itself, including drug addiction, sexual exploitation, and emotional and physical abuse. As Visitor Q's presence becomes more influential, the family members begin to confront their demons and ultimately search for redemption and reconciliation in an effort to rebuild their shattered lives. In summary, the bullies in Visitor Q perform acts of harassment and intimidation towards the son, Takuya, and indirectly, his family as well. Their actions serve as a representation of the external pressures and negative influences that contribute to the family's turmoil throughout the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the building that remains in use by the Church of England?, using the article: St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is a medieval Anglican parish church in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. While a church and a priest have probably been present in the settlement since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire, which date to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England. The church is a Grade I listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". It is a prime example of Decorated Gothic church architecture in England, with the architectural historians Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris noting that \\"it is a prolonged delight to follow the mason's inventiveness\\". The church's tracery has attracted special praise, with Simon Jenkins arguing that its Decorated windows are \\"works of infinite complexity\\". Built out of Ancaster stone with a lead roof, St Denys' is furnished with a medieval rood screen and a communion rail, possibly by Sir Christopher Wren, and has a peal of eight bells, dating to 1796. The church also houses several memorials, including two altar tombs commemorating members of the Carre family, Sleaford's lords of the manor in the 17th century., what would be the answer ?

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same essential information, but they are presented with slightly different sentence structures and word order.  In both sentences, the main points are: - The buildings were designed in 1937. - They were constructed for André Jaoul and his son Michel. - The construction took place after the war. Sentence 1 has a smoother flow and more natural word order, with the details about the buildings being drawn in 1937 and then the information about the construction happening postwar for André Jaoul and his son Michel.

It starts with the same details about the buildings being drawn in 1937, but the information regarding the war period and the recipients of the constructed buildings is presented later in the sentence.

Sex Workers: How can clients know your boundaries?","output":"While the two questions appear to delve into the subject of sex work and related services, they have different meanings and focal points. Let's analyze each question and address them separately. Question 1: What is the difference between a prostitute and an escort? This question aims to discern the difference between two distinct types of sex work: prostitution and escort services.  Prostitution is the act of providing sexual services in exchange for money or other forms of compensation. This profession involves engaging in sexual activities with clients as the primary offering. Prostitutes might work on the streets (\\"streetwalkers\\"), in brothels, or conduct business independently. They are generally paid by the service or transaction and operate in a more stigmatized and criminalized environment in most countries.  Escorts, on the other hand, are often assumed to offer companionship services apart from sexual activities. Escorts may accompany clients to social events, dinners, or other gatherings, offering a 'girlfriend experience' or a 'boyfriend experience.' Their services are not confined to sexual encounters; instead, they can act as arm candy, a conversation partner, or a date for a specific event. While sexual activities may occur between the escort and the client, this is not always the primary expectation, and there might be a more emotional and social focus. Escorts usually receive payment for their time and companionship. Additionally, they mostly work independently, through agencies, or advertise themselves online. Question 2: Sex Workers: How can clients know your boundaries? This question is directed at sex workers and seeks to better understand how clients can get to know and respect their professional boundaries. Respecting boundaries is crucial in any profession, and sex work is no exception. Sex workers and clients can establish boundaries by engaging in open and clear communication before starting any service or session. They can discuss expectations, limits, and preferences, both from the worker's and the client's perspective. This can provide a safer environment and help clients understand what is acceptable and not acceptable behavior during the interaction. Sex workers may maintain a list of services they offer and don't offer, also referred to as their \\"menu,\\" which clients can reference before making arrangements. Many independent escorts develop personal websites or online profiles detailing their preferences and boundaries. They also utilize advertisements in which they outline their policies. Another critical aspect is ensuring clients follow and respect the rules and guidelines set by the sex worker. Sex workers often have strategies and practices in place to protect themselves while they work, and these must be respected by the clients. This includes using protection during sexual activities, not forcing the worker to engage in activities they did not agree upon, and abiding by any specified time limits for the session. In conclusion, the two questions address different aspects of sex work. The first one distinguishes between two kinds of sex work—prostitution and escort services—while the second focuses on the communication of boundaries and how clients can respect them. Both inquiries contribute to expanding the understanding of perspectives and workings of the sex work industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Culpepper directs Ben to a cantina a day's ride off, to find Russ Caldwell. Before he can reach the cantina, Ben is accosted by trappers who take his horse and gun. Once Ben finds Caldwell, he and three of his buddies agree to join the drive. When they cross the trappers' path, there is no parlaying—they immediately kill the trappers and take their possessions. When Ben stands night watch, he's unprepared for a one-eyed man trying to steal the horses. Instead of immediately shooting him, Ben lets the man distract him with his talk, and is overcome by another thief. Culpepper is outraged at Ben's stupidity.","output":"The one-eyed man distracts Ben with talk."},{"instruction":"Cameron told Remy to call if she needed any help with her math homework.

If this program is successful, one day more than 1000 bicycles will be available. Everyone, not just city workers, will be able to use these bicycles. People in Fresno,Californiaalready have a free bicycle program. In fact, this idea began inAmsterdamover 40 years ago. These programs encourage citizens to get out of their cars and onto pollution-free bikes. Fresno's Yellow Bike Program puts about fast bicycles around the city. The bikes are painted bright yellow so people know they can take them. When people take a yellow bike, they can ride to work or to shopping areas, and then leave the bike for the next rider. Some people worry that the free bikes will be stolen. However, theft hasn't been a problem in other free-bike cities.

To do this, we need to subtract 201 from both sides of the equation. -30*m + 201 - 201 = -69 - 201 This simplifies to: -30*m = -270 Step 3: Solve for m Now, we need to get rid of the coefficient of m, which is -30. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -30.

Because there was a lack of evidence to prove that Johnson was not killed in self-defense , Jim was acquitted and allowed to return home . Because there was a lack of evidence to prove that Johnson had not been killed in self-defense , Jim was acquitted and was allowed to return home . OPTIONS: (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"(B). Yes. The two sentences essentially mean the same thing, just expressed slightly differently. Both are stating that Jim was acquitted - meaning he was cleared of a legal charge - and was able to return home because there wasn't enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Johnson wasn't killed in self-defense.  The variation in the sentences concerns primarily the construction of the statements referring to Johnson's death. The first sentence, \\"Because there was a lack of evidence to prove that Johnson was not killed in self-defense\\" uses the simple past tense, \\"was not killed,\\" indicting an event in the past. The second sentence, \\"Because there was a lack of evidence to prove that Johnson had not been killed in self-defense,\\" taps into the past perfect tense, \\"had not been killed,\\" which indicates a situation that occurred before another past event. While there are subtle differences in tense usage, these do not change the overarching meaning of the sentences. Here, both tenses suggest that at some point in the past, Johnson was allegedly killed by Jim. The evidence didn't conclusively show that the act of killing was not in self-defense. On this account, Jim was acquitted in both scenarios. Despite the slight structural difference, the two sentences convey the same situation and outcome - they both depict a scenario where due to lack of evidence to prove murder (as opposed to self-defense), Jim was acquitted and permitted to return home. Therefore, the essential meaning of both sentences remains the same, thereby making option B (\\"Yes, they mean the same.\\") the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article with the title: \\"Innovation Myths and the Unsexy Truths About Breakthroughs\\"","output":"Title: Innovation Myths and the Unsexy Truths About Breakthroughs Introduction: Innovation has become a buzzword, commonly used as a magical ingredient to bring success to any tech venture or startup. This phenomenon has paved the way for the rise of several myths about the process of innovation itself. However, the reality of breakthroughs is vastly different and far less glamorous than the hype surrounding it. In this article, we will explore the common myths associated with innovation and the unsexy truths behind the breakthroughs that rarely make headlines. Myth 1: Lightning-quick results One of the most persistent yet misleading myths is that innovations and breakthroughs emerge almost instantaneously. People often believe that the moment of inspiration is the only driving force behind a successful innovation. Unsexy truth: Innovation rarely happens in a flash. It requires time, persistence, and perseverance. Most successful innovators work for months or even years, undergoing several iterations and learning from their failures, before they can bring a new concept or product to life. Myth 2: Lone genius inventors Many people picture a lone genius working in isolation, single-handedly creating innovations that change the world. Unsexy truth: Innovations are rarely the result of one solitary individual working in isolation. Teamwork, collaboration, and collective effort play crucial roles in the process. Different perspectives, experiences, and skills contribute to the creation of innovative ideas or the successful execution of a project. Myth 3: Innovation is reserved for small startups and tech moguls The myth that only small, agile startups and tech giants like Apple or Google can create innovation has many people believing that innovation is challenging for larger, traditional corporations or industries. Unsexy truth: Innovation is possible across all sizes and types of organizations. Large organizations often have access to resources, talent, and expertise that smaller companies might not. Encouraging a culture of innovation and embracing change across all departments can lead to significant breakthroughs in larger enterprises. Myth 4: Innovation equals radical inventions People believe that innovation is synonymous with radical, disruptive inventions that reshape our lives (such as the internet, smartphones, or self-driving cars). Unsexy truth: While revolutionary inventions capture our imaginations, minor improvements, adjustments, and refinements of existing technologies and practices can be equally impactful. Incremental innovations often form the backbone of substantial progress, even if these vital advancements do not make the news headlines. Conclusion: Innovation is often romanticized by various myths, distracting us from the hard work, dedication, and unglamorous realities of the process. By debunking these myths and acknowledging the unsexy truths about breakthroughs, we can better understand and appreciate the nature of innovation and the people who work tirelessly to bring new and improved ideas to life. It's time to recognize and celebrate the often overlooked aspects of innovation and realize that breakthroughs come from a combination of inspiration, effort, collaboration, and persistence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make sure it is not too sharp, so it won't hurt you or damage your rope. 2. Tie a rope or cord to the rock: Take one end of the rope or cord you want to secure and wrap it around the rock a few times. Make sure it is tight and doesn't slip off. 3. Make a knot: Tie a good knot, like a square knot or a double half hitch, to keep the rope tight around the rock. This will help the rock hold the rope in place without moving. 4. Use the rock as an anchor: Now, you can use the rock to hold the other end of the rope or cord tight, like when you're setting up a tent or hanging a swing. Gently tug the rope in the direction you want it to go until the rock is set firmly in the ground or in between other rocks. 5. Check for safety: Once the rock anchor is in place, double-check that the knot and the rock are secure. You don't want the rock to move or the rope to slip when you need it most.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A grotesque brougham stops in a dark forest and its cowled driver, Lalbai the sorceress, beckons to the bewitched passenger, a newly wed bride. Lalbai leads the bride to the shaitani ilaaka (devil's domain) where she is roused from her spell. The bride is sacrificed, screaming and kicking, at the altar of her aka (the Shaitan, or great devil). Shaitan is an ancient and fearsome demon. Years ago, he roamed free and indiscriminately terrorized the local townsfolk. But he was ultimately defeated, reduced to a formless soul, and held, by a magic charm, to remain imprisoned forever within the shaitani ilaaka. Lalbai brings him a fresh bride every Amavasya night. Shaitan consumes the blood of this bride, and grows stronger with each offering, until he can break the charm, restore all his evil powers and ravage the world again. At the affluent home of rich industrialist Thakur, he has a wife, Roma, and their six-year old daughter, Anju. They have retained a governess, Shalaka, for Anju. Anju seems to be a happy child with one exception. She experiences strange convulsions and horrible nightmares every Amavasya night. Thakur decides to bring her to Dr. Yograj, a medical man who has attained Siddhi through rigorous spiritual training. Dr. Yograj examines Anju from a medical standpoint, but also notices strange telekinetic events when Anju is in his office. Later, at the home, he observes phenomena that strongly indicate a poltergeist. When he talks to Shalaka, she firmly snubs him. (Unbeknownst to the family however, Shalaka practices voodoo with Anju as the target.) Dr. Yograj refers Thakur to a famed Tantrik Baba (wise man), recently returned from Tibet after an extended spiritual course, for help. Baba visits the home, inspects Anju's room, and immediately identifies it as the work of a malevolent aatma (soul).

Article: One in five people carry a 'smart gene' variant linked to long lifespan, bigger forebrains and enhanced mental ability, researchers have found. 'We've known for a long time that people lose cognitive  abilities as they age, but now we're beginning to understand that factors like KLOTHO can give people a boost in aging. Genetic variation in KLOTHO could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the diseases that happen to us as we grow old, like Alzheimer's disease ,\\" said senior author, Dena Dubal of University of California. The KLOTHO gene affects a protein found in the kidneys and the brain that regulates many different body processes. About one in five people carry a single copy of the varian, known as KL-VS,which boosts levels of the protein and is associated with a longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function. A small minority, 3% of the population, has two copies, which is linked to a shorter lifespan. In the new study scientists scanned the brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and over who were also tested for the KLOTHO gene. They found that participants with a single copy of the gene variant also had a larger brain region known as RDLPFC, which is especially likely to shrink with age. Loss of neurons in this area may be one reason why older people are sometimes easily distracted and find it difficult to do more than one task at the same time. Researcher Dr Jennifer Yokoyama said, \\" The brain region enhanced by genetic variation in KLOTHO is vulnerable in aging and some mental disease. In this case, bigger size means better function. It will be important to determine whether the structure increase associated with carrying one copy of KL-VS can _ the cognitive shortage caused by disease.\\"[:] People who have one copy of a variant KL-VS tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke  ,whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a higher risk of stroke.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Even plants can run a fever, especially when they're under attack by insects or disease. But unlike human, plants can have their temperature taken from 3,000 feet away--straight up. A decade ago, adopting the infrared scanning technology developed for military purposes and other satellites, physicist Stephen Paley came up with a quick way to take the temperature of crops to determine which ones are under stress. The goal was to let farmers precisely target pesticide spraying rather than rain poison on a whole field, which invariably includes plants that don't have pest problems. Even better, Paley's Remote Scanning Services Company could detect crop problems before they became visible to the eye. Mounted on a plane flown at 3,000 feet at night, an infrared scanner measured the heat emitted by crops. The data were transformed into a colourcoded map showing where plants were running \\"fevers\\". Farmers could then spotspray, using 50 to 70 percent less pesticide than they otherwise would. The bad news is that Paley's company closed down in 1984, after only three years. Farmers resisted the new technology and longterm backers were hard to find. But with the renewed concern about pesticides on produce, and refinements in infrared scanning, Paley hopes to get back into operation. Agriculture experts have no doubt the technology works. \\"This technique can be used on 75 percent of agricultural land in the United States, \\" says George Oerther of Texas A & M. Ray Jackson, who recently retired from the Department of Agriculture, thinks remote infrared crop scanning could be adopted by the end of the decade. But only if Paley finds the financial backing which he failed to obtain 10 years ago. Answer:","output":"Which statement is true about Stephen Paley's infrared scanning technology for detecting crop problems? A. The infrared scanning technology was originally developed for medical purposes. B. The technology allows farmers to use 50 to 70 percent less pesticide. C. The technology requires direct contact with the crops to measure their temperature. D. Paley's Remote Scanning Services Company is still in operation today. Correct answer: B. The technology allows farmers to use 50 to 70 percent less pesticide. Explanation: The article states that Paley adopted infrared scanning technology developed for military purposes and satellites, which could detect crop problems before they became visible to the eye. By using this technology, farmers could spot spray their crops, which would result in using 50 to 70% less pesticide than they otherwise would.

Slipknot is an American heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. The band was formed in 1992 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Jim Root, Paul Gray, Craig Jones, Sid Wilson, Shawn Crahan, Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011-2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Anticipation for Slipknot's second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001 and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled Iowa, Slipknot's second album - released on August 28, 2001 - peaked at number three on the Billboard charts and at number one in the UK. The album produced three singles; \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" (promotional single), \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"My Plague\\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the film Resident Evil. In 2002, Slipknot appeared in Rollerball (2002), performing \\"I Am Hated\\". The release and intense promotion of the album resulted in sold-out shows in large arenas in several countries.  In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, the future of Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether there would be a third album, or if the split would become permanent. \\"I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot,\\" Jordison protested. \\"I've seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.\\"  Nonetheless, on November 22, 2002, Slipknot released their second DVD, Disasterpieces.  Preparation for Slipknot's fourth album began towards the end of 2007; work began at Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa, with producer Dave Fortman in February 2008. The album was finished in June, and the band the All Hope Is Gone World Tour on July 9, 2008. Slipknot's fourth album, All Hope Is Gone, was released on August 20, 2008, debuting at number one on the Billboard albums chart. The album produced five singles; \\"All Hope Is Gone\\", \\"Psychosocial\\", \\"Dead Memories\\", \\"Sulfur\\" and \\"Snuff\\". 2009 marked the 10th anniversary of Slipknot's debut album; to commemorate the event, the band released a special edition version of Slipknot on September 9, 2009. The band toured in support of the album throughout 2008 and continued until October 31, 2009, resulting in Slipknot's third hiatus.  During the hiatus, several band members focused on respective side projects; Taylor founded Junk Beer Kidnap Band and returned to Stone Sour with guitarist Root; Crahan continued working with his band Dirty Little Rabbits; and drummer Jordison returned with his band Murderdolls and became the new permanent drummer of Rob Zombie. Percussionist Fehn is now a full-time bassist with metalcore band Will Haven and Sid Wilson founded the eponymous band Sid.  In 2010, Gray was planning to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he was found dead in an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The day after his death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray's widow and brother. On June 21, the cause of death was confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and synthetic morphine substitute fentanyl.  The band was hesitant to comment on the future of Slipknot. The members made conflicting statements in interviews; drummer Jordison told The Pulse of Radio \\"there is another Slipknot record already kinda in the making\\". Vocalist Taylor told FMQB Productions' he was \\"very conflicted about whether or not [he wants] to do anything with Slipknot\\". The band released their fourth video album (sic)nesses on September 28, 2010; it debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Music Video Charts. The DVD features Slipknot's entire live performance at the 2009 Download Festival and a 45-minute film documenting their tour in support of All Hope Is Gone, and served as a tribute to Paul Gray.  Regarding the continuation of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue and he felt they should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing a small number of shows in Europe. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.  Slipknot also said the band would complete and release the band's fifth studio album, and that there were no plans to replace Gray. Jordison said the writing process for the album had already begun and that he had written 17 songs. Slipknot performed at the Mayhem Festival tour of 2012.  On May 29, 2012, Roadrunner Records posted a teaser video titled Antennas to Hell on its website. Later that day, on Twitter, Corey Taylor said Slipknot will release a greatest hits album on June 17, 2012. He also said the band was not yet recording new material but was putting together demos for a new album.  Slipknot's first annual music festival, called Knotfest, was held on August 17, 2012, at Mid-America Motorplex near Pacific Junction, Iowa, and on August 18, 2012, in Somerset, Wisconsin. Deftones, Lamb of God, Serj Tankian also performed at the festival. The festival shows also debuted a Slipknot museum. On 14, June 2013, Slipknot headlined the Download Festival for a second time.

Build a movie plot around this: When will the infrared sensors be used? for racing at night.","output":"Title: Night Vision Showdown Genre: Action/Thriller Introduction: Our story is set in the underground racing world, where experienced racers participate in high-speed, high-stakes races without safety nets and strictly off the books - the perfect breeding ground for the illegal racing world, filled with thrill-seekers, gamblers, and criminals.  Innovations in technology have made their way into these races, including the use of advanced infrared sensors capable of allowing racers to navigate effortlessly through the toughest terrains during night races. These races, known as Night Vision Showdowns, have become the ultimate test of skill, danger, and resilience, attracting the best racers from around the world. Main Characters: 1. Alex \\"Night Rider\\" Reed - A former professional racer, Alex was banned from the legitimate racing world after a near-fatal crash took the life of his close friend and racing partner. He now dives into the underground racing scene to obliterate those who consider it just a gamble. 2. Amy \\"Siren\\" Jones - A rebellious tech genius and a skilled amateur racer who develops new and advanced infrared technology that revolutionized the world of night racing. 3. Victor \\"Raven\\" Morales - The reigning underground racing champion and antagonist of the story, who feels threatened by the arrival of Alex in the Night Vision Showdowns. 4. Samuel \\"The Gamemaker\\" Thompson - The mastermind behind the underground racing world and the one who capitalizes on these events. He's always ready to push the envelope, creating new and more challenging races but at the same time, grows more desperate as the stakes become higher and the races riskier. Plot: Act 1: Alex Reed has lost everything after the accident and seeks redemption in the underground racing scene where he meets Amy Jones, a rebellious tech-genius with a soft spot for racing. After learning about the Night Vision Showdowns and the infrared technology, Alex is intrigued and asks Amy to build a custom car for him. Act 2: Amy designs and constructs a high-tech race car equipped with an advanced infrared sensor system, making it a top contender for racing at night. As Alex starts winning races and gaining notoriety, daring stunts and death-defying auto duels unfold, with every opponent trying to best each other for the title of the ultimate Night Vision King. During this time, both Alex and Amy face their personal demons - Alex must come to terms with the guilt left behind by the tragic accident, while Amy grapples with the moral implications of the technology she created and its use in the dangerous underground racing world. Act 3: As the Night Vision Showdowns become increasingly perilous, its popularity heightens, and so does the law enforcement's interest. Simultaneously, Samuel's desperation escalates, proposing a daring, seemingly impossible race: driving a treacherous course through a densely wooded area with zero visibility. Alex, driven both by his desire for redemption and justice against the underground racing criminals, accepts the challenge. The stakes are even higher when Victor, prepared to cheat to win, sabotages Amy's car before the race begins. Unaware of this, Alex and Amy face an unparalleled challenge as they race against time and an army of competitors. Climax: Alex uses his profound driving skills and trusts Amy's technological innovations, ultimately defeating Victor \\"Raven\\" Morales in the nerve-wracking, intensely thrilling race. In the end, Victor gets arrested with Samuel for their criminal activities, and the underground racing world crumbles. Conclusion: Alex and Amy expose the true villains of the underground racing world and restore justice (and their reputations) in the process. Though Night Vision Showdowns will be remembered as an intense and dangerous phase of racing, Alex and Amy learn valuable lessons and grow together as friends and partners.

Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - Tripping the Live Fantastic is Paul McCartney's first official live album and his first release of concert material since Wings' 1976 \\"Wings over America\\" live package.

Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - MTV Unplugged is an American television series showcasing musical artists usually playing acoustic instruments.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What culture's literature grew due to the group that only had a limited measure of independence?  Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

Q:Information:  - A historical figure is a famous person in history, such as Alexander the Great, Gandhi, Hirohito, Bismarck, Washington, Napoleon or Mandela.  - The quest for the historical Jesus refers to academic efforts to provide a historical portrait of Jesus. Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions.  - Historicity is the historical actuality of persons and events, meaning the quality of being part of history as opposed to being a historical myth, legend, or fiction. Historicity focuses on the truth value of knowledge claims about the past (denoting historical actuality, authenticity, and factuality). The historicity of a claim about the past is its factual status.  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - In Abrahamic religions, the Messiah or Messias is a saviour or liberator of a group of people, more specifically, the Jewish people.  - At the start of his reign, Japan was already one of the great powersthe ninth-largest economy in the world, the third-largest naval power, and one of the four permanent members of the council of the League of Nations. He was the head of state under the Constitution of the Empire of Japan during Japan's imperial expansion, militarization, and involvement in World War II. After the Japan's defeat of the war, he was not prosecuted for war crimes as many other leading government figures were, and his degree of involvement in wartime decisions remains controversial among historians. During the post-war period, he became the symbol of the new state under the post-war constitution and Japan's recovery, and by the end of his reign, Japan had emerged as the world's second largest economy.  - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\";  , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769  5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.  - A parable is a succinct, didactic story, in prose or verse, which illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a fable in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters. A parable is a type of analogy.  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.  - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974.  - The Christian Church is a term generally used to refer to the whole group of people belonging to the Christian religious tradition throughout history. In this understanding, the \\"Christian Church\\" does not refer to a particular Christian denomination but to the body of all believers. Some Christians believe that the term \\"Christian Church\\" or \\"Church\\" applies only to a specific historic Christian institution (e.g., the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity.  - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \\"My Master\\" (irregular plural ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \\"master\\" \\"\\" literally means \\"great one\\".  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived.  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.  - The historicity of Jesus concerns whether Jesus of Nazareth , born c 7 -- 2 BC , existed as a historical figure , whether the episodes portrayed in the gospels can be confirmed as historical events as opposed to myth , legend , or fiction , and the weighing of the evidence relating to his life . One of the chief problems confronting scholars interested in the historicity of Jesus , like that of the historicity of King Arthur , is that there are no contemporary records of his life or existence . Like many genuinely historical figures of antiquity , all records of his historicity come from one or more generations after his death , the earliest source being that found in the Epistles of Paul dated to AD 59 , who discusses his crucifixion . Other sources such as that of Josephus or Tacitus date even later . Historians interested in the historicity of Jesus are confronted by discussing the nature of these historic records and the intention and points of view of their authors . Although there is \`\` near universal consensus '' among scholars that Jesus existed historically , biblical scholars differ about the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the details of his life that have been described in the gospels . While scholars have sometimes criticized Jesus scholarship for religious bias and lack of methodological soundness , with very few exceptions , such critics do support the historicity of Jesus , and reject the theory that Jesus never existed , known as the Christ myth theory . Certain scholars , particularly in Europe , have recently made the case that while there are a number of plausible \`\` Jesi '' that could have existed , there can be no certainty as to which Jesus was the historical Jesus , and that there should also be more scholarly research and debate on this topic . The historicity of Jesus is distinct from the related study of the historical Jesus , which refers to scholarly reconstructions of the life of Jesus , based primarily on critical analysis of the gospel texts ....  - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.  - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC  10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.  - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.

If you cannot quite pinpoint what is causing you pain, suffering, confusion, or what is blocking you from letting go, spend some time writing about your experience and how you feel. You may realize that certain thoughts or beliefs keep you from letting go of something. You can also learn to identify and express your emotions through journaling.  Be completely honest in your journal and share your thoughts and feelings. Write about what might be stopping you from letting something go or what factors make it difficult. Don't be concerned about spelling, neatness, format, or even making sense. Start writing when you feel like it, and stop when you feel like you're done. Remember that you don't have to process everything in one sitting. You may work out your feelings over multiple entries over a period of time. . If you find your thoughts becoming negative or holding onto something, use mindfulness to help let them go. Sit down and ask yourself, “What is it that I’m feeling?” Notice your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Notice these things without responding to them or interacting. After a minute or so, bring your awareness to your breath. Notice how it feels to bring air into your body and exhale it. Continue to let your entire body breathe and let whatever feelings come up be felt, but always return to your breath. Breathe through each experience.  If you get sidetracked in your own thoughts, always come back to your breath. Don't sabotage yourself by expecting meditation to come easily right away. Practicing mindfulness and meditation can be very difficult at first, but becomes easier the more you do it. Stick with it, even if you are initially frustrated by your drifting thoughts. Find an affirmation or mantra to repeat to yourself when you’re having problems letting go. This serves to remind you to avert your attention and accept that letting go is okay. Choose a mantra that resonates with you such as, “I surrender” or, “Letting go is okay.” When you start to feel stuck or uncomfortable in holding onto something, repeat the mantra in your mind.  Some other examples may include, “I am not in control and that’s okay” or, “Letting go frees me.” It may be helpful to write these on sticky it notes and posting them where you will see them frequently, like on your mirror or on your computer monitor. You can even have your phone send you alerts with these affirmations. You may want to choose a time to let something go and make it a sacred or meaningful ceremony. For example, write all of your thoughts and feelings about what you cannot change. Once you finish, burn the paper to symbolically represent you letting go and moving on. Invite a trusted friend or family member to join you if you feel you need support.  You can also draw a picture or gather items you wish to burn, throw away, or donate. Release whatever you associate with what you cannot change as a way to let go. For example, if you’re ready to move on from an unhealthy relationship, remove anything that reminds you of the person or the relationship. Write a letter saying that you’re ready to let go, then burn it.","output":"Journaling, practicing mindfulness, using affirmations, and creating letting-go ceremonies are methods to help you identify and release thoughts and emotions that block you from moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Floodwater gouged out ground beneath Spencer Court, Newburn, on Tuesday, exposing the piles holding it up and badly damaging foundations. Residents attending a public meeting reacted angrily to the news the flats might have to be pulled down. On Thursday two further blocks of council flats were evacuated amid fears Spencer Court could collapse. By Peter HarrisLook North At a heated public meeting residents were shocked to be told the Spencer Court flats in Newburn are set to be demolished. An engineer working for Northumberland Estates said an inspection this afternoon revealed they are likely to be beyond saving. However, the homeowners said that was the first they had heard of demolition plans. The mood in the meeting at Walbottle School hall became increasingly tense as locals vented anger at having worthless houses. They suggested homes should never have been built there. Residents of Hareside Walk and Hareside Close had been allowed home but were asked to leave again. Housing company Your Homes Newcastle - which manages council housing for Newcastle City Council - said it took the decision in the interests of residents' safety. Mick Murphy, technical director at Newcastle City Council, said after the meeting: \\"Engineers assessments say that it's unsafe and probably unsafe to try and repair.\\" Kate Scaife, who lives in Spencer Court, said: \\"To find out in a public meeting was shocking. To everybody else it's bricks and mortar, but to us it's home and it hurts.\\" Caroline Charlton, who lives in Mill Vale, said: \\"There's a lot of upset people and for us poor residents we're going to be stuck in the middle of a long legal battle between landowners. \\"Who would want to buy our houses? They're lovely homes but who would take the risk? I certainly wouldn't.\\" Paul Nicholson, also lives in Mill Vale, he said: \\"We've had enough upheaval over the last few months, we need to walk away from this now because I've got a five-year-old and a one-year-old and I don't feel that it's safe anymore.\\" A culvert near the damaged flats collapsed in May but the force of floodwater on Monday eroded soil and a waterfall formed close to the flats. Developer Dunelm Homes owns the land on which the homes stand, while the culvert is on land owned by Northumberland Estates. Neither company has accepted liability. Northumberland Estates said it was working hard to find a long-term solution but said there was little it could do \\"in the face of such very extreme weather conditions until the culvert can be cleared\\". Dunelm Homes said it was attending emergency meetings and providing whatever assistance and support it could. Mr Murphy said the flats at Spencer Court were \\"extremely unstable\\". Engineers for Northumberland Estates told the public meeting an inspection had been carried out and the report was expected to confirm the flats are beyond saving. Greg Blyth, a resident of Spencer Court, said earlier: \\"I don't think they should have built on this ground. \\"The whole place needs knocking down because it's very, very unsafe and it's a matter of time before everything does go.\\" Newcastle City Council, which said planning permission had been given because the plans were right for the ground, is looking at how well the culvert was maintained. Mr Murphy added: \\"You can build in most places as long as you take the right engineering steps. An engineer has taken account of poor ground because they've used those long piles.\\" Northumbria Police made the decision to evacuate the area on Tuesday after what the Met Office called the most intense September storms for 30 years. Residents of Mill Vale were allowed back in for a short time to collect valuables on Wednesday.","output":"Floodwater significantly damaged the foundations of Spencer Court flats in Newburn, prompting a heated public meeting where residents were informed about potential demolition. Two more blocks of council flats had to be evacuated due to the risk of Spencer Court collapsing. Damaged by a collapsed culvert, residents are now stuck in a legal battle as neither landowner is accepting liability. Engineers' assessments deem the flats 'extremely unstable,' leaving residents faced with the likelihood that their homes are beyond repair and questioning whether they should have been built on the ground in the first place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A morbidly obese bus inspector who tipped the scales at 31st 7lb has shed more than half his body weight after being shamed for taking up multiple seats on the tube. Philip Kettle, 52, from Romford, was carrying around the equivalent of 128 bags of sugar in weight after eating unhealthily for almost two decades. But after warnings from doctors and daily angry stares from commuters, Philip decided to overhaul his diet and now weighs a trim 14st 7lb. Slimline: Bus conductor Philip Kettle poses in one of his old XXXXXL blazers after losing a colossal 17st. Big change: Philip now weighs just 14st 7lb but used to weigh a mighty 31st 7lb and was morbidly obese. 'When you are that size you become. withdrawn, withdrawn from society, you don't want to go out to things. because people will look at you,' Phillip revealed. 'You. become very self conscious that you are being scrutinised. Looks are. one thing but the emotional side also takes a right pounding. 'I was ashamed. I was not proud of what I had done to myself over the years.' At his biggest, Philip had a 60in waist and struggled with simple activities such as climbing the stairs and keeping up with his five-year-old grandson. 'I was eating chocolate bars and various junk food all the time - I have a very sweet tooth,' he added. 'But my health started to deteriorate. I had very high blood pressure. It was quite a shock to hear what the GP said. I was at that point in my life that I realised I had put my family through a lot by being this way.' Particularly hard for Philip was the realisation that he might not live to see his grandson grow up, which made him increasingly desperate to shed the pounds. 'I was very overweight throughout my daughter's lives but now I have a grandson,' he said. 'I. didn't want him remembering his grandfather like that. I couldn't do. anything about the past but I could so something about the future. Relieved: Wife Denise, 52, is thrilled that her husband has finally managed to shift the pounds. Unhealthy: Philip was warned that he might not see his grandson grow up unless he lost weight. 'I. had just carried on and put off doing something about it for years. But. it got to a point where I could not carry on. It was becoming too much.' Philip's solution was to join Weightwatcher's where he was swiftly put on a programme that replaced daily English breakfasts and carb-laden sandwiches with healthy salads, fruit and vegetables. Snacking was banned, while weekly weigh-ins helped to keep him on track as the pounds slowly but surely dropped off. He also started walking everywhere and two years later, he now weighs just 14st 7lb and has a trim 34in waist. 'My. blood pressure is back to normal, I am physically fit and I'm off all. my medication - the doctor said I have got my health back,' said Philip. 'I used to go. everywhere in the car, even short journeys, but now I walk everywhere. I. walk to work and as much as I can and only use the car once a week. 'I'm even doing a 26-mile walk for charity, which before was something I could never of imagined doing. 'Everything has changed now. I have. changed so much as a person and really come out of my shell. I've never. been so happy. I look at myself in the mirror now and I can't believe. it. 'My wife says I now. turn heads for the right reasons. There are so many things I can do now. that I would not do before.'

The credit portion of the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 did not affect the Czech Republic much, mostly due to its stable banking sector which has learned its lessons during a smaller crisis in the late 1990s and became much more cautious. As a fraction of the GDP, the Czech public debt is among the smallest ones in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, unlike many other post-communist countries, an overwhelming majority of the household debt - over 99% - is denominated in the local Czech currency. That's why the country wasn't affected by the shrunken money supply in the U.S. dollars. However, as a large exporter, the economy was sensitive to the decrease of the demand in Germany and other trading partners. In the middle of 2009, the annual drop of the GDP for 2009 was estimated around 3% or 4.3%, a relatively modest decrease. The impact of the economic crisis may have been limited by the existence of the national currency that temporarily weakened in H1 of 2009, simplifying the life of the exporters.

The annual drop of the GDP for 2009 was estimated around 3% or 4.3%, which was a relatively modest decrease compared to some other countries. This drop was primarily due to the decrease in demand from Germany and other trading partners, as the Czech economy heavily relies on exports.

Rock Lee is characterized by his distinctive appearance, featuring a bowl-cut hairstyle, thick eyebrows, and a green jumpsuit, which are elements inspired by the legendary martial artist, Bruce Lee.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: Walter Faxon (February 4, 1848 – August 10, 1920) was an American ornithologist and carcinologist. He was born at Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, where he grew up. He received three degrees from Harvard University. One of his greater ornithological achievements was demonstration that Brewster's warbler is a hybrid. Hypothesis: Walter Faxon was 80 years old when he died.","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the context. We need to find Walter Faxon's birth and death dates in the context to calculate his age at death. Relevant information from the context: - Walter Faxon was born on February 4, 1848. - He died on August 10, 1920. Step 2: Calculate the time between birth and death. We need to determine the number of years between 1848 and 1920, as well as the number of months and days between February 4 and August 10. Years: 1920 - 1848 = 72 years Months and days: From February 4 to August 10 = 6 months and 6 days Step 3: Adjust the age calculation based on the number of months and days. Since 6 months and 6 days is more than half a year, we can round up the age to the nearest year. In this case, Walter Faxon would be considered: 72 years + 1 (rounded up from 6 months and 6 days) = 73 years old at the time of his death. Step 4: Compare the calculated age to the hypothesis. The calculated age of 73 years old does not match the hypothesis that Walter Faxon was 80 years old when he died. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Review: vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence appears to be positive. The reviewer uses words such as \\"vibrant\\" and \\"colorful\\" which indicate an energetic and visually engaging experience. The term \\"semimusical rendition\\" suggests that the movie has musical elements, adding another layer of enjoyment for fans of the genre. It's essential to note that the reviewer uses adjectives like \\"vibrant\\" and \\"colorful\\", which signify that the movie has an abundance of life, excitement, or activity. These words are primarily used to praise the film's visual aspects by highlighting its striking colors and possibly the liveliness of its narrative or characters. Moreover, the term \\"semimusical rendition\\" implies that the movie may not be an entirely musical film but has some musical components. The use of this term suggests that the movie creatively incorporates aspects of musicals while maintaining its own unique identity, as the reviewer didn't label it strictly as a \\"musical.\\" This might attract audiences who enjoy musicals, along with those who appreciate innovative storytelling approaches. Considering the chosen words and phrases, the review most likely intends to express positivity and appreciation for the movie.

As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed. College student Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young, go to visit Peter Vincent, who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night, much to the chagrin of Charley. While visiting Peter's apartment Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes drawn to one of the four, the alluring Regine. Charley drives Alex back to her dorm and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. An upset Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's vampires, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's group, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth, a bug-eating servant of Regine, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs. Later that night, Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day, Charley talks to his psychiatrist, Dr. Harrison, who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there, however, he sees his friend Richie with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood.

And they will probably be friendly to people who talk nicely to them. Teachers also seem to get along better with children who take schoolwork seriously and prepare for class. And, just like any other human being, teachers like to be appreciated. The next time your teacher helps you solve a math problem or figure out a science project, say thank you with a smile.     Talking to Parents--Parents can be very supportive if their children ask for help. If you think there's something your parents can do to help you feel more comfortable around people, then ask them. Very often, parents want very much to help, but really don't know what to do. Pick a quiet time of the day and ask to talk. Tell them how you feel. Maybe they had the same trouble when they were kids.     Talking to Strangers--This is always a tough one. How do you deal with a neighbor, or the mail carrier? That often seems to cause arguments between kids and parents. The answer to these questions will vary from kid to kid, from parent to parent because all cultures are different. Some folks live in small towns where a hello to everyone is ok. Then there are kids who live in the city who may have been taught not to speak to anyone they don't know. If you're having trouble with this and always feel awkward in these kinds of situations, you might want to talk to your parents or a teacher about it.

Can we draw the following conclusion? There are mountains in north carolina","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that there are mountains in North Carolina based on the information provided. North Carolina is home to a diverse range of mountainous regions, especially the Appalachian Mountains, which encompass various sub-ranges such as the Great Smoky Mountains, the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Black Mountains. The Oconaluftee River Valley, as mentioned, is situated in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. The Great Smoky Mountains are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains and form the border between North Carolina and Tennessee. This mountain range is characterized by its dense forests, high peaks, and diverse wildlife. Some of the tallest peaks in the eastern United States are found in this area, including Clingmans Dome (6,643 feet above sea level), Mount Guyot (6,621 feet), and Mount LeConte (6,594 feet). The Great Smoky Mountains National Park encompasses over 800 square miles of this region, providing a sanctuary for plant and animal species and a space for outdoor enthusiasts to explore and appreciate the natural beauty. The Blue Ridge Mountains, found within the Appalachian Mountains, extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania and run through the western portion of North Carolina. Some of the highest peaks in this subrange include Grandfather Mountain (5,946 feet), Mount Mitchell (6,684 feet; the highest peak east of the Mississippi River), and Roan Mountain (6,286 feet). The Blue Ridge Parkway runs over 250 miles through North Carolina, offering scenic drives and access to hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities. The Black Mountains, another subrange of the Appalachian Mountains, are located in North Carolina as well and consist of rugged, thickly forested peaks. The highest point in this subrange is Mount Mitchell, which also happens to be the highest peak in the eastern United States. The Black Mountains are known for their rich biodiversity, with numerous rare and endangered plant and animal species found within the region. In conclusion, the presence of the Great Smoky Mountains, the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Black Mountains in North Carolina confirms the existence of mountains in the state. These mountain ranges offer a wealth or recreational opportunities, ecological diversity, and stunning natural landscapes for visitors and residents alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Auden ended in failure.\\"?","output":"If we assume the premise \\"But he did disprove, for an unimportant but magnificent moment, W. H. Auden's dictum that poetry makes nothing happen\\" to be true, it implies that there was a specific instance or moment in which the individual in question was able to demonstrate that poetry can, in fact, have an impact or cause something to happen. This moment may not have been significant in the grand scheme of things, but was still noteworthy and exceptional. Now, considering the hypothesis \\"His attempt to contradict W.H. Auden ended in failure,\\" we need to assess whether this statement aligns with the implications of the premise. Before we move on, it is essential to understand the context of W. H. Auden's dictum. Auden, a renowned poet, wrote in his elegy for another poet, W. B. Yeats, that \\"poetry makes nothing happen.\\" This line has been interpreted in various ways, but a common understanding is that Auden meant that poetry does not hold the power to bring about significant changes in the world. Given this understanding of Auden's dictum, the hypothesis is framed around the idea that the individual's attempt to contradict this notion ended in failure. Contradicting the dictum means that the individual tried to prove that poetry can result in meaningful changes, outcomes, or events. Therefore, if his attempt was successful, he would have shown that poetry can, in fact, make things happen. However, the premise previously established that the individual did manage to disprove Auden's dictum, albeit for an \\"unimportant but magnificent moment.\\" This statement asserts that, even if it was short-lived and not influential in the long term, the individual was successful in demonstrating the power of poetry to impact the world in some way. Therefore, if the premise is true, it does not entail the hypothesis \\"His attempt to contradict W.H. Auden ended in failure.\\" Instead, according to the premise, the individual's attempt to contradict Auden was successful during that specific moment. While it may not have been a major victory, it was, nevertheless, a moment in which Auden's dictum was contradicted, and as a result, the hypothesis does not follow from the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article in one sentence. His centre-right Fidesz has polled 45%, with most of the votes counted. A centre-left opposition alliance is trailing with 25%, while the far-right Jobbik party is credited with 21%. The Hungarian left has never fully recovered from its heavy defeat in the 2010 ballot, in which Mr Orban swept to power with a two-thirds majority. Sunday's election has been mainly fought over the state of the economy, correspondents say. \\"No doubt we have won,\\" Mr Orban told supporters gathered in the capital, Budapest, late on Sunday evening. \\"This was not just any odd victory. We have scored such a comprehensive victory, the significance of which we cannot yet fully grasp tonight.\\" He said the election results showed that Hungarians wanted to stay in the European Union, but with a strong national government. \\"I'm going to work every day so that Hungary will be a wonderful place,\\" he declared. Fidesz is predicted to win around 135 of the 199 seats in parliament. It now also seems likely that Jobbik will become the second-largest party in parliament, the BBC's Nick Thorpe reports from Budapest. Although the Socialist-led opposition is in second place, the five parties making up the alliance plan to form their own factions after the elections, our correspondent says. Observers say Jobbik's adoption of a softer image has paid dividends, as a recent opinion poll found leader Gabor Vona to be the most popular opposition politician. Fidesz supporters say Mr Orban's victory is a tribute to his leadership powers. But opposition parties have accused the prime minister throughout their campaign of undermining Hungarian democracy. They have also accused Mr Orban of curtailing civil liberties and harming free speech. Fidesz has insisted that reform was needed to complete the work of eradicating the legacy of Communism from the country, and reduce the budget deficit to below the EU's required 3% of gross domestic product. Mr Orban's populist and Eurosceptic approach has proven popular with many Hungarians. \\"The left had eight years to show what they can do, and they showed us all right,\\" he told Hungarian media on Saturday. \\"Why on Earth should we believe that the same people and the same parties would not do the same if given another opportunity?\\"","output":"Prime Minister Viktor Orban's centre-right Fidesz party won Hungary's parliamentary election by securing 45% of the votes, as the left struggled to recover from a heavy defeat in 2010, and the populist, Eurosceptic approach was well-received by many Hungarians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While shooting a scene about a traffic accident, Ben is told to focus his attention on Sally, Deirdre's sister, who helped the passengers after the double-decker bus they were on crashed. Sally is deeply insecure about her looks. She grows bitter when Deirdre flaunts her new boyfriend, Sam, a middle-aged bank manager who has left his wife of 14 years, Noeleen, leaving her to question her own self-worth as a woman and wife. John is utterly lost without Deirdre and is determined to win her back. He gets involved in an absurd plan along with Mick, the driver of the bus that crashed, and Lehiff. They kidnap Sam and force him to go to his bank to get money for a ransom. Things go awry when Sam, who has the money, is assaulted by an enraged Noeleen on the street and a couple of police officers appear. Mick and John flee the scene without their money. Mick, who lost his job after the bus crash, becomes obsessed with taking revenge on Philip, the boy who had lobbed the stone into the bus windscreen.

No Based on the premise, \\"They had 'a physical relationship' but it wasn't sexual,\\" it becomes clear that their relationship involved physical interactions but excluded any form of sexual activity.

There is nothing in the world more true than that. Old Man Coyote has the craftiest brain of all the little people of the Green Forest or the Green Meadows. Sharp as are the wits of old Granny Fox, they are not quite so sharp as the wits of Old Man Coyote. If you want to fool him, you will have to get up very early in the morning, and then it is more than likely that you will be the one fooled, not he. There is very little going on around him that he doesn't know about. But once in a while something escapes him. The coming of Paddy the Beaver to the Green Forest was one of these things. He didn't know a thing about Paddy until Paddy had finished his dam and his house, and was cutting his supply of food for the winter.  You see, it was this way: When the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind first heard what was going on in the Green Forest and hurried around over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest to spread the news, as is their way, they took the greatest pains not to even hint it to Old Man Coyote because they were afraid that he would make trouble and perhaps drive Paddy away. The place that Paddy had chosen to build his dam was so deep in the Green Forest that Old Man Coyote seldom went that way. So it was that he knew nothing about Paddy, and Paddy knew nothing about him for some time.  Answer this series of questions: 1. Is coyote creative? 2. Is anyone more creative than him? 3. who is he compared to? 4. who is smarter? 5. how can you trick him? 6. will it work? 7. how often does something get past him? 8. when has it happened? 9. like who has done it? 10. what did he do? 11. when did coyote find out? 12. who didn't want him to find out? 13. why? 14. how? 15. where is Paddy's dam? 16. would it be easy for coyote to find? 17. why? 18. what else was Paddy doing while making the dam? 19. where did the Merry little Breezes travel? 20. why?","output":"1. Yes, Old Man Coyote is creative. He uses his crafty brain to achieve his ends. 2. It is not mentioned if anyone is more creative than him, but he is described as very crafty and cunning. 3. He is compared to old Granny Fox, another cunning and smart animal in the Green Forest and the Green Meadows. 4. Old Man Coyote is considered smarter than old Granny Fox, as his wits are described to be sharper. 5. To trick Old Man Coyote, one would have to be up very early in the morning and plan exceedingly well. 6. Despite attempts to trick him, it is more likely that the one trying to fool Coyote would end up being fooled themselves. 7. Although Old Man Coyote is usually aware of his surroundings, something occasionally gets past him. 8. It happened when Paddy the Beaver arrived in the Green Forest and started building his dam and cutting his supply of food for the winter. 9. Paddy the Beaver was the one who unintentionally managed to keep his doings hidden from Old Man Coyote for some time. 10. Paddy chose a location deep in the Green Forest to build his dam, away from Old Man Coyote's usual paths. 11. The text does not specify when exactly Coyote found out about Paddy and his dam, but eventually, he did. 12. The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind did not want Old Man Coyote to find out about Paddy's activities. 13. They were afraid that Old Man Coyote would make trouble and potentially drive Paddy away from the Green Forest. 14. The Merry Little Breezes ensured that they wouldn't hint at the news of Paddy to Old Man Coyote as they went around spreading the news to others. 15. Paddy's dam is located deep in the Green Forest. 16. It would not be easy for Old Man Coyote to find Paddy's dam due to its location. 17. The location of Paddy's dam is deep within the Green Forest, in an area where Old Man Coyote seldom goes, making it difficult for him to stumble upon it. 18. While making the dam, Paddy was also cutting his supply of food for the winter to ensure that he had enough to eat. 19. The Merry Little Breezes traveled through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows to spread the news about Paddy's activities and keep it a secret from Old Man Coyote. 20. The Merry Little Breezes did so to protect Paddy the Beaver from potential harm, as they were afraid that Old Man Coyote might cause trouble or drive Paddy away from the Green Forest if he found out about Paddy's dam."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The stall between 2005 and 2008 marks a stark shift in the trend in abortions, which had peaked at 1.61 million in 1990 and then declined almost every year since until 2005, when it hit 1.21 million - the lowest level since 1976. \\"What we found was essentially no change,\\" said Rachel K. Jones, a senior research associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit reproductive health research center that gathers the most comprehensive data on abortion in the United States. \\"It seems the long-term decline in abortion has stalled.\\" The sudden plateau, which caused concern among anti-abortion activists and pro-choice advocates, raises the possibility that the decline could be reversing, though more data is needed to know for sure, said Jones, whose survey of nearly 1,800 providers is being published in the journal Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health. \\"It's kind of a wake-up call that we need to increase access to contraceptives services so we can continue to prevent unintended pregnancies and the decline in abortions can continue again,\\" she said. The survey, which has been conducted periodically since 1974 but had not been done since 2005, found the total number of procedures had crept up 0.5 percent by 2008 - from 1.206 million to 1.212 million. The abortion rate in 2008 rose 1 percent in 2008, to 19.6 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. That's after the rate had peaked in 1981 and had fallen nearly every year since until 2005, when it hit the lowest level since 1974 at 19.4. The survey did not gather data on the reasons for the shift. But other evidence supports the idea that the recent recession may have played a role - making it harder for women to afford contraceptives, leading to more unplanned pregnancies, and more women to decide they can't afford another child, Jones said. \\"One explanation is that women who were poor who found themselves with an unintended pregnancy in the middle of a recession who in other circumstances would have said 'Okay, I'll go ahead and have a baby' would just say, 'I just can't do this right now' and get an abortion,\\" she said. \\"That would slow down the decline.\\" An earlier survey from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had found no increase in contraceptive use between 2006 and 2008, Jones noted. At the same time, poor women are the most likely to seek abortions, and a 2008 Guttmacher survey found an increase in the proportion of poor women undergoing the procedure. Previous recessions did not have a major impact on the trend in the abortion rate, but those economic downturns were not nearly as severe, Jones said. Other observers agreed, saying women were making the painful economic calculus to skip a few routine bills to cover a 400 to 600 abortion rather than face supporting another child. \\"We hear from women who are selling possessions and forgoing paying certain bills in order to afford the abortion care they need,\\" said Vicki Saporta of the National Abortion Federation, which represents abortion providers. \\"Many of these women already have children and are struggling to care for the children they have and are very clear they can't afford to have another child.\\" Another factor may have been the stalling in the drop in pregnancies in teenage girls that occurred in the same period. \\"We had been seeing substantial declines in teen abortion rates since the early 1990s and those have been an important driver in the decline in abortion rates nationally,\\" Jones said. But others disagreed. Randall K. O'Bannon of the National Right-to-Life Committee argued that increased efforts to promote abortions, especially medical abortions using the drug known as RU-486, probably playing a greater role. \\"The abortion industry has been busy promoting its products,\\" O'Bannon said. \\"It's trying to change what the image of abortion is - like it's as safe and simple as taking a pill. That's certainly a major factor.\\" The survey, which was conducted in 2009 and 2010, found use of RU-486, also known as mifepristone, continued to increase, jumping 24 percent, from 161,000 to 199,000, to account for 17 percent of all abortions. Although that increase was enough to account for the stall, Jones said research suggests that the availability of RU-486 has not yet increased the overall number of women having abortions. While the overall abortion rate remained unchanged, there were significant shifts in individual regions and states . Generally, abortion rates were highest in the Northeast and West and lowest in the South and Midwest. But the rates also vary sharpy from state to state. For example, the District's abortion rate plummeted nearly 44 percent, tumbling from 54 to 30 per 1,000 women. The rate in Maryland fell 8 percent (31.5 to 29), while Virginia's rate increased 7 percent (16.5 to 17.6). The D.C. drop was probably because of two clinics closing, which could have contributed to the increase in Virginia as women sought abortions there instead, Jones said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about how the number of women getting abortions in the United States has stopped decreasing and has reached a stable point. This is surprising and concerning for people who both support and are against abortions because it had been going down for nearly 20 years. The article suggests that the recent recession, which is a time when people have less money, might be a reason for this change because it could make it harder for women to afford contraceptives and make them more likely to have unintended pregnancies. The article also mentions that there could be other factors causing this change, like how abortions are being promoted or changes in teenage pregnancy rates. Overall, the article is saying that we need to pay attention to why this is happening and try to improve access to contraceptives so the decline in abortions can start going down again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who were suspected of having a love affair during months of rehearsal? from the following article ?  The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.

Review: The Life and Time of Little Richard, as told by Little Richard, as produced and directed by Little Richard, was about as one sided as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but does have good writing, great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing Richard. All the music is by Little Richard, so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song. The movie covers his early childhood, carrys thru the formative years in music, the wild success and Richard's throwing it all away to praise the Lord. Its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles, whom opened for him. My main objection is that his outrageous, counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time. Some of his energy, which he still has, does not come across full force. He seemed tame, compared to what I remember of him at the time. The best scenes are Richard getting jilted by Lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing, to make the point about not having a decent place to change. If they had gotten into the \\"Bronze Liberace\\" as Richard use to refer to himself in interviews, then there's a story.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind.

Please answer the following question: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.  Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store. He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  Which temperature will result in faster decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","output":"Storing the cupcakes at 10° F will result in faster decay compared to storing them at 0° F.  Freezing is an effective way to preserve food because it slows down the rate of chemical reactions, including those responsible for spoilage and bacterial growth. Lower temperatures decrease the rate of these reactions and inhibit the growth of microorganisms, ensuring that the food remains fresher for a longer period. In the case of Robert's cupcakes, storing them at 0° F would be a better option because this lower temperature will reduce the rate of decay and microbial growth more effectively than storing them at 10° F. As a result, the cupcakes will stay fresh for a longer period when stored at 0° F."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner, making the case a possible homicide. Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was worried about his daughter's involvement in drugs, prostitution, and hardcore pornography and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that lifestyle.

But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange, but most of the time they break down in tears. Now a group of psychologists from Yale University in the US say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of restoring emotional balance. \\" _ seem to take place when people are unable to tolerate strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher, told The Telegraph. Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things -- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \\"I want to eat you up!\\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly. \\"We want a happy, middle spot. Extreme is not good. It's hard on our bodies,\\" Aragon told The Washington Post. There are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction. At an exciting concert, fans scream in horror at their idols. People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears. \\"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationship with others, and even how well people work together,\\" said Aragon. The psychologists then went further and claimed that the reverse was also true. Strong negative feelings may also bring out positive expressions.

Choices:  - hen house - painting - virginia - california - lion's den  The rationale to choose \\"virginia\\" as the answer is that:","output":"Virginia is the most logical answer for George to go hunting foxes because it is a region with a rich tradition of fox hunting and a suitable environment for the activity. Here's a detailed explanation for each of the choices: 1. Hen house: A hen house is a shelter for domesticated birds, which might be targeted by foxes in search of food. However, it is not a preferred place for hunting foxes, as these spaces are usually small and enclosed, making it difficult to have a proper fox hunting experience. 2. Painting: A painting is a visual artwork created using pigments on a surface, typically by applying the medium to a canvas or other support. Paintings often depict various subjects, including landscapes, people, animals, and events. While paintings could include foxes as subjects, they are not places where one could actually hunt them. 3. Virginia: Virginia is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States and offers a suitable environment for foxes and fox hunting. The state has a rich history of fox hunting, dating back to the colonial era. Virginia hosts many hunt clubs and offers ample opportunities for participating in the traditional sport with access to beautiful woodlands and rural landscapes. 4. California: While it is true that foxes can be found in California, the state is not as strongly associated with fox hunting as Virginia. Additionally, California faces certain restrictions, reduced public access to hunting areas, and a different culture around fox hunting than Virginia. Therefore, Virginia is a more suitable choice for George to indulge in his preferred activity. 5. Lion's den: A lion's den is a place where lions live, often referring to their natural habitat in the wild or an enclosed space in zoos or wildlife parks. Foxes and lions have completely different habitats and behaviors, which makes a lion's den an unlikely place to find foxes for hunting. Based on these reasons, \\"Virginia\\" is the most appropriate choice for George to go hunting foxes, considering its strong tradition of fox hunting, plentiful hunt clubs, and suitable landscapes and habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Victorian London, an unseen criminal begins masterminding his \\"perfect plot on paper\\" which starts with a robbery taking place and three cats stealing a pink diamond. Three constables spot them and give chase, but the cats escape to the rooftops and glide off into the night, giving the stolen diamond to a mysterious horseman. The next day, Dr. Watson rushes to 221B in Baker Street and informs his colleague Sherlock Holmes of the robbery. Holmes then calls his pet mouse Jerry to bring him a copy of the Times. Jerry heads out to buy it while encountering Tom on the way, who also has something for Holmes. Jerry returns to Holmes' flat and hands him the paper or what was left of it after the chase. Reading a letter Tom had given to them for the night, Holmes and Watson decide to go to the Bruce Nigel Theatre where a performer named Red is seen. Holmes is told that she is being blackmailed and Holmes suggests who the perpetrator might be – Professor Moriarty. Holmes deduces that the Star of Punjab, a diamond that is light sensitive to the light of a solar eclipse which was to happen the following day, is to be stolen by the mastermind of the blackmail. At the Punjab Embassy, Spike and Tyke are assigned to guard the Star of Punjab. Spike begins to teach Tyke how to be a good dog guard, but the three cats from the previous night steal the diamond while an unfocused Spike is not looking.

Article: Beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s, architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism, with architects like Charles Moore in the USA, Christian Norberg-Schulz in Norway, and Ernesto Nathan Rogers and Vittorio Gregotti in Italy, who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents. Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles. Robert Venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a \\"decorated shed\\" (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside), and upheld it against modernist and brutalist \\"ducks\\" (buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms).

Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group of larvae had fewer changes in their RNA sequence?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The original text in Turkish translates to the following in English: \\"Kosovo's first diplomatic envoys went to their posts in Albania, Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States on Sunday, October 19th.\\" This sentence talks about a significant event which took place on October 19th. On this day, Kosovo's initial group of diplomatic representatives traveled to their respective duty stations in various countries across the world.

The \\"first\\" diplomatic envoys represent the pioneers of diplomacy for any country, entrusted with the essential task of initiating, fostering, and sustaining relationships with other nations globally.  It's important to note that the placement of diplomats among various countries symbolizes a formal acceptance of mutual relations among the nations. With that action, Kosovo was not only engaging with these countries on a diplomatic level but also making a statement about its sovereign status as an independent and self-governing state.  The roles of these diplomatic envoys could be vast and varied. They might have been responsible for conducting negotiations, gathering and reporting information, promoting friendly relations, and protecting the interests of their home country to the maximum extent possible.  In the grand scheme, these diplomats might have laid the groundwork for broad-ranging cooperation and critical dialogues amongst these countries, potentially covering various sectors such as trade, education, culture, defense, and more.

The play isn't great to begin with, and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as Peploe doesn't decide how she wants to treat the material's theatrical origins (we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc.) and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you're watching a film, whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is breath-takingly poor: stage-y and plummy, it's as if she's playing the part via Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Only Fiona Shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but it's hard to watch a film for one performance alone, even if that performance is as light, truthful and entire as Shaw's.

As it turned out, the group was composed of members from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's dance troupe, who were in the process of filming a music video. Initially, the dancers feared that their activities would be forcibly halted by the police officer's presence. However, instead of shutting down their performance, Singh decided to engage in conversation with the group. As both parties familiarized themselves with each other, Singh decided to show off his own dance skills and \\"bust a move,\\" as reported by the Global News. People were delighted by the unanticipated turn of events and found Singh's willingness to join and dance alongside the troupe to be \\"amazing,\\" as per the Ottawa Citizen. A video of the jovial encounter was uploaded to Facebook, showing Constable Singh breaking it down with one of the dancers. The video soon went viral and has been shared more than 800,000 times. Singh's ability to dance so impressively didn't come out of nowhere. Before joining the police force, he was a member of his college's dance troupe. Furthermore, Singh and his team had the incredible opportunity to open for renowned rapper Rick Ross. This entertaining and wholesome incident showcases the importance of community engagement and the positive impact it can have on the public perception of police officers.

Context: Zoos are not my favorite places. I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

These products confuse some buyers, as they may think the \\"MP4\\" players simply mean they can do more than MP3. What is MP4?!  It is a multimedia container. It is not only used to store digital audio   and digital video streams, especially those of MPEG, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles   and pictures. As a most modern container format, it allows streaming over the Internet.  With the help of a piece of MP4 video equipment, you can change various programs such as MPEG to MP4, ASX to MP4, AVI to MP4 and so on, which can be done very quickly and easily without any effect on the sound quality.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What obstacles does Neighborhood Legal Services face?

One of the obstacles Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) faces is cultural isolation, especially in the Asian communities they are trying to help. This means that the people they want to help might have different traditions and ways of doing things that can make it harder for NLS to reach and assist them. Another obstacle mentioned is language, as many people in these communities might not speak English very well. NLS is trying to overcome these obstacles by hiring more lawyers who speak different Asian languages and understand their cultures better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects.

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  I am facing a new situation today: A science teacher is attempting to show his students how kinetic energy works in gases. In order to do so, he leaves the classroom with two beakers filled with the same type of gas. He goes to the kitchen and heats one beaker up on the stove, but does nothing to the other beaker. He then returns to the classroom and has the students examine the gases. The students observe that the kinetic in beaker G is higher than that of the gas in beaker R.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beaker did the teacher place on the stove? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the observations made by the students, we can deduce which beaker was placed on the stove by understanding the behavior of gases at different temperatures and the changes in their kinetic energies. As the background article explains, when a gas is heated, its Kelvin temperature increases, leading to an increase in the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This increase in kinetic energy causes the gas molecules to move faster and collide more forcefully with the walls of the container, resulting in higher pressure. Now, let's examine the situation with the science teacher and the two beakers filled with the same type of gas. The teacher heats one beaker on the stove and leaves the other beaker unheated. When the teacher returns to the classroom, the students observe that the kinetic energy in beaker G is higher than that of the gas in beaker R. Knowing that increased temperature leads to increased kinetic energy, we can infer that the beaker with the higher kinetic energy, beaker G, was the one that was heated on the stove. The gas in beaker G experienced an increase in temperature, resulting in more rapid and forceful movement of its gas molecules compared to those in beaker R. This increase in the kinetic energy and motion is consistent with the behavior described in the background article. Thus, the correct answer to the question, \\"Which beaker did the teacher place on the stove?\\" would be beaker G. The experiment effectively demonstrated the effect of temperature on the kinetic energy of gases to the students, as they were able to observe the differences in kinetic energy between the heated and unheated beakers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.

On a day in which the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd took the stand and Lloyd's mother again left the courtroom in tears, Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Friday had a warning for the jury. \\"I am not going to forbid you from watching the Super Bowl if that's something that's really important to you,\\" she said.

The correct answer is \\"Odin Lloyd and drove to a secluded area where he was shot and killed, Bomberg said.\\" because the passage is discussing the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez in connection with the death of Odin Lloyd. The other options mention unrelated individuals, places, or entities, which would not fit the context of the passage. These alternatives involve the judge, the court, the football team, and the news channel, all of which have no direct association with the murder and are thus incorrect choices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

Se tarkoittaa rautateiden vetoyksikköä, joka vetää junan vaunuja. Vetureita on erilaisia, kuten höyryveturit, dieselveturit ja sähköveturit. Vetureiden käyttö alkoi 1800-luvulla, ja niiden kehitys on jatkunut nykypäivään asti, jolloin monimutkaiset sähköveturit dominoivat rautatieliikennettä. Höyryveturit olivat ensimmäisiä käytettyjä vetureita, ja ne toimivat höyryn voimalla. Höyryn avulla saadaan aikaan mekaaninen liike, joka siirtyy veturin pyörille ja sitä kautta vaunuihin. Höyryveturit olivat suosittuja aina 1900-luvun puoliväliin asti, mutta niiden käyttö alkoi vähetä, kun diesel- ja sähköveturit kehitettiin. Dieselveturit puolestaan käyttävät dieselmoottoria voimanlähteenä. Dieselmoottori syöttää polttoainetta suihkutuspiirin kautta sylintereihin, jossa se syttyy itsestään korkean puristuspaineen myötä. Tämän prosessin seurauksena syntyy voimaa, joka siirtyy veturin pyörille ja vetää junavaunuja. Dieselvetureiden etuna on niiden suhteellinen itsenäisyys sähköverkosta, ja niiden käyttö on yhä suosittua erilaisissa maastoissa ja olosuhteissa. Sähköveturit saavat voimansa sähköverkosta, joka tavallisesti tulee yläpuolella kulkevien sähköjohtojen kautta. Sähkövetureissa on voimalähde, joka muuntaa sähköenergian mekaaniseksi energiaksi, joka siirtyy junan pyörille. Sähkövetureiden etuihin kuuluvat ympäristöystävällisyys, alhaisempi melutaso ja usein parempi energiatehokkuus kuin dieselvetureissa. Nykypäivänä sähköveturit ovat yleisiä erityisesti Euroopassa ja Aasiassa. Yksi mielenkiintoinen kehityssuunta vetureissa on hybriditekniikka, jossa yhdistetään esimerkiksi diesel- ja sähkömoottorien ominaisuudet. Tämä mahdollistaa joustavamman käytön eri rataosuuksilla ja olosuhteissa. Myös vetyä polttoaineena käyttävät veturit ovat olleet esillä viime vuosina, ja ne voivat tarjota entistä ympäristöystävällisemmän vaihtoehdon rautateiden liikenteeseen. Kaiken kaikkiaan veturi on junaliikenteen keskeinen elementti, jonka avulla junavaunut saadaan liikkeelle ja matkustajat sekä rahti kulkeutuvat paikasta toiseen. Vetureiden kehitys jatkuu edelleen, ja tulevaisuudessa saatetaan nähdä yhä tehokkaampia ja ympäristöystävällisempiä ratkaisuja junaliikenteeseen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Napoleon maintained strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing what needed to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, \\"Give me lucky generals,\\" aware that \\"luck\\" comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer argues that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805-06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility. By the Russian campaign in 1812, however, Napoleon seems to have lost his verve. With crisis after crisis at hand, he rarely rose to the occasion. Some historians have suggested a physical deterioration, but others note that an impaired Napoleon was still a brilliant general.

It's important to note that this information was pointed out during a panel discussion on affirmative action policies and demonstrates an unintended effect, which has led to the underrepresentation of historic African Americans (i.e., descendants of American slaves) at Harvard University.

Colonial Delays Restart to Sunday While Pipe Segment Replaced Colonial Pipeline Co. has delayed until Sunday the expected restart of the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, which was shut earlier this week by an explosion and fire in Alabama. Colonial aims to restore service on the main gasoline pipeline, known as Line 1, Sunday afternoon, one day later than originally expected, it said in an online statement. The company earlier said work crews made “substantial progress” Wednesday night to facilitate removing product from a portion of the 1.3 million-barrel-a-day line, which will allow them to extinguish a fire that’s burned since the blast Monday. After all fuel is removed, the damaged section will be replaced with a 36-inch-diameter pipe as a permanent repair. “Colonial’s team on-site is constantly reassessing our timeline for restoration of service on Line 1,” the company said in the statement on its website at 11:30 p.m. New York time on Thursday. Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday traded down 0.4 percent at 1.4184 a gallon as of 12:38 p.m. in Singapore, extending losses after closing Thursday at a one-month low. Prices have pared gains since jumping the most in almost eight years after trading reopened following the blast. The blast took out service on one line of a system that brings gasoline, jet fuel and diesel more than 5,000 miles from refineries in Houston to storage facilities near New York City. Colonial Pipeline, which is owned by a group that includes subsidiaries of Koch Industries Inc. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, supplies about half of the refined products used on the East Coast. This week’s events followed a spill in September that left the line out of service for 12 days. So far about 4 million barrels, or 168 million gallons, of gasoline have been shut in. The second line, which delivers diesel and sometimes crosses with Line 1, was closed for several hours this week. Colonial’s inspection of Line 2 showed no effect from the blast. Nationwide retail gasoline prices have risen 1.2 cents a gallon to 2.218 since Monday’s interruption on Colonial. The pipeline makes shipments of gasoline in five-day cycles to Southeastern states that are otherwise cut off from access to refineries that produce motor fuel. A batch of regular conventional gasoline left Monday from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to a Colonial shipping schedule. Supplies to markets in Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia are at risk when this line goes down, said Andy Milton, senior vice president of supply and distribution at Mansfield Oil Co., a fuel supplier based in Gainesville, Georgia. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Colonial Pipeline Co. has delayed the restart of the largest US fuel pipeline until Sunday, following an explosion and fire in Alabama earlier this week. The company plans to restore service on the main gasoline pipeline by extinguishing the fire and then replacing the damaged section with a 36-inch-diameter pipe as a permanent repair. The pipeline delivers gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel over 5,000 miles from Houston refineries to storage facilities near New York City.

Answer a question about this article: Despite their usurpation of imperial authority, the Fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy. There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Two types of phonetic Japanese script: katakana, a simplified script that was developed by using parts of Chinese characters, was abbreviated to hiragana, a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely Japanese. Hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan's famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in Kagerō Nikki by \\"the mother of Fujiwara Michitsuna\\", The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon and The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu. Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored yamato-e, Japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid- and late Heian periods, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day. What was the name of the cursive script that gave expression to spoken words?","output":"The name of the cursive script that gave expression to spoken words in Japan is hiragana. Developed as a simplified and more accessible form of written language, hiragana allowed for greater expression in vernacular literature, particularly for court women who did not receive training in Chinese like their male counterparts. This script played a significant role in the flourishing of Japan's famous vernacular literature, as exemplified by works such as Kagerō Nikki, The Pillow Book, and The Tale of Genji."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What was at stake in the election??\\" is in \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives.

Usage: Based on the above understanding, the pronoun 'her' looks more likely to referring to 'Nellie'. So the answer in this case gets classified under 'B'. If 'her' seemed to be referring to 'Harriet', it would be 'A'. If it didn't seem to refer to either candidate, the response would be 'Neither'.

Let's break down the sentence for a more in-depth analysis. 1. \\"Which\\": This is an interrogative determiner that is used to introduce the question and inquire about a specific selection from a set of items or choices, in this case, pictures. 2. \\"pictures of himself\\": This is a noun phrase that refers to a set of pictures where Chris is the subject being depicted. By using the reflexive pronoun \\"himself,\\" it implies that Chris is both the one being depicted in the images and the one viewing them. 3. \\"did Chris see\\": In English, when forming questions with a past participle like \\"see,\\" we invert the usual subject-verb order to emphasize the interrogative nature. Using \\"did\\" as an auxiliary verb, we have \\"did\\" followed by the subject \\"Chris\\", and then the base form of the verb \\"see.\\" This construction indicates a question about a past event. 4. \\"in the gallery\\": This is a prepositional phrase providing context and location for the event in question. \\"In\\" is the preposition, and \\"the gallery\\" is the object of the preposition. It tells us where Chris saw the pictures of himself. Overall, the sentence is linguistically acceptable and adheres to the standard rules and conventions of English grammar.

They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: When did President Trump announce his plans to suspend military exercises? Options: - Before he met with Kim Jong Un in August   - After he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th   - not enough information   - After the Foreign Minister announce its denuclearization commitment === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"After he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","output":"The hypothesis \\"I think teaching is supposed to be a prestigious job.\\" true?\\" cannot be directly determined as true or false based on the premise, as the premise presents a subjective viewpoint towards the status and treatment of teachers in a female-dominated field. However, we can break down the premise and hypothesis in order to provide a more in-depth analysis. The premise suggests that the prestige of being a teacher is, according to the speaker, \\"pretty nil.\\" This statement indicates that the speaker holds a somewhat negative opinion about the respect and importance given to the teaching profession. The reason provided for this lack of prestige is that the teaching field is predominantly filled with women, and as a result, society treats them poorly. This sentiment reflects the presence of sexism and the undervaluing of female-dominated professions. Now, looking at the hypothesis, \\"I think teaching is supposed to be a prestigious job,\\" we can assume that the speaker believes teaching is a profession that should hold a high level of importance and respect in society. Teaching indeed plays a fundamental role in shaping the minds of future generations and providing them with the knowledge and skills needed to lead successful lives. With this understanding, the hypothesis acknowledges that teaching should be a prestigious job, but the premise suggests the current state of prestige is low due to gender biases. There is a disconnect between what is expected and the reality, thus creating a complex answer to the question. It is essential to consider various factors, such as cultural, historical, and societal perspectives, when evaluating the prestige of a profession. In conclusion, the answer to whether the hypothesis \\"I think teaching is supposed to be a prestigious job.\\" is true cannot be definitively determined as either yes or no based on the given premise. It does, however, present an interesting discussion on the potential influence of sexism on the prestige and respect given to professions such as teaching that are predominantly female-dominated. The hypothesis recognizes the importance of teaching and suggests it is supposed to be prestigious, while the premise illustrates a different reality based on the speaker's perception."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: USDA draws the line on food stamps, rules against medical marijuana deductions It's the last dance with Mary Jane for states that had been illegally allowing food stamp recipients to claim deductions for medical marijuana. The Department of Agriculture last month sent out a memo ordering states to stop permitting the practice. Though 18 states currently allow medical marijuana use in some capacity, it remains illegal under federal law. And until recently, at least a few states were allowing food stamp users to deduct the cost of their medical marijuana in order to meet the income eligibility requirements. For instance, a family of four under USDA guidelines must earn less than 1,863 a month to qualify for food stamps. In limited cases, families were deducting the cost of their medical marijuana every month to bring their monthly income within that limit. That's a no-no, Lizbeth Silbermann, director of the USDA program development division, wrote in the memo last month. \\"FNS is now reaffirming its long standing policy that a household may not utilize the SNAP medical deduction for the cost of any substance considered illegal under Federal law,\\" she wrote. SNAP stands for Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Silbermann called out violators, though not by name. \\"It has come to FNS' attention that some State agencies are allowing elderly or disabled households to deduct the cost of medicinal marijuana from their income for SNAP purposes,\\" she wrote. The states -- which include Maine, Oregon and New Mexico -- had been allowing the deductions under a 2008 law that permits \\"allowable medical expenses\\" to be deducted for elderly or disabled recipients. Marijuana, though, does not qualify as allowable, Silbermann wrote, warning that states must \\"cease this practice immediately\\" or face penalties. USDA spokeswoman Alyn Kiel confirmed to FoxNews.com that the states have since discontinued the practice and come into compliance. She said the deduction was not widely used though it had been on the books. Medical marijuana laws and enforcement across the country continue to be in flux. While the feds have cracked down on the practice, Los Angeles moved last month to ban the pot shops until the state's high court rules. The USDA memo came as the department faces regular criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill for allegedly encouraging food stamp enrollment. The food stamp rolls have swelled since the recession, growing roughly 40 percent since 2009. As of April, more than 46 million people were in the program, which costs 80 billion a year.

Paul Aurelian was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years , after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors , which suggests several Pauls have been mixed up . Gilbert Hunter Doble thought he might be the same man as Saint Paulinus of Wales .  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.  - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics.

The shocking and sudden departure of Thomas Staggs as Walt Disney Company’s chief operating officer Monday has blown open the race to succeed Bob Iger atop the entertainment giant. It likely means that for the first time since the 1980s, Disney will look outside its ranks for a new leader to guide the company through an era of tremendous changes in the entertainment landscape.      “For the first time in memory they’re going to go outside for a CEO,” said Laura Martin, an analyst with Needham & Company. “That’s a big thing. Given the unique culture of the Walt Disney Company it was widely expected that a successor to Bob Iger had to come from within.”      “Wall Street doesn’t like uncertainty and hiring someone from outside after they’ve jettisoned the heir apparent adds uncertainty,” she added.      In recent years, all signs have pointed to Staggs as the man waiting in the wings to assume Iger’s mantle. Over more than two decades, he meticulously rose through the ranks from the strategic planning department to CFO to head of the Parks and Resorts division.      Investors responded negatively to his exit, pushing Disney’s stock down 1.70% in after market trading to 97.05. The difficulty with finding someone to fill Iger’s shoes is that the Disney job requires a variety of expertise. Its vast holdings include gaming, film, television, theme parks, and merchandising.      Related Movie Theaters Bounce Back: What's Behind the 2018 Rebound Box Office: 'Mary Poppins Returns' Pockets 4.8 Million on Opening Day      “Its breadth of activities in media and entertainment are very broad,” said Hal Vogel, a media analyst. “No one is an expert in everything, but the next leader has to have experience in a lot of different types of businesses.”      In the aftermath of the Staggs announcement, speculation swirled that Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who is already a Disney board member, might be an attractive successor. At 46, she would be a young enough to guide the company for decades, and has the Silicon Valley bona fides to help Disney adapt to the digital era.      There are a number of other external candidates who might fit that bill. 21st Century Fox executive vice chairman Chase Carey, having successfully helped to guide that entertainment company through one turnover in leadership, might be willing to jump ship to a rival. He is steeped in the film, broadcast and cable businesses that help drive Disney’s bottom line. Likewise, Peter Chernin, the man who Carey replaced atop what was then News Corp., has run herd across a sprawling entertainment conglomerate in the past and is a known quantity with the investment community.      There’s also a chance that CBS chief Leslie Moonves could find himself in the market for a new perch given the uncertainty surrounding the future of Sumner Redstone’s Viacom and CBS Corp. holdings. One truly outside-the-box possibility might be to buy DreamWorks Animation and install its founder Jeffrey Katzenberg in the corporate suite. His history with the house that Mickey built is a complex and fraught one — the psychological stuff of Greek dramas.      The rise of streaming services and online forms of entertainment have soured investors on companies like Disney that rely heavily on the pay television business for their profits. As cable loses subscribers that threatens the financial underpinnings of ESPN, the sports channel widely considered to be one of the crown jewels of Disney’s holdings. That means that the company cannot wait long before they signal that they have figured out the next generation of leadership.      “They have a real challenge in front of them with no easy answers,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. “The need someone who can help figure out what appears to be significant changes in the multi-channel landscape.”      Inside the walls of the company’s Burbank headquarters, the list of candidates narrows. Pixar head John Lasseter is credited with reviving the studio’s animation division, but he may not want to abandon the creative side of the business for the stresses of meeting quarterly earnings projections. Alan Horn, currently overseeing the movie division, has the steady hand needed to keep the company on track and years spent in the trenches at Time Warner’s Warner Bros. studio. At 73, however, he would probably be seen as a transitional candidate. Two names that aren’t being considered, according to insiders, are Disney Media Networks Co-Chairman Ben Sherwood and former CFO Jay Rasulo, the man Staggs pushed out of the line to replace Iger.      “Internally this sets up a horse race, but I’m not sure who the horses are,” said Vogel.      There’s also the chance that Staggs’ exit sets the stage for Iger, who has already been at the helm for over a decade, to extend his contract between its 2018 termination date. That might postpone the inevitable shakeup atop one of the biggest companies in the entertainment space, although it won’t delay it indefinitely. ||||| Succession planning at the world’s largest media company fell into disarray on Monday as Tom Staggs, Walt Disney Co.’s chief operating officer and the heir apparent to Chief Executive Robert Iger, unexpectedly said he would step down.

If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.  and the situation: Italy had two distinct regions.

Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.

My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

The only catch – the interview is set to take place on Sebastian's private jet, mid-flight. Against the backdrop of a ticking clock, Charlie must navigate a web of obstacles that threaten to leave him grounded forever. The movie opens with Charlie McCoy, an up-and-coming journalist working tirelessly at his small-town newspaper. He's been researching the life of Sebastian Hawke, a tech giant who has just announced his retirement. Then, an unexpected call from Sebastian's secretary presents Charlie with the golden opportunity: an invitation for a one-on-one interview with the man himself. Overjoyed, Charlie prepares meticulously for the interview, knowing it can be the turning point in his career. However, when the day arrives, a series of unfortunate events unfold that place Charlie in a race against time. First, Charlie's alarm fails to go off, resulting in him waking up late. Then, his car doesn't start. Desperate not to miss his chance, he borrows his roommate's bicycle and rides to the airport. En-route to the airport, Charlie sustains a flat tire. He frantically tries to fix it but soon realizes the tire is beyond repair. Time is running out, and Charlie decides to ditch the bike and run the remaining distance on foot. As if his morning couldn't get any worse, Charlie accidentally falls into a construction zone, ripping his suit and injuring his arm. He is forced to trudge onward, battered, bleeding, and disheveled. When Charlie finally reaches the airport, the plane is already preparing for takeoff. Refusing to give up, he leaps over the boarding gate and sprints towards the plane, losing his belongings along the way. At the last possible second, the airplane's door is about to close, but Charlie manages to slip aboard just in time. Despite having lost all of his notes, equipment, and pride, Charlie gathers himself and faces Sebastian Hawke for the career-defining interview. Though rattled, Charlie finds solace in Sebastian's understanding and warm demeanor. The two have a heartfelt, insightful conversation about life, adversity, and determination. Sebastian shares his own experiences and story of perseverance, and their conversation goes deeper than a standard interview. The Flight of Destiny not only propels Charlie's career forward, but it serves as a testament to his unbreakable spirit and determination in the face of great adversity. The film delves into the themes of resilience, ambition, and the importance of seizing opportunities before they slip away."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Final Cut Context: In this futuristic tale, Alan Hakman (Robin Williams) witnesses the death of his childhood friend who had fallen off a plank of wood in the abandoned building in which they were playing. Flash to the present, and chips called \\"Zoe\\" are inserted into the brain at birth and record a person's entire life; when the person dies, the video is edited and shown at the funeral. Video editor (\\"cutter\\") Alan Hakman edits the recordings of people's lives according to the wishes of the subject's family, interviewing the person's family members to get an idea of what to look for in the recordings. Of course, in the case of some unscrupulous people, the bad parts are left out, but the entire recording of a person's life is therefore subject to scrutiny. So, in some cases, Hakman was knowingly burying the bad and highlighting the good. As a result, Alan is turned into a cold megalomaniac, but things change when he stumbles across a subject's memory of his friend, who he thought was dead. In searching for a record of his friend's Zoe chip, he finds none, as only 20% of all people have the implants. What he does find is a record of his own implant, of which he was unaware. He goes about accessing the memory, which shows that Alan's friend was still breathing, and the \\"blood\\" Alan thought he remembered stepping in as he was leaving the building turned out to be paint. Meantime, the Zoe chip of his subject is destroyed during a confrontation in his office. Confronted by activists who want his subject's life opened to all, Alan attempts to flee because his memory chip recorded what he saw of the subject's life, but is shot and killed by the activist, who justifies his actions, hence Alan was not killed in vain.

Woodland had two nearby fish hatcheries. Pine hatchery had great result the past few years because they found a way to reduce ammonia water toxicity. Spruce hatchery has big ammonia toxicity problems and hadn't find a way to remediate them.  Which hatchery found fewer fish with poor growth?  Hint: Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.

Syria: Another day, another massacre Apr 19, 2011 04:07 PM EDT Reports are coming in of yet another episode in which Syrian security forces have opened fire on a crowd of peaceful protestors. Which raises the question: What will it take to move Western democracies to respond to the serial slaughters of civilians by the regime of Bashar al Assad? The latest bloodshed took place Tuesday morning, this time in the city of Homs, where thousands of people had occupied a central square Monday night, pitched tents and vowed to remain until their demands for political change were met. This was an act of extraordinary courage, since at least a dozen people had been killed Sunday in the city of 700,000 by the security forces. And it appears to have prompted another massacre. Information is fragmentary, because Syria has prohibited foreign journalists from entering the country and done its best to censor the Internet. But reports from residents gathered by the BBC and a video posted on YouTube indicate that security forces stormed the square in the early morning hours, firing on the crowd with automatic weapons. \\"Listen to the shooting,\\" once caller told the BBC. \\"Can you hear it? It's hammering on us like rain.” The death toll was uncertain, though one BBC correspondent was told eight had died. Mass shootings of civilians by security forces are becoming a near daily event in Syria. In the southern town of Daraa, where the protest movement began last month, there have been multiple massacres, including one on April 8 in which gunmen opened up on a crowd marching with olive branches, killing 27. There have been similar episodes in the city of Banias and in several nearby villages. And these are just the ones that human rights groups have been able to document. All together, considerably more than 200 people have been killed by the regime. The government mixes its repression with empty promises of change: Hours after the latest shootings Tuesday it announced that it was lifting a decades-old emergency law. But opening fire on crowds was not permitted even under emergency rule. There is no indication that it will stop now--unless the regime is toppled, or comes under severe international pressure. In nearly every instance where state-sponsored murder on this scale has taken place in recent years, the United States and other democracies have reacted strongly. Uzbekistan’s massacre of protestors in the city of Andijon in 2005 led to a rupture of relations with Washington and the European Union. And NATO has intervened in Libya to protect civilians from Moammar Gaddafi. Yet the response to Assad’s bloodshed has been limited to rhetoric. President Obama called the shootings in Daraa “abhorrent” and a White House statement said last week’s attack on Banias was “outrageous.” But the administration has refrained from taking even diplomatic measures to express its dissatisfaction, such as withdrawing the U.S. ambassador in Damascus. It has failed to bring Syria’s case before the UN Human Rights Council--not to speak of the UN Security Council. Syria, mind you, is not a friend of the United States. It is Iran’s closest ally in the Arab world, and a sponsor of the Hezbollah and Hamas militias. For years it provided a transit route for suicide bombers headed to Iraq in order to kill American soldiers. It tried to secretly build a nuclear reactor with the help of North Korea. Yet even when faced with extraordinary human rights crimes--the repeated gunning down of unarmed protestors--the Obama administration remains passive. At first this response was puzzling. Then it looked badly misguided. Now it has become simply unconscionable. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In 2011, in Syria, there were reports of security forces hurting peaceful protestors who wanted political change.

This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which wave has higher frequency, wave A or wave B?  David is experimenting with electromagnetic waves. He has four different waves to study, wave A, wave B, wave C, and wave D. In wave A, distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves is greater than that of wave B. In wave C, the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given time is greater than that of wave D.  Hint: Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer the question, we need to determine which wave has a higher frequency, wave A or wave B, based on the provided information about their wavelengths. Given information: - Wave A: greater distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves compared to wave B. - Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. Step 1: Analyze the relationship between wavelengths and frequencies. The given information states that shorter wavelengths correspond to higher frequencies. Since wave A has a greater distance between corresponding points than wave B, it means wave A has a longer wavelength. Step 2: Apply the relationship to find the wave with the higher frequency. According to the relationship provided, shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies. Therefore, the wave with the shorter wavelength will have the higher frequency. Conclusion: Since wave B has a shorter wavelength than wave A, wave B has a higher frequency. The answer to this question is: Wave B has a higher frequency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.  I am facing a new situation today: Drought is major concern in the Midwest. To confront the problem scientists are trying to develop drought-resistant crops. To that end, they took a plant that was not exposed to drought. They labeled it as plant A. Then they took a similar plant, and repeatedly exposed it to drought. They labeled it as plant B. They wanted to find out what makes a plant drought-resistant.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which plant there would be more water loss, plant A or plant B? The answer is:","output":"Plant A would experience more water loss than Plant B. This is because Plant B has been repeatedly exposed to drought conditions, allowing it to develop a strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use by changing the regulation of its stomata and hydraulic safety margin.

Genetically modified plants with new characteristics have been produced through genetic engineering methods. What impacts have resulted from the use of genetically modified plants?  Your answer:","output":"The use of genetically modified (GM) plants has brought about various impacts on agriculture, the environment, the economy, and human health. These impacts can be both positive and negative, and the overall effect of GM plants is still a topic of debate for researchers, governments, and the general public. 1. Agricultural Impacts: Positive: a) Increased crop yield: Genetic modifications have led to increased crop yield through traits such as pest resistance, herbicide tolerance, and stress resistance. Higher crop yield enables farmers to produce more food to meet rising demands. b) Improved nutritional value: Some genetically modified plants have enhanced nutritional content, such as vitamin-enriched rice that contains beta-carotene (Golden Rice), which can help combat malnutrition in developing countries. c) Pest and disease resistance: Genetically modified crops, such as Bt cotton and Bt corn, produce their own pesticides, protecting plants from pests and diseases, and reducing the need for chemical pesticides. d) Drought, flood, and salinity tolerance: GM plants can be developed with increased tolerance to environmental stresses, such as drought, flooding, or high salinity conditions, resulting in more resilient crops for harsh environments. Negative: a) Crossbreeding and contamination concerns: There is the possibility of unintentional crossbreeding between GM crops and wild relatives, which may lead to undesirable or unexpected genetic traits becoming widespread in the environment. b) Resistance development in pests and weeds: Overreliance on pest-resistant GM crops may lead to the evolution of resistance in pests and weeds, creating new problems for managing insects and weeds in the agriculture sector. 2. Environmental Impacts: Positive: a) Reduced chemical pesticide usage: Due to the use of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant GM plants, fewer chemical pesticides are needed, resulting in a reduced environmental footprint and lower toxicity levels in the ecosystem. Negative: a) Potential harm to non-target organisms: There is concern that GM crops could have unintended consequences on non-target organisms, such as the decline of Monarch butterflies due to Bt corn pollen spreading to milkweed plants. b) Loss of biodiversity: The introduction of GM crops can impact the genetic diversity of traditional crop varieties and lead to the loss of locally adapted landraces, affecting the overall agricultural biodiversity. 3. Economic Impacts: Positive: a) Increased profits for farmers: Using GM crops can lower production costs for farmers by reducing the need for pesticides, labor input, and other expenses. In some cases, this leads to higher profitability for the farmers. b) Reduced reliance on imports: For some countries, adopting GM technology can decrease their dependence on food and feed imports, helping improve their national food security. Negative: a) Corporate influence and monopoly: Large multinational agrochemical companies dominate the GM seed industry, leading to concerns regarding corporate control over the food chain and the reduction of seed diversity in the hands of farmers. b) Cost burden on small-scale farmers: Small-scale farmers may struggle to afford the high costs of GM seeds and associated technology, perpetuating the cycle of debt and poverty in some areas. 4. Human Health Impacts: Positive: a) Potential benefits through improved nutrition: GM crops can be designed to provide increased nutritional content and potentially address malnutrition in regions where access to diverse food sources is limited. Negative: a) Uncertainty regarding long-term health effects: While there is a broad scientific consensus that GM crops currently on the market are safe for human consumption, public concerns remain about potential long-term health effects that have not been extensively studied. In summary, genetically modified plants have brought about a wide range of impacts, some of which are positive and beneficial, while others raise concerns and potential risks. The balance of these impacts may vary depending on the specific GM crop, technology, and the socio-economic context in which it is deployed. As the use of GM plants continues to expand, ongoing research, regulation, and monitoring are essential to ensure their safe and responsible use and to maximize the potential benefits while minimizing potential risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Spruce hatchery has big ammonia toxicity problems and hadn't find a way to remediate them.  Hint: Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment. The answer to this question is:","output":"Pine hatchery found fewer fish with poor growth due to their successful efforts in reducing ammonia water toxicity, compared to Spruce hatchery, which has big ammonia toxicity problems and hasn't found a way to remediate them. As mentioned in the paragraph, ammonia toxicity can cause poor growth and other issues in fish, so the hatchery with reduced ammonia toxicity (Pine hatchery) would have fewer fish with poor growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first quarter the Cardinals trailed early as kicker John Carney nailed a 31-yard field goal, followed by QB Drew Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. The Cardinals replied with kicker Jay Feely making a 37-yard field goal, followed by OT Levi Brown recovering a fumble and returning it 2 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter the Cardinals replied and took the lead when Feely got a 44-yard field goal, followed the 4th quarter by Feely's 29-yard field goal. Then FS Kerry Rhodes recovered a fumble and ran 27 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The lead was broken down with Brees making a 35-yard TD pass to WR Robert Meachem, but the Cardinals managed to pull away when Brees' pass was intercepted by CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and returned 28 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. With the win, Arizona went into their bye week at 3-2. Question: How many total yards did Feely have? Answer:","output":"To calculate the total yards attributed to Jay Feely, we must consider the field goal distances he made successfully during the game. 1. Made a 37-yard field goal 2. Made a 44-yard field goal 3. Made a 29-yard field goal To find the total yards, we add the distances of each field goal: 37 yards + 44 yards + 29 yards = 110 yards Therefore, Jay Feely had 110 total yards in field goals during the game against the Saints."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kanye’s West's Been Troubled 'Since Halloween': Source When Kanye West was hospitalized for exhaustion on Nov. 21, rumors swirled about the state of his mental health. West, 39, had been taken to the hospital by the Los Angeles Fire Department after police had responded to a 911 call placed by his doctor. But according to a source close to the rapper, there were signs of trouble as early as Halloween. “He wasn’t making a lot of sense when he talked, and he was texting a lot of strange stuff to people,” says the source. “Not dangerous, but he just didn’t make a lot of sense.” “Part of loving Kanye is that he sometimes is talking on a different level from you, and you just listen,” the source continues. “But this was a lot more alarming.” According to the source, West would text and call around the clock. “When Kanye gets like this, he doesn’t sleep. So you’d wake up to like 20 texts. The more tired he got from not sleeping, the less sense he was making. He wasn’t in a good head space.” It had clearly been a difficult patch for West. Two months before his breakdown, wife Kim Kardashian West had suffered a traumatic experience in which she was robbed at gunpoint and had millions of dollars worth of jewelry stolen from her in Paris. In November, the source says, he was dealing with the anniversary of his mother’s death. “The pressure had gotten to him and he didn’t handle it well,” says the source. “He made himself exhausted. But [the exhaustion] was a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself.” As the couple navigates this tough time, the source says that the rapper remains devoted to his family. “Kanye loves Kim very much, and he adores the kids,” says the source. “He would take a bullet for them. They’re his whole world. If [the family] can get through this, they’ll be so much stronger. I want them to be happy, and I think they will be happier together than they would be apart.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Kanye West's mental health struggles and his hospitalization due to exhaustion on November 21. It discusses the signs of trouble that began as early as Halloween, with the rapper not making much sense when he spoke and sending strange texts to people. The source reveals that West's sleepless nights, stress from Kim Kardashian's traumatic Paris robbery, and the emotional impact of his mother's death anniversary all contributed to his exhaustion. Despite these challenges, the article highlights West's devotion to his family and the hope that they'll grow stronger together through this difficult period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who designed the national flag of south africa?","output":"The national flag of South Africa was designed by Frederick Brownell, a former South African State Herald. The flag was adopted on April 27, 1994, which coincided with the first democratic elections in South Africa and the end of apartheid, ushering in a new era of hope, healing, and unity for the country. Frederick Brownell was a well-respected vexillographer (a person who designs flags) and played an important role in the design and creation of several national flags, including those of Namibia and Zimbabwe. In early 1994, Brownell was tasked with the challenging responsibility of designing the new South African national flag amidst considerable time pressure. The unique design of the South African flag came about through an extensive collaborative process involving public input, various design submissions, and guidance from a committee appointed to oversee the selection and creation of the new national symbols. The flag features a horizontal bicolour of red and blue bands, with a green Y-shaped band (known as a pall) running from the bottom left (hoist side) towards the upper fly side and separating the red and blue bands. The red band is on the top and the blue band is on the bottom, and the pall touches the edges of the flag at its widest points. The red and blue bands are further outlined with narrow white bands. On the left side of the flag, the green pall converges with a black triangle on top and a gold triangle on the bottom, both equilateral. The design and colors of the South African flag are symbolic and carry deep meanings representing the diverse history and culture of the nation. The black, green, and gold colors are inspired by the African National Congress (ANC) flag, one of the major political parties in South Africa. The red, white, and blue colors are derived from the Boer Republics' flags (Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Union Jack), representing the Dutch and British colonial history of the country. The Y-shaped pall signifies the convergence of various cultural backgrounds into a unified whole, reflecting the diverse South African society's journey towards unity. The overall design symbolizes the nation's aspirations to move forward, leaving the tumultuous past behind and embracing the promise of a better future for all its citizens. In summary, the national flag of South Africa was designed by Frederick Brownell, a renowned vexillographer, who masterfully combined various colors and symbols to create a unique and meaningful design signifying the beginning of a new chapter in South Africa's history – one marked by unity, healing, and hope for a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In his tent on the beach, Zurga notes that the storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir (\\"L'orage est calmé\\"). Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (\\"Je suis jaloux\\"). Nourabad and some of the fishermen enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace. Outside the temple, Nadir waits beside the funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn and the coming double execution (\\"Dès que le soleil\\"). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir.

William Frederick \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody (February 26, 1846 - January 10, 1917) was an American scout, bison hunter, and showman. He was born in Le Claire, Iowa Territory (now the U.S. state of Iowa), but he lived for several years in his father's hometown in Toronto Township, Ontario, Canada, before the family returned to the Midwest and settled in the Kansas Territory. Buffalo Bill started working at the age of eleven, after his father's death, and became a rider for the Pony Express at age 14. During the American Civil War, he served the Union from 1863 to the end of the war in 1865. After his mother recovered, Cody wanted to enlist as a soldier in the Union Army during the American Civil War, but was refused because of his young age. He began working with a freight caravan that delivered supplies to Fort Laramie, in present-day Wyoming. In 1863, at age 17, he enlisted as a teamster with the rank of private in Company H, 7th Kansas Cavalry, and served until discharged in 1865.  The next year, Cody married Louisa Frederici. They had four children. Two died young, while the family was living in Rochester, New York. They and a third child are buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester.  Cody went back to work for the Army in 1868 and was Chief of Scouts for the Third Cavalry during the Plains Wars. Part of the time, he scouted for Indians and fought in 16 battles; at other times, he hunted and killed bison to supply the Army and the Kansas Pacific Railroad. In January 1872, Cody was a scout for the highly publicized hunting expedition of the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia.  Cody was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1872 for gallantry as an Army scout in the Indian Wars. It was revoked in 1913, along with medals of many other recipients, when Congress decided to create a hierarchy of military awards to replace the patchwork which had evolved over time. The result was that the Medal of Honor became the highest military decoration, with its award restricted to \\"officers or enlisted\\" personnel who demonstrated bravery \\"above and beyond the call of duty.\\" The law also allowed the government to retroactively change the honor rolls, resulting in civilian scouts who met neither criterion having their awards rescinded. Cody was one of five scouts affected, whose medals were stripped shortly after Cody died in 1917.  Cody's relatives objected, and over a number of years they wrote repeatedly to Congress seeking reconsideration. All efforts failed, including a 1988 letter to the US Senate from Cody's grandson. A year later the office of Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming took up the cause. Its brief, which argued for the retroactive elevation of these civilian scouts' status to meet the Medal's standards, persuaded the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to restore their medals. To this day, they are the only honorees who were civilians at the time of their award to regain the Medal of Honor.","output":"This text is about William Frederick \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, who was an American scout, bison hunter, and showman.

News article: Shortly after his victory last year, Donald J. Trump began revisiting one of his deepest public humiliations: the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of him making vulgar comments about women.      Despite his public acknowledgment of the recording’s authenticity in the final days of the presidential campaign — and his hasty videotaped apology under pressure from his advisers — Mr. Trump as president-elect began raising the prospect with allies that it may not have been him on the tape after all.      Most of Mr. Trump’s aides ignored his changing story. But in January, shortly before his inauguration, Mr. Trump told a Republican senator that he wanted to investigate the recording that had him boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.      “We don’t think that was my voice,” Mr. Trump told the senator, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Since then, Mr. Trump has continued to suggest that the tape that nearly upended his campaign was not actually him, according to three people close to the president. ||||| Sen. Jeff Flake Plans Series Of Speeches Targeting Trump On Facts And Truth      Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images      Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is planning to take his crusade against President Trump's tendency to play fast and loose with the truth to the Senate floor.      The retiring lawmaker told Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep he is planning a series of speeches about the critical importance of facts and truth to American democracy. Flake continues to be one of the few GOP legislators to vigorously speak out against Trump.      \\"These speeches aren't necessarily just on the president, but on certain issues,\\" Flake said. \\"The first one will be on the need to have shared facts that we all agree on.\\"      Flake first revealed his intention to begin the series of speeches to the New York Times Tuesday night after the paper reported that Trump is now questioning the veracity of the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape, where Trump was recorded bragging about groping and kissing women. During the campaign, he admitted that the tape was of him and dismissed it as \\"locker room talk.\\"      The Times also reported that Trump is again perpetuating the well-refuted conspiracy theory that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, was not born in the U.S.      \\"Those are things that I think are empirically settled, and I think it's important that we recognize it as such. And democracy really depends on having shared facts, and I'll be addressing some of those issues,\\" Flake told NPR.      Politics Listen To The Full 'Morning Edition' Interview With Sen. Flake Sen. Flake Expresses Reservations About GOP Tax Measure Listen · 7:15 7:15      \\"It is damaging to a democracy if you say things are fake news that aren't, and portray facts as something else, so I do think that it's damaging to a democracy, I do,\\" the GOP senator added.      Flake's office did not have a timetable for when he plans to begin the series of speeches but said it would not be this week.      Later on Wednesday, Flake also tweeted that it was \\"highly inappropriate\\" that Trump had shared several incendiary videos from a far-right British anti-Muslim party on Twitter earlier that morning.      Those sentiments are ones Flake has expressed before, particularly in his book Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.      In the book, released this past summer, Flake explained he was deeply concerned about the perpetuation of conspiracy theories and \\"alternative facts\\" peddled by Trump and his allies, such as conservative media like Fox News. Flake recalled how he faced blowback in Arizona when he told a Tea Party group he believed Obama was, in fact, a U.S. citizen and was subsequently booed \\"because I didn't subscribe to a right-wing conspiracist fantasy about our first African American president.\\" He called it \\"a sobering experience indeed.\\"      \\"When a conspiracy theory becomes litmus-test orthodoxy, objective reality is at risk,\\" Flake bemoaned.      That approach didn't endear Flake to the conservative base in his home state, and he faced a very real possibility of being defeated in the GOP primary. But Flake announced at the end of October he wouldn't run for re-election. In doing so, he gave a scathing speech on the Senate floor about the current state of politics and the \\"flagrant disregard for truth or decency.\\"      Flake's outspoken criticism of Trump has earned plenty of jabs back from Trump, despite the fact that the president still needs his vote to pass his tax overhaul. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"This news article is about how President Trump started to say that the tape where he made rude comments about women might not have his voice in it.

A senator named Jeff Flake doesn't like that Trump is changing his mind about this.

Movie plot title: Teza Movie plot: Teza, which means morning dew in Amharic, tells a story of hope, loss, and reminiscence through the eyes of an idealistic, young intellectual, displaced from his homeland of Ethiopia for many years. The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

Paragraph: Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan and the Greco-Indian Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). The first figural portrayals of the Buddha, previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth. The Yavanajataka and Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence.

The given equation is: 0 = 2*z - 16 + 12.  2. First, simplify the like terms on the right side to clean up the equation:          0 = 2*z - 4.        Here, we just added the numbers -16 and 12 together to get -4. 3. The next step is isolating \\"z\\" to one side, which is the goal of solving a linear equation. To do this, we add 4 to both sides of the equation:     0 + 4 = 2*z - 4 + 4. 4. This simplifies to:     4 = 2*z. 5. Finally, we want to solve for z. This is done by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:     z = 4 / 2. 6. This means:     z = 2.

I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which runningback had the most rushing yards of the game?","output":"Title: The Quest for the Ground Game Throne: Determining the Running Back with the Most Rushing Yards in a Single Game Introduction: The NFL has witnessed numerous running backs vying for the honor of holding the most rushing yards in a single game. With a plethora of talented athletes stepping onto the gridiron, pinpointing the one with this exceptional feat is a testament to their relentless pursuit of greatness. Their unyielding spirit, agility, and sheer determination leave fans in awe. As we delve deeper into the rich history of the NFL, let's discover which running back managed to break the record for the most rushing yards in one game. A Glance at the Record Holders: Running backs often play an instrumental role in achieving victories in competitive games. From pantheon greats like Walter Payton and Jim Brown to contemporary superstars like Adrian Peterson and Derrick Henry, the list of exceptional running backs is seemingly endless. However, there can only be one who holds the title for the most rushing yards in a single game. Before unveiling who claimed this impressive record, let's take a brief look at some significant names that led the way. 1. Walter Payton: Before 2000, Walter Payton, known as \\"Sweetness,\\" held the record for the most rushing yards in a single game. Payton, a nine-time Pro Bowler and 1977 NFL MVP, rushed for 275 yards for the Chicago Bears against the Minnesota Vikings on November 20, 1977. The Hall of Famer's record lasted for over two decades, underscoring his immense talent. 2. Corey Dillon: On October 22, 2000, Corey Dillon of the Cincinnati Bengals shook things up, setting a new record with 278 rushing yards against the Denver Broncos. The 1997 second-round draft pick out of Washington managed to surpass Payton's long-standing mark by three yards in a 31-21 victory. 3. Jamal Lewis: Moving forward, September 14, 2003, witnessed Jamal Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens rewrite the record book with an astonishing 295 rushing yards in a single game against the Cleveland Browns. The former first-round pick and Super Bowl champion fell just five yards short of the elusive 300-yard barrier, leaving fans mesmerized. Lewis' performance even earned him the 2003 NFL Offensive Player of the Year award. The Undisputed Record Holder: Adrian Peterson: Often regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time, Adrian Peterson exhibited an extraordinary performance on November 4, 2007. Turning the naysayers into believers, the then-rookie exploded onto the scene, breaking Jamal Lewis' single-game rushing record. Peterson, a first-round pick from the University of Oklahoma, amassed a staggering 296 rushing yards for the Minnesota Vikings against the San Diego Chargers. The game went down in the annals of history, with Peterson firmly implanting his name as the running back with the most rushing yards in a single game. Conclusion: Adrian Peterson's remarkable feat has yet to be eclipsed, even after more than a decade. His incredible performance highlights the essence of dedication, hard work, and determination. As passionate fans of the sport, we will forever cherish moments like these, which bring us closer to the game we love. While it remains uncertain whether another running back will surpass Peterson's record, the quest to topple his achievement is what continues to make the ground game electrifying and captivating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Little Fresh Meat That’s what they call male model Lucky Blue in China.      (It’s very much a compliment.)      Photographs by Sandy Kim      Lucky Blue, who is not a racehorse, as his name might suggest, but rather a six-foot-three, 17-year-old model, is learning how to dance. Basic moves. The grapevine. A decent step-touch. “Just remember when you’re step-touching to lead with this.” Here, Danny, the male dance instructor leading this private lesson at a small Los Angeles studio, pats the side of Lucky’s butt. This makes Lucky blush. He buries his hands in the pockets of his skintight black jeans. Today’s lesson is worst-case-scenario prep for Lucky Blue’s upcoming appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the following week, in case DeGeneres requests a short boogie from her guest, as she often does. Lucky can’t seem to find the rhythm. His step-touch has a jitteriness that makes it look like he’s tiptoeing around dog poop. “I suck at this!” he shouts good-naturedly. Danny tries another tack: “Take your hands out of your pockets! Use your lanky arms — let them swoop you this way and that.” Lucky starts swinging his arms, his face scrunched in painful concentration. He looks like a very thin monkey. Or any other 17-year-old boy forced by social circumstance to dance.      Lucky is just a kid, after all, which can be hard to square with his smoldering gaze in the new Tom Ford campaign or his Nordic-vampire visage in the Annie Leibovitz–directed Moncler shoot. Signed at age 12, he’s already walked in more than two dozen shows this year, including ones for Balmain and Sacai in this year’s Paris Fashion Week. On the runway, he commands a Bond-villain-esque presence. Lucky is fairly well known here — for a male model, at least — but he’s extremely, and somewhat inexplicably, famous in China, where they call him “Little Fresh Meat,” a common nickname for young good-looking men. Lucky has 350,000 followers on Weibo, one of China’s biggest social networks, and more than a million Instagram followers. “Walking is pretty easy,” he explains as we leave the studio together. “You just have to be confident, like not caring. And honestly, people think about their walk too much, so they try to do something really interesting, but the designers hate it.”      The Smiths at home in Hollywood. Clockwise from top left, Sheridan, Daisy, Dallon, Starlie, Lucky, and Pyper. Photo: Sandy Kim      I first met Lucky Blue Smith the week before at a roof party held at the L.A. office of his modeling agency, Next Management. A brief digression: You would think that a party of all models would be the craziest party in the world. But here’s a comforting fact — models are just like us. They stand around the food table awkwardly, even more so since they don’t really eat. They dance in little closed circles like high-schoolers. While dancing, they “vogue,” seemingly without irony. Their collective beauty, contained on one rooftop, almost works against them. No one model seems that special. Except for Lucky. His extra-giant stature and bleached pompadour make even the genetically blessed look Kmart-catalogue caliber. When I spot him standing in a far corner, his manager is dusting his shoulders and adjusting his collar like a trainer prepping her show dog about to take the stage.      To be fair, Lucky is taking the stage. He and his sisters, Daisy Clementine, Pyper America, and Starlie Cheyenne (all real names), form a band called the Atomics, and they’re slated to play a couple of songs. The three sisters are models, too, also with Next. Their mother, Sheridan, is a former model. Their dad, Dallon, is not a model, but he does look a little like Kurt Russell. Dallon’s mother was a model, though, as was Sheridan’s. Basically, the Smiths are third-generation professional pretty people. For a band composed solely of models, the Atomics are way better than they need to be. They have a nice if unsurprising surf-rock vibe. They’re proficient on their instruments (Lucky plays the drums) but not quite confident in their stage banter. “Um, you guys can dance, please?” Daisy begs the crowd as they play the opening notes of their final song. “Just tell us our music is okay enough to dance to.”      Lucky Blue shares a bedroom with his three sisters, from left, Daisy Clementine, Starlie Cheyenne, and Pyper America. Photo: Sandy Kim      Later, when I’m introduced to Lucky’s sisters and parents, they’re so imposingly big-eyed and blond that my Jewish fight-or-flight nerves kick in. “Did you like our songs?” Daisy asks enthusiastically. The room tonight was maybe a tough crowd, but Next has recently started an arrangement to beam the band’s performances to China. “The year Lucky turned 7, we had a rock-and-roll Christmas,” Dallon, who works with the band, tells me. “They all got instruments as gifts and learned how to play them.” A photographer with Next runs over and interrupts the conversation. “Family-picture time!” she exclaims. I start to bow out, but an arm belonging to one of the tall blond children pulls me back in. “Lauren, stay in the picture!” Lucky commands. We all smile for the camera. Then Pyper requests a “funny face” take. The family does what it can to mar their natural beauty — eyes cross, tongues wag — and after the click, Pyper runs over to see how it turned out. “You didn’t make a silly face!” she scolds me. In my defense, I assumed that next to such a physically blessed set, my face would read as funny enough.      It’s easy to think that beautiful people are graded on a curve, that life is somehow easier for them. That’s not always the case. The Smith family both had luck and made their own (Lucky included). Daisy was actually scouted first, at a casting call in Salt Lake City, an hour from the family home in Spanish Fork, Utah. She was 14. At the time, Lucky was all but ignored. Two years later, though, when the whole clan showed up at Next’s office in their ancient white band van — Dallon had been trying to get them traction as a family band, like a Partridge Family for the aughts — Lucky had grown into his looks, fixed his beaverish front teeth, and developed a slick rockabilly style. Next signed him up, too, and though he was not yet a teenager, he began booking adult campaigns — Vogue Hommes Japan, shot by Hedi Slimane, then a Levi’s campaign that featured him drumming solo under the HOLLYWOOD sign. Two years ago, the Smiths moved to L.A. into a two-bedroom apartment owned by Next in the heart of Hollywood, adjacent to the famous Mann’s Chinese Theatre. All four kids share one bedroom, which is manageable only because they travel so much. But still, they had 4,300 square feet in Utah. And Lucky is not a fan of the location, which his mom gamely calls “gritty.” “It’s the worst place to live. I hate it,” Lucky says. “I want to move to Venice Beach.”      The Smiths praying before dinner. Photo: Sandy Kim      Many of their new friends in L.A. are from church. The Smiths are Mormon, and they try to pray together before every meal. Occasionally Lucky tweets out a Book of Mormon passage to his teen-girl followers, say, “3 Nephi 12:16 Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father,” which is often met with confused replies like “is this even from the bible LOL.” Lucky will have to decide soon whether he wants to do the traditional mission abroad, which would mean putting modeling aside for at least a year. His parents say it’s up to him. But success seems to be a religion of sorts for the family as well: Other than a few Polaroids, the only decoration in their apartment is a set of inspirational slogans stuck to the kitchen wall — ON THE MOVE and WORK HARD/WORK WELL/WORK TOGETHER — and, on index cards, a series of goals for the Atomics to achieve, like getting their single to No. 1 on iTunes and launching a world tour. The family also meets regularly to discuss each child’s personal goals. “We started calling them three-by-five-card meetings,” Sheridan says. “Whenever someone has a big project, we write it on an index card and it goes up on the wall. And it doesn’t come down until it’s done.”      The siblings play in a band together called the Atomics. Photo: Sandy Kim      After the dance lesson, Lucky offers me a ride in the rust-orange Kia Soul he shares with his sisters, still dented from a recent accident on the Pacific Coast Highway. He’s headed back to the agency, where he’ll take new digitals to show off some recently acquired bicep muscles. “Do you want any music?” he asks, fiddling with his iPhone. He plugs it into the car stereo. “Okay, I hope you like this. A lot of my friends hate my music. I have weird taste,” he says as the first notes of “Hard to Explain” by the Strokes fill the car.      In person, Lucky’s demeanor is much more goofy teen boy than Derek Zoolander. At times he even seems a little over his head, like that Anne Hathaway movie where she takes off her glasses and wakes up a princess and is like, “What is high tea?” During our drive, I ask him what it was like to mingle with fashion heads at the age of 16. “I honestly had no clue who I was walking for at first. But now my agency’s like, ‘Okay, this is the photographer you want to talk with,’ or, ‘This is how you pronounce this weird name.’ ” He doesn’t notice the green left-turn signal, and the car behind us honks aggressively. “Sheesh,” he says, zooming through the light. “I hate traffic here.” What were the other models like, I wonder. “Were they nice to you?” I ask. Lucky thinks about it. “Most of them are jerks and stuff like that, until you prove yourself. You gotta prove yourself,” he says. “Some of the guys can get really cocky and rude, but the bigger models are just like whatever, like, ‘You’re cool, I’m cool,’ you know? They’re nicer because they’re not insecure.”      Overlooking Runyon Canyon. Photo: Sandy Kim      Lucky Blue Smith seems to have no trace of insecurity himself. Of course, people have been telling him he’s special since he was old enough to understand language. Now, though still not technically an adult, he’s basically the One Direction of male models. Girls wait for him outside of fashion shows in Paris and Milan. A male model hasn’t had this kind of fame since Tyson Beckford. And even Tyson required a surname. Lucky Blue is just Lucky Blue. And yet he seems generally unfazed by all the attention. His focus is work and the band. He doesn’t even have time for a girlfriend right now. “Girls say they love me and stuff,” he replies with a dismissive shrug when I ask about the kind of messages he receives through social media. Maybe, again, it’s just that he’s a kid. Even down to his culinary sensibilities. Lucky tells me of his recent tour with Adidas in Hong Kong and Shanghai. “They took me to this really traditional Chinese restaurant,” he recalls. “And they served chicken feet! And chicken neck! Basically they put all these random chicken parts in a soup. It was so nasty. I got sick after.”      The sun is shining when we arrive at the agency. Lucky hugs two of the male models in the lobby. One of them suggests that he and Lucky take a selfie. “Will you put this on your Instagram and tag me?” he asks. “I need more followers, man!” Eventually we head out back to the deck with a Next agent, Gino, who is snapping photos. Lucky peels off his sweatshirt, revealing a cool T-shirt with the heads of the Royal Tenenbaums characters on it, which I compliment. “I don’t know the Tenenbaums,” he replies. “I just really like this shirt. Someone sent it to me.” He pulls out a jar from his backpack. “This is the same pomade Elvis used,” he says, handing it over for examination. “Even if it was, like, bad, I would still use it. I wouldn’t care.” Gino sets Lucky up on a stool against the concrete wall. He seems fidgety as Gino sets up the camera. Lucky: “You know that thing where you look at the sun with your eyes closed and it’s not as bright? That’s bullshit.” Gino: “Uh-huh. Okay, ready?” And just like that he is. Lucky whips his hand through his hair. He pouts his lower lip. He moves his body ever so slightly for each shot. He knows where to put his chin, where to settle his gaze. He’s so fluid and precise that watching him feels like yoga for the eyes.      The Smiths. Both of Lucky's grandmothers and his mother were models, as are his three sisters. Photo: Sandy Kim      After a hundred frames, Gino calls for a short break so he can set up a different background. Lucky picks up his water bottle and heads over to me. The deck of the agency offers a magnificent view of the city, and the HOLLYWOOD sign is in clear view to the northeast. “I think the HOLLYWOOD sign should move from there to there,” Lucky says, pointing to the mountain range directly in front of him. “It would be way more centered.” I tell him that it wouldn’t, actually. The position is relative. If the HOLLYWOOD sign were moved to the range in front of him, it would just be more centered to his position at this moment, on top of a building in mid-Wilshire. “No, I think it would look cooler over here,” he responds. Oh, to be 17 and king of the world.      *This article appears in the August 10, 2015 issue of New York Magazine. ||||| No disrespect to the Hall of Famers—from Kanye to Clooney, Gosling to Pharrell—but this year we're feeling a different, right-this-second strain of pro-level style.

But Lucky Blue Smith found time to take a spot in the front row of the Anthony Vaccarello show on Tuesday, the first day of Paris Fashion Week.      The show was packed, not least because of the rumor that Mr. Vaccarello is a possible heir to the Saint Laurent crown should Hedi Slimane step down. Mr. Vaccarello also designs Versace’s Versus label, of which Mr. Smith is a fan. He spoke to Styles before the show began.      Lucky, what has brought you to Paris during the women’s wear shows?      I’m here for one big shoot. It’s going to be huge. I can’t tell you who with, but you’ll soon find out. I fly out on Thursday.      What are you going to do once the show is over?      It’s not very rock ’n’ roll, but I have a big school test when I get back to the U.S., which I have to study for. I’m not very good at doing my homework, so I really need to focus tonight. Schoolwork tonight, the shoot and then home. I wish I could see more of Paris, but whenever I’m here, it’s never for more than 48 hours. I need to take an actual vacation to France and find out what really goes on here.      Where is home?      Home is Los Angeles — well, when I am ever there. I seem to live on a plane right now. Originally I’m from Utah. But I am a child of sunshine, which is why, oddly, I don’t really mind the fact that it’s pouring with rain today. I quite like the contrast.

Funny, cool, and totally honest, this is a must-have for Lucky Blue Smith fans or anyone looking for teen advice and memoirs.            “The man of the moment…the reigning heartthrob of social media.” —Vogue ||||| You could say he’s had a lucky year. The lanky six-foot-two-inch 17-year-old all-American with piercing blue eyes has taken the fashion industry by storm. This season, Lucky Blue Smith is the face of Tom Ford, Moncler, and Calvin Klein Jeans, and has walked the runways of designers Michael Kors, Versace, and Fendi. He’s also become an Insta-stud. His social-media presence has branded him a male equivalent of Cara Delevingne, the British “It girl” whose quirky online persona (more than 20 million Instagram followers) catapulted her into fashion’s stratosphere and then into big Hollywood movies.      The exact moment Smith’s career turned from model to Insta-star was during the men’s-wear shows last January in Milan. He first joined Instagram to keep up with friends from home in Utah, but by show season he had amassed 150,000 followers. Most were fans of his modeling pictures, and they were eager to meet him. He posted a message that he’d be outside Via Solari, 35, Fendi’s show venue in Milan, at a certain time. Sixty girls arrived demanding selfies. He pulled the stunt three more times. Again, more girls, more selfies. His followers were multiplying. By the time fashion week had migrated to Paris, Smith’s modus operandi was tried and true. The “Insta-meets” had become frenzies of hormonal teenagers wielding camera phones. “In Paris, a girl was having a panic attack, so I sat her down, gave her a hug, and took a pic with her. I looked back and she had passed out!” To date, he has more than 1.4 million followers.      Smith is the youngest of four children, the only boy after sisters Starlie Cheyenne, 22, Daisy Clementine, 20, and Pyper America, 18. (Their mother, Sheridan, a former model, and their father, Dallon, a hobbyist musician who started a guitar-string company, gave them memorable first names to offset their familiar surname.) Together, they’re the Atomics, a family band with Lucky Blue on drums. They live in L.A. now, but they grew up in a tight-knit community in Spanish Fork, Utah, where a model scout first approached Daisy, in 2008. “I was 10 at the time,” Lucky Blue remembers, “and they said, ‘In a couple of years, we’ll come back for you.’ ” They weren’t kidding. He signed at 12, and by the time he reached 15, the Smiths had moved to California, Lucky Blue had been shot by Hedi Slimane for Japanese Vogue, and all four siblings had become the face of Gap’s 2012 holiday campaign.      As Smith’s fan base continues to climb, he offers two tips for those who haven’t amassed as many followers. The most important thing to remember when taking a selfie: “Good lighting. Definitely.” And find a four-legged friend. “Put a puppy in your picture and it will make it 20 times better.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Lucky Blue Smith is a 17-year-old model who has taken the fashion industry by storm, becoming the face of Tom Ford, Moncler, and Calvin Klein Jeans.

Build a movie plot around this: Who is observing the wedding of three couples from outside the courthouse window in the final scene? Porter The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Portraits of Love Genre: Romance, Drama, Mystery Step 1: Introduce the three couples. The movie follows the romantic journeys of three unique couples: - Amelia and Tom, a young couple passionate about activism and environmental causes. - Lana and Brian, middle-aged divorcees who found love and support in each other. - Carlos and Sasha, a long-distance couple overcoming cultural differences to be together. Step 2: Introduce Porter, the mysterious observer. Early in the movie, we see a figure, later revealed to be Porter, sketching a courthouse from various angles in his notebook. He seems drawn to weddings held in the courthouse, and he strikes up conversations with the pairs, subtly influencing their relationships. Step 3: Highlight the trials and triumphs of the three couples. The movie delves into the lives of Amelia and Tom as they develop a water conservation project, showing their love grow and thrive. Lana and Brian, uncertain about remarriage, pursue their relationship steadily, culminating in a joint decision to wed. Sasha and Carlos face visa difficulties, but ultimately manage to marry once their issues are resolved. Step 4: Build suspense around Porter's motivation. Throughout the movie, we discover more about Porter. Flashes of a grieving woman, an old wedding ring, and a hidden sketchbook filled with tender memories hint at his backstory. These glimpses keep the audience wondering about his connection to the courthouse and the couples. Step 5: The final scene at the courthouse. The three couples gather at the courthouse to marry in a small but intimate ceremony, surrounded by friends and family. Porter observes from outside the window, uninvited. As the couples exchange vows and celebrate, a sequence shows Porter's life paralleling their stories - a once-happy marriage cut short by tragedy. Step 6: Reveal Porter's motivation and backstory. In the final moments, we learn that Porter's wife, Julia, passed away unexpectedly years ago. Their marriage ceremony took place at the same courthouse, and Porter found solace in returning to this place, drawing comfort from the loving stories of other couples. Witnessing the love shared between Amelia, Tom, Lana, Brian, Sasha, and Carlos allows him to heal and finally let go of his past. Step 7: Closure. With closure for Porter's pain and glimpses of hope in his future, the movie ends as each couple embarks on their journey as newlyweds. Porter returns to his home and reveals his sketches to the loved ones of each respective couple, leaving a heartfelt note about the inspiration they provided in his own life. In conclusion, Porter, the man observing the weddings at the courthouse, identifies with the love and commitment shared by Amelia, Tom, Lana, Brian, Sasha, and Carlos. He is drawn to these ceremonies, as they serve as a remembrance of the love he shared with his late wife, and provide closure to his own struggles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the other group?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Blue group, which focused on weight training, didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the Brown group. This is because weight training primarily involves the use of skeletal muscle to increase size and strength, whereas running, as performed by the Brown group, causes the cardiac muscle to contract faster and pump more blood, thereby increasing its strength and efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where was Swagger's home located? Movie title: Shooter Movie plot: Bob Lee Swagger reluctantly leaves a self-imposed exile from his isolated mountain home in the Wind River Range at the request of Colonel Isaac Johnson, who appeals to him to help track down an assassin who is planning to shoot the president. Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed. He independently learns that Swagger may have been framed for the assassination and is further made suspicious when he learns that the officer who shot Swagger was himself shot dead just hours later in a \\"mugging\\". When the agents realize their secret is compromised, they kidnap Memphis and attempt to stage his suicide. Swagger tails them and kills the captors. The two then join forces and visit a firearms expert who provides information on the FBI's ballistics report and a short list of people capable of taking a shot from a distance of one mile or more.

Article: I call my story the story of a bad boy, partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young gentlemen, and partly because I really was not an angle. I may truthfully say I was a friendly, impulsive teenager. I didn't want to be an angel. In short, I was a real human boy, such as you may meet anywhere in New England. Whenever a new scholar came to our school, I used to ask him \\" My name's Tom Bailey; what's your name?\\" If the name struck me favorably, I shook hands with the new pupil _ , but if it didn't, I would turn and walk away, for I was particular on this point. I was born in Rivermouth almost fifty years ago, but, before I became very well acquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents moved to New Orleans. I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move, and it didn't make much difference to me where I was, because several years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be educated, I had my own view on the subject. I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam, who happened to be standing by me at the moment, and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees! You see I was what is called \\" a Northern man with Southern principles,\\" I had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were connected with the South. I knew I was born in the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee, because they talked about Yankees in a scornful way which made me feel that it was quite a shame not to be born in the South. And this impression was strengthened by Aunt Chloe, who said, \\"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\\" With this picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the readers will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little Sam, when my father announced this to me. As for kicking little Sam, I always did that, more or less gently, when anything went wrong with me. My father was greatly troubled by...

Answer: Answer:","output":"It can be inferred from \\"a Northern man with Southern principles\\" that the narrator, despite being born in the North, has adopted the values, beliefs, and cultural identity associated with the South. This is due to his upbringing in New Orleans, where he developed a strong attachment to Southern ways and was influenced by the opinions of those around him, such as his schoolmates and Aunt Chloe. As a result, he feels a sense of pride in his Southern identity and is apprehensive about being sent to Rivermouth, in the North, for his education."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers. Fay and Johnny leave the airport but are unable to hail a cab before officers...","output":"George Peatty holds the position of a betting window teller in the movie \\"The Killing.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could. The bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why didn't Paul feel concern? Answer:","output":"Paul didn't feel concerned because he believed that Greg had given in and wouldn't call to cancel the check. Greg had a reason for making the decision, and according to Paul, once Greg had a reason, it was usually impossible to change his mind. Additionally, Paul thought that canceling the check wouldn't make sense for Greg, as it would only buy him a little more time, and Chloe and Paul could come back to start their tactics again. Thus, Paul felt that the risks and consequences of canceling the check were not worth it for Greg, and that's why he didn't feel concerned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Eric John Wilson ( born February 21 , 1970 ) , is the former bass player for Sublime ( 1988 -- 1996 ) and also bassist for Long Beach Dub Allstars ( 1997 -- 2002 ) . He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer .  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002.  - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

The grocery chain Supervalu said Friday that it may have suffered a data breach at stores in as many as five states. Hackers accessed a network that processes store transactions. Account numbers, expiration dates, cardholders' names and other information may have been stolen, the company said. Grocery stores — as well as some stand-alone liquor shops — in Minnesota, Virginia, Illinois, Maryland and Missouri may have been affected between June 22 and July 17. The cards from which data may have been stolen were used at 180 Supervalu stores and liquor stores run under the Cub Foods, Farm Fresh, Hornbacher's, Shop 'n Save and Shoppers Food & Pharmacy names. Data may also have been stolen from 29 franchised Cub Foods stores and liquor stores. Supervalu officials say stores across five states may have been target of a data breach. Hackers could have credit card information for customers who shopped between June 22 and July 17. There was also a related criminal intrusion at some stores owned and run by Albertson's LLC and New Albertson's Inc., the company said. Supervalu provides information technology services to the Albertson's and New Albertson's stores. Supervalu said that it currently believes the data breach did not impact its owned or licensed Save-A-Lot stores or any of the independent grocery stores supplied by the company through its independent business network other than the franchised Cub Foods stores previously mentioned. Once it learned of the breach, the company said that it took immediate steps to secure that portion of its network. An investigation into the incident is ongoing. The company hasn't determined if any cardholder data was actually stolen and said Friday that there's no evidence of the data being misused. The release of information about the breach was released out of 'an abundance of caution,' the company said. It is believed that the intrusion has been contained, the company said, and it remains confident shoppers can safely use their credit and debit cards at its stores. The intrusion at Supervalu is just the latest in a string of data breaches at major retailers. Earlier this month, Target said that expenses tied to a breach leading up to last year's holiday shopping season could reach as high as 148 million. The incident led to a major shakeup and CEO Gregg Steinhafel resigned. Restaurant operator P.F. Chang's confirmed in June that data from credit and debit cards used at its restaurants was stolen. There have been smaller breaches at Neiman Marcus and Michaels Stores Inc., and even at Goodwill. There are currently efforts underway to change the technology used in credit and debit cards to make consumer information more secure.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who said they used to be cruel to women? , can you please find it?   Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on.

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, an American country rock band, has existed in various forms since its founding in Long Beach, California in 1966. The group's membership has had at least a dozen changes over the years, including a period from 1976 to 1981 when the band performed and recorded as the Dirt Band. Constant members since the early times are singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and drummer Jimmie Fadden. Multi-instrumentalist John McEuen was with the band from 1966 to 1986 and returned during 2001 departing once again in November 2017. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded around 1966 in Long Beach, California by singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and singer-songwriter guitarist Bruce Kunkel who had performed as the New Coast Two and later the Illegitimate Jug Band. Trying, in the words of the band's website, to \\"figure out how not to have to work for a living,\\" Hanna and Kunkel joined informal jam sessions at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Long Beach. There they met a few other musicians: guitarist/washtub bassist Ralph Barr, guitarist-clarinetist Les Thompson, harmonicist and jug player Jimmie Fadden, and guitarist-vocalist Jackson Browne. As Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the six men started as a jug band and adopted the burgeoning southern California folk rock musical style, playing in local clubs while wearing pinstripe suits and cowboy boots. Their first paying performance was at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach, California.  Browne was in the band for only a few months before he left to concentrate on a solo career as a singer-songwriter. He was replaced by John McEuen on banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and steel guitar. McEuen's older brother, William, was the group's manager, and he helped the band get signed with Liberty Records, which released the group's debut album, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band during 1967. The band's first single, \\"Buy for Me the Rain,\\" was a Top 40 success, and the band gained exposure on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as concerts with such disparate artists as Jack Benny and The Doors.  A second album, Ricochet, was released later during the year and was less successful than their first. Kunkel wanted the band to \\"go electric\\", and include more original material. Bruce left the group to form WordSalad and Of The People. He was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow.  By 1968, the band adopted electrical instruments anyway, and added drums. The first electric album, Rare Junk, was a commercial failure, as was their next, Alive.  The band continued to gain publicity, mainly as a novelty act, making an appearance in the 1968 film, For Singles Only, and a cameo appearance in the 1969 musical western film, Paint Your Wagon, performing \\"Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans\\". The band also played Carnegie Hall as an opening act for Bill Cosby and played in a jam session with Dizzy Gillespie.

The gases becoming less harmful interferes directly with the third and fourth steps outlined: \\"Heat rises from the ground\\" and \\"Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space\\". If the gases are less harmful, they are less likely to prevent the heat from dissipating into space, meaning less heat is trapped within the Earth's atmosphere.

With a new cookery book out every day with ever more weird and wacky recipes to excite Britain's budding chefs, we sometimes lose sight of the simple meals we enjoy the most. One no-nonsense we user has gone back to basics to post a recipe for Marmite on toast on the BBC's Good Food website - sparking a wave of hilarious responses. User Benno Himself posted the recipe two years ago but only in the past few days has it seen a surge of interest and comments from fellow BBC Good Food users who appreciate his sense of humour. Twitter users have also gone mad for this amusing recipe. User Benno Himself posted this recipe back in 2010 but has seen a revival in sarcastic and ironic comments.

There's really no arguing with this tried and tested technique for the perfect Marmite on toast. It has even been rated an average five out of five stars. People are impressed. Though on closer inspection, it appears some of the gushingly positive response to this recipe might be peppered with a hint of irony. This amateur chef goes back to basics with his step by step guide to making this very simple dish. 'This. is one of my personal favorites! The assemblage of this dish only took. about 10 minutes despite drilling a hole in the middle of the bread with. my rock-solid unsalted butter.

I've. been using a fork to spread the butter but the toasted bread seams to. break up, is there a special kitchen implement to spread butter? - Tim Messanger. This. looks great but as a hardworking unemployed layabout, I don't have time. for complicated recipes like this after a long day in the pub/down the. bookies. Does anyone know if this is available as a ready-meal in any of. the supermarkets? - cmtarpey. This is a recipe my mother handed down to me, I've always been reluctant to do it as I was nervous it wouldn't taste as good as hers... no need for me to worry, turned out perfectly Thank You so much for bringing back some childhood memories. - Tilly.

Identify each distinct part: The phrase consists of three separate parts: \\"Feeding Three\\", \\"Reflecting God\\", and \\"Embrace Holy Living\\". Each part needs to be translated separately for accuracy. 2. Translate each part:  - \\"Feeding Three\\" is translated into Spanish as \\"Alimentando a Tres\\". Here, 'Feeding' translates to 'Alimentando', and 'Three' translates to 'Tres'. We use 'a' before 'Tres' to indicate to whom the action applies.  - \\"Reflecting God\\" can be translated as \\"Reflejando a Dios\\". 'Reflecting' is translated as 'Reflejando', and 'God' as 'Dios'. Again, we use 'a' before 'Dios' to indicate the object of the reflection. - \\"Embrace Holy Living\\" is translated as \\"Abraza la Vida Santa\\". 'Embrace' could be translated as 'Abraza', 'Holy' as 'Santa', and 'Living' as 'Vida'. 'La' is used as the article before 'Vida Santa' in Spanish. 3.

Summarize this article: Start by sawing a 2x4 board into 2 pieces that are the same width as your desktop, minus the width of the two legs that will go on either side. These pieces will serve as supports to brace the desk from beneath. Once you’ve done this, cut your remaining wood into 4 identical legs. Their length should correspond to the desired height of your desk, minus the width of the boards making up the desktop.  Note that 2x4 boards are actually only 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) thick, not a full 2 inches (5.1 cm). This means that if your desktop is 24 inches (61 cm) wide, each of your support pieces will need to be 21 inches (53 cm) to allow enough room for a leg on either side. Similarly, you’ll need to subtract 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from your initial table leg measurements to reflect the thickness of the desktop—you want your desk to sit 28 inches (71 cm) off of the ground, for example, each of your legs will need to be 26.5 inches (67 cm) long. Paint or stain your table legs to match your desktop, or leave them unfinished to provide some visual contrast. You can find premade desk and table legs at most hardware stores and home improvement centers, as well as certain specialty furniture stores like IKEA. They’re available in a variety of lengths, shapes, and materials, which means you’re sure to find the perfect set to complete the style of desk you’ve envisioned. Metal legs, for instance, could give a lightly-stained wooden desk a sleek, minimalistic modern air, while square frames can keep the underside of a desk from looking so open without sacrificing valuable storage space. Keep in mind that you’re not limited to simple 2x4 or premade legs. You might also turn a few old wooden pedestals into one-of-a-kind decorative stands to lend your desk added personality, or even just secure your desktop to a pair of sawhorses for a clever, no-fuss solution. The possibilities are virtually endless!  Think outside the box and keep your eyes peeled for interesting materials and objects that you think might make good legs for a homemade desk. Examples of other unusual items you could utilize as legs include plywood sheeting, bamboo, industrial pipe, telescopic metal poles, or even modified wooden crates or pallets. To fasten legs cut from 2x4 boards, drill 2 screws through the outer edge of each leg and into the end of the central support piece on each side of the desk. Then, sink another screw every 7 inches (18 cm) along the length of the support. Jostle your desk gently when you’re finished to confirm that it’s stable.  Store-bought desk legs typically have screw holes molded into the ends to make the assembly process a cinch. You may need to get creative when it comes to putting on legs made from converted or salvaged materials, depending on the general shape and configuration of the pieces. Summary:","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to build a desk using 2x4 boards, focusing on constructing and attaching the legs. The process involves cutting the 2x4 board into support pieces and legs. The support pieces should be measured by considering the width of the desktop and the width of the legs. The leg length should account for the thickness of the desktop. Painting or staining legs to match or contrast with the desktop is optional. Premade desk and table legs can be found at hardware stores, home improvement centers, and furniture stores. Metal legs, square frames, wooden pedestals, and sawhorses can be used for desired desk styles. Additionally, other unconventional materials and objects, such as plywood sheeting, bamboo, industrial pipe, telescopic metal poles, wooden crates, or pallets, can be used as legs. Fastening the legs involves drilling screws through the outer edge of each leg into the support piece and sinking a screw every 7 inches along the support. If using store-bought desk legs, screw holes are usually molded into the ends for easy assembly, while attaching legs made from converted or salvaged materials may require more creativity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What did Mozart hear in Mannheim?  During the 1750s  Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ. In 1789, Mozart was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der Associierten to re-orchestrate several... Answer:","output":"When Mozart first heard Handel's \\"Messiah\\" in Mannheim in 1777, he experienced a significant and renowned piece of work that had been growing in popularity and performed all over Europe and beyond, even reaching the American continent with concerts in New York, Florence, and Hamburg. At that time, \\"Messiah\\" had already established a presence in various religious establishments and music festivals, as well as expanded its influence through the practice of featuring its individual choruses and arias in church services or concerts. By the time Mozart encountered \\"Messiah,\\" there was an emerging trend of large-scale performances, such as the commemorative concerts held in Westminster Abbey in 1784. These performances boasted an extensive lineup of performers and instrumentalists, exceeding 500 participants under the direction of Joah Bates. Although many of these large-scale performances claimed to follow Handel's original intentions, they often incorporated grandiose orchestral arrangements, which may or may not reflect the original vision of the composer. In addition to impressive performances in England, the \\"Messiah\\" was being adapted on the European continent to suit the shifting musical tastes by re-orchestrating Handel's score. For instance, Johann Adam Hiller produced a reimagined version of the work performed at Berlin Cathedral in 1786, and later in 1788, a rendition with an orchestra that included unique and unconventional elements like clarinets, trombones, and multiple timpani. As Mozart began to engage with \\"Messiah,\\" he himself received a commission from Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der Associierten to create a re-orchestrated version of Handel's work. Van Swieten, an Austrian diplomat and music patron, contributed significantly to popularizing Baroque music during the Classical period. Therefore, Mozart's introduction to the \\"Messiah\\" in Mannheim led him to be an integral part of the evolving legacy of Handel's piece, with his adaptations further extending its reach and influence across Europe. In conclusion, when Mozart first heard Handel's \\"Messiah\\" in Mannheim, he experienced a monumental composition that had already garnered widespread acclaim and undergone various transformations according to the evolving tastes and preferences of its listeners. This encounter with \\"Messiah\\" prompted him to contribute his own version of the work, carrying on the tradition of re-interpretation and adaptation, as well as solidifying the piece's enduring influence on the world of music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Decide on the location for two different stations: one for your tent and one for your cooking station. Keep a safe distance between your cooking station and your tent, just to lower the chances of wildlife poking around your tent. Set up your tent according to the instructions once you’ve decided where you’d like to place it, and lay out your sleeping pads, bags, blankets, and pillows. If you’ve never set up a tent before, it might be a good idea to take a stab at it before your trip. Most tents come with detailed instructions and aren’t very difficult to erect, so just be patient and it’ll get done in no time! Get your cooking area set up about 200 feet (61 m) away from your tent. Check your location’s rules to see if you need to set up a bear box or bag to hold your food. Keep all food containers closed when you’re not using them, and dispose of trash as soon as you can. If you’re backpacking, put all trash into a resealable bag so its scent doesn’t travel far. Plan on wearing different clothes when you cook, especially if you’ll be grilling meat. Wear a jacket or top that you can leave with your food instead of taking it back to the tent. A greasy, smoky shirt that smells like hamburger might be a temptation to prowling creatures. Once you’ve put up your tent, take a walk around the campsite to figure out how far away the amenities are. If you’re backpacking, it’s really important to establish where you’ll go to the bathroom, how to get to water, and where the firewood is before the sun sets.  Once nighttime comes and you’re using a flashlight to get around, you’ll be glad to know the general direction you need to go. For men and boys, peeing on the trees can be a fun and convenient part of any camping trip - especially at night, when facilities are a long distance away, or if there is a limited supply of facilities for defecation and/or female campers.  The only restrictions are that you use common sense when you do this and always go at least 200 feet away from a water source. in a safe and appropriate spot when you’re ready for it. If you’re at a campsite, there may be a specific place where you need to make your fires, like a fire pit. If you’re out in the woods, create your own fire pit that is at least 8 feet (2.4 m) away from dead grass and other vegetation. Dig down into the dirt 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) and create a mound of dirt around the hole to act as a wall. You can also put rocks around the dirt area to enclose it and keep the fire in place. Every fire needs tinder, kindling, and firewood. Tinder is something small, like pieces of cardboard, lint, or wood shavings. Kindling is made up of small twigs and branches. Firewood can be whole or split logs, and it always needs to be dry. Once you have your campsite set up, take a moment to say “hi” to anyone who is camping near you. You might make some new friends, and it’s helpful to be familiar with who is nearby in case either of you needs help at some point. It can be exhausting just setting up camp, so take a load off, have a snack, and rest for a little while before moving on to your first activity. If you’re camping with pets, take them around the campsite and let them smell everything. There are lots of new scents and it’ll help them calm down if they can explore a little. Summary:","output":"Setting up your campsite starts with identifying where to pitch your tent and where to place your cooking station, ideally about 200 feet (61 m) apart to deter wildlife from your sleeping area. Familiarize yourself with tent setup using instructions provided, and prepare your sleeping gear. You might need to check local camping rules about food storage for wildlife safety. Ensure all food containers are closed when not in use and dispose of trash responsibly. Bring clothes specifically for cooking, particularly if you're grilling meat, to keep food smells away from sleeping areas. Explore your campsite to locate amenities, especially if you're backpacking, and establish areas for bathroom use, water sources, and collecting firewood before it gets dark. For males, they could opt for peeing on trees, provided it's 200 feet away from a water source and done with common sense. You might need to create your own fire pit in the wilderness, ensuring it's safely distanced from dead grass and other vegetation. Gather tinder, kindling, and firewood, all of which need to be dry. Finally, introduce yourself to other campers nearby because it can facilitate cooperation in case of emergencies. Camping can be tiring, so take breaks, your next step would be to start your first activity.

In a study conducted in England, 87.1% of non-pedigree cats were type A, while only 54.6% of pedigree cats were type A. Type A and B cats have naturally occurring alloantibodies to the opposite blood type, although the reaction of Type B cats to Type A blood is more severe than vice versa. Based on this, all cats should have a simple blood typing test done to determine their blood type prior to a transfusion or breeding to avoid the haemolytic disease (or neonatal isoerythrolysis). It is also important to check donor cats for FeLV/FIV status.

Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man.

Article: A few years ago, Priscilla and I visited Kaua\`i and fell in love with the island. We kept coming back with family and friends, and eventually decided to plant roots ourselves. We bought land near Pila'a and our family is dedicated to preserving its wildlife and natural beauty.      We've heard from many in the community and learned more about the cultural and historical significance of this land. Over the past week, we've spoken with community leaders and shared that our intention is to achieve an outcome that preserves the environment, respects local traditions, and is fair to those with kuleana lands.      To find a better path forward, we are dropping our quiet title actions and will work together with the community on a new approach. We understand that for native Hawaiians, kuleana are sacred and the quiet title process can be difficult. We want to make this right, talk with the community, and find a better approach.      The land is made up of a few properties in Waipake, Pila'a, and several kuleana within them. As this community knows, the history of this land is complex. Many of you have shared your families' stories, and we want to honor their history.      Before we acquired land in Waipake, it was set to be sub-divided by a commercial developer and built into about 80 homes, which could have impacted endangered monk seals and albatross. As soon as we bought this land, we formally withdrew this process. Now the land will be preserved with minimal development, and large portions will be maintained for farming by the community.      Pila'a has an even more complex history. Years before we bought the land, the Environmental Protection Agency had to step in to establish a consent decree to protect it. We are committed to being good stewards of this beautiful land. We hope to build a home for our family here.      There are also several kuleana across Pila'a. Some belong to descendants of Manuel Rapozo, and others have had no inhabitants for many decades. Over generations, there are not always clear records of ownership, and many families with a stake in these kuleana may not even be aware.      For the kuleana descended from Manuel Rapozo, the only inhabitant is his great grandson, Carlos Andrade, who has lived on and cared for these lands for more than forty years. He is 72 years old, retired, and wants to clear up the titles of these kuleana so he can pass the land on to his children. He will continue his quiet title action and upon completion his family will have ownership of those kuleana. He has been a steward of his family lands and we support him in this effort.      Other kuleana have no dwellings or inhabitants at all. In some cases, it is unclear whether any other families are partial owners. We reached out to families on Kaua\`i and off island to discuss this directly. After that, we initiated the quiet title process to identify any other partial owners so we could also pay them their fair share.      Upon reflection, I regret that I did not take the time to fully understand the quiet title process and its history before we moved ahead. Now that I understand the issues better, it's clear we made a mistake.      The right path is to sit down and discuss how to best move forward. We will continue to speak with community leaders that represent different groups, including native Hawaiians and environmentalists, to find the best path.      Beyond this process, we are also looking for more ways to support the community as neighbors. We have contributed to community organizations and will continue to do so. We work with wildlife experts to preserve endangered species. We hope to do much more in the future.      We love Kaua\`i and we want to be good members of the community for the long term. Thank you for welcoming our family into your community.      Mark Zuckerberg      -----      Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO and founder of social media network Facebook. ||||| Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will no longer pursue litigation intended to buy up small parcels of land on Kauai from kamaaina families to enhance the seclusion of his 700-acre estate on the Garden Isle.      SHARE                                                ADVERTISING      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will no longer pursue litigation intended to buy up small parcels of land on Kauai from kamaaina families to enhance the seclusion of his 700-acre estate on the Garden Isle.      Zuckerberg announced his decision to drop eight quiet title lawsuits in a letter to the editor sent to The Garden Island newspaper on Kauai.      “Upon reflection, I regret that I did not take the time to fully understand the quiet title process and its history before we moved ahead,” he wrote. “Now that I understand the issues better, it’s clear we made a mistake.”      Zuckerberg filed the lawsuits Dec. 30. The complaints targeted 13 parcels that are mostly one acre in size or smaller and are known as kuleana lands, which give every owner rights that include access to the property and water as well as residential use. These kuleana parcels, originally awarded to residents of Hawaii by Hawaiian government officials under the Kuleana Act of 1850, are all within the 700 acres Zuckerberg purchased two years ago for around 100 million.      The billionaire co-founder of Facebook said he heard from many community members who conveyed the cultural and historical significance of these kuleana lands after he filed the lawsuits in state court.      “We understand that for Native Hawaiians, kuleana are sacred and the quiet title process can be difficult,” he said in his letter, which the newspaper published today. “We want to make this right, talk with the community, and find a better approach. To find a better path forward, we are dropping our quiet title actions and will work together with the community on a new approach.”      Zuckerberg’s decision came after an initial story in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser last week that was first to publicly disclose and detail one of the eight lawsuits.      On Tuesday, Zuckerberg announced that he was “reconsidering” his litigation. On Thursday, the Star-Advertiser published details of the other seven lawsuits that involved adverse possession claims, a contention that people before Zuckerberg who claimed to own some kuleana parcels or surrounding lands had acquired possession of the kuleana parcels just by openly using them for 10 or 20 years without opposition.      “The right path is to sit down and discuss how to best move forward,” Zuckerberg said in his letter. “We will continue to speak with community leaders that represent different groups, including Native Hawaiians and environmentalists, to find the best path. We love Kauai and we want to be good members of the community for the long term. Thank you for welcoming our family into your community.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided against pursuing litigation that intended to purchase small plots of land on Kauai from native Hawaiian families to expand the seclusion of his 700-acre estate.

Information:  - Plant cells are eukaryotic cells that differ in several key aspects from the cells of other eukaryotic organisms. Their distinctive features include:  - Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae. It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. \\"Volvox\\" diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately .  - Cyanobacteria , also known as Cyanophyta, is a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis. The name \\"cyanobacteria\\" comes from the color of the bacteria (= blue). Sometimes, they are called blue-green algae, and incorrectly so, because cyanobacteria are prokaryotes and the term \\"algae\\" is reserved for eukaryotes.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Pandorina is a genus of green algae composed of 8 , 16 , or sometimes 32 cells , held together at their bases to form a sack globular colony surrounded by mucilage . The cells are ovoid or slightly narrowed at one end to appear keystone - or pear - shaped . Each cell has two flagella with two contractile vacuoles at their base , an eyespot , and a large cup - shaped chloroplast with at least one pyrenoid . The colonies coordinate their flagellar movement to create a rolling , swimming motion . Pandorina shows the beginnings of the colony polarity and differentiation seen in Volvox since the anterior cells have larger eyespots . Molecular sequencing has shown that Pandorina is paraphyletic with respect to Volvulina . Asexual reproduction is by simultaneous division of all cells of the colony to form autocolonies that are liberated by a gelatinization of the colonial envelope . Sexual reproduction occurs by division of each cell of the colony into 16 - 32 zoogametes . Zoogametes show indications of heterogamy , a slight difference in the size and motility of the pairs that fuse to form the smooth walled zygote . ( Smith , 1920 , p. 95 ) .  - Pyrenoids are sub-cellular micro-compartments found in chloroplasts of many algae, and in a single group of land plants, the hornworts. Pyrenoids are associated with the operation of a carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM). Their main function is to act as centres of carbon dioxide (CO) fixation, by generating and maintaining a CO rich environment around the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Pyrenoids therefore seem to have a role analogous to that of carboxysomes in cyanobacteria.  - The Volvocaceae are a family of unicellular or colonial biflagellates, including the typical genus \\"Volvox\\". The family was named by Ehrenberg in 1834, and is known in older classifications as the Volvocidae. All species are colonial and inhabit freshwater environments.  - Chloroplasts are organelles, specialized subunits, in plant and algal cells. Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (18321897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks  sometimes called \\"The Father of Plant Physiology\\".  - In taxonomy, Volvulina is a genus of colonial green algae, specifically of the Volvocaceae. The colony (coenobium) is broadly ellipsoidal or spherical and consists of a fixed number of cells, usually 16 in mature individuals (rarely 4, 8 or 32). The cells are located at periphery of the coenobium and separated from each other by being embedded in a swollen sack. The cell body is lens-shaped or half spherical when mature with two flagella. The chloroplast is dish- or bowl-shaped. Pyrenoids may be present or absent, the stigma large. The nucleus is centrally located and there may be 4 to 8 contractile vacuoles. Sexual reproduction is by isogamy.  - Mucilage is a thick, gluey substance produced by nearly all plants and some microorganisms. It is a polar glycoprotein and an exopolysaccharide. Mucilage in plants plays a role in the storage of water and food, seed germination, and thickening membranes. Cacti (and other succulents) and flax seeds especially are rich sources of mucilage.  - Hornworts are a group of non-vascular plants comprising the division Anthocerotophyta. The common name refers to the elongated horn-like structure, which is the sporophyte. As in mosses and liverworts, the flattened, green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte plant.  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - Germination is the process by which a plant grows from a seed. The most common example of germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of an angiosperm or gymnosperm. In addition, the growth of a sporeling from a spore, such as the spores of hyphae from fungal spores, is also germination. Thus, in a general sense, germination can be thought of as anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or germ.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"George gave Jessica the book.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would most likely rate the sentence, \\"George gave Jessica the book,\\" as linguistically acceptable because it adheres to several important rules and principles of English syntax and semantics. In order to provide a more comprehensive analysis, we will evaluate the sentence on several linguistic levels. 1. Phonology: Phonology is the study of how sounds function and pattern in a language. The sentence contains sounds that are part of the English language and is phonologically well-formed. Each word can be pronounced following the rules of English phonotactics, which determine the allowable combinations of phonemes (basic units of sound) within a language. 2. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the structure and formation of words. In the sentence, all the words are morphologically correct. They all adhere to the rules that govern the formation of words in the English language. For example, \\"gave\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"give,\\" formed correctly with the past tense suffix. 3. Syntax: Syntax involves the arrangement and ordering of words in a sentence. The sentence follows typical English word order, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this sentence, \\"George\\" functions as the subject, \\"gave\\" is the verb, and \\"the book\\" is the direct object. Additionally, we have an indirect object, \\"Jessica,\\" which represents the recipient of the direct object. The correct positioning of the indirect object is right after the verb and before the direct object. 4. Semantics: Semantics deals with the study of meaning in language. From a semantic point of view, the sentence is also acceptable. Each word within the sentence has a clear meaning, and when combined, they create a logical and coherent message. The sentence communicates that George transferred possession of a book to Jessica. 5. Pragmatics: Pragmatics involves the use of language in context, including how people produce and interpret meanings in specific social situations. This sentence is pragmatically acceptable as it can be uttered in various contexts where one might want to express the action of George giving a book to Jessica. Additionally, the indirect object in the sentence adds to the sentence's informativeness, contextual clarity, and relevance. 6. Register and style: While linguistic register and style might not be strictly considered with regard to a sentence's acceptability, it should be mentioned that this sentence is neutral in tone and formality. The words used are standard English, and the sentence can be easily understood by speakers of various age groups, educational backgrounds, and social contexts. This adds to the overall acceptability of the sentence. In conclusion, the sentence, \\"George gave Jessica the book,\\" can be considered linguistically acceptable by a linguist. It follows the rules of English phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics, and it is pragmatically functional and stylistically neutral."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
