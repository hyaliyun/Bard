Bio: graham arnold withey -lrb- born 11 june 1960 in bristol -rrb- is an english former professional footballer who played in the football league , as a forward .","output":"From the given bio of Graham Arnold Withey, several details can be gathered. They include information about his personal life, professional career, and the specific role he played in the sport. Here, we can break down the gathered details into three main categories: Personal Life, Professional Career, and Football Position. 1. Personal Life:    a. Name: Graham Arnold Withey    b. Birthdate: 11 June 1960    c. Birthplace: Bristol, England    d. Nationality: English 2. Professional Career:    a. Occupation: Former professional footballer    b. Tenure: The phrase \\"former professional footballer\\" suggests that he has retired from his professional football career, but the bio doesn't provide information about the duration of his career or the years he played.    c. Football League: Graham Withey played in the Football League, which is a system of professional football leagues in England. It usually refers to the English Football League (EFL), which, before 1992, was the highest level of domestic football and consisted of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Divisions. After 1992, it represents the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels of English football, as the highest level became the Premier League. The bio does not, however, specify which division(s) he played in or the clubs he played for during his career. 3. Football Position:    a. Forward: Graham Withey played as a forward on the field. In football, forwards, also known as strikers or attackers, are responsible for the majority of goal-scoring opportunities and play closest to the opposing team's goal. Their primary objective is to score goals and create scoring chances for their teammates. Although the bio does not provide information about his specific playing style, tactical role, or the number of goals he scored, his role as a forward suggests his offensive capabilities and contribution to his team. To summarize, Graham Withey was born on 11 June 1960 in Bristol, England, and is a former English professional footballer. He played as a forward in the Football League, but the bio lacks further details about his career, including the clubs he represented, the years he was active, and any achievements he might have had during his tenure in the professional football scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Alison Bechdel, Who Created 'Bechdel Test,' Wins MacArthur Prize The MacArthur Foundation has announced the 21 recipients of this year’s fellowships, often referred to as the “genius grant,” and among the honorees is cartoonist and graphic artist Alison Bechdel, who is known for her graphic memoirs Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic and Are You My Mother? The prestigious fellowships, which are awarded based on achievement and potential, come with a stipend of 625,000, spread over five years, which can be spent in any way the honorees see fit. Bechdel, who is currently at an artist residency in Italy, told the Los Angeles Times that when she received the call announcing she won, “It was crazy.” She added, “It was a little garbled, then I heard the person on the other end say the words MacArthur Foundation and the world started spinning.” Bechdel is only the second graphic novelist to win the fellowship after Ben Katchor won in 2000. Even those who aren’t familiar with her cartoons or graphic memoirs have likely heard of the 54-year-old Bechdel, whose work has inadvertently upended the way we think about movies with her now famous Bechdel Test. The test, which the cartoonist coined in 1985 in a strip called “The Rule,” asks three questions of a film as a way to demonstrate the very basic level at which gender biases operate in movies: 1) Does the movie have two female characters?; 2) Do the speak to each other?; 3) Do they speak about something other than a man? Sadly, many movies — even today, almost 20 years after the test was created — don’t pass. Yet the very fact that the Bechdel Test has become a mainstream concept, rather than a niche, radical feminist idea, proves how much influence it has had. Out of the 21 prizes awarded, eight other women were also honored. The New York Times reports that the oldest fellow this year is 71-year-old Pamela O. Long, a historian of science and technology in Washington, and the youngest is 32-year-old Danielle S. Bassett, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania. The other honorees this year are a mix of artists, filmmakers, social activists, poets, historians and scientists that include John Henneberger, Mary L. Bonauto, Sarah Deer, Jonathan Rapping, Jacob Lurie, filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer, Ai-jen Poo, Rick Lowe, Samuel D. Hunter, Steve Coleman, Terrance Hayes, Yitang Zhang, Jennifer L. Eberhardt, Tami Bond, Mark Hersam, Craig Gentry, Khaled Mattawa and Tara Zahra. When asked about the stipend, Bechdel told the LA Times, “It will give me a lot of security that I don’t have. Pay off some debts, save for retirement — really boring stuff.” But she also added that it will allow her to “take some risks, do something new — to really plunge into my work. It’s an incredible gift.” Summary:","output":"Cartoonist and graphic artist Alison Bechdel, who created the well-known \\"Bechdel Test,\\" has been announced as one of the 21 recipients of this year's MacArthur Foundation fellowships, also known as the \\"genius grant.\\" The prestigious fellowship awards come with a 625,000 stipend over five years to be used by the recipients in any way they choose.

And the answer is?","output":"Opprobrium refers to a deep form of public disgrace or criticism resulting from one's actions, behavior, or conduct, causing them to lose the respect of others. The word has its origins in Latin, derived from \\"opprobrium\\" which means reproach, disgrace, or shame. In English, the term is often used to emphasize the intense disapproval or condemnation held by the community or society towards an individual or their actions. When someone is subjected to opprobrium, they experience a severe loss of reputation and may face humiliation, scorn, and contempt from the people around them. This could be a result of their immoral, unethical, or socially unacceptable actions that are considered beyond the pale. The consequences of opprobrium can have a significant impact on an individual's personal and professional life, often leading to isolation and exclusion from social or professional circles. Examples of events that may lead to opprobrium include but are not limited to: 1. A political scandal involving corruption, fraud, or abuse of power. 2. A high-profile individual being exposed for engaging in criminal activities or gross misconduct. 3. Public figures making offensive or incendiary remarks about a particular racial, religious, or social group. 4. People engaging in unethical business practices or exploiting others for personal gain. 5. Cases where a person of authority abuses their position for selfish purposes. It is important to note that the concept of opprobrium is not limited only to individuals; groups, organizations, or even entire nations can be subjected to opprobrium for actions that are perceived to be morally or ethically repugnant. The concept has also been employed in the study of social psychology, where it may be examined in conjunction with subjects such as deviance and sanctioning.  In summary, opprobrium refers to a deep form of public disgrace or criticism, often resulting from an individual's or group's actions that are seen as highly reproachable, immoral, or unethical. The experience of opprobrium can have severe personal and societal consequences, affecting one's reputation and relationships within their community."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The countryside aroundStratfordis pleasant, with its beautiful woods, green fields and quiet rivers.  The first place we visited was the house in the center of Stratfordwhere Shakespeare was born. We saw the small desk that Shakespeare sat at when he went to school. One of the things we liked best was the garden behind the house, because we could see there many of the flowers, trees and plants that Shakespeare wrote about in his plays.  After we had visited Shakespeare's birthplace, we went to see the church where he was buried.  We had lunch in a very old hotel that was probably there in Shakespeare's time. Every room of the hotel had the name of one of Shakespeare's plays on the door--the \\"Hamlet\\" room, the \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" room, and so on.  After lunch we walked across the fields to the old cottage, about a mile out of Stratford, where Shakespeare spent most of his married life. The cottage is just as it was in Shakespeare's day. We saw the chairs where Shakespeare perhaps sat and thought about ideas for new plays, and we saw the plates from which he probably ate his dinner.  When we got back to our hotel that evening, we were tired, but we had enjoyed a wonderful day. Question: Most of Shakespeare's married life was spent   _  .

Reducing resource use means just what it says using fewer resources. There are lots of ways to reduce our use of resources. Buy durable goods. Choose items that are well made so they will last longer. Youll buy fewer items in the long run, so youll save money as well as resources. Thats a win-win! Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt. Youll use fewer resources and save money. Buy only what you need. Dont buy a gallon of milk if you can only drink half of it before it spoils. Instead, buy a half gallon and drink all of it. You wont be wasting resources (or money!) Buy local.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which project would register higher CPU load, project A or project C?  Bob works for a data storage company. He has now three projects, project A, project B, and project C, simultaneously going on. All of them involves storing  XML data. Project A has small volume of data, but project B and project C has large volume of data. He applied Fast Infoset format for project B, but didn't apply that format for project C.  Hint: Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent. Answer:","output":"Project C would register a higher CPU load. Both Project B and Project C involve storing large volumes of data, which we know can often exceed reasonable limits and increase CPU load as the system must put more power into processing the XML data. However, the crucial difference between the two is the format in which the data is stored.  For Project B, Bob applied the Fast Infoset format. This format is beneficial because it can reduce the data volume by as much as 80 percent, thereby lessening the burden on the CPU. A decreased data volume implies lesser data for the system to read and process, so less power is required. This directly impacts the CPU load, causing it to be lower with the use of Fast Infoset format. On the other hand, for Project C, Bob did not apply the Fast Infoset format. This means that the large volume of XML data is not being reduced, and the system is tasked with managing the full volume of data. The CPU load would go up due to the increased power needed to process this large volume of XML data. Comparing this to Project A, which has a small volume of data, regardless of the non-use of Fast Infoset format, the CPU load would still be less because the amount of data that needs processing is much smaller. Therefore, in the context of these three projects, since Project C has a large volume of XML data without the reduction benefits of the Fast Infoset format, it would register a higher CPU load compared to Projects A and B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is credited with very few works?, using the article: The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan., what would be the answer ?

I know that the answer to the question \\"Was Origin published in Spanish or Polish first?\\" is in \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions.

Context: Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. pick from the following. a). negative b). positive Short movie review: does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review provided, it is evident that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. There are several factors that support this conclusion. Firstly, the language used in the review is quite negative. When a reviewer states that a movie \\"doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting,\\" it implies that the plot is weak or poorly executed, and the performances of the actors are subpar or not engaging. Both of these factors are crucial to the overall success and enjoyment of a film, and if a movie fails to deliver in these areas, it may be considered a disappointment to the audience. Secondly, the review offers no positive aspects of the movie for the reader to consider. Generally, when a movie receives a favorable review, the critic will often mention the highlights and strengths of the film, such as strong characters, quick pacing, impressive visuals, or thought-provoking themes. In contrast, this review solely focuses on the film's shortcomings, which further supports the notion that the critic is thinking negatively of the movie. Moreover, if the critic were thinking positively about the movie, they might have chosen a different wording in their review. For instance, they could have mentioned the redeeming qualities of the film despite its lack of plot or acting. They might have also focused on other elements that were well-executed, such as the use of music, cinematography, or set design. However, none of these aspects were discussed in the review, thus solidifying the conclusion that the critic is not impressed with the movie and is therefore thinking negatively. In conclusion, the critic's thoughts on the movie are negative based on the language used in the review, the lack of any positive aspects mentioned, and the absence of highlighting any redeeming qualities. As a result, readers will likely form a negative impression of the movie and may be less inclined to watch it themselves, directly influencing the movie's potential success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gloves, work clothing, and protective eyewear are all recommended. If you have single cracks less than ¼\\" (6mm) wide, use asphalt crack filler. Check the label for application instructions or apply as follows:  Shake the bottle to mix the product evenly. Cut off the top of the nozzle so the opening is narrower than the crack. (If there is no nozzle, load the product into an asphalt caulk gun instead.) Squeeze the filler directly into the crack until it is flush with the driveway. Let dry for 24 hours. If the filler has sunk below the driveway surface level, apply an additional coat. Wait at least 24 hours after the final coat before walking or driving over the repair. This material is intended for \\"alligator scale\\" or \\"spiderweb\\" crack patterns, single cracks wider than ¼\\" (6mm), and small depressions shallower than 2\\" (5cm). If the alligator cracks are severe, chunks of the asphalt may be fully separated from the driveway.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who possibly acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin? from the following article ?  Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"avoid retaking the course\\" a valid answer? Choose from: (a). Yes (b). No Answer:","output":"While making a choice between options (a) Yes and (b) No is a direct way to answer the given question, let's provide a more in-depth analysis to better understand the context and the validity of the answer. First, let's consider the question that Quinn is expected to answer: \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" This question is quite open-ended, as it does not specify who \\"Others\\" are or what situation they find themselves in. However, with the additional context provided, we know that Quinn wants to pass a course and has worked hard towards it. We can infer that \\"Others\\" probably refers to fellow students in the same course or academic environment. The answer Quinn has proposed, \\"avoid retaking the course,\\" implies that the primary concern for these other students is passing the course and not having to repeat it. This could be seen as a valid answer, assuming that the primary motivation for the majority of the students is to pass the course in order to save time, resources, and maintain their desired academic trajectory. However, the answer could also be deemed as too narrow or specific. A more comprehensive answer might take into account various factors affecting students besides not wanting to retake the course. Some students might have different priorities or circumstances that dictate their next move. Here are just a few possibilities: - They might want to master the particular subject for their career path, regardless of whether they retake the course or not. - They could be focused on acquiring critical thinking, problem-solving, and social skills, which are essential and sought after by employers. - Their priorities might include building relationships, networking, or gaining extracurricular achievements to boost their résumés. - Students might be pursuing personal interests and passions outside of the course, which contributes to their sense of well-being and overall satisfaction. In summary, while \\"avoid retaking the course\\" could be a valid answer for some students, it may be insufficient to address the open-ended query. A more complete answer could discuss various factors that drive students to make decisions in an academic setting. It is essential to consider different motivations, aspirations, and circumstances surrounding their choices, lending to a more in-depth understanding of what \\"Others\\" might want to do next. In this context, the validity of the answer as originally provided is not as definitive and would fall more in line with option (b) No."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: Lemon Tree Movie plot: Salma, a Palestinian widow - living there for decades - has to stand up against her new neighbor, the Israeli Defence Minister, when he moves into his new house opposite her lemon grove, on the green line border between Israel and the West Bank. The Israeli security forces are quick to declare that Salma's trees pose a threat to the Ministers safety and issue orders to uproot them. Together with Ziad Daud, a young Palestinian lawyer, Salma goes all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court to try and save her trees. Her struggle raises the interest of Mira Navon, the Defence Minister's wife, trapped in her new home and in an unhappy life. Despite their differences, and the borders between them, the two women develop an invisible bond, while forbidden ties grow stronger between Salma and Ziad. Salmas legal and personal journey lead her deep into the complex, dark and sometimes funny chaos of the ongoing struggle in the Middle East, in which all players find themselves alone in their struggle to survive. As usual, the Palestinian cause is dismissed, the movie ends with the Israeli wife moving out (obviously separating from her husband), a tall concrete wall has been built between the two properties and a final camera shot shows us half the trees have been cut right down.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Who is greatest teacher in Chinese history? You can't think of anyone else when you hear people read Confucius   2,500 year-old words: \\"All study but no thinking makes people puzzled.\\"  All thinking but no study makes people lazy. Tuesday was Confucius' birthday. He was born on September 28,551 BC in the Kingdom of Lu  , in today's Shandong Province. Chinese look upon Confucius as the greatest thinker and also the greatest teacher. He had about 3,000 students. For more than 2,000 years, Confucius' ideas have been around in people's everyday lives. Now they have gone far into Western countries and south Asia. People can still hear _ today. Why are his ideas so popular? They help not only in everyday life but also society. Confucius' most important ideas are kindness and good manners. Confucius said young people should take care of the old. People should give up thinking of themselves and work for others. As a great teacher, Confucius said that all should go to school if they wanted to learn. Some of Confucius' popular words are \\"A kind person should care others\\" and \\"Be strict with yourself, but be kind to others\\". People use his ideas to help themselves and society. Now, more than 100 Internet web sites are teaching people about Confucius and his ideas. \\"Kindness and honesty are the best values of the world today,\\" said 79-year-old Kong Fanjin who was studying Confucius.","output":"Question: Who is considered the greatest teacher in Chinese history, and what are some main ideas in his teachings?

Options: a ) rs . 880 , b ) rs . 890 , c ) rs . 895 , d ) rs . 900 , e ) none A:","output":"To solve this problem, first, we need to find the principal amount (P), which will allow us to find the simple interest. First, use the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) In this case: - A is the total amount after interest has been added - P is the principal amount (the initial sum of money) - r is the interest rate (10% per annum or 0.10) - n is the number of times interest is compounded per time period (we'll assume annually, so n=1) - t is the number of time periods (3 years) We know the compound interest (CI) is rs. 993 after 3 years. To find the principal amount, we first need to find the total amount (A): CI = A - P 993 = A - P Now we apply the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + 0.10)^3 We need to find P in this equation, so let's solve for P in the CI equation: CI + P = A 993 + P = A Since A is equal in both equations, we can equate them and solve for P: P(1 + 0.10)^3 = 993 + P Let's simplify and solve for P: P(1.10)^3 = 993 + P P(1.331) = 993 + P P*1.331 = P + 993 P*1.331 - P = 993 P(1.331 - 1) = 993 P(0.331) = 993 P = 993 / 0.331 P ≈ 3000 (approximately) Now that we have the principal amount (P = rs. 3000), we can find the simple interest using the simple interest formula = (P * r * t). Let's plug in the values: Simple Interest (SI) = (3000 * 0.10 * 3) SI = (3000 * 0.3) SI = 900 So the answer is option d) rs. 900."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can't believe I'm going to say this, because I've eaten so many places, but I think the dinner I had at Fleur de Lys is the best meal I've ever eaten. I had the four-course Elegance prix fixe menu, and each dish is etched in my memory -- the tuna tartare with an amazing blend of herbs and a minty note, the barely-there slivers of veal ravioli floating in jus and foam, the filet mignon that remade the flavors of a basic dish into its own unique thing, and the chocolate souffle.  Service was excellent and attentive. There's a bit of the overindulgent goofiness that strikes me at any fancy restaurant, but to their credit the descriptions of each dish were succinct and useful (not the litany you sometimes get, where a waiter is explaining to you the name of the farmer's cousin who picked the radicchio).  Something else I noticed is that you can have a sublime meal here for a variety of price points. One of my dinner companions had the three-course Lion King prix fixe, at 45 or 55; I had the four-course at 89; and two others had the four-course with wine pairings for about 150.

Math Problem Solve 143*t - 148*t + 25 = 0 for t.","output":"To solve the equation 143t - 148t + 25 = 0, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. Since both 143t and -148t are terms with the variable t in them, we can combine them. (143t - 148t) = -5t Step 2: Rewrite the simplified equation. Now our equation is -5t + 25 = 0. Step 3: Isolate the variable. To find the value of t, we need to isolate it by having it on one side of the equation and everything else on the other side. To do this, let's first subtract 25 from both sides: -5t + 25 - 25 = 0 - 25 -5t = -25 Step 4: Solve for t. Now, to isolate t, we need to divide both sides by -5: t = -25 / -5 Step 5: Simplify the answer.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir... My question: Who plays Prince Nasir?

He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better.

Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it appears this one didn't have any effect whatsoever on the class - whenever the teacher left, conversations quickly started - and I didn't hear the words \\"Shakespeare\\" or \\"Tempest\\" being used at all.

The costumes aren't too bad and neither are the special effects - the class may not have loved the film, but they weren't exactly taking the p*ss either.

Billy would put the bowl down and wait for Tumble to come up to the bowl to eat from it. When Tumble reached the bowl, he put his nose on it. But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat. Billy reached down and blew on the hot oatmeal, to cool it down for Tumble to eat. Once the oatmeal was cool enough, Tumble could dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal. Billy loved to watch as Tumble ate his bowl of oatmeal, because Billy took good care of Tumble, everyday.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. If there are no more water cubes being frozen, it means that the ice cube tray will not be refilled with water, and thus, no additional ice cubes will be made.

Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans. Now answer this question: What formed on the outside of the earth after it cooled?","output":"After the Earth cooled down, a solid crust formed on the outside of the Earth.

The 25-year-old has enjoyed a breakthrough season with English Premiership side Leicester, scoring one try in 17 appearances . \\"I've really enjoyed the year and it's been good to get out there and get games week to week,\\" said the Scarlets youth product, who joined Tigers from Rotherham in 2014. \\"My rugby's progressed this year. It's probably the toughest league in the world in terms of competition and every game is tough.\\" Born in Bangor but raised in Pwllheli in north Wales, Roberts has been given his chance this season because of injuries to Tuilagi and Toomua. Roberts has seized his opportunities and has also sought guidance from Tuilagi and Toomua as well as that of Tigers head coach, former New Zealand centre Aaron Mauger. \\"I try and learn as much as I can,\\" Roberts told BBC Wales Sport. \\"I was lucky enough to play with Manu for a few games and I really enjoyed that. \\"I've learnt a lot off him and Matt Toomua is around the training ground and I can pick his brains when I want. \\"If I can learn a little bit off them then I'll be better for it. \\"Then you've got Aaron Mauger, who was a world class centre himself. \\"Mauger has been a massive help for me. He's looked at my game and looked at ways for me to keep improving. \\"He's put a lot of faith and trust in me and played me in big games when he probably had opportunities to play other people. \\"I'm very grateful he's put his trust in me and I think I've repaid that trust he's put in me.\\" Having made a breakthrough at Tigers this season, Roberts will leave Welford Road and the English Premiership at the end of the current season. Roberts will return to Wales, having signed for Cardiff Blues. \\"The main driving force behind the move was to play back in Wales,\\" said Roberts, who studied at Cardiff University. \\"When you're playing in Wales you are in the limelight a bit more and I enjoyed living in Cardiff when I was a student. \\"I've not played regional rugby and I'm really looking forward to that. \\"Cardiff Blues are a club who are going in the right direction and it's an exciting place to be at the moment,\\" Roberts said. \\"They're playing some good rugby and have some good young coaches and they're building a really good squad. I'm excited to get started.\\" Roberts will compete with the likes of Rey Lee-Lo, Willis Halaholo, Garyn Smith and Harri Millard for a starting centre spot for the Blues next season. \\"All top clubs, whether it be Leicester or Cardiff, are always going to have strength in depth,\\" Roberts said. \\"It will be tough competition but I don't think it gets much tougher than Leicester having to compete for a place. \\"If you approach it in the right way it can help you become a better player. You can push each other to better things.\\" Roberts has represented Wales at Under-16 level and was also in the Under-18 squad. Moving back to Wales means Roberts will not have to rely on a wildcard selection for the senior national side. \\"Growing up in Pwllheli it's what I've always dreamt about doing,\\" Roberts added. \\"But that's not really at the forefront of my mind. I'm just looking to go to Cardiff and try and get in the team and play regularly every week. \\"We'll see what comes of that.\\" Should Roberts make it into the senior side, he will follow in the footsteps of friend and former Scarlets colleague George North. And Roberts says the Northampton Saints wing, raised in Anglesey, is an inspiration for young players in north Wales. \\"I've known George since I was about 10 years old and we played age group rugby together in north Wales,\\" Roberts said. \\"We then moved down to Llandovery College at the same time. He's a friend and I speak to him to quite often. \\"To have someone like George that youngsters can look up to and try and replicate is great for young lads up in north Wales.\\" Summary:","output":"Welsh rugby player Jack Roberts is leaving English Premiership side Leicester to join Cardiff Blues, citing a desire to play in Wales and be in the limelight as the main factors in his decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" was shot immediately after that of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", but it received less attention during production than the \\"higher-gloss, higher-profile video\\" for \\"If I Were a Boy\\". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix.

The foods you eat will have an effect on how far you are able to run, your energy levels, and the recovery process.  Whenever you have a run coming up, try to keep some of these diet tips in mind to help you feel your best and run your hardest:  Foods with carbohydrates and protein are good choices. Try eating things like bread, pasta, and rice to get carbohydrates in your diet. Include things like meat, fish, and eggs to get enough protein. Before doing any physical activity, it's a good idea to warm up.  Warming up before running can help prevent injury and improve the quality of your run.  Keep some of these general tips in mind when warming up before a run.  Walk for at least 5 to 10 minutes before a run. Doing some light stretching before a run can help you warm up. It's a good idea to cool down as well.  Try walking for around 5 to 10 minutes after a run. Training too often or too much can increase the chances of injury.  Although you may enjoy running, taking a break between runs can help keep you safe.  Make sure that you are breaking up your running schedule to help keep you running strong.  It's recommend that you run every other day. You might try cross-training on days off.  For example, on days you don't run you may lift weights. Running requires maintenance.  If you take too much time off from running, you will find running more difficult when you come back to it.  It's a good idea to make a regular schedule for your runs and stick to it, allowing you to avoid losing your ability to run a mile without stopping.  Include rest days in your schedule to allow your body time to recover. It can be fun to continue increasing the distance you run to help keep your routine interesting. Although running can improve your health and fitness, it may also cause injury.  Injuries from running most commonly occur when a person pushes themselves too far, trains while injured, or over-trains.  If you ever feel any pain during your runs or after, consider taking a break or cutting down on the distance you are running.  Make sure to increase distance gradually.  Adding too much distance to your runs, without training for it, can cause injury. Make sure your shoes are a good fit and are suitable for running. Don't train while injured.  Ask your doctor for other exercises you can do while the affected area heals.","output":"To optimize your running performance and prevent injury, it is essential to pay attention to your diet, warm-up routine, training schedule, and recovery process.

Consistency is key, but also remember to incorporate rest days to give your body time to recover. Gradually increasing the distance you run helps keep your routine dynamic and fun, but it's crucial to avoid pushing yourself too far and risk injury. Maintain a slow and steady progress, listening to your body and backing off if you experience pain during or after your runs. Make sure your running shoes are a good fit and specifically designed for running to ensure proper support. If you encounter an injury, refrain from training on the affected area and consult with a doctor for alternative exercises to remain active while healing.

The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric. Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy.

Pour into your sprayer and shake. Mist the windows and the cloth interior with the vinegar-water mixture before wiping any any excess. As it's applied, mixture may be redolent of vinegar, but the vinegar smell wears off quickly once it's dried. If you don't like the smell of coffee, you may be out of luck on this one, although the tactic really does work. Place six paper plates strategically throughout the car; onto each plate, spoon one cup of roasted coffee, evenly spread out across the entire plate. Keeping the windows down about an eighth of an inch, allow the coffee smell to permeate the car on a warm, sunny day. After a day, remove the coffee beans and enjoy the smell of your latte... er, car! Although not a surefire way of removing bad smoke odors from your car, this method is reputed to work because newspaper is an odor absorbent. Crumple up a good number of old newspaper sheets and place them strategically throughout your cabin. Wait 48 hours for the newspaper to absorb all the smoke smells, and then remove the newspaper and recycle. As much most of the methods detailed in this article, this method can work in combination with other methods. Use this method to increase your chances of removing odors while placing coffee beans in your car, for example, or when coating it with baking soda. You can find activated charcoal at pet supply stores, health food stores, or even bigger department stores. Place a cup or so of activated charcoal, which comes in powder form, in a bowl, and then place that bowl in your car. Wait for a day or two, after which time the charcoal should have worked its magic and absorbed a lot of the smells of smoke from your car.  Some animal products have activated charcoal in them, at far less cost. Kitty litter, for example, may contain it. In the end — it might be cheaper — and just as effective to place a bowl of kitty litter in your car rather than buy a huge supply of activated charcoal and only use it once.  Activated charcoal is a quite strong natural odor eliminator. If you've tried using baking soda and it's not eliminated the smell of smoke completely, try this method. It should neutralize the odor very well. A cup or so will do the job. Ammonia is very harsh, so be sure not to bunk up in the car while the ammonia is work on eliminating the car's odors. After removing, open the windows and air out the car for an hour or two before using the car. Repeat this every night for a week or two if the odor isn't eliminated after a single use.

Their work goes beyond the mere fascination with ancient objects; they strive to decipher and piece together the stories of the past.

The pursuit of truth is the driving force behind their dedication to deciphering the mysteries of ancient civilizations and cultures. This search for truth and desire to understand our past helps us gain insight into our own human story and allows us to learn from the experiences of those who came before us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Have you ever seen an egg? Some animals do not have live births. Instead, they lay eggs. The eggs contain the embryo. The embryo matures in the egg. With time, it will hatch. Some animals hatch and do not need care from their parents. They are ready to live on their own. Other animals will still need the care of their parents. Sea turtles break out of their shells. They immediately walk to the ocean. They do this with no help from an adult. Birds stay in the nest for many weeks. They are cared for by their parents. They leave the nest when they are strong enough to fly. Some animals give birth to live offspring. Animals like horses, cows, and whales give live birth. Their offspring are born looking like mini adults.  Question: \\"What are the two kinds of hatching behavior?\\" Answer: \\"Some animals hatch and do not need care from their parents. Other animals will still need the care of their parents\\" Is this answer correct? Select from:  (a). no  (b). yes...I think the answer is","output":"(b). yes The answer is indeed correct. The two kinds of hatching behavior are: 1. Animals that hatch and do not need care from their parents: These animals are often considered precocial, as they are relatively mature and mobile after hatching. They are generally able to start foraging for food on their own right away. An example of this type of hatching behavior is seen in sea turtles, as mentioned in the text. Upon hatching, they immediately make their way to the ocean without any help from adult turtles. 2. Animals that hatch and still need care from their parents: These animals are considered altricial, as they are usually less developed and require parental care for a certain period of time after hatching. This can include activities such as providing food, maintaining the nest, or offering protection. Birds are a prime example of this type of hatching behavior. Once hatched, baby birds (referred to as nestlings or hatchlings) often remain in the nest for several weeks, relying on their parents for sustenance and assistance until they are strong enough to leave the nest and fly independently. In summary, there are two main kinds of hatching behavior observed in animals – those that are independent and do not need care from their parents, and those that require parental care for initial survival and maturation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised him on her own. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old. As a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. At the conclusion of the 2008-09 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66-16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history. With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award. Reflecting on James's performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote, \\"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\\"  In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1-1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.  In February of the 2009-10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to the Cavaliers' backcourt. Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season. Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd. The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine turnovers in the losing effort. Did his good performance continue?","output":"Yes, James had a good performance. He even won another Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award because he played very well. He helped his team have the best record in the league for two years in a row. Even when some of his teammates got hurt, he played as a point guard and did a great job. He scored lots of points, got many rebounds, made many assists, and his team won many games because of him."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.

My sister was in town last weekend, so I thought to bring her to Sambalatte to check it out.  They didn't have iced white mocha on the menu, but they offer to make us some.  I'm guessing they only have one size for to-goers.....since they just assumed we want a large right when we ordered.  Then one of our friends got some gelato, and a red velvet cupcake.  The ice cream scooper yelled \\"one or two scoop\\", automatically the cashier said \\"two\\".  I noticed Sambalatte is a more high-end coffee shop and customers that go there wouldn't mind paying a little more for a bigger portion.  But without asking their clients what size/portion they prefer seem a little rude, plus what if he/she was on a diet and could only have a small/one scoop ice cream?  The iced-white mocha, which I'm so thankful they offer to make us some, were not at all anything to our expectations.  The coffee were too light, you can't even smell or taste it.  Mostly it was all just milk and some type of sweetener that taste nothing like a white mocha.  They definitely got the look down, but my iced white mocha was not as yummy as it looks.  Also, the gelato is comparable to any grocery store ice-cream, not that great :/   All in all, now I know for sure I do not like Sambalatte's products.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fun - discomfort - love - car - inspiration  I believe the correct choice is \\"inspiration\\", here's why: A:","output":"You are correct in choosing \\"inspiration\\" as the most likely answer to the question. Here's why: When James was chatting with friends and eating pizza, he suddenly experienced something that made him urgently run out of the room to get a pen and paper. This reaction suggests that he had a sudden idea or thought that he felt compelled to write down immediately, which is a clear indication of inspiration. Let's analyze the other options and explain why they are less likely: 1. Fun: While James might have been having fun with his friends, it doesn't explain why he would urgently need to run out of the room to get a pen and paper.    2. Discomfort: If James felt discomfort from eating pizza, running out to get a pen and paper wouldn't be the expected reaction. He might have stepped out to find some relief instead.    3. Love: While it's possible that James experienced or talked about love during the conversation, it doesn't provide a clear reason for his action of running out to get a pen and paper, especially in a hurry. Although he might have felt the urge to write a love letter, it's less likely than an immediate need to document inspiration.    4. Car: The presence or discussion of a car doesn't seem relevant to James running out of the room to get a pen and paper.

The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota, called the paranotal theory. Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes.

The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The ongoing war against cybercrime More than 350 million personal records have been at risk because of data privacy breaches since 2005. Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Like most college students, Jake McCoy had to apply for several loans to pay for his education. After a rigorous check of his credit, he secured the loans and has been paying them back since graduating from Baylor University in May 2006. Then, in October 2008, he received a letter from Baylor with bad news: A laptop computer with his account information had either been stolen or misplaced. \\"They told me my information was on it, and that's pretty much it,\\" McCoy said. \\"I assumed that my information was in good hands; it was so hard to get the loans that I figured surely they'd protect it very well.\\" The university set up a credit monitoring service for McCoy, now a first-year medical student at Baylor. The service expired in a year, and McCoy worries that he's still at risk for being on the hook for thousands of dollars that someone using his identity could spend. \\"The biggest concern is always that you don't know what someone is going to do with your financial information,\\" said McCoy. \\"I was really worried that someone out there was going to be ruining my credit and how big of a headache it would be to resolve it.\\" And McCoy is not alone. In March, a portable media device with personal data for more than 3 million people was stolen from Minnesota-based Educational Credit Management Corp. It is believed to be the largest breach of its kind. The thieves who stole the USB drive, like in other cases, may not commit identity thefts themselves, according to Jonathon Giffin, a system and software security researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \\"They may sell the information to others who have the knowledge of making money from those identities,\\" Giffin said. Most credit card companies and banks offer some recourse if a customer becomes the victim of internet fraud. But when personal information is lost because a company is the victim of crime, it is often unclear who is ultimately responsible. There are U.S. laws that hold companies accountable when major breaches occur, and new legislation is being considered. The Personal Data Privacy Act of 2009 would require companies to notify, in writing, anyone affected by a security breach. Under the act, which is still pending a vote in Congress, companies would also be required to notify major media outlets if there are more than 5,000 people affected by a security breach. The company that carried McCoy's loans simply provided him with a basic 15 credit monitoring service that lasted for one year. \\"For me, it's not a one-year ordeal,\\" said McCoy. \\"If I had ruined my credit, it would have taken me forever to get back on track. One year was a nice gesture, but I definitely wish it would have been more than just a year.\\" More than 350 million personal records at hundreds of universities, government agencies and businesses have been at risk because of data privacy breaches since 2005, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit group that publishes reports on cybercrimes. Sometimes, that's a result of simple mistakes, and other times, it's the result of a criminal act. Either way, Giffin says everyone needs to protect their personal identity. \\"We can encourage organizations to try to protect our data using mechanisms such as data encryption, so that if a USB drive or a laptop is stolen, the data is encrypted and cannot be retrieved,\\" he said. \\"But we would be relying on companies to do that for us.\\" Encryption causes a slowdown for companies. System users would have to encrypt and decrypt the data every time they access it, which creates extra work, and companies may not have an incentive to pay for safer data. New legislation could change the way companies look at data safety costs. The Data Accountability and Trust Act, which has been passed by the House and awaits a vote in the Senate, would protect consumers by requiring companies to take reasonable measures to protect data containing personal information. If a security breach occurs, companies would be required to provide nationwide notice. But even if the bill is enacted, it may not be enough. Many laws dealing with internet protection haven't always been able to catch up to evolving cybercrimes. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been any progress in the ongoing battle to protect personal data, according to Adam Palmer, the lead adviser on cybersecurity issues for Norton. \\"There are some very good, tough laws right now on both the state and federal level, and there's a lot of legislation in the pipeline to try to address some of these crimes,\\" said Palmer, a former cyber-crime prosecutor. But new challenges exist for fighting crime in a virtual world. Palmer says cybercriminals often use sophisticated technology to launch attacks. You can't go to a crime scene and take pictures ... that makes it very difficult for prosecutors.--Adam Palmer, cybercrime expert \\"You can't go to a crime scene and take pictures and interview witnesses, so it's in some ways a very old crime that still relates to stealing money, stealing people's identities,\\" he said. \\"It's done with such complexities, that makes it very difficult for prosecutors.\\" Giffin says there has been a significant shift in cybercrime over the last decade, including new techniques such as \\"botnets,\\" which are computers that can transmit viruses to other computers without the knowledge of the owner. Although cybercriminals continue to develop new methods of attack, there are no new ways for users to protect themselves other than what experts have advised for years: • Maintain good security practices • Exercise greater awareness of how your information could be used • Tell your financial institutions to track your accounts • Report any cybercrimes to law enforcement But even in doing so, consumers -- like McCoy -- still face a potential risk when their personal information is in the hands of others. McCoy says he is more careful with his information, and he hopes that businesses take more precautions with their customers' personal data. \\"It still put that doubt in my mind about how easy it could be for businesses that I trust to lose my information or have it stolen,\\" McCoy said. \\"I don't know why they were carrying around information on a laptop. I feel like they should be a little more protective with information than that.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the ongoing battle against cybercrime and how it affects people's personal information. It tells the story of a college student named Jake McCoy, whose personal data was on a stolen laptop.

Let's analyze both sentences in detail: Sentence 1: The object Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open. In this sentence, we learn that Annette has given a small penknife with its blade open to someone (presumably a male character). However, the sentence does not state any information about the ownership of the penknife. The penknife could belong to Annette, the recipient, or someone else altogether. Sentence 2: The penknife didn't belong to Annette or him. In this sentence, it's explicitly mentioned that the penknife does not belong to either Annette or the recipient. This statement establishes the ownership, which was not provided or implied in the first sentence. To summarize, the first sentence does not provide information about the ownership of the penknife, making the claims of the second sentence not entailed by the first. An entailment relationship exists between two sentences when the truth of one sentence guarantees or requires the truth of the other, such that it would be logically contradictory for one sentence to be true and the other false.

To join the bow together, you need something that can secure the center part and keep the loops in place. A staple is perfect for this job because it can go through the layers of paper and hold them tightly together. The other option, using a rubber band, is not suitable because it might not hold the paper bow tightly enough, and the bow could fall apart.

Secret Service director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and espionage. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary MS One, where prisoners are kept in stasis for the length of their sentence. Snow's friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snow's contact Mace, who knows where Frank's briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden. Meanwhile, the President's daughter Emilie arrives on MS One to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop mental instability. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a siege. Snow is initially reluctant to go, but agrees after Shaw tells him that Mace is on MS One and could help Snow prove his innocence. Langral initially attempts to trick Alex into releasing Emilie, but it goes bad and Snow is forced to infiltrate MS One.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Peale was born in 1741 in Chester, Queen Anne's County, Maryland, the son of Charles Peale and his wife Margaret. He had a younger brother, James Peale (1749-1831). Charles became an apprentice to a saddle maker when he was thirteen years old. Upon reaching maturity, he opened his own saddle shop; however, when his Loyalist creditors discovered he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business. In 1762, Peale married Rachel Brewer (1744-1790), who bore him ten children, most named for Peale's favorite artists, male and female. The sons included Raphaelle Peale (1774-1825), Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860), who was another famous portrait painter and museum owner/operator in Baltimore, and scientific inventor and businessman, Titian Peale I (1780-1798), and Rubens Peale (1784-1865). Among the daughters: Angelica Kauffman Peale (named for Angelica Kauffman, Peale's favorite female painter) married Alexander Robinson, her daughter Priscilla Peale wed Dr. Henry Boteler, and Sophonisba Angusciola Peale (named for Sofonisba Anguissola) married Coleman Sellers.  After Rachel's death in 1790, Peale married Elizabeth de Peyster (d. 1804) the next year. With his second wife, he had six additional children. One son, Franklin Peale, born on October 15, 1795, became the Chief Coiner at the Philadelphia Mint. Their youngest son, Titian Ramsay Peale (1799-1885), became an important naturalist and pioneer in photography. Their daughter, Elizabeth De Peyster Peale (1802-57), married William Augustus Patterson (1792-1833) in 1820.  Hannah More, a Quaker from Philadelphia, married Peale in 1804, becoming his third wife. She helped raise the younger children from his previous two marriages.  Peale's slave, Moses Williams, was also trained in the arts while growing up in the Peale household and later became a professional silhouette artist.  In 1810, Peale purchased a farm in Germantown where he intended to retire. He named this estate 'Belfield', and cultivated extensive gardens there. After Hannah's death in 1821, Peale lived with his son Rubens and sold Belfield in 1826. Peale died on February 22, 1827, and was buried at the Saint Peter's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"In this article, there are several interesting aspects worth highlighting. One is the naming tradition in Peale's family, where he named his children after his favorite artists, such as Raphaelle Peale, Rembrandt Peale, Titian Peale I, and Rubens Peale. This demonstrates the profound impact that art and painters had on Peale's life and how he wanted to pass that legacy onto his children. Another interesting aspect is how Peale's life was filled with personal and professional challenges. The article mentions that when his Loyalist creditors found out he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business. Despite these challenges, Peale went on to achieve great success in his artistic career. The article also highlights Peale's deep connection to Philadelphia, where he spent the majority of his life. Not only did he live, work, and raise his family in the area, but he also purchased a farm in Germantown and named it 'Belfield,' where he cultivated extensive gardens. In his later years, Peale continued to reside with his family until his death in 1827. Finally, the mention of Peale's slave, Moses Williams, who was trained in the arts and became a professional silhouette artist, indicates the influence Peale had on other people's lives and careers. It also serves as a reminder of the different societal norms and practices during that time in American history."},{"instruction":"Q: What is the microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells?

This House believes in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, a two-state solution is better justified than a one-state solution What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"To construct an argument in favor of a two-state solution being better justified than a one-state solution in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, one could follow these steps: Step 1: Establish the context and goal The Israel-Palestine conflict has persisted for decades, with both sides laying claim to the same territories. A peaceful resolution is both morally and practically necessary. The main goal of this argument is to demonstrate that the two-state solution is more justified than a one-state solution. Step 2: Define the terms A two-state solution would create separate, sovereign nations for both Israelis and Palestinians, living side by side in peace. A one-state solution would merge both populations into a single, binational state. Step 3: Highlight the main issues Three critical issues are often raised in this debate: the rights of both parties to self-determination, achieving a territorial compromise, and guaranteeing the security of both populations. Step 4: Address the issues from the perspective of a two-state solution 1. Self-determination: A two-state solution respects the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians. It acknowledges their distinct national identities and allows them to govern themselves independently, promoting peaceful coexistence and reducing tensions between the two groups. 2. Territorial compromise: A two-state solution would require both sides to make territorial compromises, such as re-drawing existing borders to create a viable Palestinian state. By doing so, both parties can reach a compromise that satisfies their respective national aspirations, making it more likely to be accepted by both populations. 3. Security: Separate states would provide better security guarantees to both Israelis and Palestinians. Israel could maintain its defense capabilities within its borders, safeguarding its population against external threats, while a sovereign Palestinian state could work with the international community on security issues, ensuring that its interests are protected. Step 5: Counter-argue any potential benefits of a one-state solution Critics of a two-state solution often argue that a one-state solution would be more democratic and fair, eliminating the barrier between Israelis and Palestinians. However, given the vast differences in culture, religion, and national identity, a one-state solution could exacerbate tensions and lead to more conflict. The two-state solution respects these differences by allowing each group to govern themselves, leading to better chances for peaceful relations. Step 6: Conclude the argument In conclusion, a two-state solution provides a more justified approach to resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict. By respecting the rights of self-determination, enabling territorial compromises, and ensuring security for both populations, it lays the groundwork for a more peaceful and stable future for Israelis and Palestinians. While a one-state solution may seem ideal in theory, its implementation could potentially worsen the situation rather than promote harmony between the two groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who said they used to be cruel to women?  Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Talking through your worries and insecurities with someone can be more helpful than you think. If you think you have a real problem with clinginess, it might be best to talk it through with a professional counsellor. Your school may have one that is there for exactly this purpose, and you can talk to them about anything that's worrying you. It can be helpful to talk with a professional because they can be more objective than friends or family sometimes.  If you can't or don't want to talk with a counsellor, consider talking with a parent or a trusted adult. Talk to them about how you're feeling and what's going on in your life. Tell them that you are worried you are being too clingy with friends, but you're not sure what to do about it. They have probably been there before and can offer advice about how to handle it. Try to remember that friends are not all there is to life even if they do play a big and important part in it. Remember that you have responsibilities at home and at school or work.

Besides your friends, you have a family that cares about you. Spend time nurturing your relationships with your siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. These are the people that will be there for you no matter what. Spending time with family can be a great way to start feeling more secure. In most cases, your family knows you better than anyone else and accepts you all the same. If you have secure relationships with your family members, you can learn how to act that way with friends, too. In addition to making sure that you are taking care of your responsibilities and family, find things that you enjoy doing alone. It is good to learn to just be with yourself and feel comfortable with it. If you already have a hobby that you enjoy, then great. If you don't, try out a few things you've been curious about and see what grabs your attention. Many hobbies have their way of making you more confident in yourself. For example, they may teach you a cool skill. Although there are many indirect ways of building confidence in yourself, you can also take steps to work on your self-confidence more directly. In order to build self-confidence, you will need to become aware of the bad things you are thinking about yourself. Any time you catch yourself getting mad at yourself or thinking something negative about yourself, try to become aware of it, and remind yourself that you aren't going to think that way anymore. This also means that you need to give yourself credit when you do something good. If you say something funny that makes people laugh or you do a good deed, let yourself feel proud.","output":"The article focuses on the importance of addressing clinginess and offers various methods to overcome it, such as discussing the issue with a professional counselor or a trusted adult, fulfilling responsibilities at home and work, nurturing relationships with family members, engaging in hobbies and developing self-confidence through positive self-awareness and giving oneself credit for accomplishments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Has anyone ever naturally gained height after 20 years of age? How can I increase in height after 20 years? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Pick from: -no. -yes.","output":"Yes, the two questions are essentially asking the same thing, with both focusing on the possibility of an individual increasing their height after 20 years of age. The potential for height increase after 20 years of age is a topic that has intrigued many adults, particularly those who desire to grow taller for various reasons. While there have been claims and isolated cases of people growing taller after their teenage years and even into their 20s, it is important to understand the factors influencing height and the likelihood of natural height increase in adults. Height is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetics play a significant role, with genes inherited from both parents contributing to an individual's ultimate height. Environmental factors, such as a healthy diet and sufficient exercise, are also important during childhood and adolescence, as they can impact bone growth and overall development. Human height is primarily the result of long bone growth which occurs at the ends of bones, specifically in areas known as growth plates. These plates contain layers of cartilage that multiply and add length to bones as the body grows. During adolescence, hormonal changes, particularly the increase in growth hormone secretion, catalyze significant bone growth, resulting in height increase. As individuals reach adulthood, usually by the age of 18-20, their growth plates close and are replaced with bone, thereby stopping further bone elongation. At this specific point, which may vary from person to person, height increase is typically no longer a natural occurrence. In extremely rare cases, some people might experience some further growth due to late bone growth plate closure or other hormonal conditions, but this is not the norm.  While it is unlikely to naturally increase height after 20 years of age, there are steps that you can take to create the illusion of height or maintain your current stature. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Posture: Improving your posture by standing up straight and tall, pulling your shoulders back, and keeping your head high can have a significant impact on your perceived height. 2. Exercise: Regular exercise, especially stretching exercises such as yoga and Pilates, can help improve posture and muscle tone, which may give an illusion of slightly increased height. 3. Clothing choices: Wearing clothing with vertical lines or choosing outfits with similar colors from head to toe can create an elongating effect. Additionally, wearing shoes with a slightly raised heel can add some height. 4. Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight can contribute to a better overall appearance and posture, which may enhance the perception of your height. Even though it's unlikely to gain height naturally after 20 years of age, focusing on these tips and being content with your current height can help boost your confidence and make a positive impact on your overall well-being. Always remember, height is just one aspect of your physical appearance, and your unique qualities and talents contribute to your overall persona."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together.

News article: Album Review: 'Amok' by Atoms for Peace This post is in partnership with Consequence of Sound, an online music publication devoted to the ever growing and always thriving worldwide music scene. A lone rat scurries about on a floating piece of driftwood. A melting palm tree slumps towards its inevitable fall near Crossroads of the World. A passenger’s struggling hands materialize on the backseat window of a sinking wagon. A lost traveler clutches the bow of his dinghy, while an ominous hooded seaman navigates at ease nearby. Not too far away, a man clutches a winded telephone pole, no doubt screaming for help towards the erratic soldier a street over, who stands guard above the apocalyptic wasteland that is Los Angeles. Not even Disneyland makes it out alive in Stanley Donwood’s gloomy artwork for AMOK, presented in full at the album’s terrifying official site. Similarly, loneliness floods the debut album for Thom Yorke’s star-studded side project, Atoms For Peace. Despite being surrounded by some of the industry’s top-level talent – Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, all-star session drummer Joey Waronker, and Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco — AMOK comes off as an email attachment from the deep, dark abyss that is Yorke’s mind. Words like “processed” or “mechanical” spur to mind, which isn’t exactly surprising given the songwriter’s hints to Rolling Stone last fall: ”One of the things we were most excited about was ending up with a record where you weren’t quite sure where the human starts and the machine ends.” (MORE: The Harlem Shake Is Dead; Long Live the Harlem Shake) Disappointing isn’t the right word to describe the end result, but it’s close. With the release of 2006′s The Eraser, Yorke didn’t have to deal with any adrenalized expectations, simply because he didn’t tout unique collaborations as he does withAMOK. Flea was still busy carving out his double-album Stadium Arcadium, Waronker was flirting with Hollywood scores, and Refosco was putting together his outfit, Forro in the Dark. Now, with a full band and not just a laptop of possibilities, Yorke sets the bar high for a team effort that could be unique and maybe even intimidating — instead, it’s what one would have expected in the summer of 2006. Something was lost in the two years of tinkering between Yorke and Godrich. As the producer explained in the aforementioned interview, many of the beats and riffs behind AMOK’s nine tracks date back to 2010, when the outfit spent three days together in Los Angeles to snapshot the energy they exhibited on their critically acclaimed, short-lived tour. Yorke spoke highly of this time, stating: “We got wasted, played pool, and listened to Fela Kuti all night. It was that idea of trance-ing out. But there are still songs here.” He’s not wrong; there are plenty of songs on AMOK. Album opener “Before Your Very Eyes…” caresses with sticky, glazed distortion and hand-chaffed claps; lead single “Default” haunts with spookhouse bass and dizzying beats, agreeably cribbed from 2003′s Hail to the Thief; “Dropped” torments over digital sparks and schizophrenic melodies; “Stuck Together Pieces” drills down found sounds and Yorke’s strongest vocal hooks; and “Judge Jury and Executioner” nibbles by with organic guitar work that sips from caffeine beats. These are the areas where the album squeezes the fruits of their labors, sounding less claustrophobic and more expansive. (MORE: David Bowie and Tilda Swinton Make Sweet Music (Video) Together) Yet much like Radiohead’s polarizing 2011 album, The King of Limbs, the many devils are in the very, very small details. Ignore Yorke’s wallowing vocals on “Unless” and, instead, zero in on the John Carpenter-inspired drone hook that stalks the background no different from Halloween‘s The Shape. On “Ingenue,” focus on the bass as Flea cranes his fingers, all behind Godrich’s showering arrangements, which later dazzle on “Reverse Running” — especially in the rapturous closing 50 seconds that outsmart the closing title track. Hear it? Yorke’s crew is there, but in parts, and that’s the real snub to AMOK. Only does “Stuck Together Pieces” mirror those wild, Fela Kuti-soundtracked nights Yorke discussed (which is why it’s the album’s strongest track), and that’s pretty unfortunate given they had eight other opportunities to bottle that collaborative lightning. It all goes back to the seclusive pathos Yorke and Godrich injected alone together over those two years on their laptops. Godrich summarized it as “a backward idea – and a step into the unknown.” It was a step in the wrong direction. By meddling with the organic nature of those days and nights together as an actual band, Godrich and Yorke wound up with another take on The Eraser. These songs don’t say anything about Atoms For Peace that Yorke’s solo album didn’t already say about himself. Far from capturing their kinetic live energy, AMOK feels as isolated, distraught, and feeble as the characters littered about in Donwood’s tragic portrait. Though, perhaps that’s always been Yorke’s intention; after all, he says it best in the album’s closing lines: “I’m trying to be a thought killer.” Next time around, Thom, step away from the knife and let it live. Essential Tracks: “Stuck Together Pieces”, “Judge Jury and Executioner”, and “Dropped” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is a review of the album 'Amok' by Atoms for Peace. The author talks about the artwork and the loneliness depicted in the album. They mention that the album has some good songs, but overall, the collaboration of the band members does not shine through, and it feels more like a solo project of Thom Yorke rather than a group effort.

Bank boss failed lie detector questions on heist plot: cops A Connecticut bank executive who told police he was taken hostage at his home and forced to wear a purported bomb to his chest last month has since failed a portion of a lie detector test, a search warrant has revealed. A polygraph test given to Matthew Yussman found that the 46-year-old failed questions specific to his involvement with the alleged Feb. 23 attack that began at his Bristol home, the Bristol Press reported. \\"The results of that test indicated that Yussman showed deception on the relevant test question, 'Are you lying about your involvement in the home invasion,'\\" the warrant stated. The chief financial officer for Achieve Financial chose to not finish the test a short time later, New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell told the paper. \\"He did talk to us for a short time after, but then he made the decision to end the interview,\\" he said. The test was one of several details revealed in the warrant issued for a Feb. 28 search of his home after Yussman claimed that he was ambushed by two men in his garage around 12:30 a.m. on Feb. 23. He was returning home from a hockey game when he said he was overtaken by the yet-to-be identified suspects who were cloaked in ski masks and goggles. His mother, who lived with him, told police that she too was taken hostage when she went to check up on him in the garage. That woman, Valerie Yussman, described finding her son lying facedown on the floor with his hands zip-tied behind his back. She was allegedly next forced into her bedroom where she was duct-taped and tied to a bed. Her hands were kept free, however, and the criminals left her with cookies, lunch meat and juice, she said. When describing the suspects, Valerie Yussman said they were \\"well-spoken and polite.\\" Yussman, meanwhile, stayed with both captors who discussed how he'd enter the bank later that morning and leave with 4.2 million. Around 3:30 a.m. the three left the home in Yussman's vehicle for about half an hour. The CFO said he was blindfolded in the back and didn't know where they went. When they returned he allegedly checked on his mother at some point. She said that it didn't appear that his hands were tied up. Around 8:24 a.m. the bank's president called 911, reporting that he had received a call from Yussman informing him of his captors' demands. When officers arrived at the credit union minutes later they found him seated inside a car with what appeared to be a bomb strapped to his chest. The object was deemed safe and removed from him. A claimed bomb placed under Yussman's mother's bed was also found to be a fake. Calls for comment from Yussman, Achieve Financial and the Bristol Police Department were not immediately returned to the Daily News Friday.

Answer:","output":"Philip K. Dick's short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,\\" published in 1966, served as the inspiration for the 1990 science fiction action film called \\"Total Recall,\\" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in the leading role. Directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman, the film adaptation takes the fundamental concept from Dick's story and expands upon it, adding more action-packed sequences, memorable characters, and futuristic settings, turning it into a visually spectacular and highly entertaining cinematic experience. In \\"Total Recall,\\" Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who is plagued by vivid and recurring dreams about the planet Mars. Intrigued by these mysterious dreams, Quaid decides to visit a memory implant center called Rekall Inc., where they provide clients with virtual vacations by implanting desired memories directly into their minds. Quaid opts for a package that turns him into a secret agent on a mission to Mars. However, during the memory implantation process, something goes awry, and Quaid becomes convinced that he is, in fact, a real secret agent with an important mission to uncover. As the story unfolds, Quaid begins to question the nature of his reality, and he embarks on a thrilling journey to Mars, encountering various adversaries and allies along the way, played by an impressive supporting cast that includes Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, and Ronny Cox. The movie's plot is full of twists and turns that leave both the protagonist and the viewers uncertain about the true nature of Quaid's dreams, origins, and mission. \\"Total Recall\\" was a box office success, and it also received critical acclaim for its groundbreaking special effects and dynamic visual storytelling. The film was nominated for and won several awards, including an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, further cementing its status as a prominent example of the science-fiction genre and as a significant part of Philip K. Dick's continued legacy in popular culture. The vast and imaginative universe created in \\"Total Recall\\" has continued to spark interest in fans of science fiction, and it even resulted in a less successful remake of the film in 2012, starring Colin Farrell in the leading role. However, the 1990 version remains the most iconic adaptation of Dick's short story, capturing the author's distinctive style of weaving together thought-provoking concepts and gripping stories that explore the enigmatic boundaries between perception, memory, and reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The story begins with the Japanese army's defeat of the China forces occupying Hong Kong on 25 December 1941. Nicholas is an eleven-year-old boy whose  parents have both suddenly disappeared in the chaos of war breaking out.  As the Japanese come to do a home to home search, three loyal family servants, Tang, his wife Ah Mee, and the gardener Ah Kwan take Nicholas and they escape to Kowloon as Hong Kong Island is no longer safe. Upon reaching the shore of Kowloon, Tang and Ah Mee disguise Nicholas as a Chinese boy and the trip continues to Tang's home village, the village of Sek Wan. Nicholas passes the years of the war here with Tang and his family. He is given the Chinese name Wing Ming. During this time, many events happen. Nicholas makes a dangerous journey back to Kowloon to get quinine cure to the malaria Tang has contracted. He also helps the Communist partisan army – The East River Column Fighters-  to translate instructions for using heavy explosives. Nicholas joins the partisan army on a mission to Kowloon where they blow up a railway bridge and weaken the position of the Japanese army. Yet his most dangerous job would have been to deliver a medicine into the prison of war camps (POW camps). Taking news or items to prison camps is nicknamed \\"playing music on the bamboo radio\\". Nicholas does more than expected by entering the camp itself because the person who he was supposed to pass the medicine to had the fever. Exhausted and worried, Nicholas narrowly escapes the clutches of the Japanese with the help of the prisoners and finally reaches the safety of Sek Wan village. The answer is:","output":"Tang contracts malaria in Sek Wan village."},{"instruction":"- No; - Yes; Q: Question: what is hosting a website?

Q:Question: \\"What has been done to cause the thing that caused specific alterations?\\"  Context: \\"The core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion created the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the Swiss Alps that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas. Peaks such as Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and high peaks in the Pennine Alps, the Briançonnais, and Hohe Tauern consist of layers of rock from the various orogenies including exposures of basement rock.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Several geological processes have caused the specific alterations in the core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt that led to the formation of steep vertical peaks like Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and high peaks in the Pennine Alps, the Briançonnais, and Hohe Tauern. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the events: 1. Formation of the Alpine orogenic belt: The Alpine orogenic belt was formed by the convergence of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, resulting in the uplift of the sedimentary rocks and creating the mountain ranges. 2. Folding and fracturing: The immense tectonic forces involved in this convergence caused the rocks to fold and fracture. Folding occurs when rock layers are bent and deformed under pressure, while fracturing is the breaking of rocks due to stress. 3. Exposure to various orogenies: Throughout geologic history, the region experienced multiple orogenies, or mountain-building events. Each of these events added new layers of rock and contributed to the complexity of the Alpine geological structure. 4. Erosion: Over time, natural processes such as wind, water, and ice erosion wore down the folded and fractured rocks. Erosion acted differently across various types of rocks, with softer rocks eroding more quickly than harder ones. 5. Formation of steep vertical peaks: The differential erosion of rock layers exposed the stronger basement rocks, which were more resistant to erosion. This process, combined with the pre-existing folding and fracturing, led to the formation of the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the Swiss Alps. In summary, the specific alterations that resulted in the formation of the Swiss Alps' steep vertical peaks are a combination of tectonic forces, folding, fracturing, multiple orogenies, and differential erosion. These processes all contributed to the complex geology and unique landscape of the Alpine region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And I was wondering How would you describe Alex? Answer:","output":"Based on your statement, Alex can be described as someone who has recently shifted towards a more fatalistic approach to dealing with life's difficulties. Earlier, he may have battled problems head-on, closely examining details, and exploring potential solutions. The fact that he is now tired of worrying about these things implies that he has expended a significant amount of mental and emotional energy trying to manage his troubles. This newfound reliance on \\"fate\\" indicates a degree of surrender. It may signal Alex's acceptance of the inevitability of certain occurrences. A belief in fate suggests that he may be transitioning towards a more passive way of dealing with issues, banking on destiny to craft his path instead of him actively steering his direction. This could be because he is exhausted, overwhelmed, or merely philosophically transformed. However, deeming fate responsible for everything also reveals Alex as someone who is potentially resilient. By surrendering some control to fate, Alex is enabling himself to withstand potential negative outcomes better, attributing them to inevitable destinies rather than personal failures.  Alex also seems to have a thoughtful and introspective nature. Stressing about problems before deciding to leave it to fate reveals a contemplative personality. It's clear that he takes things to heart and thinks deeply about them, possibly looking to extract lessons from these experiences. Additionally, the fact that he's considered tired of worrying suggests that Alex is a deeply emotional individual. The weight and breadth of his problems have elicited a sense of mental exhaustion in him, evidence of his capacity to experience profound emotional highs and lows. Moreover, his shift towards fatalism could indicate a growing desire for peace and calm. Given how taxing worrying can be, deciding to let fate decide is a clear manifestation of his wish to lead a less stress-ridden life. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that Alex could be escaping from his responsibilities. Leaving everything to fate might be an easy way out from confronting the actual problems and working on their solutions. It could be seen as a shielding mechanism to justify failures or mishaps that might occur in his life path. In summary, Alex represents a thoughtful, deeply emotional, and potentially resilient individual treading the path of self-discovery and acceptance, all while battling with life's many complexities. His attribution to fate reflects an amalgamation of exhaustion, introspection, and perhaps, a considerable need for peace. Whether this standpoint marks escapism or wisdom is entirely subjective and depends on other aspects of his personality and circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Advertising Watchdog Clears Teacher Recruitment Advert Amidst Complaints Introduction: A recent teacher recruitment advert that led to 140 complaints has been cleared by the advertising watchdog, stating that the ad did not overstate teachers' pay. The decision comes as a relief to the campaign, dispelling doubts and controversy surrounding the advertisement. Body: The advert, geared towards enticing young professionals to consider a career in teaching, came under fire after viewers took issue with the purported pay scale, deeming it misleading. Those who were dissatisfied with the figures raised a total of 140 complaints, leading the advertising watchdog to step in and investigate the matter. Upon thorough examination, the advertising regulator found that the advert did not overstate or exaggerate teachers' pay. Instead, the figures presented within the campaign aligned with actual pay scales, based on years of experience and location. By validating the claims made in the advert, the watchdog has effectively silenced concerns over the legitimacy of the campaign. Such recruitment campaigns play a critical role in attracting new talent to the teaching profession. With growing concerns over education and the need for qualified teachers in various fields, it is imperative that potential candidates receive accurate information regarding the benefits and perks of the job, including pay. This incident highlights the importance of transparency in advertising, especially when dealing with professional careers that impact society. The advertising watchdog's decision to look into this matter not only solidifies their role in keeping advertisements honest, but also ensures that potential candidates are presented with factual information. While the advert has now been cleared, those behind the campaign must tread carefully moving forward, ensuring that all future promotions abide by the rules and regulations set by the advertising watchdog. The outcome of this investigation serves as a reminder that accuracy and fact-checking should remain a priority in all advertising efforts, particularly when it comes to recruiting for important roles like teaching. Conclusion: The advertising watchdog's decision to clear the teacher recruitment advert of any wrongdoing stands as a testament to the relevance and necessity of their work. By ensuring that the information presented in such campaigns is accurate, potential teachers can make informed decisions about their career choices and contribute positively to education and society. As the incident has been resolved, the focus should now be on developing and maintaining trustworthy advertising campaigns that fuel interest in the teaching profession and help address the demand for qualified educators."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the final step of the following process: -  A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone Answer:","output":"The final step of the mentioned process can be seen as the beginning of the regrowth and recovery phase for the affected ecosystem. After the forest fire, the landscape may appear barren and lifeless, but over time, the ecosystem gradually starts to rebuild itself. This occurs through several interrelated processes: 1. Nutrient replenishment: As the ashes from the burnt trees and plants settle, they release essential nutrients back into the soil. This process enriches the soil and provides a fertile ground for new plant growth. 2. Plant regeneration: Some plant species have adapted to regenerate after wildfires. They may regrow from their roots, or their seeds may require exposure to high temperatures or chemicals released during the fire for germination. As these plants start to grow back, they provide the foundation for the recovery of the ecosystem. 3. Colonization by pioneer species: Some fast-growing species like grasses, shrubs, and other early successional plants begin to colonize the burned area. These pioneer species stabilize the soil, prevent erosion, and create a hospitable environment for other plant species and animals to return to the ecosystem. 4. Animal recolonization: Gradually, as vegetation regrows, it provides food and shelter for animals that were displaced or born elsewhere. Dispersal helps to repopulate the area, and the return of animal life can contribute to pollination, seed dispersal, and the reestablishment of the food chain. 5. Succession and ecosystem recovery: Over time, the ecosystem further develops through ecological succession. This process involves the replacement of one community of plant and animal species by another, eventually leading to the reestablishment of a mature, stable, and diverse ecosystem. This recovery process can span several years to decades, depending on the severity of the fire and resilience of the ecosystem. In conclusion, while the immediate aftermath of a forest fire may lead to the destruction of plant and animal life, it also sets in motion a natural recovery process that allows the ecosystem to gradually regrow, recover, and regain its ecological balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy.

When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations.

Identify the keywords and their Finnish translations:    - \\"Transparency directive\\" refers to a set of rules or guidelines regarding transparency, typically in a business or regulatory context. In Finnish, \\"transparency\\" can be translated to \\"läpinäkyvyys\\" and \\"directive\\" can be translated to \\"direktiivi\\". So, the whole term may be translated as \\"läpinäkyvyysdirektiivi\\".    - \\"Report\\" can be translated to \\"raportti\\" in Finnish.    - \\"Mr Skinner\\" is a proper noun referring to a person. We keep proper names the same in Finnish as they are in English. 2. Translate the sentence structure:    - The original sentence has the subject \\"I\\" and an action \\"turn to\\". In Finnish, \\"I\\" is translated to \\"minä\\" (often shortened to \\"mä\\" in spoken language), and \\"turn to\\" can be translated to \\"käännyn\\", which is in present tense.     - The original sentence is constructed in English phrases with 'and' which in Finnish can be translated to 'ja'. 3.

Q:Question: \\"A nectar feeding bird would be called what?\\"  Context: \\"Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"A nectar-feeding bird would be called a nectarivore. Nectarivorous birds, such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets, have evolved special adaptations like brushy tongues and specially shaped bills to access nectar from flowers. These birds play a crucial role in the ecosystem, as they pollinate flowers while feeding on nectar, ensuring the reproduction and survival of various plant species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Proceeds go to Hepburn's family.","output":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"Proceeds go to Hepburn's family,\\" follows the preceding text logically. Both sentences indicate that the money raised from the sale will financially benefit Hepburn's family. Let us provide a detailed explanation for better understanding. In the first sentence, we learn that the money raised from a sale will be placed into a trust. This trust is specifically designated for Hepburn's family, which means that the funds within it are to be used for their benefit. Trusts are financial arrangements that provide a legal mechanism for managing assets on behalf of beneficiaries. In this case, the beneficiaries are Hepburn's family members. The trust can then distribute the funds or use the assets in accordance with its terms and the intentions of the person who established the trust. The next sentence, \\"Proceeds go to Hepburn's family,\\" is a simplified statement that conveys the same idea. Proceeds refer to the money generated from the sale, which is to be directed toward Hepburn's family. While this sentence does not include specific details about the trust mentioned in the first sentence, it still highlights that the financial benefit is meant for Hepburn's family. Therefore, the second sentence aligns with and reinforces the main point of the first sentence, which is that the money raised from the sale will support Hepburn's family. The context provided in the first sentence about the plan to establish a trust adds an extra layer of detail and a more thorough understanding of how the family will receive the funds. Overall, the two sentences are consistent in their message and work together to describe how this sale's financial outcome will ultimately benefit Hepburn's family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is a correct answer to the following question about List of Schedule IV drugs (US). Yes or no? Answer: Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III. Question: what is schedule 4 drugs A:","output":"Yes, Schedule IV drugs, also known as Schedule 4 drugs, are a category of drugs classified under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in the United States. The CSA is a federal legislation that was enacted in 1970 to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and possession of certain substances with potential for abuse and addiction. The Act categorizes drugs into five schedules (I to V), with Schedule I representing substances with the highest potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, and Schedule V representing substances with the lowest potential for abuse and accepted medical use. Schedule IV drugs are defined as substances with a lower potential for abuse and dependence compared to Schedule III drugs. According to the CSA, these drugs meet the following criteria: 1. The substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in Schedule III. 2. The substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. 3. Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in Schedule III. The drugs listed under Schedule IV include benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam), non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone), and certain medications used to treat seizures or anxiety (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin). While these drugs have accepted medical uses and a lower potential for abuse compared to substances in Schedule III, they can still lead to some degree of physical or psychological dependence if not used responsibly. Prescriptions for Schedule IV drugs are subject to certain requirements and restrictions. Physicians and other authorized healthcare providers can prescribe these medications, but they must follow specific guidelines for prescription writing and documentation. Refills for Schedule IV drugs are allowed, but generally, no more than five refills are allowed within a six-month period. The DEA, or Drug Enforcement Administration, closely monitors the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances to prevent diversion and misuse. In conclusion, Schedule IV drugs are substances with a low potential for abuse and limited physical or psychological dependence compared to Schedule III drugs. They are subject to specific regulations and monitoring to ensure the safe use and distribution of these medications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The chief of the Pakistani Taliban who had a 5 million bounty on his head has been killed in an American drone strike. Hakimullah Mehsud, thought to have been behind a failed car bombing in New York's Times Square and several attacks inside Pakistan, is one of five believed dead in the attack this morning. The attack and his death were confirmed by senior Taliban commanders, who said they saw Mehsud's body, and U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources. Killed: Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who had a 5m bounty on his head, pictured in 2009. It is believed the men were killed in a U.S. drone strike on Mehsud's car in the mountainous North Waziristan region, in the north west of Pakistan. Reports said Mehsud led the violent militant group from a secret hideout in the tribal region, which is one of the Taliban's main strongholds. How the U.S. Department of State described Mehsud, who has been among the CIA's most wanted men in the world for at least four years. Drones fired four missiles at a compound in Danda Darpa Khel, a village about three miles from the regional capital of Miranshah, sources said. Two of the dead reportedly included Hakimullah's personal bodyguard Tariq Mehsud and his driver Abdullah Mehsud. A senior Taliban commander said: 'We confirm with great sorrow that our esteemed leader was martyred in a drone attack.' Mehsud took over the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban in August 2009 after his predecessor was also killed in a drone attack. Since then he has been one of the CIA's most wanted men with a 5 million bounty on his head. He appeared in a farewell video for a Jordanian double agent whose suicide bombing in 2009 killed seven CIA employees at a base in Afghanistan. The U.S. named him 'the self-proclaimed emir of the Pakistani Taliban' and charged him with conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens abroad and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. His funeral will be held tomorrow in Miranshah, the Taliban commander said - which is likely to stir tensions further in the highly volatile region. Today's drone strike came amid peace talks between the Pakistani government and militants in the region to end years of fighting. Unconfirmed reports say the strike came as Mehsud attended a gathering of 25 Taliban leaders to discuss the government's offer of peace. Hakimullah Mehsud, pictured right, was said to command violent militants from a mountainous hideout. This photo from November 2008 shows Mehsud, second from left, speaking to journalists at a Taliban base. During. a visit to London yesterday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who won a landslide election victory in May, confirmed talks with the Pakistani Taliban had started. The Pakistani government condemned today's drone strike, although their statement was issued before Mehsud's death was reported. Controversial: Taliban leaders have already described Hakimullah Mehsud as a martyr. 'These. strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial. integrity,' said a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The drone strikes are unpopular in Pakistan,. where many people view them as an infringement on Pakistani sovereignty. and say innocent civilians are killed in the process. But the Americans have had some successes - in May, a drone strike killed Mehsud's second-in-command, and one of his most trusted lieutenants was captured in Afghanistan last month. The CIA and the White House declined to comment on Mehsud's death. Although the killing will spark calls for revenge among Taliban leaders, it may make negotiations with the militants easier in the long-run, said Saifullah Mahsud, director of the Pakistani think-tank FATA Research Center. He said: 'Hakimullah Mehsud was a very controversial figure and he had very tough demands.' Mehsud, who told jokes and had an interest in modern technology, was the driver for the former head of the Pakistani Taliban before rising through the ranks. The militant leader, known for his emotional outbursts, had two wives but moved frequently because of his fear of U.S. drone strikes. His wing of the Taliban was accused of being involved in an attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square in 2010. But recently Mehsud's rivalries with other Taliban commanders over the spoils from extortion and kidnapping had sharpened, it is believed, raising tensions within the armed organisation. Tension: Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, pictured meeting U.S. President Barack Obama last week, said only yesterday that peace talks with the Taliban had started. His government condemned the drone strike. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article discusses the death of Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, killed by an American drone strike. The report highlights that Mehsud, who had a 5 million bounty on his head, was regarded as one of the most wanted men by the CIA. He was believed to be behind a failed car bombing in New York's Times Square and multiple other attacks within Pakistan. Mehsud, together with four other unidentified individuals, was killed in a drone attack on his car in the mountainous North Waziristan region, a known Taliban stronghold. Drones fired four missiles at a compound in Danda Darpa Khel, resulting in Mehsud's death and that of his personal bodyguard and his driver. Mehsud's leadership of the Pakistani Taliban had begun in August 2009 following the drone death of his predecessor. The U.S. marked him as a significant threat, charging him with conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens overseas and use a weapon of mass destruction. His death was confirmed by Taliban commanders and intelligence sources from both the U.S. and Pakistan. The drone strike occurred amid ongoing peace negotiations between the Pakistani government and regional militants, a point of contention that sparked controversy. While the Pakistani government and the public widely condemned the strikes as violations of the nation's sovereignty, the death of Mehsud could potentially simplify these negotiations, according to Saifullah Mahsud, director of the Pakistani think-tank FATA Research Center. The article describes Hakimullah Mehsud as an emotional and controversial figure, moving often due to fear of drone strikes and known for rivalries within the Taliban. His faction of the group was implicated in an attempt to carry out a car bomb explosion in Times Square in 2010. Notably, the drone strike that resulted in Mehsud's death came shortly after Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif confirmed that peace talks with the Taliban had begun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To make a more informed decision about whether or not to recommend the app to a friend, it would be beneficial to gather more information about it, such as reading more detailed reviews or checking the app's ratings and description. Additionally, the appropriateness of recommending an app to a friend depends on the friend's preferences, needs, and interests. If you are aware that your friend enjoys similar apps or is in search of a specific functionality offered by this app, then the recommendation is more likely to be well-received.

Adverse effects or reactions: The company may have received reports of severe or unexpected side effects associated with the use of the drug. These adverse effects could pose a significant health risk to patients, prompting the company to recall the product as a precautionary measure to ensure patient safety. 2. Manufacturing issues: It is possible that during the manufacturing process, there have been errors or contamination that could affect the drug's quality, purity, or stability. This could pose safety risks or render the drug ineffective, necessitating the recall to address these issues and prevent potential harm to patients. 3. Insufficient or incorrect labeling: If the drug's packaging or labeling contains inaccurate or inadequate information about its ingredients, usage instructions, drug interactions, or side effects, this could lead to misuse by patients or healthcare professionals. In such cases, the company would recall the drug to ensure that consumers receive the correct information required for safe and proper use of the product. 4. Non-compliance with regulatory guidelines: Regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, regularly monitor the pharmaceutical industry to ensure drug safety and efficacy. If the drug does not comply with specific guidelines or has not been tested thoroughly before its release to the market, the company may be required to recall the product to avoid legal or ethical complications. 5. Data manipulation or cover-up: In rare cases, the pharmaceutical company may discover that data from crucial research or clinical trials has been manipulated or hidden, altering the perceived safety or efficacy of the drug. Under such circumstances, the company would have to recall the drug to protect patients and preserve its reputation. 6. Expiry or storage concerns: If the drug has exceeded its expiration date or has been stored in suboptimal conditions that could affect its potency or safety, the company would need to recall the product to prevent potential harm to consumers. In summary, the cause for a pharmaceutical company recalling a drug can be related to several factors, including safety concerns due to adverse effects, manufacturing issues, labeling errors, non-compliance with regulatory standards, data manipulation, or expiry and storage-related factors. A recall is often initiated to ensure the well-being of patients and to maintain the company's reputation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

CHAPTER III  LIGHTFOOT TELLS HOW HIS ANTLERS GREW  It is hard to believe what seems impossible. And yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else. So it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be. Peter Rabbit wanted to believe what Lightfoot the Deer had just told him, but somehow he couldn't. If he had seen those antlers growing, it would have been another matter. But he hadn't seen Lightfoot since the very last of winter, and then Lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had. So Peter really couldn't be blamed for not being able to believe that those old ones had been lost and in their place new ones had grown in just the few months of spring and summer.  But Peter didn't blame Lightfoot in the least, because he had told Peter that he didn't like to tell things to people who wouldn't believe what he told them when Peter had asked him about the rags hanging to his antlers. \\"I'm trying to believe it,\\" he said, quite humbly.  \\"It's all true,\\" broke in another voice.  Peter jumped and turned to find his big cousin, Jumper the Hare. Unseen and unheard, he had stolen up and had overheard what Peter and Lightfoot had said.  \\"How do you know it is true?\\" snapped Peter a little crossly, for Jumper had startled him.  \\"Because I saw Lightfoot's old antlers after they had fallen off, and I often saw Lightfoot while his new ones were growing,\\" retorted Jumper.

Context: Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons. Rousseau's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of Albrecht von Haller's poem Die Alpen that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity. Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in The Prelude. Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence.

They also drafted Jamaal Wilkes, then known as Keith Wilkes, out of UCLA. With Barry as the offensive leader, and with Attles using a team approach to coaching, the Warriors managed to finish the season atop the Western Conference with 48 wins. In the playoffs, they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in six games, then eliminated Thurmond and the Bulls in seven games to advance to the Finals.  Links: a. 1974–75 NBA season b.

It was first performed at the Théâtre de l'Athénée in Paris in a production that opened on 17 April 1947, which Louis Jouvet directed.  - The Screens is a play by the French dramatist Jean Genet. Its first few productions all used abridged versions, beginning with its world premiere under Hans Lietzau's direction in Berlin in May 1961. Its first complete performance was staged in Stockholm in 1964, two years before Roger Blin directed its French premiere in Paris.  - Our Lady of the Flowers (\\"Notre Dame des Fleurs\\") is the debut novel of French writer Jean Genet, first published in 1943. The free-flowing, poetic novel is a largely autobiographical account of a man's journey through the Parisian underworld. The characters are drawn after their real-life counterparts, who are mostly homosexuals living on the fringes of society.  - Querelle of Brest is a novel by the French writer Jean Genet. It was first published anonymously in 1947 and limited to 460 numbered copies. It is set in the midst of the port town of Brest, where sailors and the sea are associated with murder. Its protagonist, Georges Querelle, is a bisexual thief, prostitute and serial killer who manipulates and kills his lovers for thrills and profit. The novel formed the basis for Rainer Werner Fassbinder's last film, \\"Querelle\\" (1982).  - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.  - Jean Genet ( ) was a French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist. Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but he later took to writing. His major works include the novels \\"Querelle of Brest\\", \\"The Thief's Journal\\", and \\"Our Lady of the Flowers\\", and the plays \\"The Balcony\\", \\"The Blacks\\", \\"The Maids\\" and \\"The Screens\\".  - The Thief's Journal (\\"Journal du voleur\\") is perhaps Jean Genet's most famous work. It is a part-fact, part-fiction autobiography that charts the author's progress through Europe in a curiously depoliticized 1930s, wearing nothing but rags and enduring hunger, contempt, fatigue and vice. Spain, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Nazi Germany, Belgium... everywhere is the same: bars, dives, flop-houses; robbery, prison and expulsion.  - Querelle is a 1982 West German - French English - language drama film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Brad Davis , adapted from French author Jean Genet 's 1947 novel Querelle de Brest . It marked Fassbinder 's final film as a writer / director ; it was posthumously released just months after the director died of a drug overdose in June 1982 .  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - New German Cinema is a period in German cinema which lasted from the late 1960s into the 1980s. It saw the emergence of a new generation of directors. Working with low budgets, and influenced by the French New Wave, such directors as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Alexander Kluge, Harun Farocki, Volker Schlöndorff, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, Margarethe von Trotta and Wim Wenders made names for themselves and produced a number of 'small' motion pictures that caught the attention of art house audiences, and enabled these directors (particularly Wenders and Schlöndorff) to create better-financed productions which were backed by the big US studios.  - Rainer Werner Fassbinder (31 May 1945  10 June 1982) was a German film director, screenwriter, film producer and actor. Fassbinder was part of the New German Cinema movement.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'querelle' exhibits the relationship of 'based on'.

Cette préoccupation se réfère non seulement à la capacité des chercheurs à obtenir des ressources financières pour mener à bien leurs projets, mais également à l'impact que cela pourrait avoir sur la compétitivité de ces initiatives au sein des concours ouverts organisés par le CIHR. Dans ce contexte, il est important de noter que les restrictions budgétaires peuvent entraver le développement de nouveaux projets de recherche ainsi que la continuité des projets existants. Par conséquent, le manque de financement représente un problème majeur pour les chercheurs qui souhaitent innover et progresser dans leur domaine de spécialisation. Ce problème s'explique par différentes raisons, telles que l'insuffisance des fonds publics alloués à la recherche en santé, la complexité des processus de demande de financement et la concurrence accrue entre les chercheurs pour accéder à ces ressources. Dans le cadre des concours ouverts organisés par le CIHR, il est essentiel de promouvoir l'équité et la transparence en termes de financement ainsi que d'encourager des collaborations efficaces entre chercheurs et institutions. Ces concours visent à soutenir les projets de recherche les plus prometteurs en leur fournissant des ressources financières pour atteindre leurs objectifs. Cependant, le niveau de compétitivité peut être très élevé, ce qui peut décourager certains chercheurs ou les mettre en difficulté pour présenter des demandes de financement solides et compétitives. Afin de surmonter cette difficulté et de rendre les chercheurs plus compétitifs dans les concours ouverts du CIHR, il est nécessaire de renforcer la collaboration entre différentes disciplines et institutions, d'améliorer la qualité et la pertinence des projets de recherche proposés, et de promouvoir la formation et le développement professionnel pour les chercheurs dans le domaine de la santé. Il est également crucial de commencer par sensibiliser les chercheurs aux ressources et aux opportunités de financement disponibles, notamment en fournissant des conseils et en offrant des ateliers et des séminaires pour renforcer les compétences en matière de recherche et de rédaction de demandes de financement.

Translate to English","output":"Winston Churchill wrote, \\"Never, never, never entertain the idea that war can proceed smoothly and easily.\\" Winston Churchill, who served twice as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and is widely regarded as one of the most significant figures in modern history, was no stranger to the realities of war. He is well known for his leadership and tenacity during times of conflict, especially during World War II. He participated in and contributed to many military campaigns and endeavors throughout his life, so his perspective on the subject carries a great deal of weight. The quote in question, which insists that one should never assume that war can be without complications or challenges, reveals the depths of Churchill's understanding and experience. He was undoubtedly well aware of the complexities and difficulties inherent to warfare, and he sought to remind others of these essential truths. War, by its very nature, brings with it a wide range of obstacles and hardships – both for the soldiers who must confront the conflict directly and for the political leaders who must attempt to navigate through a myriad of challenging decisions and consequences. The outcomes of war often have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on the nations and communities involved, so it is crucial to recognize the gravity and complicatedness of such endeavors. Churchill's words are a stark reminder of the importance of considering all factors and consequences when engaging in war or any act of aggression, especially the potential for deviation from one's expectations and plans. Furthermore, his quote highlights his belief in the importance of preparedness, caution, and persistence in the face of adversity. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Never, never, never entertain the idea that war can proceed smoothly and easily\\" is a testament to Winston Churchill's insight into the brutal and unpredictable nature of warfare. It conveys the critical message that those involved in or leading any war effort should be mindful of the obstacles, challenges, and sacrifices that come with it and must approach the matter with the seriousness, caution, and determination it deserves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Electric motor: Nothing in the principle of any of the motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.

Mr Goldsmith stood as an independent after leaving the Conservative Party in protest at the government's decision to back a third Heathrow runway. But Lib Dem Sarah Olney, who is also opposed to Heathrow expansion, fought the campaign on the issue of Brexit. Labour's Christian Wolmar lost his Â£500 deposit as he trailed a distant third. In quotes: What the result means Ten famous by-elections In pictures: By-elections since 2010 BBC London Live: By-election reaction The other five candidates also lost their deposits as they did not receive a big enough share of the vote. Ms Olney polled 20,510 votes to Mr Goldsmith's 18,638. The Conservative Party, UK Independence Party and Green Party did not field candidates. As the new Lib Dem MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, Ms Olney will be the party's only female MP - joining eight male colleagues. She said the by-election result was a rejection of the \\"politics of anger and division\\". She added: \\"The people of Richmond Park and North Kingston have sent a shockwave through this Conservative Brexit government, and our message is clear - we do not want a hard Brexit. \\"We do not want to be pulled out of the single market, and we will not let intolerance, division and fear win.\\" She said if Article 50 - the legal process that sparks Britain's exit from the EU - is put to a parliamentary vote, she will vote against it. \\"That's been a central part of my campaign and now I've been given a very  clear mandate that that's what they [constituents] want me to do,\\" she told the BBC. But the Conservative Party was quick to dismiss Ms Olney's view, stating: \\"This result doesn't change anything.\\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the result \\"was a remarkable, come-from-nowhere upset that will terrify the Conservatives\\", but he claimed it was also a rejection of \\"a hard Brexit\\". \\"This was not just about a Remain versus Leave rerun - this was about people trying to say to Theresa May, 'We do not like the extreme version of Brexit outside the single market you're taking us down,'\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"The other thing that was clearly a concern to voters was they desperately wanted a moderate, decent alternative to the Tories now Labour has shuffled off the main stage - and they were delighted to give the Liberal Democrats the opportunity to be just that.\\" Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg conceded the vote had been about Brexit as Richmond \\"was a very strong pro-Remain constituency\\". He praised Mr Goldsmith's \\"nobility\\" for keeping his word, but said it was a \\"real shame\\" that an independently minded person like him would no longer be in Parliament. In a year of political upsets, another. Sarah Olney joined the Liberal Democrats only 18 months ago. She now becomes the party's ninth MP. As soon as the polls closed last night, the width of Lib Dem smiles pointed to an extraordinary result. A party of government shrivelled to a rump at last year's general election had rediscovered its mojo in this rich, pro-European corner of south-west London. Zac Goldsmith had hoped this contest would be a referendum on the prospect of even more planes thundering through the skies here if Heathrow Airport gets bigger. But, instead, it was June's EU referendum that dominated. Seventy per cent of voters here backed Remain. But Zac Goldsmith didn't. The Liberal Democrats, unapologetically pro-EU, ruthlessly exploited this. Sarah Olney told me she would vote against triggering Article 50 - the formal mechanism for starting Brexit. But the country voted Leave, even if this seat didn't, and the government will press on regardless. For Zac Goldsmith this was his second political humiliation of the year - beaten by Labour to be London Mayor, beaten by the Lib Dems in his own backyard. And leaving Theresa May's slender majority looking even thinner. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead Brexit negotiator and chair of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, tweeted his good wishes to Ms Olney. \\"Congratulations @sarahjolney1 and @LibDems. Europe is watching & we are proud #IamEuropean,\\" he wrote. Mr Goldsmith, who campaigned for Leave in the referendum, quit as the Tory MP for the constituency in October so he could fight a by-election as an independent on an anti-Heathrow Airport expansion ticket. At the time, the Conservatives said they \\"disagreed\\" with Mr Goldsmith's decision but would not field a candidate against him. A relative newcomer to politics, Sarah Olney said she was compelled to join the Liberal Democrats after the 2015 general election. In her victory speech, she said: \\"A year and a half ago I wasn't involved in politics, I wasn't a member of a political party, I had never been involved in a political campaign, I had never thought about being a politician. \\"But I knew I was a liberal. \\"When I saw what happened in the general election last year I felt I had to get involved.\\" Ms Olney, who lives in North Kingston with her husband Ben and two children, works as a qualified accountant at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. After his defeat was announced, Mr Goldsmith said: \\"This by-election was not a political calculation. \\"It was a promise that I made and it was a promise that I kept. \\"I wish Sarah well in her very, very important job and I hope she serves this community as well as this community deserves.\\" A Conservative Party spokesman said the result would make no difference to Brexit plans. He said: \\"The government remains committed to leaving the European Union and triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year.\\" Turnout = 53.6% Ms Olney was elected with a majority of 1,872 votes, compared with a Conservative Party majority of 23,015 at the 2015 general election. What is a summary of this text?","output":"In the Richmond Park by-election, the Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Olney won the south-west London seat, defeating Zac Goldsmith, who resigned from the Conservative party and ran as an independent over their Heathrow expansion policy. The Liberal Democrats used the election to fight \\"hard Brexit\\", with Olney stating that if Article 50 were put to a parliamentary vote, she would vote against it. The result reduces the total number of Conservative members of parliament to 329 and increases the already slender majority the Conservative government has in the Commons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bu hafta haberlerde ayrıca: Hırvat profesör tiroid uyarıcı hormonun kemik erimesini önlediğine dair kanıt buldu. Translate to English","output":"This week in the news: Croatian professor finds evidence that thyroid-stimulating hormone prevents bone loss. In this week's headlines, a notable discovery was made by a Croatian professor regarding the connection between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the prevention of bone loss, also known as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a common medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide, especially among the elderly population. It is characterized by the weakening of bones, which increases the risk of fractures and can significantly impact a person's quality of life. The Croatian researcher investigated the potential role of TSH in maintaining bone health and preventing osteoporosis. TSH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain, which stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormones. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolism, growth, and development. In recent years, scientists have been investigating the possible effects of TSH on bone metabolism and bone health. Through his extensive research, the Croatian professor found evidence suggesting that TSH could indeed play a protective role in maintaining bone density. According to the findings, TSH appears to prevent the breakdown of bone by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, which are specialized cells responsible for the resorption of bone tissue. By reducing the activity of osteoclasts, TSH may be able to slow down the process of bone loss and help prevent the development of osteoporosis. This discovery has significant implications for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Currently, the most common pharmaceutical interventions for osteoporosis include bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy, both of which have potential side effects and limitations. The knowledge that TSH may be an essential factor in maintaining bone density could lead to the development of new, more targeted therapies that have fewer side effects and can be tailored to individual patients. Furthermore, this research could help improve our understanding of the complex relationship between the endocrine and skeletal systems. Identifying the specific mechanisms through which TSH affects bone metabolism may pave the way for additional research into other hormonal factors that influence bone health. Such insights could ultimately lead to better prevention strategies and more effective treatments for osteoporosis and other bone-related disorders. In conclusion, the recent discovery by the Croatian professor regarding the potential role of TSH in preventing bone loss represents a significant advancement in our knowledge of osteoporosis and bone health. This groundbreaking research could pave the way for more innovative and effective treatment options for osteoporosis, as well as contribute to a greater understanding of the complex interplay between hormones and bone metabolism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vollin agrees and is successful; he befriends the spirited and grateful Jean, in the process revealing his passion for all things related to Edgar Allan Poe, including his homemade collection of torture devices inspired by Poe's works (such as a pit, pendulum with crescent razor, shrinking room, etc.), and identifying the raven as his talisman. After Vollin reveals his growing love for Jean to her father, the Judge quickly discourages him from the affair. Angered, Vollin hatches a plan when Edmond Bateman (Karloff), a murderer on the run, comes to his home asking for a new face so he may live in anonymity. Vollin admits to not being a plastic surgeon, but says he can help Bateman, and asks him to help in exacting revenge on the Thatchers, which he refuses. Bateman explains that he feels his antisocial behavior is a result of having been called ugly all his life, and he hopes a new face may gave him a chance to end it. Vollin performs the surgery, but instead turns Bateman into a disfigured monster, promising only to operate again on Bateman when Vollin's revenge is exacted. Bateman finally reluctantly agrees. Vollin hosts a dinner party, among which Jean, Jerry, and the Judge are guests. One by one, the guests are caught in the Poe-inspired traps.

Write some highlights for the following article: Using the most unlikely of clues -- a pretzel bag -- authorities in Denmark and the United States are zeroing in on a suspected child abuser, and they are asking for the public's help in ending the exploitation of a small girl. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday released five photographs of a man carefully edited from four videos in which the man sexually assaults a young girl, believed to be 7 to 9 years old. Three of the videos, which contain a clear image of the man, are date-stamped April 14, a fourth is dated April 27, and all four appear to have been posted on the Internet several days later, on May 2. Danish National Police discovered the videos soon thereafter and notified U.S. authorities on May 3. Three factors led Danish investigators to believe the crime occurred in the U.S.: the background, some products visible in the video, and the man's appearance. In the United States, investigators with Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of ICE, saw a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels in the videos. By studying Frito-Lay web sites, they learned that Rold Gold pretzels are packaged differently within the United States and Canada. ICE investigators believe the bag in the video is exclusively distributed in the United States. With leads coming to an end, the investigators are asking the public for help in identifying the man. \\"We kind of hit a wall in this investigation. Without the public's help, we may not be able (to find the man) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim,\\" said Brian Korzak, a special agent with ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Unit. Publication of the man's photo \\"will greatly increase our chances of locating this individual,\\" said Special Agent Patrick Redling. \\"Since the videos were created so recently, we feel there's a child in danger right now.\\" Korzak and Redling say investigators routinely identify both technical and visual clues in videos for evidence to identify criminals and to rescue victims. HSI is asking anyone with information about this man to contact the agency immediately by calling the ICE Tip Line at 866-347-2423 or completing an online tip form at www.ICE.gov/tips. Tips remain anonymous, ICE said, and individuals should not attempt to apprehend the suspect. ICE filed a criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court of Washington on Friday, charging the man in the photos, identified as a \\"John Doe,\\" of producing, possessing and distributing child pornography.","output":"So, there's a bad guy who is hurting a little girl.

The seven-week strike action was suspended last week amid negotiations between Unite and the city council. But the breakthrough could be unworkable as the council report says giving ground on workers' demands is not financially viable. It cost the authority up to £300,000 a week to clear the backlog of rubbish. See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here The dispute centres on a restructuring plan that Unite says is threatening the jobs of more than 120 refuse collectors, while the council says it will modernise the service and save £5m a year. The strike was suspended on 16 August after the council agreed certain posts would not be made redundant and conciliatory service Acas said bin collections could resume. A statement said the authority had accepted the workers' case and restored the jobs of grade three workers, who are responsible for safety at the back of refuse vehicles. However, a report due to be discussed by the council's cabinet on Thursday said the proposed reorganisation - which prompted the industrial action - was needed to enable spending to be contained within the budget. Current working arrangements and crew structure had not delivered value-for-money savings targets and \\"will not meet the business need of the future\\", the report said. The update report into the ongoing bins dispute has raised eyebrows for more than one reason. It's unusual to see so candid a publication in the public domain - but this report said quite clearly there's absolutely no room for manoeuvre when it comes to the pay grading issue that refuse workers have been striking over. Why? Not only because of the direct savings of more than £5m the council wants to make - but because keeping the grade three binmen as they are could lead to a raft of equal pay claims that the council can't afford. The report stops short of saying a deal was done prematurely, but it certainly recommends there should be no movement whatsoever on the council's original plans, which led to the strike in the first place. Not what Acas and Unite were saying last week, or what the binmen want to hear. One told me today that the mood is very downbeat following the deferral of this crucial vote - because he has no desire to go back on strike, but believes it's almost inevitable with such potentially deep division between council officers and the promise of a resolution. So next Friday really is crunch time, the day when new contracts must be issued, and when senior councillors must decide whether they vote with officers risking more devastating strike action, or against them - and then have to face some other potentially serious consequences. The leader, and much of the city, will be hoping they reach some kind of deal before then. The report said a decision to not proceed with the deletion of grade three roles would result in an increase in costs of £600,000 in a full year alone. \\"However, the more significant potential financial implications arising from a decision not to continue with the implementation of the new operating model arise from a significant increase in the risks in relation to further equal pay claims,\\" it added. The meeting to discuss the report was deferred until 1 September. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses a labor dispute between Unite, a labor union, and the city council in Birmingham involving the city's refuse collectors.

Please answer the following question: FRIDAY, Aug. 3 (Health Day News) -- Middle school students who are physically fit are likely to score higher on standardized tests measuring reading and math abilities, a new study has found. And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. \\"The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,\\" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. \\"Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive   and academic benefits that come from physical fitness\\", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading... What's the suitable title of the passage? A) Parents should be aware of the benefit of fitness. B) Fitter kids are likely to make better grades. C) Fitness affects kids' social behavior greatly. D) Teachers should value physical education classes. A:","output":"B) Fitter kids are likely to make better grades."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Abbot Howard Hoffman (November 30, 1936 - April 12, 1989) was an American political and social activist, anarchist, and revolutionary who co-founded the Youth International Party (\\"Yippies\\"). Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in protests that led to violent confrontations with police during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, along with Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale. The group was known collectively as the \\"Chicago Eight\\"; when Seale's prosecution was separated from the others, they became known as the Chicago Seven. While the defendants were initially convicted of intent to incite a riot, the verdicts were overturned on appeal. Context: Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in anti-Vietnam War protests, which were met by a violent police response during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was among the group that came to be known as the Chicago Seven (originally known as the Chicago Eight), which included fellow Yippie Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, future California state senator Tom Hayden and Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale (before his trial was severed from the others).  Presided over by Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to Hoffman, about which he joked throughout the trial), Abbie Hoffman's courtroom antics frequently grabbed the headlines; one day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes, while on another day, Hoffman was sworn in as a witness with his hand giving the finger. Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman \\"you are a 'shande fur de Goyim' [disgrace in front of the gentiles]. You would have served Hitler better.\\" He later added that \\"your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.\\" Both Davis and Rubin told the Judge \\"this court is bullshit.\\" When Hoffman was asked in what state he resided, he replied the \\"state of mind of my brothers and sisters\\".  Other celebrities were called as \\"cultural witnesses\\" including Allen Ginsberg, Phil Ochs, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Mailer and others. Hoffman closed the trial with a speech in which he quoted Abraham Lincoln, making the claim that the president himself, if alive today, would also be arrested in Chicago's Lincoln Park.  On February 18, 1970, Hoffman and four of the other defendants (Rubin, Dellinger, Davis, and Hayden) were found guilty of intent to incite a riot while crossing state lines. All seven defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy. At sentencing, Hoffman suggested the judge try LSD and offered to set him up with \\"a dealer he knew in Florida\\" (the judge was known to be headed to Florida for a post-trial vacation). Each of the five was sentenced to five years in prison and a 5,000 fine.  However, all convictions were subsequently overturned by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Walker Commission later found that in fact it had been a \\"police riot\\". Question: What happened during the trial?. Whats the answer?","output":"Alright, imagine a group of friends called the \\"Chicago Seven\\" who didn't like a big war happening. They went to a big meeting called the Democratic National Convention in 1968 to share their thoughts. The police didn't like that and it led to a big fight. So, the Chicago Seven had to go to a big room called a courtroom to talk to a man named Judge Hoffman. They had to explain why they were protesting, but they didn't always behave nicely, and sometimes wore funny clothes or said mean things to the judge.  Other famous people came to the courtroom to support the Chicago Seven and share their thoughts too. But in the end, the judge said the Chicago Seven were guilty for causing a big problem during their protest. They were told they had to stay inside a place called a prison for 5 years and pay some money. Later, other important people decided that the Chicago Seven were not guilty after all, and they didn't have to stay in prison. It was also found out that the big fight was actually the police's fault."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This group also includes all extinct non-avian dinosaurs, extinct crocodilian relatives, and pterosaurs. Archosauria, the archosaur clade, is a crown group that includes the most recent common ancestor of living birds and crocodilians. It includes two main clades: Pseudosuchia, which includes crocodilians and their extinct relatives, and Ornithosuchia, which includes birds and their extinct relatives (such as non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs).  - Desmatosuchinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs, the other being Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to \\"Desmatosuchus\\" than the last common ancestor of \\"Desmatosuchus\\" and \\"Stagonolepis\\". All synapomorphies that diagnose the clade can be found in the osteoderms. These include tongue-and-groove articulations for lateral plates present in dorsal presacral paramedian plates and large spikes on the lateral cervical, dorsal, and caudal plates.  - Aetosaurinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs , the other being Desmatosuchinae . It is a stem - based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to Aetosaurus than to the last common ancestor of Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus . The only synapomorphy that diagnoses the clade Aetosaurinae is the medial offset of the dorsal eminences of the paramedian osteoderms . A phylogenetic study in 2012 found Aetosaurinae to be paraphyletic , with Aetosaurus being the basal-most stagonolepidid and aetosaurines like Calyptosuchus , Neoaetosauroides , and the newly described Aetobarbakinoides being successively more derived taxa leading up to a clade containing Desmatosuchinae and Typothoracisinae . Under this phylogeny , most traditional aetosaurines are more closely related to Desmatosuchus than they are to Aetosaurus , and the clade Aetosaurinae can only include Aetosaurus .  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Desmatosuchus (from Greek  \\"desmos\\" 'link' +  \\"soûkhos\\" 'crocodile') is an extinct genus of archosaur belonging to the Order Aetosauria. It lived during the Late Triassic.  - Neoaetosauroides is an extinct genus of primitive aetosaur. Its type and only species is \\"N. engaeus\\". Fossils have been found from the Los Colorados Formation outcropping along the Sierra Morada River in La Rioja, Argentina, and date back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic. It was the first aetosaur known from the formation, with remains being discovered in the 1960s.  - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: ,  - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race +  - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree)  a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes.  - Aetosaurus is an extinct genus of archosaur reptile belonging to the order Aetosauria. It is generally considered to be the most primitive aetosaur. Three species are currently recognized: \\"A. ferratus\\", the type species from Germany and Italy; \\"A. crassicauda\\" from Germany; and \\"A. arcuatus\\" from eastern North America. Additional specimens referred to \\"Aetosaurus\\" have been found from South Africa, the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States, and the Fleming Fjord Formation of Greenland. Specimens of \\"Aetosaurus\\" occur in Norian-age strata.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - The Late Triassic is the third and final of three epochs of the Triassic Period in the geologic timescale. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event began during this epoch and is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding series is known as the Upper Triassic. In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper, after a German lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages.  - Typothoracisinae is a clade of aetosaurs within the subfamily Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs closer to \\"Typothorax\\" than to \\"Stagonolepis\\" or \\"Desmatosuchus\\". As with many aetosaur taxa, most of the synapomorphies that diagnose the clade are found in the osteoderms. These include a strongly acute angle of flexion between the dorsal and lateral flanges of the dorsal and lateral plates and triangular-shaped pelvic and anterior caudal dorsal lateral plates possessing semicircular borders and hook-like eminences.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Emil Hans Willi Hennig (April 20, 1913  November 5, 1976) was a German biologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics. In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in 1950. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (ordinary flies and mosquitoes).  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - In biology and genealogy, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA, also \\"last common ancestor\\" LCA, or \\"concestor\\") of any set of organisms is the most recent individual from which all organisms in a group, for are directly descended. The term is also used reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms.  - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\".  - In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characteristic of a clade. Apomorphy implies a characteristic that is different from the form of an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, of use in determining membership in a clade. Synapomorphy is a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms. In other words, it is an apomorphy shared by members of a monophyletic group, and thus assumed to be present in their most recent common ancestor. The word synapomorphy, coined by German entomologist Willi Hennig, is derived from the Greek words ', \\"syn\\" = shared; ', \\"apo\\" = away from; and \\"\\", \\"morphe\\" = shape.A   - In zoological nomenclature, a type species (\\"species typica\\") is the species name with which the name of a genus or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological type specimen(s). A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups called a type genus.  - Calyptosuchus (meaning \\"covered crocodile\\") is an extinct genus of crurotarsan from the Late Triassic of North America. As an aetosaur, it was heavily armored and had a pig-like snout used to uproot plants. The genus might be a junior synonym of \\"Stagonolepis\\".  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - Typothorax is an extinct genus of typothoracisine aetosaur that lived in the Late Triassic. Its remains have been found in North America. Two species are known: \\"T. coccinarum\\", the type species, and \\"T. antiquum\\".  - Stagonolepis is an extinct genus of stagonolepidid aetosaur known from the Late Triassic (Carnian stage) of Europe.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".  - Aetosaurs (\\"aetosaur\\" ; order name \\"Aetosauria\\" ; from Greek, (aetos, \\"eagle\\") and (sauros, \\"lizard\\")) are an extinct order of heavily armoured, medium- to large-sized Late Triassic herbivorous archosaurs. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera.    'aetosaurinae' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'taxon rank'?

In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him.

He was attempting to use conflict de-escalation technique number one, which involved affirming the individual's feelings and frustrations, and showing that he was listening to their side. However, in this particular case, the woman was not responding positively to the technique, and her extremely loud screaming necessitated Ray to pull the receiver away from his ear to protect his hearing and prevent any discomfort.

Yesterday, the President held a landmark meeting with a wide array of leaders in the health care field – insurance companies, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and providers –who pledged to work together to control costs in health care to the tune of 2 trillion in savings over the next ten years. Today, the President held another meeting with five employers, a state health department, and a union to discuss innovative ideas that are being implemented in the workplace to improve the health of workers and reduce the rising rate of health care spending.

The President directed the Office of Personnel Management to work with the Office of Health Reform, the National Economic Council, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Management and Budget to examine successful employer wellness and prevention practices that lower health care costs and improve employees’ health, and to explore possibilities of developing a plan for federal employees and their workplaces.      More generally, the discussion was designed to expand on the theme that the health care system in America needs comprehensive reform, including a much greater focus on wellness and prevention. As the President stated in his remarks afterwards , \\"what we've done here today is to gather together some of these stories and best practices to make sure that they are going to be informing the health care reform discussions that take place here in Washington.\\" If these companies have been able to implement proven measures in the private sector, \\"there’s no reason why we can’t do that for the country as a whole.\\" The White House fact sheet details the attendees and the kinds of practices they have been implementing: ||||| When colleagues want to conduct business with Sally Jewell, they have a better chance getting her to schedule a lengthy hike than a coffee date.      President Obama’s unconventional pick to lead the Interior Department — a former oil engineer and commercial banker who heads the consumer co-op Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI) — represents an effort by the administration to defuse the partisan fight over conservation and energy.      Jewell, who lacks the political experience of previous interior secretaries, will be challenged to rebuild a national consensus over protecting public lands. But friends and colleagues describe her as a pragmatic business leader who could work with both parties and interest groups on all sides.      Many environmentalists and oil and gas industry officials greeted her nomination with cautious optimism Wednesday, saying she could reconnect Americans to their outdoors heritage without stifling drilling and mining operations on land and off shore.      Introducing her at the White House, Obama emphasized that Jewell “has spent the majority of her career outside of Washington, where, I might add, the majority of our interior is located.”      She has proven, he added, that one can reconcile economic growth and environmental protection.      “She knows the link between conservation and good jobs,” Obama said. “She knows that there’s no contradiction between being good stewards of the land and our economic progress; that, in fact, those two things need to go hand in hand.”      Jewell, 56, who has spent most of her life in the Seattle area, is an avid climber and hiker who scaled Antarctica’s highest peak two years ago and has repeatedly climbed Washington state’s Mt. Rainier. Doug Walker, who served on the board of REI with Jewell, said she “walks the talk. . . . Sally is not fooling you here. She really does this stuff.”      Walker, who chairs the board of the Wilderness Society, described Jewell as a “can-do, activist-type manager” who will focus on inspiring Americans to care about public lands. The biggest challenge that conservationists face is “really reconnecting these federal lands to the broad swatch of American people, not just elderly white people,” Walker said.      Jewell has advised Republican and Democratic administrations alike on how to enlist more Americans in outdoor activities, most recently helping chart a plan for the U.S. National Park Service’s future while she served on the National Parks Second Century Commission.      Obama touted his nominee’s experience working for Mobil Oil in the late 1970s and the early ’80s, noting that Jewell was a University of Washington undergraduate studying to be a dentist when she “realized her boyfriend’s homework was more interesting than hers, and she decided to become an engineer” and “went on to work in the oil fields of Oklahoma and Colorado.”      Tim Wigley, president of the Western Energy Alliance, said he hoped that time in the fields would translate into expanded oil and gas drilling on federal lands. “We hope to see a better balance of productive development on non-park, non-wilderness public lands that enhances the wealth of America and creates jobs while protecting the environment,” he said.      1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Obama’s second term: Who’s in, who’s out?

President Obama’s Cabinet The president appoints 16 members to his Cabinet, in addition to many other high-profile positions.

Here is how the second-term team is shaping up. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      Jewell also won praise from former interior secretary Dirk Kempthorne, who enlisted her in multiple brainstorming sessions in Shepherdstown, W.Va., when he led the department under President George W. Bush.      “She was always someone I wanted there because she’s a catalyst,” Kempthorne said, adding that he didn’t even know her party affiliation. He said she was well suited to manage Interior’s “vast portfolio,” which includes Indian lands and offshore drilling, “because she is effective and time-tested on taking a variety of issues, deciphering them, determining what is the most important and making a decision.”      A few voices within the Republican Party and the environmental community expressed hesi­ta­tion Wednesday, noting that Jewell’s limited political résumémade it difficult to pass judgment.      Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she “looked forward to hearing about the qualifications Ms. Jewell has that make her a suitable candidate to run such an important agency and how she plans to restore balance to the Interior Department.”      Bill Snape, senior counsel for the advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity, wrote in an e-mail that he and his colleagues “are hopeful but not yet joining the love fest. She has her work cut out for her and our public lands are not a publicly-traded commodity on Wall Street.”      Outdoor Industry Association President Frank Hugelmeyer said the move shows that the president has recognized the true economic value of outdoor recreation. Hugelmeyer estimated that it generates 646 billion in annual direct consumer spending and 6.1 million direct jobs.      “No one sees it as unusual when a Treasury secretary comes out of the investment banking world,” he said. “I think it’s way overdue.”      If confirmed, Jewell would take over at a time when many conservationists are pressing Obama to take bolder action on land conservation. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar devoted much of his tenure to promoting renewable energy on public land and managing the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.      On Tuesday, former interior secretary Bruce Babbitt gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he called on the president to set aside one acre permanently for conservation for every acre he leases for oil and gas development.      “So far, under President Obama, industry has been winning the race as it obtains more and more land for oil and gas,” Babbitt said. “Over the past four years, the industry has leased more than 6 million acres, compared with only 2.6 million acres permanently protected. In the Obama era, land conservation is again falling behind.”      Fran Ulmer, a former lieutenant governor of Alaska who serves on the board of the National Parks Conservation Association with Jewell, said the nominee was skilled at helping “people get to a common solution” and tended “to take the long view” on public-lands issues.      “She’s going to ask the question, not what’s in the best interest today but what’s in the interest in the long term, and I think that will have implications for energy policy and public-lands management,” Ulmer said, “I’d say in a good way.”      As a member of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents, Jewell is also familiar with navigating difficult budget issues. The university’s president, Michael Young, said that even as board members struggled with a loss of state funding and subsequent tuition increases, “Sally was a remarkably steady voice in steering through that. She’s a great manager: very levelheaded, very clear-eyed, with the capacity to keep her focus on the ultimate goal.”      And Walker said that although Jewell is somewhat wary of entering the political fray, she’s “in essence willing to sacrifice everything” to take on the challenge.      “It’s not like she’s running for something else,” he said. “This is the culmination of what she wants to do.”      At the White House on Wednesday, Jewell joked about the challenge before her. “I’m going to do my best to fill those big boots of yours,” Jewell said to Salazar, prompting a round of laughter, “but I think I might get lost in your hat.”      Eddy J.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action.

Options: - street - forest - tree - yard - park  Explain why a human would choose \\"street\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"street\\" as the answer to the question of where a brave squirrel would be found because it demonstrates the qualities that are commonly associated with bravery, such as facing danger and unusual challenges, adapting to unfamiliar surroundings, and overcoming various obstacles. Firstly, streets tend to be more dangerous for squirrels compared to other environments like forests or parks. Squirrels have to deal with vehicles and other urban hazards, which can pose significant threats to their safety. Thus, the level of danger for a squirrel in a street environment is high, requiring extraordinary courage to navigate such a scene. A brave squirrel might be found thriving in this type of environment, as they would be displaying the fearlessness to face numerous dangers that a typical squirrel would possibly shy away from. Secondly, the urban landscape of a street reflects an environment that a squirrel would need to adapt to in order to survive. Streets are usually densely populated with human establishments, making them a less than ideal habitat for squirrels. In addition, the lack of natural resources, such as trees and greenery, could prove challenging for a squirrel typically accustomed to wooded areas. A brave squirrel would adapt to these unfamiliar surroundings and learn new skills to overcome the challenges that come with living in a street environment, which further epitomizes its bravery. Lastly, streets have various obstacles and distractions that squirrels need to confront. These may include navigating around humans and animals, dealing with noise pollution and traffic, and finding food in an area where natural resources might be scarce. This requires a level of boldness and resourcefulness that one might associate with a brave squirrel, as they have to display resilience and determination in order to survive in such an environment. In conclusion, a human might choose \\"street\\" as the answer to the question because a brave squirrel would likely encounter numerous challenges and dangers within this context, requiring extraordinary courage and adaptability to thrive. The street environment also pushes the squirrel to develop new skills and enhance their resourcefulness, illustrating a level of bravery that exceeds that of a squirrel found in a more natural and accommodating environment like a forest or park."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His books and stories have been bestsellers in Japan as well as internationally, with his work being translated into 50 languages and selling millions of copies outside his native country. The critical acclaim for his fiction and non-fiction has led to numerous awards, in Japan and internationally, including the World Fantasy Award (2006) and the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award (2006). His oeuvre received, for example, the Franz Kafka Prize (2006) and the Jerusalem Prize (2009). Most of Haruki Murakami's works use first-person narrative in the tradition of the Japanese I Novel. He states that because family plays a significant role in traditional Japanese literature, any main character who is independent becomes a man who values freedom and solitude over intimacy. Also notable is Murakami's unique humor, as seen in his 2000 short story collection, After the Quake. In the story \\"Superfrog Saves Tokyo\\", the protagonist is confronted with a 6-foot tall frog that talks about the destruction of Tokyo over a cup of tea. In spite of the story's sober tone, Murakami feels the reader should be entertained once the seriousness of a subject has been broached. Another notable feature of Murakami's stories are the comments that come from the main characters as to how strange the story presents itself. Murakami explains that his characters experience what he experiences as he writes, which could be compared to a movie set where the walls and props are all fake.  Many of his novels have themes and titles that invoke classical music, such as the three books making up The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: The Thieving Magpie (after Rossini's opera), Bird as Prophet (after a piano piece by Robert Schumann usually known in English as The Prophet Bird), and The Bird-Catcher (a character in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute). Some of his novels take their titles from songs: Dance, Dance, Dance (after The Dells' 1957 B-side song, although it is often thought it was titled after the Beach Boys' 1964 tune), Norwegian Wood (after The Beatles' song) and South of the Border, West of the Sun (after the song \\"South of the Border\\").  Some analyses see aspects of shamanism in his writing. In a 2000 article, Susan Fisher connected Japanese folk religion or Japanese shamanism with some elements of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, such as a descent into a dry well. At an October 2013 symposium held at the University of Hawaii, associate professor of Japanese Nobuko Ochner opined \\"there were many descriptions of traveling in a parallel world as well as characters who have some connection to shamanism\\" in Murakami's works. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What themes are in his writing?","output":"Haruki Murakami's writing often encompasses themes such as the importance of freedom and solitude, unusual humor, surrealism, and elements inspired by classical music. In his works, independent main characters are portrayed as valuing freedom and solitude over intimacy, reflecting the influences of traditional Japanese literature where family plays a significant role. Murakami's unique sense of humor is another prominent theme, as he believes that readers should be entertained even while addressing serious subjects. Furthermore, many of his stories contain surreal elements, where characters experience strange situations. Classical music is also frequently referenced in his novels, with some of them having titles and themes invoking well-known compositions. Additionally, some analyses suggest that aspects of shamanism, like connections to Japanese folk religion or parallel world travels, can be found in his writing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Britain is bracing itself for a lashing from the elements when the driest month on record is set to be blown away by 70mph winds and heavy rain this weekend. But it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the South. The spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end, however, with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days. Scroll down for video. Calm before the storm: Two men enjoy what could be the last of the glorious Indian Summer weather as they take a row on the River Cam in Cambridge this morning. Forecasters have predicted dismal conditions over the next few days, but much of Britain has been enjoying the glorious weather that typified much of September. This stunning scene was captured across Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire last night, but the sun is also setting on the glorious weather with up to 60mm of rain falling in a matter of hours in some parts. Sunlight bursts through the mist over Corfe Castle in Dorset. Despite the settled weather in the last few dayts, the The Met Office has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding. Up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by 10C. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. It is also likely to finish in the top five warmest Septembers. The Met Office warned severe gales with gusts of up to 70mph were possible in north-west Scotland in a yellow 'be aware' alert. The sun sets over Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire in a picture taken from Dunstable Downs. Severe weather warnings of rain are in place for parts of the north and west of Britain today and tomorrow. Picturesque: This autumnal scene was captured at Sycamore Gap along Hadrian's Wall last night. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. With the sun shinging and beneath clear blue skies,  a man enjoys the fine weather as he walks his dog along the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Despite the dire weather forecast, these four girls found it warm enough today to paddle in the sea at the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Fine day for a walk: The surface of the water sparkles in the October sun today as a man walks his dog along the shore at Hastings. The Chief Forecaster's assessment said: 'Although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of Scotland, the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur.' A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning. Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours. Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was  spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young. Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of. Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch. The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.' It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding. A man heads out early to the banks o the River Cam in Cambridgeshire for some fishing. Rain is set to sweep in over the South and East of England tomorrow morning. A team of rowers head out for an early morning row on the River Cam while a thin blanket of mist covers the trees in the back ground. The calm scenes are set to come to an end when an Atlantic front moves in across Britain. Enjoy it while it lasts: Temperatures across Britain have remained above average for the beginning of October - but the mercury could plummet by 10C in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow. Forecasters say the high pressure that settled over Britain for much of September is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return. Temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average October weather. University rowers take a breather during an early morning practice session on the River Cam. The scene is a sharp contrast to the weather predicted over the next few days. A cyclist is pictured riding along the banks of the River Cam in Cambridgeshire this morning. Temperatures topped 20C in some parts of Britain today. The sun shines through the trees along the banks of the River Cam as two women enjoy a morning row. Wet weather is set to sweep in from tonight. Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of \\"change of month, change of weather\\". 'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas. 'While river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry September, a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours, so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas. Dark clouds gather from the coast off Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire this afternoon with Scotland's Indian summer looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning. Scotland and northern England is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end. 'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges. 'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late. 'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.' Highlights:","output":"1. After enjoying the driest month on record and warm weather, the UK is set to face heavy rain and winds up to 70mph this weekend. 2. The Met Office has issued a yellow \\"be aware\\" alert for severe gales, which could batter the northwest of Scotland. 3. Southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England, and Wales are expected to see heavy downpours, raising concerns of surface water flooding. 4.

Context: In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her. Question: The narrating nurse probably believes that: Answer: Available choices: [1]. Connie was worth defending before she took action. [2]. not enough information. [3].

Stereolab's music is politically and philosophically charged. Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views.

Here is a question about this article: John Evans, for whom Evanston is named, bought 379 acres (153 ha) of land along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of Evanston, Illinois. The first building, Old College, opened on November 5, 1855.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them.  I am facing a new situation today: Bob and Andy were two nature enthusiasts. They went camping together once a month. Bob was into bird watching, while Andy was fascinated with frogs and salamanders. They went on a trip last week-end and they were very happy with what they had observed.

The teams drew a blank in the much-anticipated bout, leaving both the fans and players feeling a mix of relief and disappointment. Dundee, wearing their traditional dark blue, had the home advantage, having the backing from the legion of loyal fans at Dens Park. Despite the support, they struggled to find a breakthrough in a frustrating 90-minute battle against Ross County. The latter, represented by their iconic red and navy uniforms, demonstrated their tenacity through a sturdy defence, neutralizing Dundee's attack effectively.  The opening minutes of the match showed promise, with both teams displaying an eagerness to establish an early lead. Dundee's forward paced up and down the field, with a couple of close moments that could've tipped the scales in their favor. However, Ross County's goalkeeper exhibited immaculate performance, thwarting the several attempts with exceptional saves. The latter's defense was uncannily reliable, a crucial factor in the resultant draw.  On the other hand, Ross County, though equally thwarted by Dundee's resilient goalkeeper, displayed some impressive footwork and strategic attacking plays. Their midfield was a sight to behold, though unfortunately for them, Dundee's defense held firm, refusing to allow them a clear shot at their posts.  The first half was a frustrating segment of the match, with both teams creating opportunities but failing to convert any into a lead. The brinkmanship on display offered a thrilling yet somewhat agonizing watching experience for the spectators. Multiple shots on goal from both sides were blocked or veered wide, leaving the scoreboard untouched as the halftime whistle blew. As they emerged from the tunnel for the second part of the clash, the determination in the player's eyes was evident. Both Dundee FC and Ross County remained resolute in their resolve to break the deadlock. The second half mirrored the first, with both teams battling fiercely but failing to find the net. The closing minutes of the game saw an intensely aggressive performance from both sides. Efforts were redoubled as they made a desperate final bid to score. Despite several close calls, the goal remained elusive. The final whistle confirmed the undeniable outcome of the encounter - a goalless draw. In the aftermath, both Dundee and Ross County would feel a blend of satisfaction and disappointment. The former would be pleased with their defensive showing and, equally, frustration at a lack of corresponding offensive success. In contrast, Ross County can be proud of their performance away from home, holding their ground at Dens Park. This goalless standoff between Dundee FC and Ross County at the iconic Dens Park shows the immense competition within the Scottish Premiership. Furthermore, it highlights the skill level within these teams, with both defenses deserving credit for their determined performances. Despite the lack of goals, this match was far from uneventful, displaying an array of twists and turns, hard tackles, near misses, and splendid saves. The performance will undoubtedly spark conversation and raise questions about both teams' strategies and tactics for the remainder of the season. It's clear, however, that both Dundee and Ross County have shown they're not to be underestimated, proving yet again that in the Scottish Premiership, it's always a battle to the end."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The man in the canoe had lost his paddle .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the given hypothesis. The premise states that a man wearing a red life-vest is sitting in a canoe on a body of water, which provides us with some information about the scene. However, this information is insufficient in helping us determine whether the man has lost his paddle or not.  In order to analyze the situation in a more comprehensive manner, we need to consider other possibilities and information. For instance, we could examine the following scenarios: 1. The man is purposefully not using the paddle: It is possible that the man is taking a break, resting, or simply enjoying the view and tranquility of the surrounding environment. In this case, he might have kept the paddle inside the canoe or nearby, and we would not be able to conclude that he has lost his paddle. 2. The man is using an alternative method to propel the canoe: While paddles are the most common way to maneuver a canoe, there is a chance that this person is using an alternative method, such as a small motor or even a creative DIY solution. Again, in this case, it would be incorrect to conclude that the man has lost his paddle. 3. The man is intentionally not using a paddle: The man could be engaged in an activity that doesn't require a paddle, such as fishing, bird watching, or photography. In this scenario, the canoe is simply a means of transportation or a platform from which to perform his chosen activity. Thus, we cannot jump to the conclusion that he has lost his paddle. 4. The man is in a state of distress: It is possible that the man is experiencing some sort of emergency or crisis, such as being injured, ill, or entangled in aquatic plants, which prevents him from using the paddle. In this case, we cannot be sure whether he has lost his paddle or if he is simply unable to use it due to these circumstances. 5. The man has indeed lost his paddle: Admittedly, it is possible that the man has indeed lost his paddle and is currently stranded on the water without a means to propel his canoe. However, we cannot simply assume this scenario is accurate without considering other potential situations and additional information. In conclusion, while the hypothesis might be a possibility, we cannot confidently say that it is accurate based solely on the given premise. As the provided information is insufficient in deducing the paddle's status, we may need to gather more evidence or context regarding the situation before making a definitive conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there are some minor differences and alterations in word choices and wording that can be further analyzed. 1. Original sentence: She worked on processes of chemical extraction of metal complexes and described the chemical and physical properties of solvent species in an organic solvent. 2. Paraphrase: It worked on solvent extraction processes of metal complexes and described the chemical and physical properties of chemical species in an organic solvent. Here is a detailed comparison of the two sentences: - Subject: The first sentence uses \\"She\\" as the subject, referring to a female individual. In contrast, the paraphrase uses \\"It,\\" which appears to refer to a neutral entity or a potentially non-human subject. The change from a human subject to a neutral subject might alter the context and lead to ambiguity regarding the entity performing the research. - Action: In both sentences, the action remains the same – working on extraction processes and describing properties. - Object: The object of the sentences is the extraction processes of metal complexes. In the original sentence, it is mentioned as \\"processes of chemical extraction of metal complexes,\\" while the paraphrase describes it as \\"solvent extraction processes of metal complexes.\\" The word \\"chemical\\" is omitted from the paraphrase. However, the meaning remains the same since solvent extraction is a chemical process. - Purpose: The purpose of the actions in both sentences is to describe the chemical and physical properties of the species in an organic solvent. In the first sentence, it is specifically mentioned as \\"solvent species,\\" while the paraphrase uses the term \\"chemical species.\\" Although this change slightly alters the specificity, the overall purpose remains the same. In summary, both sentences are paraphrases that convey the same message despite having different word choices and structures.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism. Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to \\"vivre pour altrui\\" (\\"live for others\\", from which comes the word \\"altruism\\"), and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Altruism came from the phrase \\"vivre pour altrui,\\" which means \\"live for others\\" in French.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, \\"When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof.

First, we want to make our sand pie in something like a bowl, right? But in this case, our bowl is the big tank for the pool sand filter.

Now, we come to the stuff we fill into our 'bowl'. If we're making a sand pie, what do we need most? Yes, sand! So, we need lots of 'special' sand called pool silica sand. We need to pour that into the 'bowl' or the big tank. After doing that, we will pretend we're at the beach. What would a sand pie be without water? Boring, right? So, we'll fill the tank with water up to where the sand reaches. We'll have our sand nice and watery now.  Next, we take a tiny circle band - it's called an O-ring that goes on the pool filter's valve (that's like a door that controls water flow). Now, this O-ring needs to be slippery to work properly. It's like when we use some soap on our slide to make it extra slippery. But we can't use soap here, we'll use a special slippery stuff called a multipurpose lubricant. With the O-ring now all slippery, we can put it back on the valve. The valve, our water control door, then attaches to our 'bowl' or tank. Think of it like adding a door to your sandcastle. Last, we have the collar and pipes, let's think of those as the crown and scepter of our sand kingdom.

Answer the following question: What does a child learn to do in a lake? - become adult - row boat - drive - go out to play - begin school  The best answer is Answer:","output":"A child can learn various skills and engage in numerous recreational activities in a lake. Among the options provided, the best answer is learning to row a boat and going out to play. Here's a breakdown of each activity: 1. Become adult: Growing up and becoming an adult is a natural process that happens over time. A lake doesn't directly contribute to this process. However, a child can surely learn important life lessons and skills near a lake, which contribute to their maturity as they grow older. 2. Row a boat: Learning to row a boat is an excellent skill for a child to develop at a lake. Rowing a boat offers numerous benefits such as enhancing coordination, improving strength, and teaching teamwork, as well as offering a fun outdoor activity. It also promotes a sense of independence while allowing the child to learn how to navigate through water safely. 3. Drive: A child cannot learn to drive a car in a lake. Driving requires a proper instructor, dry land, and adherence to safety and legal regulations. However, a child may learn to operate small watercraft, such as kayaks or paddle boats, under adult supervision. 4. Go out to play: A lake offers a wonderful environment for a child to engage in outdoor recreational activities and play. Swimming, fishing, kayaking, and building sandcastles are just a few examples of fun activities a child can enjoy at a lake. Playing outdoors can help a child develop important physical, social, and cognitive skills, as well as fostering a connection to nature and an appreciation for the environment. 5. Begin school: A lake is not a formal educational institution; therefore, a child cannot start school at a lake. However, spending time at a lake may offer valuable learning opportunities and introduce them to various aspects of nature, animal and plant life, and water ecosystems. In conclusion, a lake provides a great environment for a child to learn skills such as rowing a boat and going out to play, while also offering opportunities to explore nature, develop physical abilities, and create lifelong memories. Although some activities mentioned may not be directly related to a lake, it is essential to recognize that a child's experiences at a lake can contribute to their overall growth and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If your difference in perspective causes friction between you, don't let it bubble away silently. As with any tension in a relationship, it's unlikely to disappear if you don't address it openly. Can we draw the following conclusion? The main subject of this article is politics.","output":"No, the main subject of this article is not politics. The primary topic discussed in the provided information is about maintaining a successful relationship between an atheist and a theist. It emphasizes the importance of open communication, specifically in addressing differences in perspective that might arise due to the distinction in their beliefs. In order to address your initial question more comprehensively, here is a detailed answer regarding how to make an atheist and theist relationship work: 1. Maintain open communication: As mentioned earlier, it is crucial to encourage honest and open conversations about your differences in belief and any impact they may have on your relationship. By discussing these issues openly, both partners are better equipped to address any tension and find workable solutions. 2. Respect each other's beliefs: It is essential for both the atheist and the theist in a relationship to respect each other's beliefs, even if they do not agree. Taking the time to understand the rationale, experiences, and emotions behind those beliefs can help promote empathy and compassion in the relationship. 3. Define common values and goals: Despite the differences in religious beliefs, couples often find they still share many values or goals, such as kindness, honesty, or striving for personal growth. Identifying these shared values can help build a foundation that excellent compatibility supersedes even the most significant differences in personal belief. 4. Establish boundaries: Both partners should set boundaries when it comes to discussing each other's beliefs and engaging in religious practices. It is vital to create an environment where both parties can express their views without feeling attacked or belittled. 5. Support each other's individuality: In a healthy relationship, partners need to support each other's personal growth, interests, and expressions of identity, even when they do not align with their own beliefs. Empowering each other's individuality will create a positive atmosphere where both partners feel valued and loved. 6. Learn from each other: The differences in perspective and belief systems can provide an opportunity to learn about other ways of seeing the world. By engaging in open discussions and sharing experiences, you may gain new insights and develop a greater appreciation for the complexity and diversity of human beliefs. 7. Foster mutual understanding: It is essential to realize that a lasting and healthy relationship involves understanding, support, and acceptance of differences. Both partners should strive for a deeper understanding of one another's outlook and respect the unique experiences, beliefs, and thoughts that shape who they are. 8. Seek external support, if needed: Sometimes, couples might benefit from seeking the guidance of a relationship therapist or a support group for interfaith couples. These resources can provide valuable insights and coping strategies to navigate the complexities of an atheist and theist relationship. In summary, the main subject of this article is not politics but rather creating harmonious relationships between atheists and theists by cultivating open communication, respecting each other's beliefs, and adopting a supportive and nurturing attitude towards individuality and growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.  Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies.  Which river didn't have a food source mostly derived from algae? Answer:","output":"The Olt River, being a fast moving river, would be less likely to have a food source mostly derived from algae as the faster currents and turbulence make it harder for algae to grow and establish. The slower moving and deeper Mures River would be more suitable for algae growth, forming a significant part of its food source."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brown was the fourth of five children. During Brown's childhood, mob violence periodically erupted in Mineola, keeping African- Americans from voting. His first job was a shoeshine boy in a whites-only barber shop. In 1995, Brown ran for Mayor of San Francisco. In his announcement speech, Brown said San Francisco needed a \\"resurrection\\" and that he would bring the \\"risk-taking leadership\\" the city needed. Brown placed first in the first round of voting, but because no candidate received 50 percent of the vote, he ran against incumbent Frank Jordan in the December runoff. Brown gained the support of Supervisor Roberta Achtenberg who had placed third in the first round of voting. Brown campaigned on working to address poverty and problems with Muni. He called Jordan the \\"inept bumbler\\" and criticized his leadership. Jordan criticized Brown for his relations with special interests during his time in the State Assembly. Brown easily defeated Jordan in the runoff.  Brown's inaugural celebration included an open invitation party with 10,000 attendees and local restaurants providing 10,000 meals to the homeless. President Bill Clinton called Brown to congratulate him, and the congratulations were broadcast to the crowd. He delivered his inaugural address without notes and led the orchestra in \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\". He arrived at the event in a horse-drawn carriage. According to the New York Times, Brown was one of the nation's few liberal big city mayors when he was elected in 1996.  In 1996, more than two thirds of San Franciscans approved of Brown's job performance. As mayor, Brown made several appearances on national talk shows. Brown called for expansions to the San Francisco budget to provide for new employees and programs. In 1999, Brown proposed hiring 1,392 new city workers and proposed a second straight budget with a US100 million surplus. He helped to oversee the settling of a two-day garbage strike in April 1997. During Brown's tenure, San Francisco's budget increased to US5.2 billion and the city added 4,000 new employees. Brown tried to develop a plan for universal health care, but there wasn't enough in the budget to do so. Brown put in long days as mayor, scheduling days of solid meetings and, at times, conducting two meetings at the same time. Brown opened City Hall on Saturdays to answer questions. He would later claim of his mayorship that he helped restore the city's spirit and pride.  Brown's opponents in his 1999 mayoral reelection campaign were former Mayor Frank Jordan and Clint Reilly. They criticized Brown for spending the city's US1 billion in budget growth without addressing the city's major problems and creating an environment in city hall of corruption and patronage. Tom Ammiano was a late write-in candidate and he faced Brown in the runoff election. Brown won reelection by a 20 percent margin. He was supported by most major developers and business interests. Ammiano campaigned on a promise that he would raise the minimum wage to US11 per hour and scrutinize corporate business taxes. Brown repeatedly claimed that Ammiano would raise taxes. President Clinton recorded a telephone message on Brown's behalf. Brown's campaign spent US3.1 million to Ammiano's US300,000. The 1999 mayoral race was the subject of the documentary See How They Run.  One of Brown's central campaign promises was his \\"100-Day Plan for Muni,\\" in which he boasted he would fix the city's municipal bus system in that many days. Brown supported the \\"Peer Pressure\\" Bus Patrol program, which paid former gang members and troubled youth to patrol Muni buses. Brown claimed the program helped reduce crime. He fired Muni chief Phil Adams and replaced him with his chief of staff Emilio Cruz. In 1998, Brown was Mayor during the summer of the Muni meltdown as Muni implemented the new ATC system and Brown promised riders there would be better times ahead. A voter approved initiative in the following year would help improve Muni services. Brown increased Muni's budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure. Brown later said he made a mistake in over promising with his 100-Day Plan.  Brown helped mediate a settlement to the 1997 BART strike.  During his first term as mayor, Brown quietly favored the demolition and abolition of the Transbay Terminal to accommodate the redevelopment of the site for market-rate housing. Centrally located at First and Mission Streets near the Financial District and South Beach, the terminal originally served as the San Francisco terminus for the electric commuter trains of the East Bay Electric Lines, the Key System of streetcars and the Sacramento Northern railroads which ran on the lower deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Following the termination of streetcar service in 1958, the terminal has seen continuous service as a major bus facility for East Bay commuters; AC Transit buses transport riders from the terminal directly into neighborhoods throughout the inner East Bay. The terminal also serves passengers traveling to San Mateo County and the North Bay aboard SamTrans and Golden Gate Transit buses respectively, and to tourists arriving by bus motorcoach. Today, the terminal is being planned for redevelopment as a region wide mass transit hub maintaining the current bus services, but with a new tunnel that would extend the Caltrain commuter rail line from its current terminus at Fourth and Townsend Streets to the site. Once completed, Caltrain riders would no longer need to transfer to Muni in order to reach the downtown financial district. Additionally, the heavy rail portion of the terminal would be designed to accommodate the planned High Speed Rail lines to Los Angeles.  In 1998, The Berkeley, California-based Bicycle Civil Liberties Union, produced a two-hour documentary film in the muckraker journalism tradition, July 25: The Secret is Out, which gives evidence of Brown's designs for the Transbay Terminal site.  Allegations of political patronage followed Brown from the State Legislature through his tenure as San Francisco mayor. Former Los Angeles County GOP Assemblyman Paul Horcher, who voted in 1994 to keep Brown as Speaker, was reassigned to a position with a six-figure salary as head San Francisco's solid waste management program. Brian Setencich also was appointed to a position by Brown. Both were hired as special assistants after losing their assembly seats because of their support of Brown. Former San Francisco Supervisor Bill Maher was also hired as a special assistant after campaigning for Brown in his first mayoral race. Brown is also criticized for favoritism to Ms. Carpeneti, the lobbyist with whom he had a child. In 1998 Brown arranged for Carpeneti to obtain a rent-free office in the city-owned Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. Between then and 2003, a period that spans the birth of their daughter, Carpeneti was paid an estimated 2.33 million by nonprofit groups and political committees controlled by then Mayor Brown and his friends.  Brown increased the city's special assistants payroll from US15.6 to US45.6 million between 1995 and 2001. Between April 29, 2001 and May 3, 2001, San Francisco Chronicle reporters Lance Williams and Chuck Finnie released a five-part story concerning Brown and his relations with city contractors, lobbyists, and city appointments and hires he had made during his tenure as Mayor. The report concluded that there was an appearance of favoritism and conflicts of interest in the awarding of city contracts and development deals, a perception that large contracts had an undue influence on city hall, and patronage with the hiring of campaign workers, contributors, legislative colleagues, and friends to government positions.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated Brown when he was Speaker. One investigation was a sting operation concerning a fake fish company attempting to bribe Brown; he was not charged with any criminal act. The FBI further investigated Brown from 1998 to 2003 over his appointees at the Airport Commission for potential conflicts of interests. Brown friend, contributor, and former law client, Charlie Walker was given a share of city contracts. He had served jail time in 1984 for violating laws concerning minority contracting. The FBI also investigated Brown's approval of expansion of Sutro Tower and SFO. Scott Company, with one prominent Brown backer, was accused of using a phony minority front company to secure an airport construction project. Robert Nurisso was sentenced to house arrest. During Brown's administration, there were two convictions of city officials tied to Brown.  The FBI investigated Brown's friend Charlie Walker, who won several city contracts. Walker had previously thrown several parties for Brown and was among his biggest fund raisers. Brown reassigned Parking and Traffic chief Bill Maher to an airport job when his critics claimed Maher should have been fired. Brown put his former girlfriend, Wendy Linka, on the city payroll, as well as having appointed another former girlfriend and current U.S. Senator from California, Kamala Harris, to two California State boards in 1994. Brown was known for his strong loyalty to his supporters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was hired as special assistants?","output":"Former Los Angeles County GOP Assemblyman Paul Horcher and Brian Setencich were hired as special assistants after losing their assembly seats because of their support of Brown.

This landmark decision showcases the dedication of our lawmakers to addressing critical environmental issues and marks a major shift in the country's stance on climate change. The amendment, which is now a part of a broader legislative package, addresses various aspects of climate change and seeks to implement both nationwide and international strategies to mitigate its disastrous effects. Key provisions of the amendment include new clean energy initiatives, a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and increased support for research into innovative climate change solutions. The decision to pass the amendment was backed by a majority of senators who recognized the pressing need for immediate action in the face of rapidly escalating global temperatures and extreme weather events. In their discussions, senators cited overwhelming scientific evidence that shows human activities, particularly excessive greenhouse gas emissions, are driving climate change and causing irreversible damage to our planet. The passage of the amendment has been met with widespread praise from environmentalists, scientists, and citizens alike who acknowledge the urgent need for the nation to take the lead in addressing this crisis. Many believe that this amendment is the first step in an ongoing political transformation, where our lawmakers put the long-term interest of our planet first and prioritize environmental conservation. Furthermore, by adopting the amendment, the Senate also sets an example for countries worldwide, encouraging them to follow suit and ramp up their efforts to combat climate change. Critics of the amendment, however, argue that the measures should be even more ambitious, stressing the importance of a total shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources. In conclusion, the Senate's passage of this amendment signifies the nation's commitment to combating climate change and safeguarding the health of our planet for future generations.

Answer this question. What was the operational squadron number of the Dambusters?","output":"The operational squadron number of the Dambusters was No. 617 Squadron. The Dambusters was a Royal Air Force (RAF) unit, formed during World War II, and gained their popular nickname due to their role in Operation Chastise, which was a daring and innovative bombing raid on German dams in the Ruhr Valley. No. 617 Squadron was formed at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, England, on March 21, 1943, under the leadership of Wing Commander Guy Gibson. The squadron was specifically created for this top-secret mission, and its members were selected from experienced aircrews across the RAF Bomber Command. The main purpose of the mission was to cripple German industrial production by destroying key dams that supplied water and hydroelectric power to the Ruhr Valley industrial area. For this operation, a specially designed \\"bouncing bomb\\" was developed by British engineer Sir Barnes Wallis. The bomb, known as the \\"Upkeep\\" mine, was designed to skip along the surface of the water like a bouncing ball, bypassing anti-torpedo nets, and eventually striking the dam wall before sinking and detonating at a preset depth. To achieve maximum accuracy, the bombers had to fly at a precise altitude of 60 feet and release the bomb at a specific distance from the target. The Dambusters, flying modified Avro Lancaster bombers, carried out Operation Chastise on the night of May 16-17, 1943, targeting the Möhne, Eder, and Sorpe dams. The Möhne and Eder dams were both breached, causing widespread flooding, damage to infrastructure, and significant loss of life. However, the Sorpe dam remained intact. Despite the high-risk nature of the mission and the loss of eight aircraft and 53 airmen, the operation was considered a success and a significant morale booster for the Allies. The Dambusters' achievement earned them enduring fame, and their story has been recounted in various books, films, and documentaries. Following the dam raids, No. 617 Squadron went on to undertake various specialized and high-risk missions during World War II, utilizing advanced technologies and tactics. They were often called upon to carry out precision bombing operations against heavily fortified targets, such as the Tirpitz battleship and V-2 rocket launch sites. As such, No. 617 Squadron became known as an elite RAF unit, recognized for their skill, courage, and innovation, with their legacy living on well beyond their iconic dam raids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we need to get -21d by itself on one side of the equation. Start by subtracting 231 from both sides: 0 - 231 = -21d + 231 - 231 -231 = -21d Step 3: Solve for 'd'.

But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood these words of our Lord's ascension and coming again in glory.  They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead.  And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them.  Christ seemed to have left the world.  The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while.  Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory.  And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.  Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.  And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

Seeing this movie was the most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. However, I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. This picture has everything any movie could ever have. It has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist self-conscious art film. It's all in there, adding up to a myth. The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), happily living in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. At one point, the story borrows from \\"Not without my baby,\\" but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice. The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khan's dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie. In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance. Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion. Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar. Nana Patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character. The movie is not without its share of realism. Violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions. At times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic. I have seen a share of Bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. But \\"Shakti\\" raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained. It is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. Perhaps, the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but I came out of watching \\"Shakti\\" exhilarated.

The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the six astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.The astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside. The sixth astronomer, Barbenfouillis himself, uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge on the Moon and into space. A Selenite tries to...

When Muggs refuses to train for the Golden Gloves match unless he has his own private camp in the country, Danny placates his pal by enlisting members of the Vassey Street Boys' Club in the Civilian Conservation Corps. Arriving at the camp, Muggs refuses to accept the authority of Allen, the leader of the boys, and treats the facility as if it was his own private property. Later, Muggs has a chance to demonstrate his true nature when he risks his own life to save Al from being crushed by a falling tree. The camp captain praises Muggs for his courage, and as a reward, Muggs requests a boxing match with Al. Norton, a small-time boxing promoter, comes to watch the fight, which ends in a draw.

The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light.  The reviewer expresses clear dissatisfaction with the product, citing a specific issue they have with it, which gives a clear indication that the depiction is unflattering. The phrase \\"Remake-a-rama\\" in the title is already a hint towards a negative review, suggesting there is an overabundance of remakes, which, depending on the context, can be seen as lack of creativity or originality. In the product review itself, the dissatisfaction is further expressed through the use of quantitative data. The reviewer explicitly states that, out of the 22 titles, only 4 are original. This can be perceived as a criticism because it suggests that the product offers a low percentage of new, fresh, or unique content (approximately 18%). The implication here is that the product relies heavily on redoing or reproducing already existing material, which the reviewer clearly views as a negative characteristic. The reviewer further compounds his argument by stating that the other 18 titles are later and even extensions to mean \\"much later\\" remakes. This provides additional scrutiny on those remakes, emphasizing their distance in time from the originals. Given the overall tone of the review, this detail seems to intensify the critique rather than serve as a mitigation. Moreover, the choice of the term \\"big disappointment\\" unquestionably underscores the unflattering light in which the product is depicted. A disappointment indicates a divergence between expectation and reality in a negative sense. This assertion reveals that the product did not live up to the reviewer's expectations or standards, a clear sign of an unflavoured review. In all, through its quantitative critique, specific dissatisfaction with the product's reliance on remakes, and overall tone of disappointment, the review represents the product negatively or unflatteringly.

But in reality his mission is to retrieve diamonds, worth fifty million dollars, from a mine company's vault. Curry's subordinates include his friend Ruffo (Jim Brown) and alcoholic Doctor Wreid (Kenneth More). He also reluctantly recruits ex-Nazi Henlein (Peter Carsten) because he needs his military expertise and leadership skills. The Congolese president provides Curry with the use of a steam train and soldiers. On the way, the train is attacked by a United Nations peacekeeping plane. The mercenaries then pick up Claire (Yvette Mimieux) after they find her house burned down and husband murdered by Simbas. Meanwhile, Henlein, who resents Curry's leadership, begins to cause trouble because the German knows about the diamonds. Things come to a boiling point when he kills two children whom he suspects of being rebel spies. Afterward, Henlein makes romantic advances towards Claire, which Curry interrupts. Curry and Henlein then fight an inconclusive duel which involves a chainsaw. Curry is prepared to kill Henlein, but Ruffo stops him. Further complications arise when the mercenaries reach the town. First, the diamonds are in a time-locked vault delaying the train's departure. Second, Dr Wreid attends a pregnant woman at a mission hospital and refuses to abandon her. Curry reluctantly agrees to let the doctor stay behind. Back in town, Curry waits anxiously for the vault to open. The delay allows the Simbas to catch up and begin attacking the town and station.

Beck was born in Los Angeles, to David Campbell and Bibbe Hansen. His father is a Canadian-born arranger, composer and conductor who worked on hundreds of albums and numerous films. Beck's mother grew up amid New York's Andy Warhol Factory art scene of the 1960s, where she was a Warhol superstar, but moved to California at age 17, where she met Campbell; she is a visual artist. Bibbe's maternal grandmother was Jewish, while Bibbe's father, artist Al Hansen, was partly of Norwegian descent. In 2000, Beck and his fiancee, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks later found on Sea Change. Beck sat on the songs, not wanting to talk about his personal life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and \\"not really strew my baggage across the public lobby\\". Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a common experience (a relationship breakup), and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called producer Nigel Godrich.  Retailers initially predicted that the album would not receive much radio support, but they also believed that Beck's maverick reputation and critical acclaim, in addition to the possibility of multiple Grammy nominations, might offset Sea Change's noncommercial sound. Sea Change, issued by Geffen in September 2002, was regardless a commercial hit and critical darling, with Rolling Stone revering it as \\"the best album Beck has ever made, [...] an impeccable album of truth and light from the end of love. This is his Blood on the Tracks.\\" The album was later listed by the magazine as one of the best records of the decade and of all-time, and it also placed second on the year's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. Sea Change yielded a low-key, theater-based acoustic tour, as well as a larger tour with The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band. Beck was playful and energetic, sometimes throwing in covers of The Rolling Stones, Big Star, The Zombies and The Velvet Underground.  Following the release of Sea Change, Beck felt newer compositions were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase. During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck was never able to recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003. Feeling as though it might take him a while to \\"get back to that [songwriting] territory\\", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to Odelay. Nearly half of the songs had existed since the 1990s.

This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859).

Please answer the following question: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered.  Does Springfield have more or less air pollution than Nillmar?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Answer:","output":"Springfield has less air pollution than Nillmar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify and understand the main components of the sentence. 2. Translate each component to Turkish. 3. Combine the translated components in a grammatically correct way. Step 1: Identifying main components: \\"It\\" refers to the subject. Since we don't have context, I assume it refers to an institution. \\"is also concerned with\\" emphasizes that, in addition to other topics, the focus is on something specific. \\"internal institutional issues\\" refers to the internal problems or situations within an organization.

Simpson was released from Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada after serving nine years for his part in a botched hotel room heist. USA TODAY Sports      This file photo from July 20, 2017 shows O.J. Simpson reacting to the decision that he was granted parole at Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nev. (Photo: Jason Bean, USA TODAY Sports)      A lawyer for O.J. Simpson has threatened a lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel-casino in Las Vegas that would seek at least 100 million in damages over alleged “malice and racial prejudice” related to Simpson’s banishment from the property in November.      Malcolm LaVergne told USA TODAY Sports that he will press forward with litigation if the casino doesn’t make public that Simpson did nothing untoward when he was asked to leave the casino.      “Mr. Simpson has had 100% perfect behavior since he’s been on parole,” LaVergne said. “He was having dinner with a friend from out of town and everything was going great. The next thing you know, when he was leaving, they told him, ‘Don’t come back.’”      Representatives from The Cosmopolitan have declined to provide specifics on what — if anything — took place, and a spokesperson described initial reports by other outlets as “inaccurate” when contacted in November. Reached Friday night, The Cosmopolitan said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports that it was company policy “to not comment on potential litigation.”      At least part of TMZ’s original report was erroneous. The first version of the story — which claimed Simpson had become “drunk” and “disruptive\\" — also alleged that a dispatcher referred to Simpson by name. A spokesperson for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told USA TODAY Sports that the department was not contacted about Simpson and a search of radio traffic from that Nov. 8 night included no mention of Simpson.      LaVergne said in the letter obtained by USA TODAY Sports that Simpson received a trespass notice from The Cosmopolitan.      \\"The Cosmopolitan Casino discriminately singled out Mr. Simpson amongst his non-African American friends and subsequently expelled him for what turned out to be a fake reason while he peacefully visited the Cosmopolitan property,\\" LaVergne wrote.      LaVergne said as result of the night, Simpson was contacted by his parole officers and underwent drug and alcohol tests, both of which were negative. LaVergne said while The Cosmopolitan is within its rights to ban an individual, he added that the casino has fostered the perception that the Pro Football Hall of Fame running back and Heisman Trophy winner was intoxicated and unruly.      “We are asking, in newspaper terms, for a retraction,” LaVergne said.      In the letter, LaVergne asked The Cosmopolitan for copies of any surveillance video from that night, a list of employees who were on duty and a copy of the policy on what leads the casino to ban patron.      Simpson, who was acquitted of double-murder charges in 1995, was paroled from a Nevada prison in October after he served nine years in prison for armed robbery and assault with a weapon conviction, a crime that took place at another Las Vegas hotel in an attempt to regain possession of memorabilia.

A West Tennessee nonprofit organization will use a 300,000 federal grant to hire an attorney and a Spanish-speaking paralegal to help provide legal assistance to domestic violence victims. The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement.

He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.

Question: what triggered the civil war I found the following answer on Google: The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, that answer does not accurately capture the main trigger of the American Civil War. The primary cause of the Civil War was the longstanding controversy over the enslavement of Black people. The United States had been divided for decades on the issue of slavery, with the Northern states opposing it and the Southern states supporting it. This divide intensified as new territories and states were added to the Union, and disagreements arose over whether these new areas should allow slavery or not. Prominent events, like the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and the infamous Dred Scott decision, further heightened tensions between the Northern and Southern states. The election of Abraham Lincoln, a Republican candidate who opposed the spread of slavery into new territories, as the 16th President in November 1860, was the catalyst for the conflict. Fearful that the balance of power in the federal government would shift against them and that their way of life and economy, largely reliant on enslaved labor, would be threatened, Southern states began to secede from the Union. South Carolina was the first to secede on December 20, 1860, and other Southern states soon followed. In total, eleven Southern states formed the Confederate States of America. The actual fighting began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, a Union military installation in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. This marked the beginning of the American Civil War, which would rage on until 1865."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Answer:","output":"Title: Disappointingly Lacking - 1-star review I recently downloaded the org.wordpress.android app with the hopes of having an enjoyable and efficient blogging experience on my mobile device, but I must say that I have been majorly disappointed. While the idea behind the app is commendable, the execution is severely lacking.  I'm writing this 1-star review to detail my experience and why I believe this app is in dire need of improvements. First and foremost, the user interface of the app is extremely clunky, slow, and outdated. The overall design feels like it's stuck in the past and not optimized for today's modern smartphones. The navigation is confusing, with elements and features hidden or difficult to find. It takes a considerable amount of time to do simple tasks, such as switching between screens or loading blog posts. The user experience is far from ideal. As a blogger, one of the essential components of my work is creating and editing content on the fly. In this department, the app is a colossal failure. Formatting text is an uphill battle, and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Plus, trying to add media, such as images and videos, is a nightmare. They either take too long to upload, or they don't upload at all, forcing me to refresh the app or start all over again. Another incredibly frustrating aspect of the app is the abundance of bugs and crashes. The app becomes unresponsive quite often, which forces me to close it and restart it, hoping that I didn't lose my progress in the process. It has also happened that my posts simply vanish without notice or explanation, causing me to lose hours of work. As if these issues weren't enough, the app also consumes an extreme amount of battery life, draining my smartphone's battery significantly faster than other apps. This makes it extremely difficult to use the app outside or when away from a charging source. Customer support is virtually non-existent. I tried to contact the app developers for assistance and troubleshooting advice, but my emails went unanswered. When you offer an app with so many technical issues, customer service is crucial and, unfortunately, severely lacking in this case. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the org.wordpress.android app to anyone looking for a convenient and reliable blogging experience. Not only is the user interface outdated and confusing, but the app is also riddled with bugs and glitches that prevent an enjoyable user experience. Adding to the lack of customer support and excessive battery consumption, this app has earned a solid 1-star rating from me. There are better options out there for bloggers looking for a more reliable and efficient app. I now find myself searching for an alternative, hoping I can leave this disappointment behind."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

For this reason, work toward accepting and embracing your tallness. One way to do this is by using affirmations. Create an affirmation about accepting your tallness and say it to yourself daily. It might feel silly or untrue at first but keep at it. Say an affirmation that affirms your value and worth.  For example, say, “I am worthy and valuable just the way I am” or, “I accept my body and love it.” You can also say, “I accept that I am tall,” or \\"I can make my tallness work for me.\\" Feeling good about yourself isn’t just about accepting your tallness. Focus on loving all parts of yourself. Find all the things about yourself that make you uniquely you. Surround yourself with people who are positive and who make you feel good about yourself. Reflect on your accomplishments and your positive qualities.  For example, you might be compassionate, helpful, kind, a good listener, and generous. If you can't think of any good qualities of yourself, try developing your self-esteem. Undoubtedly, you will weigh more than girls who are smaller than you. Don’t stress over this. If you’re self-conscious about your weight, don’t talk about it or avoid conversations where girls are talking about weight. It’s okay to weigh more than your smaller friends, but it’s also understandable if you don’t want to talk about it.  You also don’t have to be ashamed of your weight. You can talk openly about your weight and be okay with it. Just don’t compare your weight or try to lose weight because others weigh less than you. If your friends bring up weight, change the subject or go do something else. You might feel tempted to wear clothes that hide your body or make you feel invisible. Focus on finding clothes that flatter instead of hiding. It might be harder to find clothes that fit, but take the extra time to find the clothing lines that cater to your height. You’ll feel more confident and better about yourself when you see how nice you look in the mirror. Find styles that flatter your tallness and make you feel good. Shop online for tall fitting sizes. Few mall stores have pants with inseams longer than 35 inches (88.9 cm). Don’t try to lose weight or eat less in order to stop growing.Cutting calories or skipping meals won’t make you any shorter, it will only make you feel sick and lethargic.  Eat a healthy diet full of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

Spoiled playboy Bob Merrick's (Rock Hudson) reckless behaviour causes him to lose control of his speedboat. Rescuers send for the nearest resuscitator, located in Dr. Phillips's house across the lake. While the resuscitator is being used to save Merrick, Dr. Phillips suffers a heart attack and dies. Merrick ends up a patient at Dr. Phillips's clinic, where most of the doctors and nurses resent the fact that Merrick inadvertently caused Dr. Phillips's death.  Helen Phillips, Dr. Phillips's widow, receives a flood of calls, letters, and visitors all offering to pay back loans that Dr. Phillips refused to accept repayment of during his life. Many claimed he refused by saying \\"it was already used up.\\" Edward Randolph, a famous artist and Dr. Phillips's close friend, explains to Helen what that phrase means. This helps her to understand why her husband left little money, even though he had a very successful practice. Merrick discovers why everyone dislikes him. He runs from the clinic but collapses in front of Helen's car and ends up back at the hospital, where she learns his true identity. After his discharge, Merrick leaves a party, drunk. Merrick runs off the road and ends up at the home of Edward Randolph, who recognizes him. Randolph explains the secret belief that powered his own art and Dr. Phillips's success.  Merrick decides to try out this new philosophy. His first attempt causes Helen to step into the path of a car while trying to run away from Merrick's advances. She is left blind as a result of this accident. Merrick soberly commits to becoming a doctor, trying to fulfill Dr. Phillips's legacy.

Q:Title: Treo Sync Cable Product review: I had problems with my PC recognizing my Treo with the cable. After spending considerable time in configuration I finally got it to work. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"In assessing the given product review, it appears that the overall depiction of the Treo Sync Cable falls into a more unflattering light. While it is important to acknowledge that the reviewer eventually succeeded in configuring the cable for it to work with their PC, the negative experience and the considerable time spent to achieve that result implies dissatisfaction with the product. Initially, the user experienced issues with their PC recognizing the Treo device when using the cable. This implies that the product does not offer a seamless and smooth integration experience for at least some users, which could be a potential concern for potential buyers who value ease of use and compatibility. One of the significant factors driving the perception of a product in the market is how effectively it solves a problem while minimizing associated negative factors like inconvenience or incompatibility. Furthermore, the reviewer had to spend a considerable amount of time in configuration. This suggests that the setup process for using the Treo Sync Cable might not be particularly user-friendly or intuitive. Depending on the user's technical background and comfort level with technology, an extended setup time could project an impression of the product being less efficient and burdensome to use. This aspect of the review is also unfavorable and can negatively influence potential buyers who are looking for quick and hassle-free solutions. As the assessment is based on a single review, it may not fully represent all users' experiences with the product. However, in this particular case, the review offers a perspective that is more focused on the challenges faced in using the Treo Sync Cable. Even though the user reported success in their endeavors, the negative aspects and struggles experienced in getting to that point cast a more unflattering light on the product, which, in turn, may dissuade others from considering it as a viable option for their needs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose your answer from:  a). Slice banana with a strainer in 1/4 inch slices.;  b). Slice banana with a knife in 1/4 inch slices.;","output":"b). Slice banana with a knife in 1/4 inch slices. In terms of naive physics reasoning, slicing a banana with a knife in 1/4 inch slices is more sound. A knife is the ideal tool for cutting fruits, including bananas, due to its sharp edge and precision.  Here's a step-by-step guide for slicing bananas for crepes: 1. Choose a ripe banana: When selecting a banana for slicing, pick one that is ripe and free from bruises. A ripe banana will be easier to cut and taste sweeter in the crepe. 2. Prepare the knife: Choose a sharp knife, preferably a small paring or utility knife. A serrated knife may also work if you don't have a sharp-edged knife. Make sure to clean and sanitize the knife before use. 3. Peel the banana: Peel the banana by holding the stem and gently pulling down on the skin. Be sure to remove all the skin, including any small fibers that may be left behind. 4. Cut off the ends: Start by cutting off both ends of the banana. This will create flat surfaces at the top and bottom, allowing for more even slicing. 5. Position the banana: Lay the banana flat on a cutting board to make slicing easier. For added stability, you can also slice the banana in half lengthwise and then place the flat side down on the cutting board. 6. Slice the banana: Hold the knife at a right angle above the banana and gently slice through the fruit in a smooth, downward motion. Maintain control and consistency by using the same amount of pressure for each slice. Aim for slices that are approximately 1/4 inch in thickness. Thin slices will cook quickly and evenly, providing a delicate texture for the crepes. 7. Arrange the slices: After slicing the banana, arrange the slices on a plate or tray. This will make it easier to place them onto the crepes while cooking. Keep in mind that using a strainer (option a) would not be an ideal method for slicing bananas, as strainers are designed for separating liquids from solids, not cutting foods into precise slices. A knife is the more suitable and practical tool for this specific task, resulting in uniform and neat banana slices perfect for crepes."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  Paragraph: Two students read about reproduction for biology class. Vic read more about reptile reproduction, while Fox read more about fish reproduction.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student didn't learn that fish lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body? Answer:","output":"Vic is the student who didn't learn that fish lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body, as they read more about reptile reproduction. Fox was the one who focused on fish reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In the given information about the Asian Institute at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, no mention is made about the cleanliness or condition of the school. The information provided mainly focuses on who and what the institute is; detailing aspects such as its location (Devonshire House), its connection to the university's Trinity College, and the director's identity (Ritu Birla). The text primarily serves to provide an informative context about the Asian Institute. As such, a statement regarding the hygiene or upkeep of the school, like \\"The school is very dirty,\\" does not logically follow or is not consistent with the preceding text.

This can also be useful if you left any big items, like electronics, at your ex's place. If you had an extremely messy breakup, a trusted friend can even agree to retrieve items for you.  Make sure you pick the right friend to help. A friend who's prone to drama may be tempted to start a fight with your ex. Instead, opt for a friend who's generally cool and composed, even in stressful situations. If your ex is giving you a really hard time about retrieving your stuff, contact a friend or family member of your ex that you are on good terms with. They may be willing to help you. If your ex is present when you're over, it's best to minimize conversation. If you want to be pleasant, stick to small talk and simple questions rather than bringing up any major issues.  For example, ask, \\"How's work?\\" or make a comment on the weather. Avoid open questions and topics that could yield negative answers. Asking \\"How have you been?\\", for example, may lead your ex to talk about their difficulty with the breakup. They also may pretend to be fine to hurt your feelings. It can be hard to let go, and you may be tempted to linger at your ex's place and make a lengthy goodbye. Focus on the fact you're there to get your stuff and not address any lingering issues with your ex. As soon as you get through the door, start gathering your things and leave as soon as you finish. If you want to say a goodbye before you go, keep it brief. Now is not the time to drag up lingering resentments or talk over the relationship. Say something like, \\"I'm going to take off now. I hope you're doing okay.\\" If the two of you lived together, or if you simply left a lot at their place, you may have to make more trips. Grab the absolute essentials, like clothing, on the first trip. Then, before leaving, talk over when you can come back to get the rest of your stuff. You want to keep things as uncomplicated as possible, and physical contact after a breakup can get confusing. Avoid things like a prolonged hug hello or goodbye. If your ex offers a hug or another form of contact, keep it as brief as possible. Summary:","output":"1. If you don't want to go alone, ask a cool and composed friend to help you retrieve your items from your ex's place. 2.

Wealthy Victor Hazell owns a vast estate, and drives his expensive car proudly around it to survey his domain. He drives past several signs that show he has acquired much of his property recently, by buying out surrounding smallholdings. There are hundreds of prime pheasants wandering around his property, and as he drives along his two gamekeepers, Rabbetts and Springer, wish him a good morning. However, he does not acknowledge their presence, throws his cigar out the window and drives on proudly, much to their disgust.Hazell's good mood is ruined when he stops on a hillside and spots, in the distance, the garage and filling station owned by William Smith and his nine-year-old son, Danny. Hazell gets out of his car and peers at the structure through a set of field glasses, watching Danny fill the tank of a customer's car. In high bad humor, he returns to his own car and proceeds down the hill towards the filling station.In the garage, William and Danny have just finished repairing a car another customer left behind. Danny asks permission to drive it out of the garage, and William lets him do so. Hazell's car comes barreling down the hill at the same time as Danny is backing the car out of the garage, and both he and Hazell are forced to slam brakes to avoid a collision. William praises Danny for his quick thinking and Hazell, putting on a friendly tone, does the same. He then asks William if he'd be willing to sell his land - the Smiths own six acres of field and the garage, filling station, and an old caravan which serves as their home - but William tells him he already explained to the solicitor from Hazell's estate he was not interested.Hazell explains to William that his land is smack in the middle of the rest of his estate, and is preventing him from achieving his goal of having one of the biggest and best pheasant shoots in that part of England.

Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. To say that a given statement (e.g., the statement of a law of some scientific theory) -- [call it \\"T\\"] -- is \\"falsifiable\\" does not mean that \\"T\\" is false. Rather, it means that, if \\"T\\" is false, then (in principle), \\"T\\" could be shown to be false, by observation or by experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable. This led him to attack the claims of both psychoanalysis and contemporary Marxism to scientific status, on the basis that their theories are not falsifiable.

Andrew Fryberg, 15, is in critical condition, and Nate Hatch, 14, in serious condition at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, according to hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg. \\"All three of them are cousins, and they live right close to each other,\\" Don Hatch, Nate's grandfather, told CNN affiliate KOMO. The boys were close friends, nearly inseparable, Hatch said. They even went to a school dance together recently, where Fryberg was named the freshman class homecoming prince. \\"Only God knows what escalated this. Only God knows,\\" Hatch said, according to KOMO. \\"Nobody pushed a button with bullying. It's just something that happened, and we don't know why.\\" Hatch said he forgives Fryberg and plans on visiting his family. \\"I'll say, 'I feel for you and I'll pray for you,' \\" he said. The girls were identified as Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Gia Soriano, both 14, according to Dr. Joanne Roberts, Providence Regional Medical Center Everett's chief medical officer. They were in critical condition with head injuries. At a news conference Saturday, Roberts read a brief statement from Soriano's family: \\"Our family is in shock. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers during this tragedy. Our hearts go out to the other victims and their families.\\" Investigators in Marysville have not provided details, but students offered up accounts that painted a terrifying, chaotic picture. Fellow student Jordan Luton was finishing his lunch in the cafeteria when he heard a loud bang. He saw Fryberg go up to a table of students, \\"came up from behind ... and fired about six bullets into the backs of them,\\" Luton told CNN. \\"They were his friends, so it wasn't just random.\\" According to a law enforcement source, witnesses said Fryberg pulled the gun out of a black backpack before he began firing. Witnesses described the look on his face as calm, said the source. It was hard for Luton to make sense of the shooting. \\"I have no idea what his motive was because yesterday at football practice, he was all fine, talking ... having a good time,\\" he said. \\"And then today, just horrible. I don't know what went through his head or what caused him to do it.\\" By all accounts, Fryberg was a popular student. Just a week ago, he had been named the high school's freshman homecoming prince, according to a YouTube video of the ceremony and accounts provided by students to CNN. \\"It's weird to think about, because you see him and he is such a happy person,\\" sophomore Alex Pietsch said. \\"You never really see him be so angry and so upset. ... People were telling me who it was when I was getting in my mom's car and I was like, 'What? This is not happening. ... This is crazy.' It was just surprising to me that him out of all people would be the one.\\" CNN's Chelsea J.

A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \\"Bright Eyes\\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell. This explains that their assumption was in error: Bright Eyes was not acting violently because of the drug, but to protect her child.

Welsh international Ricketts, who spent three seasons with Hull, does not believe it is the right job for Wales' manager. \\"I can't see Hull being a big enough pull for Chris Coleman,\\" Ricketts said. \\"I don't think Hull is the right job for Chris Coleman and I don't think it's a big enough job for him to leave what he's built at Wales. \\"But if a job come along which he feels can't necessarily turn down or thinks is too good an opportunity to turn down then I think that might be the only way for him to leave. \\"I do believe that if Chris Coleman really wanted to become manager of Hull City I think he could force it.\\" Coleman is one of the candidates Hull have targeted to replace Steve Bruce, who resigned in July after a breakdown in his relationship with Hull vice-chairman Ehab Allam. Hull's owners put plans to sell the club on hold after Bruce's departure to \\"ensure stability in the transfer window\\", with the senior squad reduced to only 13 fit players. Fans are planning a protest against the \\"ill-considered ideas\\" of the newly-promoted club's owners on the first day of the Premier League season. Ex-West Ham and Watford boss Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Martinez, sacked by Everton in May, and former Unites States coach Bob Bradley have also been linked with the vacancy. Former Fulham and Coventry boss Coleman guided Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals a month after signing a new two-year contract with the FAW. He has already said the 2018 World Cup campaign, which begins with the qualifier Moldova at Cardiff City Stadium on 5 September, will be his last in charge of Wales. FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford said earlier in July that he was hopeful Coleman would honour his two-year contract extension. But Ford acknowledged it would be difficult to keep Coleman if he decided he wanted to manage a club side before then. Coventry City defender Ricketts is not surprised Coleman, whom he played under during a Wales career in which he won 52 caps, is in demand after Wales' exploits at Euro 2016. \\"Any club that sacks their manager or is looking for a new one will consider Chris Coleman,\\" Ricketts told BBC Radio Wales Sport. \\"What Wales did in the summer has brought Chris Coleman as a manager to the forefront. \\"I wouldn't imagine this to be the last approach the Welsh FA get for their manager.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has rejected an approach by Hull City to speak to the national team's manager, Chris Coleman.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  John was pondering about what makes a chemical reaction faster or slower. To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top.

Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable.

News article: Blue jeans celebrate 140 years By Daphne Sashin and Toby Lyles, CNN updated 2:22 PM EDT, Mon May 20, 2013 Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Editor's note: This story was first published in May 2013. (CNN) -- Jim Heston, an American guesthouse operator in Cambodia, has lived a life in denim and has the photos to prove it. There were the dungarees he wore as a little boy, the dark bell-bottoms he had on for a hike up Japan's Mount Fuji, and the Levis straight-leg 501 jeans he's stayed with for the past 36 years. At 54, Heston doesn't get embarrassed anymore, \\"but if I had to share any of these blue jean moments a few years back, I would have been a little more reluctant,\\" he says. In particular, there was the snapshot of him on a Hawaii beach in a Daishiki and jeans his mother extended with red fabric because he was growing faster than his pants were wearing out. May 20, 1873, is considered the birthday of blue jeans. Readers shared their favorite and most cringe-inducing moments in denim (hello, acid wash) to mark the occasion. \\"They're the most unique piece of clothing everyone owns because they keep changing as you wear them,\\" said Angelika Corrente, who runs Denimhead, global trend forecaster WGSN's denim division. A few facts about denim: 1. Jacob Davis, a tailor in Reno, Nevada, came up with the idea of riveted pants in response to a customer whose pockets kept ripping. He feared someone might steal his idea and recruited Levi Strauss, owner of dry goods wholesaler Levi Strauss & Co., as a business partner. They obtained a patent on May 20, 1873. 2. Denim jeans -- or trousers, waist overalls or dungarees -- started out as work-wear for hard labor in mines, factories and fields. By the 1980s, as high fashion brands began to introduce the concept of designer jeans, the shape and fit began to slim down. Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life. 3. Consumers in the United States buy approximately 450 million pairs of jeans every year. 4. On average, U.S. consumers have seven pairs of jeans in their wardrobe, according to Cotton Incorporated. 5. Environmental awareness has pushed denim laundries to improve techniques for bleaching and coating jeans to give them different looks, Corrente said. Where lots of water, aggressive washing and sandpaper was once the norm for creating that worn vintage look, lasers and and ozone gas cameras are now being used to minimize water waste and chemical runoff. 6. This year's trends are marked by a hybrid appreciation for fads of other eras. You're as likely to see someone rocking the heavy raw denim popular among '60s bikers and rebellious youth, an '80s-inspired high-waisted, flower print, or the acid-washed, ripped-up grunge look of the '90s. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article include the celebration of blue jeans' 140th anniversary on May 20, 1873, and the continued importance of denim in the fashion industry. Some key takeaways from the article are: 1. The creation of blue jeans is attributed to Jacob Davis, a tailor, and Levi Strauss, owner of Levi Strauss & Co., who were granted a patent for riveted pants on May 20, 1873. The invention arose in response to a customer whose pockets kept ripping. 2. Blue jeans were initially created as durable work-wear for laborers in mines, factories, and fields. By the 1980s, high fashion brands began introducing designer jeans with a slimmer fit and more extravagant styling. 3. The United States sees around 450 million pairs of jeans purchased annually, with an average of seven pairs of jeans per consumer. 4. Recent environmental awareness initiatives have led to improved techniques for bleaching and coating jeans. Newer methods, such as using lasers and ozone gas cameras, aim to minimize water waste and chemical runoff. 5. Current fashion trends for denim allow diverse styles from different eras to coexist, including heavy raw denim from the '60s, 80s-inspired high-waisted and flower print jeans, and the acid-washed, distressed look of the '90s. This article highlights the ongoing popularity and versatility of blue jeans, tracing their evolution from workwear to fashion statements and acknowledging the industry's efforts to become more environmentally conscious."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off back-to-back losses in overtime, the Steelers looked to turn things around.  With the return of Ben Roethlisberger to action, the Steelers hosted the 3-8 Oakland Raiders. The Steelers would open with a 33-yard field goal by Jeff Reed.  Oakland responded with a 48-yarder by Sebastian Janikowski, and both teams were tied 3-3 as the 2nd quarter began.  Roethlisberger found Santonio Holmes for a 34-yard TD pass to begin the 2nd quarter.  Oakland would put 3 points on the board after a 43-yard field goal halfway through the quarter, and the Steelers headed to Halftime with a 10-6 lead. There followed a scoreless third quarter, and in the fourth Pittsburgh's defensive struggles were exploited by the Raiders, who were able to find the end zone three times. Bruce Gradkowski would find Chaz Schilens for a 17-yard TD pass with 8:21 remaining in the game, giving Oakland their first lead of the game, 13-10. Pittsburgh responded just one minute later with a 3-yard TD run by Rashard Mendenhall.  But Oakland would not be stopped.  Gradkowski hit Louis Murphy for a 75-yard TD pass with 5:28 remaining, and the Raiders went up 20-17. Roethlisberger would make an 11-yard TD pass to Hines Ward with 1:56 remaining and the Steelers would regain the lead 24-20.  All that was needed was for the Steelers' defense to keep Oakland out of the end zone and they would win. But with nine seconds remaining, Gradkowski would once again find Louis Murphy open in the end zone for an 11-yard TD pass and the Raiders would win 27-24. The game would mark the fifth time in six games that the Steelers suffered a 4th quarter collapse, and the second time in three weeks Pittsburgh had fallen to an opponent with a losing record. At the conclusion of the game, the Steelers had allowed seven plays of 40&#160;yards or longer in their last four games (they only gave up two such plays in 2008).

At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain.  Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction. As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the Copperfin has to negotiate its way through protective minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy follows in its wake. That night, a small party, including the ship's womanizer, \\"Wolf\\" (John Garfield), goes ashore to make weather observations. Meanwhile, Tommy is diagnosed with  appendicitis. \\"Pills\\", the pharmacist's mate, has to operate following instructions from a book, using improvised instruments, and without sufficient ether to last throughout the procedure.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic, each method is elaborated upon below: 1. Fishing in Freshwater: Freshwater fishing is a method of production that focuses on capturing fish living in freshwater environments, such as lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams. This method targets species that thrive in these environments, such as bass, trout, and catfish. When done commercially, it can involve using different fishing techniques, such as nets, longlines, and traps to catch a large number of fish at once. Recreational freshwater fishing often involves the use of rods and fishing lines. 2. Fishing at Sea: Marine fishing, or fishing at sea, is another method of production that involves catching fish species that are found in saltwater environments – predominantly oceans and seas. Marine fish species include tuna, mackerel, and cod, as well as shellfish species like shrimp and crab. Commercial marine fishing incorporates various techniques, including trawling, purse seining, and longlining, to catch large quantities of fish and other marine life. Recreational saltwater fishing involves using fishing rods, lines, and bait. 3. Aquaculture, or Aquatic Farming: A more controlled method of production is aquaculture or aquatic farming, in which fish, shellfish, or aquatic plants are raised in controlled environments, such as ponds, tanks, or enclosures. This method can be applied to both freshwater and saltwater species, making it a versatile solution to the growing demand for seafood. Aquaculture has several applications: supplying fish for the food industry, aquarium trade, replenishing wild fish stocks for conservation purposes, and providing fish for recreational fishing. Some of the most commonly farmed species include salmon, tilapia, and shrimp."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: This is not something researchers at museums see every day.      When curators at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art put the Vincent van Gogh 19th-century masterpiece Olive Trees under the microscope to better understand the Dutch painter’s artistic process, a little critter was found entombed within the thick oil paint.      The unusual discovery was unexpected but not that surprising. After all, Van Gogh is one of the world’s best known plein airs artists, and his famous landscapes were painted within the very fields and gardens that were his subject matter.      The microscopic insect cannot be seen with the naked eye, and so it remained unnoticed for over a century. It made for a particularly exciting find, as the museum’s team was hopeful that they could use it to determine the season in which the work was made. The museum contacted paleo-entomologist Dr. Michael S. Engel, senior curator and professor at the University of Kansas and associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, but unfortunately the grasshopper’s body could not confirm precise dating.      Engel did observe however that the thorax and abdomen of the grasshopper were missing and that there was no sign of its movement once it landed in the paint, which indicates that the insect was already dead when it ended up on the canvas.      Van Gogh had written to his brother about the trials and tribulations of painting outdoors: “I must have picked up a good hundred flies and more off the four canvases that you’ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand.” Add grasshoppers to the list of natural elements that Van Gogh had to work against.      Though Van Gogh’s resident grasshopper has captured the imaginations of museum goers, it is only a diminutive by-product of significant research that is underway at the institution, in particular the in-depth studies of color shifts that have taken place in the artist’s work. It has been determined that Van Gogh painted with a red pigment that has receded over time, a finding that alters what is currently known about the work and its color relationships within the painting, but also to other works of this theme.      Curators, conservators and scientists are adding this to research on 104 French paintings and pastels within the collection of the museum.

One hundred years ago, a troop of artists and admirers, led by the Group of Seven’s J.E.H. Macdonald, paddled to this very point to erect the memorial to their dead friend, the “artist, woodsman and guide,” Tom Thomson. He lived humbly but passionately with the wild. It made him brother to all untamed things of nature. It drew him apart and revealed itself wonderfully to him. It sent him out from the woods only to show these revelations through his art. And it took him to itself at last. — Excerpt from the inscription on the Tom Thomson Memorial Cairn on Canoe Lake      Writer Daniel Otis peers over the shoulder of a statue of Tom Thomson in Huntsville, Ont. ( Daniel Otis ) The view from Dwight, Ont.-based Langford Canoe's limited edition \\"dove-grey\\" Tom Thomson canoe. ( Daniel Otis ) Guide Vince Ouimet at the cairn that was erected in Tom Thomson's memory on Canoe Lake in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park. ( Daniel Otis )      It was here in Algonquin Provincial Park where Thomson found himself as an artist, setting out with his cedarstrip canoe and paint kit to collect inspiration for masterpieces such as “The Jack Pine” on protracted backcountry sketching trips he began taking in 1912. And it was here, at Hayhurst Point, where Thomson most loved to pitch his canvas tent, with the wind keeping off the bugs and the cool, murky water shimmering below; then, at night, the lights of the now-abandoned town of Mowat sparkling across the lake; a beer and warm bed and body only a short paddle away. And it was here, too, on Canoe Lake where Thomson’s bloated corpse was found on July 17, 1917. He had set out on a solo fishing trip eight days prior on July 8 — 100 years ago today. He was only 39.      Article Continued Below      “Thomson did something that was the crux of what became the Group of Seven,” Garry Lantaigne tells me. “He discovered what to paint, what Canada was really about, which was the rocks and the trees and the water. No one had ever painted that before; no one showed you the rugged side of Canada.”      Artist Garry Lantaigne has painted numerous murals depicting Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven's works in Ontario's Muskoka Region.      Like Thomson, Lantaigne was a Toronto-based artist who was drawn to the sprawling woodland and twisting lakes of Algonquin. Twelve years ago, Lantaigne made the move to the quiet cottage country town of Huntsville, where he’s spearheaded the Group of Seven Outdoor Gallery, a project that’s seen nearly a hundred murals of Thomson and the Group of Seven’s work painted on buildings across the region. “Look at the colour of the lake,” Lantaigne excitedly implores as we stand under an enlarged depiction of Thomson’s “Autumn Foliage” in Huntsville. In the painting, a cluster of autumnal trees obscures a vibrant lake and rolling hills are washed in fall gold. “It’s purple! Who sees purple in a lake?” Lantaigne says. “Thomson did. And he used that purple, which pushes and pulls all the yellows and oranges, and it sets depth, it sets up space — and it blows me away.” Thomson’s lack of formal training was his grace as an artist, Lantaigne says, and it manifested itself in a euphoric style that his peers quickly emulated.      “You’re not supposed to use colours out of the tube when you paint, but Thomson had no problem with that,” Lantaigne explains. “He’s painting blue trees, red rocks, green rocks . . . and when he brought these paintings back and showed his friends, not one of them ever painted the same again.” It’s a short drive to Canoe Lake where Vince Ouimet of the Portage Store takes me on a guided tour of the artist’s haunts aboard an ash-trimmed canoe with rawhide seats that’s been painted ‘dove-grey.’      Vince Ouimet of The Portage Store steers a canoe on a guided Tom Thomson-themed tour of Canoe Lake in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park.      Article Continued Below      “Just like Tom Thomson’s,” Ouimet says. “Marine grey with a tube of cobalt blue.” On the water, Ouimet points out Little Wapomeo Island, near which Thomson’s decaying body was discovered bleeding from its right ear, copper fishing wire wrapped tightly around one ankle. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. Thomson was no stranger to the bottle, and a coroner figured he slipped and bashed his head during a portage. But since then, stories have swirled about murder and mystery, with fingers being pointed at a local woman believed to be the philanderer’s fiancée, as well as at a cantankerous German-American draft dodger who then lived on Canoe Lake. As for the line around his ankle, Thomson could have just been jigging for trout. “And some people, since then, think that maybe he was dragged to the bottom of the lake,” Ouimet says. We later paddle to the cairn (the garish totem was carved years later by a Toronto furniture baron), but first we visit the site of what was once Mowat: a mill town that had a population of just a few dozen souls in Thomson’s time. Today, all that remains are a few cottages along the lake and a ragged young forest where you can still find rusted cans and bedframes amongst crumbling stone foundations.      The cairn, erected in Tom Thomson's memory, on Canoe Lake in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park.      Thomson worked as a ranger and guide before he found the money to dedicate himself to his art. Between sojourns in the bush, he would stay at Mowat Lodge, which burned down not long after his death. Every member of the Group of Seven met Thomson up here for trips into the backcountry. In the winter months, holed up in his Toronto studio, Thomson would then turn his eight-by-10-inch wilderness sketches into the grand masterpieces that grace our galleries today. “Hewas in the woods without DEET, and he’s painting with black flies — there’d be black flies in the paint!” Ouimet says. “So, it speaks to who we think the painter is: he’s just this tough woodsman first.” Ouimet leads me along a narrow, overgrown trail. Fresh bear prints are pressed into the wet mud ahead of us. With the mosquitoes and black flies coming at me, I wish I had something like Thomson’s corncob pipe to keep them away. The trail leads up to a small, fenced clearing where an ancient white birch hangs over a headstone and a nearby cross. Thomson painted and took photos under this very tree, Ouimet says. The headstone, dated 1897, reads, “Remembers Comrades —(When Passing by) As you are now, So once was I. As I am now So you shall be. Prepare Thyself to follow me.”      Guide Vince Ouimet holds up a reproduction of Tom Thomson's 1914 work \\"Canoe Lake, Mowat Lodge\\" from the site where it was likely painted in Algonquin Provincial Park.      “We’re now looking at Mowat Lodge,” Ouimet says, holding up a reproduction of a 1914 painting, and pointing into the tangle of forest that covers what used to be the town. “You’d have the most beautiful view of the lake from right here.” The cross is supposed to mark Thomson’s grave, Ouimet adds, but the real spot is a little further, 20 paces north of the fence. I trample through the underbrush, taking exactly 20 steps, and find myself in a smaller clearing where a heaping pile of bear excrement steams glisteningly fresh. Ouimet is close behind me. “Yeah, he’s around,” Ouimet says, eyeing the turd. “That’s a healthy bear.” Here, Thomson was hastily buried after his body was discovered, only to be exhumed two days later and moved to a family plot near Owen Sound, where the artist grew up. But doubts were raised about whether or not Thomson’s body was actually moved and, in 1956, a group of macabrely curious friends brought shovels to the site and discovered a skeleton with a hole in the left temple of its skull. It is still unclear, though, if the skull was Thomson’s. “Everybody around here believes Tom Thomson is buried here,” Ouimet says. “If you go to Owen Sound, he’s buried there.” But the myth and mystery surrounding Thomson’s death shouldn’t eclipse his true legacy, Ouimet says: a sublime body of work that has influenced Canadian artists for more than a century.      Guide Vince Ouimet stands near a cross that is supposed to mark Tom Thomson's grave near the now-abandoned mill town of Mowat in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Researchers from Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art discovered a grasshopper embedded in one of Vincent van Gogh's 19th-century masterpieces, Olive Trees.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There are many kinds of reunion shows. One kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they haven't played for twenty or thirty years. These have mixed results. \`Return to Mayberry', despite some silliness, was okay; \`Return to Green Acres' as execrable (Eddie Albert used a word for the script I won't repeat here, but both it and the movie stink); \`Rescue from Gilligan's Island' filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways, though the show itself was silly even from a \`Gilligan's Island' viewpoint. In most cases, the scripts are weak; sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it's nearly always fatal for the characters to know they're being funny. New characters are introduced who don't fit the mix. In the main, these reunion shows are pretty weak. A second sort of \`reunion' show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around, telling stories, reminiscing, interspersed with flashbacks from the shows. Then there are movies based on the shows, which are rarely good; and movies based on the history of the show (\`The Brady Bunch' has had both of these happen to it, with various results). \`Return to the Batcave' uses nearly all the above, with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint, which makes it the best of the reunion shows, and has raised the bar for the others. Adam West and Burt Ward and summoned to a showing of the original Batmobile. While they are there, the car is stolen.  The Adam West of the movie is a man demented. He called Jerry, his butler, \`Alfred'. He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage. He's obsessed with being a crime fighter, when in fact he's merely a washed up actor. When the Batmobile is stolen he not only believes it's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it, he drags and unwilling Burt Ward in as his assistant. The pursuit is largely loquacious, with West and Ward reminiscing about the old days. It is broken by \`flashbacks' with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. The modern scenes and the \`flashbacks' both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained. There are also running gags that show West is able to make fun of himself: in Ward's book about his time on the show, he spoke frankly about West's libido and also his being a skinflint (West makes Ward pay for everything in their pursuit, down to tips and bus fare). The clues they follow, the characters they meet (even in flashback) all fit the mentality of the old series, and there are several homages, including a fist fight with written sound effects. The whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache. There are also cameos by Julie Newmar (looking like she's had one facelift too many) and Frank Gorshin, reminding us why he has such a cult following. Gorshin will be the Riddler when Jim Carey, his obvious successor, is long forgotten. The movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax. This show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately, there are few that can fit the pattern. This show had actors replaying their old characters; young actors playing a movie about the making of the show; the actors West and Ward reminiscing; and a modern-day movie with the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West.

FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of Archaeology issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II.

Answer this question: where does 12 years a slave take place??","output":"\\"12 Years a Slave\\" is a 2013 historical drama film based on the 1853 autobiography of the same name by Solomon Northup, a free African American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. The movie, directed by Steve McQueen, focuses on Northup's heart-wrenching experiences, as he spends twelve long years as a slave before regaining his freedom. The narrative of \\"12 Years a Slave\\" takes place in multiple locations across the United States. The events span a period from 1841 to 1853 and are set in several key locations: 1. Saratoga Springs, New York: The movie begins in Saratoga Springs, where Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) resides with his wife and children as a free man and a skilled violinist. He is lured to Washington, D.C., under the pretense of a job opportunity. 2. Washington, D.C: Upon arriving in Washington, D.C., Solomon is kidnapped and sold into slavery. This city, which still allowed slavery despite being in a free state, represents the turning point in his life. 3. Louisiana: After being sold to a slave trader, Solomon is taken to New Orleans and then transported to various plantations in Louisiana. Much of the film's narrative focuses on his time at these plantations, which include those owned by the cruel Edwin Epps (played by Michael Fassbender) and the more humane William Ford (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). The plantations depicted in \\"12 Years a Slave\\" poignantly illustrate the harsh and brutal reality of life for slaves in the southern United States during the early 19th century. Racial injustice is palpable, as Solomon and other slaves endure the dehumanizing conditions under which they are forced to live and work. In sum, \\"12 Years a Slave\\" takes place primarily in the United States' northeastern region and the Deep South, set against the backdrop of Saratoga Springs, Washington D.C., and various plantations in Louisiana. The film exposes the harrowing circumstances of life as a captive in a world that denied some people, like Solomon Northup, their most essential rights and dignity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle, the twelfth of thirteen children of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville at the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the \\"Wars of the Roses\\", a period of \\"three or four decades of political instability and periodic open civil war in the second half of the fifteenth century\\", between supporters of Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth)--\\"Yorkists\\"--in opposition to the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and those loyal to the crown (\\"Lancastrians\\"). When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. Richard's Council of the North, described as his \\"one major institutional innovation\\", derived from his ducal council following his own viceregal appointment by Edward IV; when Richard himself became king, he maintained the same conciliar structure in his absence. It officially became part of the royal council machinery under the presidency of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in April 1484, based at Sandal Castle in Wakefield. It is considered to have greatly improved conditions for northern England, as it was, in theory at least, intended to keep the peace and punish law breakers, as well as resolving land disputes. Bringing regional governance directly under the control of central government, it has been described as the king's \\"most enduring monument\\", surviving unchanged until 1641.  In December 1483, Richard instituted what later became known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal representation could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.  Richard's death at Bosworth resulted in the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England since the succession of Henry II in 1154. The last legitimate male Plantagenet, Richard's nephew, Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of Richard III's brother Clarence), was executed by Henry VII in 1499. The only extant direct male line of Plantagenets is the House of Beaufort, headed today by Henry Somerset, 12th Duke of Beaufort. But the Beaufort line was barred from the succession by Henry IV. Were there any other notable figures that worked with Richard III on the Court of Requests?","output":"Alright child, let me tell you a story. A long time ago, there was a man named Richard III who lived in England. He was born on October 2, 1452, in a castle. Richard was a part of a big family, and his dad was an important man who wanted to be king. There were two groups of people, called Yorkists and Lancastrians, who were fighting for the throne. When Richard was very young, his dad and older brother Edmund sadly died in a battle. Later, another brother of Richard became King Edward IV.  Richard wanted to make things better in his country, so he created a special group called the Council of the North to help with problems and make sure people followed the laws. He also made a place called the Court of Requests, where people could go when they had problems and needed help. This was especially helpful for people who didn't have much money. Richard made many other good changes, too. He made sure that buying and selling land was fair, he helped protect people who were accused of crimes, and he made sure that written laws were in English, so more people could understand them. But, one sad day, Richard died in a battle, and it marked the end of a very old family that had ruled England for a very long time. Now, you asked if there were other important people who worked with Richard on the Court of Requests, right? Unfortunately, we don't know their names, but we do know that they worked together to help those in need. Remember, the Court of Requests was a place where people, even ones with not much money, could go for help with their problems. This was a very important job, and Richard and those who worked with him made a big difference in their country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You may need to fix other problems and issues first in order to treat your insomnia. For example:  If anxiety or depression are keeping you awake at night, find what is making you feel anxious or depressed and try to manage that. This might involve speaking with your doctor and taking medication for anxiety or depression. Your roommate might like to read or work late into the night, and the light he or she uses is keeping you awake. If your roommate is unable or refuses to work in another room, purchase a sleeping mask instead. Try to perform the same activities every night before your bedtime. This means going to bed at the same time every evening and waking up at the same time every morning. You can also incorporate some relaxing activities into your bedtime routine, such as reading or listening to soft music. In this way, your mind will start associating such activities with bedtime and sleep. This means that the temperature is to your liking, and that the lighting is dark enough for you to fall asleep.  If your room is too warm, try to cool it down by opening a window, using fewer blankets, or turning a fan or air conditioning. If your room is too cold, try to wear warmer clothing to sleep or using more blankets. If you live in an area that is very bright at night, even if you turn off the lights, invest in a sleeping mask that covers your eyes. Use your bedroom only for sleeping and rest. This might involve removing distractions, such as computers and televisions, to ensure that you do not use them instead of sleeping.

The play is organized by camp directors Gary and Becky Granger, who are overly enthusiastic about the holiday.  Wednesday, along with her brother Pugsley and newfound friend Joel, do not fit in with the camp's environment and are singled out for their unique dressing style and behavior. When Wednesday refuses to participate in the Thanksgiving play, they are punished by being forced to watch upbeat Disney and family films. However, afterwards, Wednesday pretends to be cheerful and agrees to be part of the play, but only to plot a revolt against Camp Chippewa. During the performance, she stages a coup d'etat with the help of Pugsley and Joel, capturing other campers like Amanda, as well as Gary and Becky, setting the camp on fire and causing chaos. As they escape, Wednesday and Joel share a kiss, signifying a blossoming romance between the two. Throughout the movie, Wednesday's suspicions about Debbie, the nanny who seeks to marry and murder Uncle Fester for his wealth, prove to be true. Her instincts help save her family from Debbie's manipulations and, eventually, reunite them in the end. To conclude, Wednesday Addams plays a significant role in \\"Addams Family Values.\\" Her casting as Pocahontas in the Thanksgiving play serves as a catalyst for the movie's major turning point, which sees her leading a rebellion and standing up against the enforced conformity at Camp Chippewa.

When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team lead a less safer experiment?  Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. A:","output":"Team A led a less safe experiment because they heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, which could result in the can exploding due to increased pressure inside."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Orci was born in Mexico City on July 20, 1973, to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother. His mother immigrated to the United States with her parents after Fidel Castro came to power. Orci grew up in Mexico, and moved with his family to the United States at the age of 10. He was raised in Texas, Los Angeles and Canada. Context: Orci's first credit solely as a producer came with the film Eagle Eye, where he worked once again alongside Kurtzman. He said in an interview with the magazine Extra that he had previously been involved in productions where the producers had writing backgrounds and had looked to them for help, and he was happy to provide that same support to the writers on Eagle Eye. The director of the film, D. J. Caruso, praised the duo saying that \\"What's unusually cool about them is that they have maintained the producer-writer power that they earned in television and carried that over into the feature film area, and that is extremely rare.\\" Following their work on Eagle Eye, they were executive producers on the Sandra Bullock film, The Proposal.  Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman continued to create television series. These included Sleepy Hollow, which they developed alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series to a number of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it was an easy decision, and he needed to pretend to consider it.  Orci and Kurtzman also worked together as executive producers on the animated television series, Transformers: Prime, due to their involvement with the live action movies. Following the end of the series they were hopeful to be involved in a future animated series based on the premise, which Orci saw less like a reboot of the show and more of a continuation in a different guise. He felt that while Prime was sophisticated, there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its complexity and intensity. Question: what did the producer-power do. Whats the answer?","output":"So, the producer-power, which is Orci and Kurtzman, is a team that makes movies and television shows. They help create stories, find the right people to work on them, and make sure everything goes smoothly so the movie or show turns out great. They are really good at doing this, and people like working with them because they started as writers themselves and they can give useful advice and support.

What is the answer?","output":"The Samoyed breed of dog originated in Siberia, specifically in northwestern Russia. The Samoyed, named after the indigenous Samoyedic peoples who lived in the region, was initially bred for various purposes, including herding, hunting, and sled-pulling in the harsh Siberian climate. The Samoyed people belonged to the larger Uralic group, residing in areas around the Ob River, Karelia, and the Yenisei River. They mostly lived a nomadic lifestyle, relying on reindeer for their survival and moving seasonally to various locations. The Samoyed served as invaluable companions in these challenging conditions, mainly due to their strong work ethic, impressive endurance, and adaptable nature. Additionally, the Samoyed had a remarkable rapport with their human families, resulting in a unique bond. These dogs were not only instrumental in day-to-day tasks but also provided warmth on cold nights by sleeping close to their human companions, becoming living blankets. The Samoyed breed is instantly recognizable by their dense, double-layered white coat, which serves as effective insulation against the extreme cold. They also have a trademark \\"Samoyed smile,\\" characterized by upturned corners of their mouths, and a distinctive foxy expression thanks to their wedge-shaped head, almond-shaped eyes, and erect, triangular ears. The breed's outgoing, friendly temperament and strong working instincts have continued to make the Samoyed a popular choice among dog owners worldwide. The first Samoyeds came to Europe in the late 19th century, attracting the attention of dog enthusiasts and quickly gaining popularity, which further expanded to the United States soon after. In modern times, the Samoyed can be seen participating in dog shows, excelling in various dog sports, and undertaking a variety of roles, from therapy dogs to family pets. Affectionate, intelligent, and social, this Siberian breed has maintained its enduring appeal for centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - People dig up coal from the ground - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area - The polluted rain becomes acid rain.  Question: suppose the government regulates coal emissions happens, how will it affect more acid rain forms.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the government regulates coal emissions effectively, it will likely result in less acid rain formation. The supposed perturbation, which is the regulation of coal emissions in this case, will mainly influence the release of pollution from the coal burning process. When coal emissions are regulated, it means that there will be controls and limitations in place to reduce the amount and type of pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. These controls may include stricter laws, cleaner technologies, and better management practices. As a result of these measures, there will be a reduction in the amount of pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, being released into the air. Since sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the key contributors to acid rain formation, a reduction in their emissions will consequently lead to a reduced likelihood of acid rain formation. As the pollution that enters the clouds becomes less acidic, the rain that falls over an area will also be less acidic. In summary, an effective government regulation of coal emissions will have a positive impact by reducing the chances of acid rain formation. This perturbation will influence the second effect mentioned – acid rain – by causing it to occur less frequently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 1: Identify the main components of the premise and the hypothesis. - Premise: high-performing organizations, employees at all levels, participate, improving operational and program performance, achieve results, have a stake. - Hypothesis: high-performing organizations, employees at all levels, participate, improving operational and program performance, achieve results. Step 2: Compare the components of the premise and the hypothesis. - The components of the hypothesis are all included in the premise, except for one phrase \\"have a stake.\\" Step 3: Analyze the importance of the missing component. - The phrase \\"have a stake in\\" from the premise highlights that employees are not just participating in the process, but they also have a vested interest in the outcomes.

It is important to acknowledge that there are wide variations among individuals in both populations, and these generalizations cannot apply to everyone. 1. Israeli people: Israel is a diverse country that has welcomed Jews from all over the world. Therefore, Israeli facial features might vary depending on the individual's ancestry. However, some common traits may include: - Olive to fair skin tone - Dark brown or green eyes - Curly or wavy hair, ranging from light to dark brown or black - A prominent or straight nose 2. Arab people: Arabs represent a large population spread across the Middle East and North Africa. They, too, exhibit a wide range of facial features due to differences in genetics and geography. Some shared characteristics might be: - Olive to darker skin tone - Brown or dark brown eyes - Straight or wavy hair, typically dark brown or black - A curved or straight nose, sometimes with a prominent bridge To answer your second question: No, the questions are not the same, as they are inquiring about the common facial features of two different groups of people.

Summarize this article: The 37-year-old closed with a bogey-free three-under-par 67 to hold off Australia's world number one Jason Day (67) and win on 14 under. American Daniel Summerhays (66) was third on 10 under, while Open champion Henrik Stenson faded with a 71 to finish joint seventh on eight under. \\"It is surreal, an incredible finish,\\" said Walker, ranked 48th in the world. England's Tyrrell Hatton (68) and Paul Casey (67) ended on seven under. For the first time since 2011, all four of the year's majors have been claimed by first-time winners. England's Danny Willett won the Masters in April, American Dustin Johnson took the US Open in June, while Swede Stenson won the Open two weeks ago. He opened his week with a five-under 65 to lead the tournament and followed it with a 66 to hold the halfway lead on nine under with American Robert Streb. Walker did not play on Saturday, when the threat of storms forced play to be abandoned, but returned with 49 others on Sunday morning for round three. He carded a 68 to take a one-shot lead over defending champion Day, who had shot a 67, into the afternoon's final round. Walker holed half-a-dozen putts of between three and five feet as he opened with nine straight pars to reach the turn on 11 under. He then pitched in from a bunker on the 10th for a birdie and followed that with a 30-foot putt on the next to get to 13 under. A run of five pars was ended by a third birdie on the par-five 17th, but it turned out to be a more nervy finish than Walker would have hoped for. With a three-shot lead on the last, he opted for the safety of an iron off the tee. But then Day rolled in a 14-foot eagle putt to close the deficit to one and Walker then hit his second shot into greenside rough. He chipped his third to 35 feet and had two putts for the win, eventually holing from three feet to seal the title. \\"I made it a little more difficult than I would have liked but I did it,\\" said Walker. Defending champion Day and Stenson, who had earlier posted a third successive 67 in round three to reach nine under, were both within one shot of Walker during the final round but neither were able to catch the American. Two bogeys in his opening three holes meant Day dropped back to eight under but he holed three birdies in seven holes from the fifth to get to 11 under. Although he finished with an eagle, the six pars that preceded it proved costly. \\"The eagle was nice,\\" said Day. \\"I had to step up and do something and I hit two good shots with my two-iron. \\"I wanted to give Jimmy something to think about but it wasn't quite enough.\\" Stenson looked the more likely to challenge after a birdie on the sixth got him to 10 under, but, like many, he struggled with the pace of rain-soaked greens. He then sent his approach to the 15th over the back of the green and looked a beaten man after fluffing a chip and carding a double-bogey six. He finished tied with Martin Kaymer as the top European after the German eagled the par-five 18th to close with a four-under-par 66 and eight under total. England's Justin Rose (68) and Scotland's Russell Knox (69) both finished on four under for the championship. Ross Fisher's 69 moved him up to two under, alongside Welshman Jamie Donaldson (70) and one ahead of fellow Englishmen Matthew Fitzpatrick (67) and Andy Sullivan (69). Andrew Johnston delighted his new-found fans with a birdie on the last to finish with a one-over 71 to finish one over par. Masters champion Danny Willett closed with a level-par 70 to finish five over, as did Wales' Bradley Dredge, while England's Lee Westwood finished with a double-bogey seven on the last in a round of 75  to finish seven over.

My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister. I think the experience made us both content to elope. Question: After the end of the story the partner is feeling how about having mother involved in planning her wedding? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"After the end of the story, the partner is likely feeling hesitant and apprehensive about having her partner's mother involved in planning her wedding. The experience at her partner's sister's wedding, where the mother seemed to take over the planning process and imposed her own ideas, left her feeling uneasy. Witnessing the sister's discomfort in accepting plans that she didn't genuinely want, and the stress generated by unnecessary activities like breaking dinner plates, made the partner question whether having her partner's mother involved in planning her own wedding would be a wise decision. Moreover, the wasteful nature of the plate-breaking tradition and its lack of connection to the couple's ancestry added to the partner's bewilderment. She is likely concerned that her partner's mother might inadvertently impose her own taste and preferences on her wedding, rather than ensuring that the couple's wishes and preferences are respected and incorporated. This fear is reinforced by the fact that her partner's sister seemed to accept plans she wasn't fond of, just to please her mother. This entire experience made the partner lean more towards the idea of eloping, as it would allow them to avoid the stress and potential conflicts with her partner's mother during the planning phase of their wedding. Overall, the partner is feeling cautious and uneasy about involving her partner's mother in the planning of her wedding, and instead, would prefer a more intimate and personalized celebration that reflects their unique tastes and desires as a couple."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: Tony Leys/The Register)Buy Photo      Donna Rayhons may have responded positively to her husband's hugs and kisses, but that doesn't prove she was mentally capable of consenting to sex, one of her doctors testified Monday.      The issue could be key to whether Henry Rayhons winds up being convicted of sexually abusing his wife, who was living in a nursing home here.      Dr. John Brady, who is medical director of Concord Care Center, testified that Donna Rayhons had severe dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. He said any positive reaction to her husband's affectionate advances could be termed a \\"primal response,\\" not a conscious decision to reciprocate.      MORE: Was Henry Rayhons a loving husband or selfish abuser?      Defense lawyer Joel Yunek pressed the doctor on the matter. \\"If the testimony is that Donna is happy to see Henry — hugs, smiles, they hold hands, they talk — would that indicate that she is in fact capable at that point of understanding the affection with Henry?\\" Yunek asked.      \\"No,\\" Brady answered. He likened the situation to the instinctive response of a baby to affection shown by a mother.      The lawyer asked: \\"Isn't a primal response a decision that we make?\\"      No, the doctor said. \\"I don't believe an infant makes an informed decision.\\"      CLOSE Witnesses testified to Donna Rayhons' mental state during trial proceedings Monday in Garner, Ia.      Brady is one of several healthcare professionals who have testified on behalf of the prosecution in the unusual trial. Henry Rayhons, 78, is charged with a felony for allegedly having sex with his wife last May after Brady determined she no longer had the mental capacity to consent. Rayhons, a former state legislator, has denied any wrongdoing in his actions toward his wife, who died last August.      Brady testified Monday that Donna Rayhons had declined rapidly in the months before the incident last May 23. He said she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's based on several tests. One was a standard cognitive test, in which patients are asked simple questions, such as what day it is or whether they can repeat back three words that are spoken to them. By last May, Brady said, Donna Rayhons scored a zero on the test. Any score below eight signifies severe impairment, he said.      PREVIOUSLY: Henry Rayhons' stepchild denies that bitterness played a role      Two other doctors who testified for the prosecution Friday also said they were confident Donna Rayhons was suffering severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.      One of the doctors, neurologist Alireza Yarahmadi, disputed any notion that such an Alzheimer's patient could vary greatly in her ability to understand what was going on around her. \\"When they're severe, they're going to stay severe,\\" Yarahmadi testified.      Yunek, the defense lawyer, has been suggesting that dementia patients have \\"good days and bad days,\\" in which they're more or less capable of making decisions. Yunek also has suggested that even if they lose cognitive abilities, dementia patients maintain an emotional ability to reject activities, such as hugging or kissing. The neurologist disagreed with that idea. \\"They do have feelings, but they don't have good judgment,\\" Yarahmadi said.      On Monday morning, the prosecution showed jurors security camera video from the night of the alleged incident. The silent, black-and-white video, shot in the nursing home's hallways, shows Donna Rayhons wandering around the hall. Then it shows Henry Rayhons walking into the facility and going into her room with her. He stays in the room about 28 minutes. Near the end of that time, a nurse's aide goes into the room, reportedly to answer a call light from Donna Rayhons' roommate. Prosecution witnesses have said the roommate was upset by sounds she heard from behind a curtain, which authorities contend were from sex. The defense denies the couple had sex.      This still photo, taken from a video from security cameras at the Concord Care Center in Garner, shows Rayhons dropping his wife’s underwear in a laundry cart after leaving her room last May 23. Prosecutors allege he was trying to hide evidence that he’d just had sex with his wife, but the defense lawyer has said Henry Rayhons often placed his wife’s dirty laundry in the hamper. (Photo: Special to the Register)      At the end of the video shown to jurors, Henry Rayhons comes out of the room, walks down the hall and drops something into a laundry cart. Nursing Director Laura Studer testified that a staff member later retrieved Donna Rayhons' underwear from the laundry.      Yunek said in his opening statement last week that his client often put his wife's dirty laundry in the cart, although prosecutors contend Henry Rayhons was trying to stash evidence of his misdeed.      Studer testified that the facility's staff called police about the incident. She said they are required by state law to report any suspicions of criminal activity in the facility. She denied that Donna Rayhons' daughters instigated the report. Yunek has said his client was at the losing end of a power struggle with two of his stepdaughters, who didn't like the way he wanted Donna to continue living as normal a life as possible.      In cross-examining prosecution witnesses Monday afternoon, Yunek tried to heighten doubts about whether the couple had sex that evening.      One of the witnesses was Luann Engels-Hepker, a Mason City nurse who specializes in examining sex abuse victims. She described how she performed a thorough examination on Donna Rayhons that night after the police chief brought the elderly woman to the hospital. Rayhons did not appear agitated, but also did not seem to understand what was going on, Engels-Hepker testified. Under Yunek's questioning, the nurse said she found no signs of physical injury, though she said that doesn't necessarily mean a person wasn't abused. It could just mean there wasn't a lot of force used, she said.      The jury also heard from former nursing home staff nurse Shari Dakin, who recounted how Donna Rayhons' roommate became distraught after the alleged incident. The roommate indicated Henry Rayhons had done something awful after pulling a curtain shielding his wife's bed from the roommate's view. \\"She said she just hated that man, just hated him,\\" Dakin said. The roommate told staff members she knew what the sounds were. \\"I'm not stupid. I know what was going on behind that curtain,\\" Dakin recalled her saying.      The defense lawyer asked Dakin if the roommate ever specifically said the sounds were from sex. \\"No,\\" the nurse replied, \\"but she insinuated very strongly that's what it was.\\"      Monday afternoon, the judge told jurors they would not be hearing testimony in the case Tuesday but the trial should resume Wednesday. Yunek told reporters afterward that the interruption was because of an emergency in his family.

Physicians and nurses from the Concord Care Center testified that Donna Rayhons, wife of former Iowa legislator, Henry Rayhons was in no place mentally to give consent to any sexual interactions with her husband.      Rayhons is on trial for allegedly engaging in a sex act with Donna, who had been diagnosed with dementia and deemed unfit to give consent.      Dr. John Brady was first to take the stand as the primary physician for the Concord Care Center. He described the downward decline of Donna’s mental state and her capacity for decision-making.      He says given Donna’s decreasing score on the BIMS (Brief Interview for Mental Status), he determined Donna lacked the cognitive ability to give consent to sex.      On May 15, during a care conference between Henry, staff and the daughters of Donna, the topic of sex between spouses was discussed briefly. In the document provided to all parties, the document asks, “Given Donna’s cognitive state, do you feel she is able to give consent for any sexual activity?” To which Dr. Brady writes, “no” and then later signs his initials.      Dr. Brady says in his 20 years of practicing medicine, this is the first time he has ever been asked to make a judgement about a person’s mental capacity to have sex with their spouse while in nursing home care.      Later, Laura Studer, Director of Nursing at the care facility gave her testimony on the events of May 23. After being made aware of an incident regarding Henry and Donna where sex may have been involved, she reviewed the surveillance tapes.      There, she says you can see Donna being redirected to her room by Henry, after she had wandered through the halls. Nearly 30 minutes later, Henry is seen leaving the room and walking down the hallway. He would stop and drop something, later discovered to be Donna’s underwear, in the laundry hamper.      Studer says outside of the concerns addressed by Donna’s roommate, no other care staff recalled anything out of the ordinary. It was only until Donna’s roommate alerted staff by saying, “I know what I heard, I’m not stupid.” From there staff began investigating what they believed to be sexual abuse.      Luanne Engels-Hepker, administered the sexual abuse exam on Donna and says that she was unable to find any secretions, or any evidence of damage to Donna’s vagina.      In cross-exam, Engels-Hepker says Donna was very cooperative and did not restrict the investigation in any way.      According to prosecutors, it was later discovered the same underwear thrown in the laundry hamper contained seminal fluid consistent with the DNA of Henry Rayhons.      Several nurses, care specialists and even a local police officer took to the stand to testify to Donna’s cognitive abilities.      Head charge nurse, Shari Dakin explained how Donna was often times, “in her own little world.” Others like nurse, Patricia Barrick illustrated the extent of Donna’s dementia by recalling an event when she met Donna for a meal.      “She was holding a sandwich like this and looking down and just shaking your head. What do I do? Not saying that, but just looking blankly at the food,” said Barrick.      Barrick says it was then that she began to notice a sharp decline in Donna’s cognitive functions.

Impressed with his work, mafia boss Remo Gaggi (Pasquale Cajano), sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicholas \\"Nicky\\" Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his associate Frank \\"Frankie\\" Marino (Frank Vincent) to protect Sam and the whole operation. Nicky's volatile temper soon gets him banned from every casino in Las Vegas, so he gathers his own crew and engages in independent shakedowns and burglaries instead. Sam meets and falls in love with a hustler and former prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). They conceive a daughter and marry, but their marriage is proven difficult by Ginger's strong independence and love for her former boyfriend, con artist-turned pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods), who is ordered beaten severely by Sam and Nicky after they catch him conning Ginger out of some money. Ginger subsequently turns to alcohol. Meanwhile, Sam makes an enemy in county commissioner Pat Webb (L. Q. Jones) for firing his brother-in-law Don Ward (John Bloom) for incompetence. When Sam refuses to reinstate him, Webb pulls Sam's licence from the backlog, forcing him to face a hearing for his gaming licence while secretly arranging for the board to deny Sam. Sam blames the incident on Nicky's recklessness and the two argue furiously in the desert after Sam attempts to tell Nicky to leave Las Vegas. The casino counters begin stealing some money for themselves, prompting the Midwest mafia bosses to put Artie Piscano (Vinny Vella) of the Kansas City mafia in charge of overseeing the transactions. Piscano is... My question: Who kidnaps Sam and Ginger's daughter, Amy? Answer:","output":"The character who kidnaps Sam and Ginger's daughter, Amy, is Ginger herself. In the movie, Ginger becomes increasingly unstable and addicted to alcohol and drugs. At one point, she takes Amy and goes to Los Angeles with her former boyfriend, Lester Diamond. In an attempt to get money from Sam, she creates a kidnapping scenario, but Sam eventually gets Amy back."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly despicable.

Q:You are given a new situation: A scientist named Kathy walks into her office to see two neon signs plugged into the wall and hanging above her desk. Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room.  and a hint : Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.  Please answer this question : Are the electrons in the small sign more or less energized than the large sign's electrons? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it appears that the small neon sign is not functioning properly as it does not light up when Kathy flips the switch, unlike the large sign. In contrast, the large sign is working properly and emits light upon switching it on.  The electrons in the small sign seem to be in their original energy levels since the sign is not emitting any light. They are not energized enough to jump to higher energy levels, which is required for the emission of light. On the other hand, the electrons in the large sign are being energized as an electric current passes through them. This causes the electrons to jump to higher energy levels and, upon returning to their original energy levels, emit energy as light. Considering these factors, it can be stated that the electrons in the large sign are more energized compared to those in the small sign. The malfunction or lack of functionality in the small sign might be due to several reasons such as faulty wiring, insufficient electrical current, or problems with the noble gas content in the tubes. However, from the provided information, we can conclude that the electrons in the small sign are less energized than the large sign's electrons, as the small sign is not emitting light as it should."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a new situation: John is studying a species in two similar countries, country A and country B. Country A has large population, but country B has small population of that species. John is pondering about how this species would fare in the future in these two countries.  But I can use this background: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.  What is an answer for this question: Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, country A, with a large population of the species, is likely to experience more competition for resources such as food. As a result, individuals in country A may struggle to reproduce at a high rate, which would lead to a decrease in population growth rate. On the other hand, country B has a smaller population, which means there would be more abundant resources available per individual. This relatively abundant food and other resources could enable the organisms in country B to reproduce more easily, leading to higher birth rates and an increased population growth rate. Therefore, in this scenario, country B would likely see a higher growth rate of the species compared to country A due to the difference in population sizes and the availability of resources."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: suppose there is no lava in the chambers happens, how will it affect there is excess water and waste.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"There would be no effect.  The process you described is related to the operations of the human renal system, more specifically, the role of kidneys in waste management and water regulation in the body. The nephrons in the kidneys filter out wastes and excess water from the blood, leaving only the necessary nutrients and electrolytes. The cleaned blood is then routed back into the body's circulation, while the waste and excess water are converted into urine, excreted from the body through the urinary system. The scenario envisaged about the absence of lava in the volcanic chambers has no direct relationship to the renal process described above and thus wouldn't have an effect on it. Volcanic activities, such as lava flow, occur on a geological scale and are part of Earth's way of renewing its surface. This is a wholly physical process involving the Earth's tectonic plates and has no direct interaction with biological systems such as the renal system. On a larger scale, if volcanic activity were to reduce significantly due to the absence of lava, it might create impacts on the global climate, such as a slight cooling effect due to fewer volcanic emissions - gases and particles that can block sunlight. But even these changes won't affect the function of kidneys.  Hence, if there's no lava in the chambers, it will have no effect on the process of the kidneys expelling excess water and waste from the body. Kidneys operate based on the body's internal homeostasis and are not influenced by such external geophysical processes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Our family had been staying at Grandview for many years. We have enjoyed the rooms, pool, and location in the past. However the quality of the customer service and the basic maintenance and cleanliness of the property has declined to such a low, that we will no longer choose Grandview as our place to stay when we visit Las Vegas.  During our stay in September 2011 there were several issues with our rooms. Light bulbs out, missing sink parts, etc. that we had to get taken care of when we checked in. Then during the stay there was some kind of fire on our floor which triggered the sprinklers and flooded the hall. We were not informed that there was a fire, evacuated, or anything. Then when we asked about the flooding, carpet pulled up, huge loud fans, etc. we were told the fire department had sprayed it down and caused the damage (which the manager denied later, saying it was only the sprinklers). The whole floor began to stink terrible on top of the noise. We were never given the option to move to another floor or building. When we brought this all to the attention of the Front Desk Manager, he apologized and said that the next time we come he will make sure we have a \\"VIP room\\" where he would personally make sure everything in the room is perfect and he insisted that an apology gift of a fruit basket (or similar) would await us. When I made my reservation for our next trip in November 2012 I called him and he told me that he couldn't write down the VIP thing right then and I would have to call when it got closer to the check in date to remind him. Quite a lot of work for me, to get the apology executed. I did as he asked and he said everything would be ready when we came, however, when we got to the rooms there were things missing and dirty and there was no basket. So the \\"VIP\\" experience did not happen at all. It was just as bad a before and no efforts were made to make it better for us. When we spoke to the same manager about the issues and the basket he sent someone to fix things (which took a long time out of our vacation) and then said they had \\"run out\\" of baskets so we were just going to have to do without. Really? At this point we were ready to say never mind, let's go somewhere else and never return, but being nice and reasonable people we wanted to give them another chance to make things right.  Our last trip was May 2013. What we encountered was beyond our worst nightmares. Not only was the room filthy with fingerprints, stains, black mold, etc., but all the furniture was banged up, holes in the walls, paint on lamp shades, etc. When we went to cook dinner the usual mini salt/pepper was missing and when we called the front desk to have them send one up, they said they don't provide that anymore. So we had to stop cooking and run to the store to buy a large shaker of each, which we had to leave behind since we were flying home. The first night the shower was clogged and it was backing up into the sinks (disgusting). Someone came to clean out the drain and then housekeeping had to come clean up their mess. A few days later the toilet would not flush correctly and we had to have another person come fix that. We washed our clothes in the washer machine in the unit prior to flying home and found there were these greasy looking spots all over everything. Some of the clothes have been ruined. To top it all off there was a dead roach in our room that wasn't there when we checked in.   On top of the issues with the room, we were lied to and accosted by the sales team. At check in we were told that you wanted people who had not seen the new building to view the new rooms and give feedback in a short survey about what we liked about the rooms. For doing the survey we would get a coupon for a free lunch buffet and a gift card for the Cosmopolitan. We asked if this was a timeshare thing and were told absolutely not, it was just a short, no time commitment survey. We were interested in seeing the new rooms, especially since we had been having such issues with the current rooms, so we agreed. They took 20 cash to hold our spot, which we thought was weird for a survey. The day of the tour the salesman who picked us up walked us over to the South Point and literally watched us eat our buffet. That was the most unprofessional and creepy thing ever. I guess the goal was to get us to hurry up so we did not enjoy our meal. Then we went over to the Iris building that we were staying in and looked at a model room that was nothing \\"new\\", followed by a timeshare pitch. They refused to let us go and held us hostage by not giving our 20 back.

I read this background article the other day: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.

How can I convince them this is not the case? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: 1). no 2). yes","output":"1) Derivative: A derivative is like finding out the speed at which something changes. Imagine you're riding a bike and you want to know how fast you're going uphill or downhill. In math, we use derivatives to find how fast a curve is changing at any point. The equation you provided, ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 = 1, is for a shape called an ellipse. But this equation has two variables, x and y, so we can't directly find the derivative like we do for simple functions with only one variable. However, we can find partial derivatives, which are like finding how fast the shape changes in just the left-right (x) direction or the up-down (y) direction at a specific point (x, y). For the x direction, we'll find the partial derivative with respect to x (denoted as ∂/∂x): ∂/∂x (ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2) = 2ax + 2hy. For the y direction, we'll find the partial derivative with respect to y (denoted as ∂/∂y): ∂/∂y (ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2) = 2hx + 2by. These partial derivatives tell us how fast the curve is changing at a point (x, y) in the x and y directions. 2) Parents problem: Think of your family as a special team, and each person in your family is a valuable team member, like in a soccer game.

Would \\"It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"Low self-esteem refers to an individual's negative evaluation of their own self-worth or intrinsic value. It encompasses the thoughts, emotions, and beliefs they hold about themselves. A person with low self-esteem tends to harbor feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, and a lack of confidence in their abilities. It can manifest in various aspects of one's life, such as personal relationships, academic achievements, professional growth, and social interactions. The statement, \\"It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self,\\" is indeed a reasonable answer to describe low self-esteem since it accurately captures the essence of both the cognitive and emotional aspects of this phenomenon. Let's break this statement down into two parts to provide further clarity: 1. Judgement of oneself: Low self-esteem arises when individuals perceive themselves negatively, focusing on their shortcomings and perceived failures. They may have a tendency to compare themselves unfavorably with others and believe they do not measure up. These critical judgments, often rooted in past experiences or internalized messages from others, feed a distorted self-image that does not accurately reflect their true capabilities or worth. 2. Attitude toward the self: This component highlights the emotional and behavioral consequences of negative self-evaluations. Individuals with low self-esteem may demonstrate a pervasive lack of confidence, insecurity, and self-deprecation. They may be overly sensitive to criticism, prone to self-blame, and experience heightened feelings of shame, guilt, or worthlessness. The negative attitude toward oneself may also lead to the development of self-defeating behaviors, such as excessive perfectionism, procrastination, social withdrawal, and avoidance of challenges or opportunities for growth. Low self-esteem can be influenced by various factors, including upbringing, personality traits, mental health issues, trauma, or societal pressures and expectations. Addressing and overcoming low self-esteem typically involves identifying and challenging distorted self-beliefs, cultivating self-awareness and self-compassion, fostering positive relationships, and developing coping strategies to cope with life's challenges. In conclusion, low self-esteem is a multifaceted phenomenon that involves both the judgment of oneself and an attitude toward the self, which contribute to a person's overall sense of personal worth and competence. The statement provided accurately captures this concept and encourages a broader perspective on the complexities of self-esteem and its impact on individuals' lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His last ride came in 1999. He currently lives with his wife in Asheboro, North Carolina. He is the brother of former fellow NASCAR competitor Jim Bown. Context: In 1994, Bown moved back up to the Cup series, driving the No. 12 Ford Thunderbird for Bobby Allison. He won the pole for the Food City 500, setting a new track record. He was seriously injured in a wreck at Pocono Raceway which sidelined him for the season.  Bown returned to racing in 1995 in four Busch races, finishing ninth at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the No. 05 Key Motorsports Ford. He competed in nine Cup races in the No. 32 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for Active Motorsports, his best finish a 21st at Charlotte. In 1996, Bown drove for a variety of teams in the Busch Series, his best finish 21st at Darlington Raceway. He drove the Sadler Brothers Racing' No. 95 Ford in three Winston Cup Series events but only finished one race.  In 1997, Bown began racing in the Craftsman Truck Series, driving the No. 99 Ford F-150 for Roush Racing. Despite not winning a race, he had four top-fives and finished ninth in the standings. The next season, Bown qualified on the pole at the season opener at Walt Disney World Speedway, but finished 25th. After that race, he was released from Roush due to downsizing. He movted to the No. 57 CSG Motorsports Ford driving in six events before being released. He ended the season driving the No. 67 Chevrolet Silverado in a pair of races, finishing seventeenth at Phoenix.  In 1999, Bown returned to Hensley to drive their No. 63 Chevrolet. Despite a seventh-place finish at Charlotte, Bown was released from the team halfway into the season, and soon retired. Question: What did Chuck Bown do in his final years?

In Czech, it is translated as \\"je to\\" where \\"je\\" means 'is' and \\"to\\" means 'it'. 2. \\"hard\\" - In the context of this sentence, 'hard' refers to the difficulty in achieving something which, in Czech, is translated to \\"těžké.\\" It is important to note that \\"těžké\\" is the adjective form of 'hard' (difficult). 3. \\"to get\\" - The verb phrase 'to get' refers to the action of obtaining or achieving something. In Czech, the verb \\"najít\\" signifies 'to find' and would be most appropriate in this context, as it conveys the idea of finding a job. 4. \\"a job\\" - In English, 'a job' refers to a paid position of regular employment. The Czech equivalent to this term is \\"práci,\\" which means 'job' or 'work.' 5. \\"you know?\\" - This part of the sentence is typically used in informal conversational contexts to make sure the listener understands or agrees with the point. In Czech, it can be translated as \\"víš\\" where 'víš' is a contracted form of 'víš to', which means 'you know it' or 'you know that.'

A man jumps onto a balance beam. they","output":"In this scenario, a man jumps onto a balance beam. Most naturally, the following events would occur: 1. Regaining Stability: Immediately after jumping onto the balance beam, the man will need to regain his stability. This will require him to engage his core muscles, maintain a straight posture, and evenly distribute his weight over his feet. He might use his arms to help regain balance, extending them out from his sides. 2. Adjusting Foot Placement: Once stable, the man will begin carefully adjusting his foot placement as he prepares to move forward or perform various exercises on the balance beam. This may involve shifting his feet to be in line with each other or placing one foot in front of the other. He must maintain focus and concentration to prevent any missteps. 3. Walking, Hopping, or Performing Acrobatics: Depending on the man's level of skill and the specific exercises he wishes to perform, he may begin moving along the balance beam in various ways. This could include walking slowly and deliberately, hopping from one foot to the other, or even incorporating acrobatic moves such as cartwheels, handstands, or flips. 4. Focusing on Technique and Form: As the man navigates the balance beam, he will need to pay close attention to his technique and form. This is crucial for maintaining his balance and ensuring a safe and successful training session or performance. Proper form generally involves straight posture, controlled movements, and keeping the body's center of gravity aligned with the beam. 5. Building Confidence and Endurance: Over time and with consistent practice, the man will begin to develop increased confidence and endurance on the balance beam. As he masters basic techniques, he can gradually progress to more advanced exercises and combinations. This ongoing improvement will help him maintain an interest in the activity and continue progressing. 6. Completing the Routine or Exercise: Once the man has successfully executed his desired moves or routine on the balance beam, he will carefully dismount the beam. This can be done by simply stepping off, completing a controlled jump, or executing a more advanced dismount such as a flip or aerial maneuver. 7. Practicing and Refining Skills: After completing his routine or exercise on the balance beam, the man will likely reflect on his performance and identify areas for improvement. He may continue to practice specific exercises or combinations to further develop his skills and master more advanced moves. Additionally, he may seek feedback from a coach, instructor, or training partner to help improve technique and form. In summary, after a man jumps onto a balance beam, what most naturally follows is regaining stability, adjusting foot placement, walking or performing acrobatics, focusing on technique and form, building confidence and endurance, and practicing and refining skills on the beam. These steps help create a safe and successful experience for the individual in a fascinating and physically demanding activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose only known architectural subject is a drawing of the interior of the Old Church , can you please find it?   During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill.

Ruisdael was a prominent Dutch painter during the Golden Age. Throughout his career, he had been known for his wide range of subjects, and his ability to beautifully illustrate them. Ruisdael’s work throughout his career primarily revolved around landscapes. He worked with all sorts of landscapes, except for Italianate landscapes and foreign landscapes that were not Scandinavian. A theme he favored was the portrayal of forests, rivers, dunes, country roads, panoramas, imaginary views, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Ruisdael’s imaginary landscapes were said to reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. This indicates Ruisdael's deep understanding and appreciation of the aesthetics and principles of landscape gardening, leading him to produce works of art that represented this beauty and complexity. Windmills were often featured throughout Ruisdael's career. One of his most famous works is \\"Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede,\\" which shows the convergence of typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water, and expansive sky on a dominant cylindrical windmill. His portrayal of windmills throughout his career highlights his ability to depict the elements that characterize the Netherlands. Ruisdael also created many panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds, a genre known as \\"Haerlempjes,\\" with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. One recurring feature in these paintings is Saint Bavo's Church, where Ruisdael was eventually buried. Despite living in Amsterdam for over 25 years, it rarely featured in his work. To sum up, although Jacob van Ruisdael had a wide repertoire of landscape subjects in his oeuvre, when it came to architectural rendering, he is only known for a drawing of the interior of the Old Church. This element elevates the uniqueness of that art piece in Ruisdael's portfolio."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Q: Species divergence often, but not always, occurs because of what type of barrier between species?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Sympatric Speciation Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland. ” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14).   Choices:  - emotional  - visible  - language  - physical   A: Answer:","output":"Physical barriers are often, but not always, the cause of species divergence. Based on the provided paragraph, it explains that species divergence can also occur due to sympatric speciation, where species diverge within the same habitat without the presence of physical barriers. Sympatric speciation can be initiated by mechanisms like chromosomal errors during cell division, leading to conditions such as aneuploidy. Thus, the correct answer is physical barriers, although it is important to note that species divergence can occur without them as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The incident in question occurred when he dismissed Australian batsman Matthew Hayden with a leg before wicket (lbw) ruling. Akhtar gestured for Hayden to head to the dressing room, which was considered unsportsmanlike and against the spirit of the game. This behavior led to a charge of level one misconduct being brought against him. Cricket, as a sport, not only emphasizes performance on the field but also values sportsmanship and respect between players, regardless of the intensity of the competition. Level one misconduct is the most lenient of penalties given to cricketers for breaching game conduct. It can include minor offenses like showing dissent towards the umpire or using language deemed offensive. Nevertheless, the charge stands as a reminder for players to maintain a certain level of decorum while participating in the sport. This incident took place during a Test match, considered the most traditional form of cricket. Test matches span up to five days, with each team getting two innings. The longer duration allows the game to develop in terms of strategies and tactics on both sides. It, therefore, demands a high level of patience and focus from the players. As a result, maintaining proper conduct becomes an essential part of the game. Shoaib Akhtar is a notable figure in the cricketing world, known for his aggression and fast-paced bowling. Besides his skill and prowess, Akhtar was also known for controversies involving behavior and disputes. Throughout his career, he faced various misconduct-related charges and bans. Despite such incidents, cricket as a sport continues to draw large audiences and fans from around the world. It provides a platform that enables countries to showcase their talents and compete healthily. Ensuring that players maintain a proper conduct enables the game to progress positively and enhances the spirit of sportsmanship. In conclusion, this event occurred within the realm of sports, specifically cricket, as it involved two international teams - Pakistan and Australia. The charging of Shoaib Akhtar with level one misconduct is a reminder that adherence to proper conduct is important in the world of cricket. It ensures the spirit of the game remains intact, and players on and off the field continue to foster a culture of mutual respect, competitive spirit, and fair play."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic asthma, which also plagued her at a later age. Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, the owner of a carriage company, decided that it would be good for her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz. The first major female tennis star to turn professional, Lenglen was paid US50,000 by American entrepreneur Charles C. Pyle to tour the United States in a series of matches against Mary K. Browne. Browne, winner of the US Championships from 1912 to 1914, was 35 and considered to be past her prime, although she had reached the French final earlier that year (losing to Lenglen 6-1, 6-0).  For the first time in tennis history, the women's match was the headline event of the tour (which also featured male players). In their first match in New York City, Lenglen put on a performance that New York Times writer Allison Danzig lauded as \\"one of the most masterly exhibitions of court generalship that has been seen in this country.\\" When the tour ended in February 1927, Lenglen had defeated Browne, 38 matches to 0. She was exhausted from the lengthy tour, and a physician advised Lenglen that she needed a lengthy period away from the game to recover.  Instead, Lenglen chose to retire from competitive tennis to run a Paris tennis school, which she set up with the help and money of her lover Jean Tillier. The school, located next to the courts of Roland Garros, slowly expanded and was recognised as a federal training centre by the French tennis federation in 1936. During this period, Lenglen also wrote several books on tennis.  Lenglen was criticised widely for her decision to turn professional, and the All England Club at Wimbledon even revoked her honorary membership. Lenglen, however, described her decision as \\"an escape from bondage and slavery\\" and said in the tour programme, \\"In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis and have paid thousands of francs in entrance fees to be allowed to do so.... I have worked as hard at my career as any man or woman has worked at any career. And in my whole lifetime I have not earned 5,000 - not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study - tennis.... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy - should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? Or should I smile at the prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune - for whom?\\" As for the amateur tennis system, Lenglen said, \\"Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, and the fact of the matter is that only wealthy people do compete. Is that fair? Does it advance the sport? Does it make tennis more popular - or does it tend to suppress and hinder an enormous amount of tennis talent lying dormant in the bodies of young men and women whose names are not in the social register?\\"","output":"This text is about Suzanne Lenglen, a French tennis player who became the first major female tennis star to turn professional.
