Machines were already out of date when they were launched. Manchester and Birmingham airports quietly scrapping the machines. Heathrow and Gatwick to halt scheme for new passengers. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: UK Airports Abandon Outdated Iris Scanners: A £9 Million Loss Introduction: In 2004, iris recognition technology was introduced in several major UK airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, and Birmingham. The iris scanners, which cost a staggering £9 million, were supposed to improve security and streamline the immigration process. However, the technology has failed to deliver on those promises. Machines were already considered outdated when they were first unveiled, and now, airports are quietly abandoning these costly machines. Step 1: Discuss the initial launch of iris scanners In 2004, UK airports introduced iris recognition technology to bolster security at immigration checkpoints. These scanners were meant to provide an additional layer of protection and facilitate a smoother immigration process. However, despite the £9million investment in iris recognition technology, the machines were criticized as being outdated even at the time of their launch. Critics argued that the technology could not keep up with the rapidly-evolving security landscape. Step 2: Talk about the issues faced by airports Manchester and Birmingham airports have been facing challenges with the iris scanner technology since launch. The outdated technology has proven to be unreliable and have failed to perform the intended function of enhancing airport security. Passengers have also reported issues with the machines, such as long wait times and difficulty in using them. As a result, these airports have quietly scrapped the machines, with no plans to replace them with newer technology. Step 3: Discuss Heathrow and Gatwick's decisions Heathrow and Gatwick airports have followed suit by announcing that they will halt the iris scanning scheme for new passengers. As a result, passengers will no longer be required to go through the iris scanning process upon entering the UK. Instead, the airports will likely transition to alternative security measures that are more effective and up-to-date with current technology standards. Step 4: Analyze the impact on the airport industry and future technology adoption The decision to abandon the iris scanner technology has brought attention to the risks associated with implementing costly and novel technologies in the airport industry. The £9million investment in the scanners serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of carefully researching and understanding the long-term implications of emerging technologies before widespread adoption. Conclusion: The abandonment of the iris scanners at UK airports is a potent reminder of the need for thorough evaluation and understanding of new technologies before investing significant funds. The iris scanners, once heralded as a cutting-edge security measure, have proven to be more burdensome than beneficial. As airports seek alternatives for enhanced security, they must draw lessons from this experience and prioritize successful implementation of reliable, up-to-date technology."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Classic British Films Review: I was familiar with most of the films in this collection but only knew Storm in a Teacup from a less than perfect transfer to VHS.

Vinny, a struggling musician, and Dionna, an aspiring painter, dream of leaving their mundane lives to explore the world and find inspiration for their art. In a neighboring city called Serenity, we find Ritchie and Ruby, a pair of childhood friends turned detectives, who share a deep bond and have recently established their investigative agency. When Vinny and Dionna stumble upon an enchanted piece of jewelry - a necklace with two halves of a heart pendant - in an antique shop, their lives change forever. The moment they hold the mysterious piece, they are drawn into a centuries-old prophecy that compels them to fulfill a quest. The quest: uniting the two cities of Vibrance and Serenity, which have been separated for centuries due to an ancient curse. As Vinny and Dionna begin their journey, they discover that Serenity has been frozen in time, causing all who lived there to remain in the 19th century while Vibrance continued to evolve. The curse's origins are traced back to a bitter feud between two family's ancestors, where betrayal and loss led to the rift between the cities. Meanwhile, in Serenity, Ritchie and Ruby stumble upon clues hinting at the prophecy in an old journal found in Ruby's grandmother's attic. The pair suddenly realize their purpose as guardians of Serenity's half of the heart pendant and decide to help Vinny and Dionna reunite the cities. Vinny and Dionna face numerous challenges as they embark on their quest, including navigating a treacherous forest, battling mythical creatures, and resisting a malevolent being named Caldor who wants to maintain the separation between the two cities for his own sinister reasons. Along this treacherous journey, Vinny and Dionna eventually find their way to Serenity and meet Ritchie and Ruby. The four quickly form an unbreakable bond, supporting one another in their trials and tribulations. Each couple finds solace in their respective relationships, fueling their determination to break the curse. As Ritchie and Ruby assist Vinny and Dionna in evading Caldor's evil clutches, they uncover the true origin of the curse. In a heart-wrenching confrontation with their forefathers' spirits, the couples plead for forgiveness and vow to end the cycle of bitterness and pain between their families. Triumphantly, Vinny and Dionna reunite the two halves of the heart pendant at the border of Vibrance and Serenity. The curse is lifted and, slowly but surely, the cities begin to merge. The protagonists' shared bravery paves the way for newfound friendships, love, and creative inspiration. As the story concludes, both couples find success and fulfillment. Vinny and Dionna see their music and art flourish, while Ritchie and Ruby's detective agency gains significant renown. Through their shared journey, the couples prove that love and unity have the power to heal even the deepest wounds left by history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cleese was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese (1893-1972), an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (nee Cross; 1899-2000). His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School, where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing. Along with Gilliam's animations, Cleese's work with Graham Chapman provided Python with its darkest and angriest moments, and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of Basil Fawlty.  Unlike Palin and Jones, Cleese and Chapman wrote together in the same room; Cleese claims that their writing partnership involved Cleese doing most of the work, while Chapman sat back, not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level. A classic example of this is the \\"Dead Parrot sketch\\", envisaged by Cleese as a satire on poor customer service, which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car (this version was actually performed and broadcast on the pre-Python special How to Irritate People). It was Chapman's suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot, and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a \\"Norwegian Blue\\", giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable.  Their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason. Like Chapman, Cleese's poker face, clipped middle class accent, and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures, such as policemen, detectives, Nazi officers or government officials--which he would then proceed to undermine. Most famously, in the \\"Ministry of Silly Walks\\" sketch (actually written by Palin and Jones), Cleese exploits his stature as the crane-legged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office.  Chapman and Cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, such as in the \\"cheese shop\\", the \\"dead parrot\\" sketch and \\"Argument Clinic\\", where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)--the comic contrast between the towering Cleese's crazed aggression and the shorter Palin's shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese-Palin dynamic is reversed, as in \\"Fish Licence\\", wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.  Though the programme lasted four series, by the start of series 3, Cleese was growing tired of dealing with Chapman's alcoholism. He felt, too, that the show's scripts had declined in quality. For these reasons, he became restless and decided to move on. Though he stayed for the third series, he officially left the group before the fourth season. Despite this, he remained friendly with the group, and all six began writing Monty Python and the Holy Grail; Cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions, though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series. Cleese returned to the troupe to co-write and co-star in the Monty Python films Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Monty Python's Life of Brian and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, and participated in various live performances over the years.

Q:The 18-meter-tall Rubber Duck arrived in Beijing on Friday. It was placed on waters in the International Garden Expo Park, where the Yongding River passes through. The Rubber Duck exhibition was designed by Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman. It was part of the activities of Beijing Design Week, which ran from September 26 to October 3 in 2013. The Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26. The duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo. Sun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park. \\"Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again.\\" Sun said. Because of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends. Zhao Yan said she had been following news about the duck since 2007, when the duck began its journey. \\"I even considered going to Hong Kong to see it.

Roger Federer did not so much wield a racket as wave a wand on the sunlit grass of Wimbledon on Tuesday. It was another masterclass in a tournament of masterclasses from the seven-time champion, in this instance against Tommy Robredo, the usually stubborn Spaniard who was dismissed from the premises in 94 minutes of imperious precision. Comfortable: Roger Federer is through to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon after demolishing Tommy Robredo. Unstoppable: Federer took just 21 minutes to take the first set, and didn't lose a point on serve in the second. It was almost as if time had stood. still and a young Federer in his first bloom was with us again. At 32,. he is no more likely to shrivel away and disappear from the All England. Club than its famous ivy. His. accumulation of statistics is phenomenal; he is the only competitor in. the men’s singles not to have lost a service game in four rounds. None. of his matches has lasted longer. ‘It’s like being a footballer,’ he. said. His serve was. dominant, his net play clean and incisive. Poor Robredo made the fatal. mistake of starting poorly, winning just 13 points in the first set and. committing a horrific series of unforced errors. By the time he was up. and running in the third set, it was way too late. That. was the story of one Swiss victory on Tuesday. The other was unfolding. on Court Two: a fractious contest won 7-6, 7-6, 6-3 by Federer’s. countryman and close friend Stan Wawrinka against Feliciano Lopez. Experienced: But it wasn't Tommy Robredo's day on Court No 1. The. two men were locked in heated dispute as the match ended, tension having. built as the match developed, but they shook hands in the end and. claimed that everything was mended when they came to speak to the press. afterwards. The upshot is a. Swiss-Swiss quarter-final: Wawrinka versus Federer. Never before has. that country had two men reach the last eight here. More. intriguingly, set against Federer’s long period of success, Wawrinka. outranks Federer – third versus fourth – in the world standings. He is. also the player more recently to have won a Grand Slam tournament, this. year’s Australian Open. Yes they are buddies, but has Wawrinka’s recent success not changed the dynamic between them? ‘Which. dynamic?’ said Federer, leaning on 17 Grand Slam titles. ‘Well, I think. for him the dynamic has changed a lot. Definitely in terms of showing. up for the big moments, believing he can come through them after. previously losing a lot of close matches against many of the top guys. Sunny day: Fans packed into to watch the match at SW19 on Tuesday. ‘People clearly marked him out after the Australian Open, but it started at the US Open and just prior to that. ‘So. I am really happy for him that he’s been able to keep it going strong,. even though he had had some ups and downs that are inevitable after a. big win like the Australian Open.’ These. are heady sporting days for neutral Switzerland. A few hours after the. wins of Wawrinka and Federer, they scuttled back to their TVs – separate. screens, different locations – to watch the World Cup match between. Argentina and Switzerland. A loss, though it lasted a good deal longer than Federer’s match. Well, you can’t have everything. Just. before the match, the big-serving Wawrinka was wearing a t-shirt with. the slogan ‘Stan the Man’. When questioned, he said he wasn’t. necessarily the man – that sounded a bit boastful, he thought. It this. was just a nickname. I suppose a ‘Stan Not the Man’ t-shirt would be. ludicrous. Classy: Federer could be set for a semi-final clash with Rafael Nadal. But can he be the. man against Federer on Wednesday, just as he was in the final of the. Masters 1000 in Monte Carlo? On the negative side, due to the weather. delays on Saturday, will be playing his third match in as many days. ‘That win in Monaco will give me a lot of confidence,’ he said, ‘knowing that I can beat him on the big stage. ‘But. tomorrow it’s going to be a different experience. First time on grass. First time at Wimbledon. Five-set match. Yeah, it’s going to be tough.’ Did that not sound a touch defeatist? He. added: ‘You know when you play Roger at Wimbledon, when he’s fit and. confident and feeling well, it’s one of the biggest challenges in. tennis. It’s like playing Rafa in the French Open. These guys are. playing their best tennis for many years.’ Tommy Robredo will most certainly attest to that in the case of Mr Federer.","output":"Roger Federer played an amazing tennis match at Wimbledon against Tommy Robredo. He was so good that it was like watching magic. Federer won and moved on to the next round. People were reminded of when Federer was younger and just starting to play. He is still really good even though he is now 32 years old. Federer's friend and fellow Swiss player, Stan Wawrinka, also won his match. This means that two Swiss players have reached the last eight in the tournament. They will now play against each other in the next round. Wawrinka is currently ranked higher in the world rankings, but it will be a tough match for both players. Both Federer and Wawrinka watched Switzerland's World Cup match against Argentina after they won their tennis matches, but unfortunately, Switzerland lost."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: British and American scientists are raising genetically modified  pigs in the hope of providing organs for transplant  to humans, the project leader wrote in a newspaper Sunday.  Scientists in London and California have begun conducting the genetic experiments to find a solution to record-long waiting lists for organ transplants, Robert Winston said in an opinion piece written for Britain's Sunday Times.  In Britain alone, around 8,000 patients are waiting for a transplant.  \\"People needing a new heart or liver are waiting for someone else to die -usually a violent death in a traffic accident,\\" Winston wrote in the newspaper. He said his team was \\"trying to modify pigs so their organs might save the lives of humans.\\"  The scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to reduce the chances of the organs being rejected by patients, as has been common in previous attempts to use animal tissues, said Winston, who heads the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology at London's Hammersmith Hospital.  Working with Dr. Carol Redhead of the California Institute of Technology, Winston's team has injected human genes directly into male piglets , adding them to the animal's sperm .  He said that pigs involved in experiments had successfully produced transgenic sperm, but acknowledged that British and European laws had prevented the team from using the pigs to mate.  The Sunday Times newspaper reported that the experiments would be moved to the United States following difficulties with funding and regulations in Britain. It said the pigs would be bred in Missouri.  \\"Our U.S. friends will benefit from our technology and the income we might have produced for Britain will be lost,\\" Winston wrote.  Some scientists have previously blamed the idea of using animal organs for human transplant, saying the technique risks spreading animal viruses to humans. Winston said his research project is attempting to breed virus-free pigs. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that   _  .

One of their most popular beverages and a quintessential symbol of their brand is the Starbucks latte. In this article, you will learn about the history of the latte, the art of making the perfect Starbucks latte, and how this beloved drink has become a part of our culture and daily routines. History of the Latte The concept of a latte, a delicious concoction made of espresso, steamed milk, and a thin layer of frothy milk, originates from Italy. The word \\"latte\\" means \\"milk\\" in Italian, and the drink itself is a variation of a caffè latte, which translates to \\"milk coffee.\\" The history of the latte goes back to Italian coffeehouses in the 17th century, where baristas would serve a mix of espresso and milk to create a creamy, comforting drink that was easily enjoyed by patrons throughout the day. When Starbucks first began expanding outside of Seattle, the company experimented with different coffee beverages to attract a diverse range of customers. The latte quickly became one of their iconic offerings and contributed significantly to their success both in the United States and worldwide. The Art of Making the Perfect Starbucks Latte To achieve the perfect Starbucks latte, a well-trained barista must balance various factors: the quality of the espresso shot, the perfect milk frothing technique, and the ideal temperature. Let us explore each of these factors in detail. 1. Espresso shot: A Starbucks latte typically starts with a strong, powerful shot of espresso. This concentrated coffee base is made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee under high pressure. A high-quality espresso must possess a rich, dark brown color, a smooth, velvety texture, and a strong, full-bodied flavor. 2. Milk frothing technique: Baristas must undergo intensive training to perfect their milk frothing technique, as it is crucial to the overall texture of the latte. The process involves steaming cold milk and using a frothing wand to introduce small, controlled bubbles. This creates a silky, velvety milk texture that complements the strong flavors of the espresso. 3. Ideal temperature: The temperature of a Starbucks latte is essential for enhancing the flavor and ensuring drinkability. The milk should hover between 150°F and 155°F (65°C and 68°C), providing the perfect balance of warm comfort without scalding the drinker's tongue. A Cultural Staple and Daily Ritual The Starbucks latte has become an integral part of many people's daily routines, transcending its status as a simple coffee beverage. Millions of customers have made Starbucks Lattes part of their everyday lives, whether as a morning perk-me-up, an afternoon break from work, or a cozy treat while catching up with friends. In addition to being a day-to-day essential for many, the Starbucks latte has also given rise to the concept of coffee shop culture. With the rise of Starbucks came the rise of a third space: a location that is neither home nor work, but a comfortable environment where people can socialize, study or work. The familiar sight of people hunched over their laptops, books, and papers at a Starbucks, sipping their lattes, has become an iconic image of modern society. Moreover, the latte has encouraged people to explore their creativity through latte art - intricate designs and patterns made by carefully pouring steamed milk over the espresso layer. This popular trend has birthed countless Instagram posts, latte art competitions, and even inspired people to become professional latte artists. Conclusion The Starbucks latte has come a long way from its Italian roots to its worldwide popularity. Crafted with care and skill, this beverage has worked its way into our daily lives. Imbued with cultural significance and a pleasing warmth, lattes, undoubtedly, continue to provide comfort, inspiration, and connection for individuals all around the globe. So, the next time you take a break to sip your Starbucks latte, let yourself be enveloped by the culture, history, and beauty that surround this much-loved drink."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Phillips, militaryBranch, United States Army; United States Army, battle, American Revolutionary War. Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"Alfred N. Phillips was a distinguished individual who served in the United States Army during a pivotal period in American history. As a member of the military, he played a crucial role in shaping the future of the nation by fighting in the American Revolutionary War, a significant conflict that occurred between 1775 and 1783. The United States Army, in which Alfred N. Phillips was enlisted, is the land-based branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and is primarily responsible for engaging in ground warfare. Established on June 14, 1775, it is considered the oldest branch of the U.S. military and served as the primary fighting force during the American Revolutionary War. This military branch has evolved significantly over the years, continuously adapting to changing technological advancements, strategies, and national security needs. The American Revolutionary War, also known as the American War of Independence, was a widespread armed struggle between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies, which had declared themselves the independent United States of America. The conflict began in 1775 when hostilities broke out between colonial militia and British regulars in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. This marked the start of a full-scale revolutionary war, with the colonies seeking political, economic, and social independence from British rule. Throughout the duration of the American Revolutionary War, numerous battles and skirmishes were fought across the colonies, with many crucial engagements occurring in the Northeastern region of the United States. The conflict involved various military strategies, including the use of militia and regular forces, guerilla warfare, and alliances with European powers, particularly France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic. These foreign alliances provided significant support for the United States in securing its independence from Britain. Alfred N. Phillips, as a serviceman of the United States Army, contributed to these efforts through his active participation in the fight for independence. His actions on the battlefield, alongside his compatriots, played an essential role in preserving the young nation's nascent ideals of liberty, democracy, and self-determination. His courageous service in the American Revolutionary War is a reflection of his commitment to the founding principles of the United States and its pursuit of freedom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Mutations are essential for evolution happen, and ask you the question \\"mutations are what to evolution?\\", is the correct answer \\"plants growth\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"mutations are what to evolution?\\" is not \\"plants growth.\\" Instead, a more accurate response would be that \\"mutations are the driving force or catalyst for evolution.\\" Let me provide a detailed explanation to support this answer. Mutations refer to changes in the genetic sequence or DNA, which can occur due to errors during DNA replication, exposure to environmental factors such as radiation, or other factors that influence genetic composition. They introduce variations into a population, which are essential for the evolutionary process to take place. Evolution is the change in the heritable traits of biological populations over successive generations, resulting from factors such as mutation, recombination, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. The process of evolution primarily relies on genetic variation, which arises from mutations. Mutations can have different effects on an organism; some may lead to benefits or advantages in a particular environment, while others may cause harm or have no significant impact on the phenotype – the physical expression of the genes. When an advantageous mutation occurs, it provides an organism with a better chance of survival and reproduction in its specific environment, leading to a higher probability of passing that mutation to offspring through heritable traits. Over time, beneficial mutations tend to accumulate in the population, and unfavorable mutations may disappear or decrease in frequency due to natural selection – the process whereby certain traits become more or less common in a population depending on their impact on an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. This leads to the gradual adaptation of a species to its environment and the emergence of new species over time. Plant growth, though an essential aspect of life and ecology, is not directly related to the question of the role of mutations in evolution. By confusingly suggesting this as the answer, you would be misrepresenting the intricacies of the evolutionary process and the critical part that mutations play in driving change, adaptation, and diversification in living organisms. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \\"mutations are what to evolution?\\" is that mutations are the driving force or catalyst for evolution, as they provide the necessary genetic variation upon which natural selection can act, ultimately leading to the adaptation and evolution of species over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the action they suffered five men wounded ; the British had no casualties . In the action they suffered five wounded men , the British had no loss . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the structure and meaning of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"In the action they suffered five men wounded; the British had no casualties.\\" This sentence tells us that during a particular action, one side suffered five men wounded, while the British side had no casualties. Sentence 2: \\"In the action they suffered five wounded men, the British had no loss.\\" This sentence also tells us that during a particular action, one side suffered five wounded men, while the British side had no loss. Step 2: Identify differences in phrasing and possible meanings. The primary difference between the two sentences is the phrasing used to describe the consequences for each side. In Sentence 1, the wording is \\"five men wounded\\" and \\"no casualties.\\" In Sentence 2, the phrasing is \\"five wounded men\\" and \\"no loss.\\" Step 3: Determine if the differences impact overall meaning. The phrases \\"five men wounded\\" and \\"five wounded men\\" essentially convey the same information, so there is no significant difference in meaning. The phrases \\"no casualties\\" and \\"no loss\\" could be interpreted slightly differently, as \\"casualties\\" generally refer specifically to people who are killed or injured, while \\"loss\\" could potentially include other types of losses (e.g., equipment). However, in the context of these sentences, it is reasonable to assume that \\"no loss\\" is also referring to a lack of killed or injured personnel.

This remarkable charity was founded in 1998 by Doreen Lawrence, the mother of the slain teenager, Stephen Lawrence, with the primary objective of empowering disadvantaged young people and providing them with transformative opportunities. The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is an extraordinary organization that not only keeps the memory of Stephen Lawrence alive but transforms the lives of thousands of young people every year. With its extensive range of workshops, events, courses, and specialized programs, the charity has made a substantial impact on the lives of over 1,500 attendees. By offering these resources, they ensure that young people have the necessary skills and confidence to overcome the numerous personal and social challenges they may face. Driven by a vision to create a society where everyone can flourish, the SLCT offers an extensive array of initiatives designed to inspire, empower, and provide opportunities. These initiatives include Architecture Project Workshop (APW) which aims to create a more inclusive and diverse architecture profession by equipping young learners with key design, drafting, and management skills. Through outreach programs into schools and community centers, they continue to offer support to those in need of a safe space to learn and grow. In addition to the workshops, the SLCT hosts a variety of events that raise awareness and promote social cohesion. From art exhibitions to charity fundraisers, these events showcase the exceptional talent and resilience of the individuals they support while generating invaluable funds to extend the reach of their initiatives. Internships and bursary programs have also proven to be an integral part of the SLCT’s strategy for success. By providing opportunities for practical work experience and financial assistance, they enable disadvantaged youths to gain access to education, employment, and entrepreneurship opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable to them. Hosting the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust’s first television appeal signifies a major milestone in the organization's history. Kevin McCloud, with his exceptional ability to connect with audiences and his deep-rooted passion for design and architecture, is the perfect figure to bring this vital cause to millions of viewers. As an influential figure in the media industry and a strong advocate for inclusion and diversity, McCloud’s involvement reinforces the charity’s commitment to creating impact and lasting change. The SLCT's continued success highlights the incredible legacy of Doreen Lawrence's determination to turn her family's tragic loss into a force for positive change for countless young people. The charity's affiliation with McCloud will, without a doubt, strengthen their ability to reach an even broader spectrum of individuals, and consequently, help more disadvantaged youths to access vital personal development opportunities. Despite the immense challenges faced by disadvantaged young people, the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, with the help of partners like McCloud, continues to break barriers and change lives. As they continue to expand their reach, it is the hope of the trust and their supporters that such initiatives will ultimately contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society, driven by universal access to education, employment, and culturally-sensitive support systems."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: where in gospel of mark does the disciples question Christ deity? Would \\"This canonical account of the life of Jesus of Nazareth is one of the three synoptic gospels .\\" be a reasonable answer? pick from the following. [i] No. [ii] Yes.","output":"[i] No. A reasonable answer would be:  In the Gospel of Mark, the disciples questioning the deity of Jesus Christ can be found in several passages. It is crucial to analyze these passages to understand the context and circumstances in which the disciples have doubted or questioned Jesus' true nature. Here are those instances from the Gospel of Mark: 1. Mark 4:35-41 - Jesus Calms the Storm: In this passage, the disciples and Jesus are crossing the Sea of Galilee when a fierce storm comes upon them. Jesus is asleep on a cushion in the boat, and the disciples were frantic, fearing for their lives. In their fear and panic, they wake Jesus up and say, \\"Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?\\" (Mark 4:38). After Jesus calms the storm, he asks them, \\"Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?\\" (Mark 4:40). In this context, the disciples seem to question Jesus' concern for their lives and by extension, his divine nature. 2. Mark 6:45-52 - Jesus Walks on Water: Following the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus sends his disciples ahead of him in a boat while he goes to pray on the mountainside. Later in the night, Jesus walks on water towards the disciples' boat, but they don't recognize him and think he is a ghost. Their hearts are said to be \\"hardened\\" (Mark 6:52), implying a lack of understanding or recognition of Jesus' divine nature. 3. Mark 8:14-21 - The Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod: In this passage, Jesus warns his disciples about the yeast of the Pharisees and Herod. The disciples, however, misunderstand his warning and think it is about not having enough bread. Jesus then questions their understanding and faith by asking, \\"Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?\\" (Mark 8:17). Through this exchange, it is evident that the disciples are not fully comprehending Jesus' divine nature or teachings. 4. Mark 9:14-29 - The Healing of a Boy with an Unclean Spirit: This passage narrates the story of a father seeking healing for his son, who is possessed by an evil spirit. The disciples are unable to cast it out, and Jesus expresses disappointment in their lack of faith by saying, \\"O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you?\\" (Mark 9:19). This instance, too, illustrates the disciples' struggle to understand Jesus' authority and divine nature. In summary, while the Gospel of Mark does not have a single, definitive passage where the disciples explicitly question Jesus' deity, it does contain several instances where the disciples display a lack of understanding, faith, or recognition of his divine nature. These instances suggest that the disciples grappled with comprehending and accepting Jesus as the Christ and the Son of God."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter. I’m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not.

The only continent without amphibians is Antarctica. Amphibians are especially numerous in temperate lakes and ponds and in tropical rainforests.   Q: What is the only continent without amphibians?   Choices:  - Australia  - Europe  - Africa  - antarctica  A: Answer:","output":"The only continent without amphibians is Antarctica. As stated in the given paragraph, amphibians inhabit freshwater and moist terrestrial habitats across the globe. Their presence is widespread on every continent except Antarctica. This icy and uninhabited continent lacks the presence of amphibians due to its extreme climatic conditions and unsuitable environment for their survival. Amphibians, such as frogs, salamanders, and newts, are a group of ectothermic organisms that thrive in environments where both moisture and temperature are conducive to their survival. They require water not only for hydration but also for their reproduction, as many amphibians lay their eggs in water. The reason Antarctica is not a suitable habitat for amphibians is due primarily to its extreme cold temperatures that remain consistently below freezing for the majority of the year. These frigid conditions make it impossible for ectothermic organisms, like amphibians, to regulate their internal body temperatures, and prevent them from surviving long-term in this environment. In addition to the cold temperatures, the lack of freshwater resources also plays a significant role in inhibiting amphibian habitation in Antarctica. With approximately 98% of the continent being covered by a thick layer of ice, there is a scarcity of freshwater habitats where amphibians could reside. Considering the other choices provided, amphibians are indeed found on those continents: - Australia: You can find amphibians like frogs and tree frogs throughout the continent, in diverse habitats such as rainforests, deserts, and wetlands. - Europe: This continent is home to numerous species of amphibians and is particularly well-known for its salamander species, including the giant salamander, as well as frogs and toads. - Africa: Africa boasts a rich diversity of amphibians, including over 700 species of frogs and toads, as well as various types of salamanders and caecilians. They inhabit various environments, ranging from deserts to rainforests. In summary, the only continent mentioned in the list of choices devoid of amphibians is Antarctica due to its inhospitable climate and lack of freshwater habitats crucial for the survival and reproduction of these species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The final straw for Pablo Pantoja, who worked for the RNC in the 2010 and 2012 elections before quitting last summer, was apparently the new, flawed Heritage Foundation study on the cost of immigration, co-authored by Jason Richwine who previously wrote that \\"No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach IQ parity with whites.\\"      The Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald picked up on the Monday email from Pantoja, which is being circulated by the state's wing of the Democratic party (of course). It was originally posted to the blog of a friend of Pantoja, who notes that the new Democrat is also a National Guardsman who served in Iraq and Kuwait.

A researcher included as part of a past dissertation his theory that “the totality of the evidence suggests a genetic component to group differences in IQ.” The researcher reinforces these views by saying “No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach IQ parity with whites, but the prediction that new Hispanic immigrants will have low-IQ children and grandchildren is difficult to argue against.”      Although the organization distanced themselves from those assertions, other immigration-related research is still padded with the same racist and eugenics-based innuendo. Some Republican leaders have blandly (if at all) denied and distanced themselves from this but it doesn’t take away from the culture within the ranks of intolerance. The pseudo-apologies appear to be a quick fix to deep-rooted issues in the Republican Party in hopes that it will soon pass and be forgotten.

Others subscribe to motivating people to action by stating, “In California, a majority of all Hispanic births are illegitimate.

Richwine wrote that the U.S. should use the term \\"skill-based\\" instead of IQ-based to \\"blunt the negative reaction.\\" Thus Richwine is able to provide the missing link between the oafish Donald Trump, who said at CPAC, \\"Why aren't we letting people in from Europe?\\" and more mainstream explanations of the controversy among conservatives over immigration. \\"It's going to be a much easier lift to solve the problem of high-skilled workers,\\" Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus said in February.      The most obvious problem with Heritage's study is its economic analysis, not social analysis. When CNBC's Larry Kudlow asked Robert Rector, the lead author of the Heritage study, whether it takes into account economic growth from immigration, Rector said, \\"No.\\" Rector he did hint that he agreed with his co-author's ideas about what kind of immigrants we should let in, saying high-skilled immigrants with higher education levels would bring in more tax revenue and take fewer government benefits. Richwine (pictured above) fretted in his Harvard thesis that these immigrants would never fit in because of their tiny brains:      The average IQ of immigrants in the United States is substantially lower than that of the white native population, and the difference is likely to persist over several generations. The consequences are a lack of socioeconomic assimilation among low-IQ immigrant groups, more underclass behavior, less social trust, and an increase in the proportion of unskilled workers in the American labor market.      The idea that Latinos won't assimilate because they're doomed to low IQs for generations is offensive. But so what? More important, it's wrong. At least half of the variation in IQ is inherited, The Wall Street Journal explained in January, but scientists haven't figured out which genes affect IQ. And even more important for today's political debate, Latinos are assimilating. The New York Times's David Leonhardt explained in April that Latinos are assimilating at about the same rate as earlier immigrant groups — they're \\"the New Italians,\\" he said. As with Italians, a huge wave of Latinos immigrated here poor, poorly educated, and culturally different. But they become richer and better educated with each generation. RAND Corporation economist James P. Smith found that the average Latino immigrant has a junior high education, but the average Latino immigrant's kid goes to college for almost a year, and the average Latino immigrant's grandkid stays in college longer.      At Reuters, Reihan Salam points out that many people do not call themselves Hispanic, despite their parent or grandparent having been born in a Spanish-speaking country. The vast majority of Mexican-, Cuban-, Dominican-, Chinese-, and Filipino-Americans and Puerto Ricans have two grandparents or less who were born in those countries. The high rate of intermarriage, The American Prospect's Jamelle Bouie writes, could mean that as with Italians before them, it's likely Latinos' old national distinctions will disappear until they're just called \\"white.\\" By then, there will probably be some other group whose collective IQ the Heritage Foundation is worried about.      Update: The Heritage Foundation emails this statement from vice president of communications Mike Gonzalez: \\"This is not a work product of The Heritage Foundation. Its findings in no way reflect the positions of The Heritage Foundation.

The source says Weinstein argued that his sexual harassment scandal would blow over, but directors, including brother Robert Weinstein, disagreed.

Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, are trying to distance themselves from him and making charity donations equivalent to his campaign donations.

They say he made matters worse for himself by offering a narcissistic apology while also threatening to sue the New York Times for exposing his behavior. \\"This was his one opportunity to speak to victims,\\" says crisis PR expert Richard Levick. \\"It was one of the worst written apologies I've ever seen in a crisis situation.\\" John Oliver slammed Weinstein and his apology on his Sunday night show, Mediaite reports.

Summarize this article: Authorities are still trying to determine the cause of the fire in Greeleyville, South Carolina, but early findings suggest it was not arson. The FBI is investigating several fires at black churches in recent days. At least three of those blazes were intentionally set, officials say. However, officials said there is no evidence as of yet that the fires are linked. After hearing the news, Eddie Woods Jr, a local councilman, rushed to the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal church late Tuesday. \\"That was a tough thing to see,\\" Mr Woods told the AP news agency. \\"It is hurting those people again. But we're going to rebuild. If this was someone, they need to know that hate won't stop us again.\\" White supremacists first started burning down churches in the 1820s in order to terrorise black communities. Places of worship were deliberately targeted because blacks regarded them as sanctuaries and safe havens. In the south, this vicious tactic became commonplace in the aftermath of the American Civil War and during the civil-rights era of the '50s and '60s. Even in the 1990s, President Bill Clinton grew so concerned by a spate of hate crimes targeting black churches that he established the National Church Arson Task Force. It was in 1995 that members of the KKK burned to the ground Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal, in Greeleyville, South Carolina. Though the latest church fire may have been caused by a thunderstorm, at least three of the church fires since the Charleston massacre have been deliberate acts of arson. Though there is no evidence that these attacks have been coordinated, they will raise fears that angry whites are retaliating following moves to lower the Confederate flag across the American south. No one was in hurt in the fire and investigators plan to return to the scene on Wednesday. Authorities in South Carolina cautioned that a storm that swept through the area on Tuesday night may have been the cause. But others suspected arson because the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal church has been targeted before. In 1995, members of the Ku Klux Klan burned the church to the ground. It was one of a number of racially motivated attacks on black churches in the mid-1990s. The church was rebuilt and then-President Bill Clinton commemorated its reopening. The fires came about a week after nine black churchgoers were shot and killed in Charleston, South Carolina in what police called a racially motivated attack. The tragedy has reignited debate about race relations and sparked a backlash against the Confederate flag.

Q:Title: DRBT50 on a Mac Product review: these are no doubt, the most awesome headphones if you have to wear them for extended periods of time, and enjoy quality sound. my only problem has nothing to do with the headphones themselves, but my mac. i was able to pair them very easily, but the sound was terribly mono. after some research i found that mac doesn't support stereo bluetooth connections.... WHAT? it's called A2DP. that's what gives you the 2-channel stereo sound. so to get these to sound right on a mac, you gotta download third-party software.i'm not going to suggest any certain supplier on this forum, but a simple web search will find what you are looking for. my software only cost 20. but figure that into the cost when buying for mac. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review depicts the product in a predominantly flattering light, with some unflattering elements pertaining to compatibility issues with Mac systems rather than any inherent problems with the product itself.  The reviewer begins by praising the headphones, characterizing them as \\"the most awesome\\" when one needs to use them for extended periods and values sound quality. They are presented as comfortable to wear and providing superior audio, which fundamentally are the key qualities anyone would look for in a set of headphones. They also mention the ease of pairing the headphones, further adding to the product's positive attributes. The main criticism from the reviewer doesn't actually pertain to the product itself but rather to the perceived limitations of the Mac operating system. The possibility of a Mac not supporting stereo Bluetooth connections leads the reviewer to express disappointment, given they mention that it comes as a surprise that Mac doesn't support A2DP profiles for Bluetooth, which is crucial for superior, 2-channel stereo sound. While this point is nominally a critique, it indirectly speaks to the headphones' advanced capabilities that require such a high-level Bluetooth support. Further, the reviewer offers a solution in the form of third-party software that makes it possible for the headphones to work as expected with the Mac.  However, they also note that this software does add an additional cost to using the headphones with a Mac, subtly suggesting that potential Mac users need to be aware of this while considering purchasing this product. In conclusion, while there are certain negative aspects in the review, they are overwhelmingly offset by the reviewer's high praise for the comfort, sound quality, and pairing ease of the DRBT50. The negatives are also largely associated with the Mac system rather than the headphones themselves, so the product comes out as overall quite favorably depicted."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: On Tuesday, the Lufkin Police Department released a video with highlights from a 33-year-old woman’s 23-minute run from police after she slipped her handcuffs and stole an LPD patrol unit from the Ulta parking lot Saturday afternoon.      The 100-mph chase ended in Zavalla after a Texas Department of Public Safety troop used a pursuit intervention technique maneuver to make her lose control of the vehicle,      Toscha Fay Sponsler, of Pollok, is still being held in the Angelina County Jail on a first-degree escape causing serious bodily injury or threat of a deadly weapon charge, a first-degree aggravated assault against a public servant charge, a state-jail felony possession of a controlled substance less than 1 gram charge, a state-jail felony evading arrest with a vehicle with a previous conviction charge, and a state-jail felony unauthorized use of a motor vehicle charge. Collectively, Sponsler’s bail amount was set at 18,000.      According to a Jessica Pebsworth, a spokeswoman for the Lufkin Police Department, Sponsler ran away on foot when Lufkin PD officers responded to Ulta on a call of a suspicious person/possible shoplifter.      The officers took Sponsler into custody near the intersection of South First Street and Loop 287 and drove her back to Ulta, where she eventually slipped her cuffs while the two officers searched her belongings, Pebsworth said.      At that point in the video, Sponsler can be seen climbing through a window partition. She then allegedly stole the patrol unit and nearly backed in to the LPD officers. According to the Lufkin Police Department, she then drove off on Loop 287.      The two officers called for additional help, which soon led to a high-speed chase, involving the Angelina County Sheriff's Office, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Texas Parks and Wildlife, and the Zavalla Police Department.      The chase reached speeds of up to 100 mph and went all the way to Zavalla.      “Throughout the chase, officers could see the 33-year-old Pollok woman reaching for the officer’s shotgun, which was mechanically locked to the vehicle,” Pebsworth said. “During the 100-mph chase, Sponsler nearly went head on with two Lufkin Police units and Constable Chad Wilson.”      A DPS trooper used a PIT maneuver to cause the stolen Lufkin PD unit to spin out of control near the intersection of State Highway 63 and U.S. Highway 69 South. Sponsler left the raod and crashed into a tree and a light pole at 6:03 p.m. Saturday. An ambulance was called to the scene to check her out, and she was taken to the county jail after she waived further medical treatment.      Sponsler was found to be in possession of a felony amount of methamphetamine after her arrest, Pebsworth said.      The Lufkin PD Tahoe sustained heavy damage in the crash, and it will likely be totaled, Pebsworth said.      Lufkin Assistant Police Chief David Thomas said Tuesday that an internal review of the incident is ongoing.      The two officers called for additional help, which soon led to a high-speed chase, involving the Angelina County Sheriff's Office, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Texas Parks and Wildlife, and the Zavalla Police Department.      “During the initial review, we determined that limiting the size of the partition window in its open position could prevent this from occurring in the future if the locking mechanism fails or is not engaged,” Thomas said.

Police report that the call that originated this incident was for a suspicious person and/or possible shoplifter at Ulta.      Sponsler left the store on foot and eventually was put under arrest near South First at Loop 287.      She was handcuffed behind her back and buckled up in the back of a police unit to be taken to jail when she slipped out of one of the handcuffs, was able to get out of the seatbelt and climbed through the vehicle's sliding partition window.      After getting through the window, Sponsler gained access to the driver's seat.      While she was trying to escape, officers were standing behind the car, searching through a backpack and purse Sponsler had tried to ditch when the police vehicle almost backed into them and drove away.      The suspect led police units on a chase down Loop 287 at Tulane to Whitehouse and to various other roads at speeds that reached roughly 100 mph, almost making a head-on collision with two Lufkin officers, Constable Chad Wilson and several other drivers.      Police officers reported seeing her continuously reaching and fumbling for the officer's shotgun, which is mechanically locked inside the unit.      Multiple law enforcement agencies joined the chase with DPS leading them.      Shortly after, troopers used a pursuit intervention technique maneuver to spin Sponsler out close to state Highway 63 at the 69 south intersection.      Sponsler then left the road and crashed into a tree at 6:03 p.m..      A medical unit was called out to the scene, but Sponsler declined further medical treatment before she was taken to jail.      Law enforcement officials found Sponsler in possession of a felony amount of methamphetamine after she was arrested will charge her additionally with escape, evading on foot, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, possession of a controlled substance and aggravated assault of a police officer.      The police unit, a Tahoe, was damaged heavily and is likely totaled.      No one was hurt during the chase and police say that the incident will be further reviewed to make sure the best practices were met.      The incident is still under investigation.      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      UPDATE: The police chase in Lufkin has ended after the female suspect crashed the vehicle and was caught by officials from the Lufkin Police Department on U.S. 69 South just before Main Street in Zavala.

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter. Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Bolten, Cheney and Bush\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who was a part of this conversation?\\"? Available options:  a). no;  b). yes;","output":"b). yes; The correct answer is \\"yes\\" because the paragraph mentions a conversation that involved Joshua Bolten (White House Deputy Chief of Staff), Vice President Cheney, and President Bush. Bolten suggested that the Vice President (Cheney) should get in touch with the President (Bush) to confirm the engage order. Later, the paragraph states that the Vice President called the President at 10:18 for a two-minute conversation. So, all three of them, Bolten, Cheney, and Bush, were a part of this conversation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the answer for the question: Where was the long sea voyage? from the following article ?  The film tells a fictionalized version of the Pilgrims' voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to North America aboard the Mayflower. During the long sea voyage, Capt. Christopher Jones falls in love with Dorothy Bradford, the wife of William Bradford. The love triangle is resolved in a tragic way at the film's conclusion.  Ship's carpenter John Alden -- said to be the first person to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620—catches the eye of Priscilla Mullins, one of the young Pilgrims following William Bradford.  Alden ultimately wins Priscilla in another, if subtler, triangle with Miles Standish.   Lloyd Bridges provides comic relief as the first-mate Coppin, and child star Tommy Ivo gives a touching performance as young William Button, the only passenger to die on the actual voyage across the storm-swept Atlantic, who, according to this film, wanted to be the first to sight land and to become a king in the New World. \\"I'm going to be the first to see land.

Throat cancer is a general term, but it is often used to refer to cancer of the:      Pharynx, a hollow tube between the nose and esophagus (swallowing tube) that includes the:      Nasopharynx: The upper section, which is behind the nose      Oropharynx: The middle section, which is behind the mouth      Hypopharynx: The bottom section, which is behind the voice box (larynx)      Larynx, also called the voice box, which is the part of the throat containing the vocal cords that help you speak. The larynx has three parts:      Glottis: The middle portion that contains the vocal cords      Supraglottis: The area above the vocal cords      Subglottis: The area below the vocal cords and above the trachea (windpipe)      Approximately half the cases of throat cancer are found in each of the larynx and pharynx. The number of new cases of smoking-related cancers, such as cancer of the larynx and many cancers of the pharynx, is declining.      The number of new oropharynx cancers is increasing, however, because of a relatively new cause of this disease, human papillomavirus (HPV). Patients with HPV-related oropharynx cancer are less likely to smoke and may have a better outlook than patients with smoking-related oropharynx cancer.      Throat Cancer Types      Most throat cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. This means they develop in the squamous cells that line the throat.      Other less frequent types of throat cancer include cancers of the minor salivary glands.       ||||| MARYSVILLE — Kristine Moore got a new lease on life thanks to her daily potato chip habit.Her habit — “I've eaten Ruffles potato chips every day of my life for the past 20 years. It's a staple of my lunch,” she said — led to an early diagnosis of throat cancer.Say what you will about the nutritional value in chips, Moore owes a debt of gratitude to a sharp fragment of a chip that poked her tonsil Feb. 28.“I must not have chewed it up enough, because Ruffles have ridges,” Moore said.The next day, she felt as if she were coming down with something. Her husband, Bob Metcalfe, took a look and said she needed to see a doctor.“He said, ‘Boy oh boy, your tonsil is inflamed and it looks like it has sores on it,' ” she said.She went to a walk-in clinic and was referred to the Everett Clinic, where they tested her for strep (it came back negative). But the doctor didn't like what she saw and took a biopsy then and there.The results came back abnormal, so a larger sample was taken, and Moore was scheduled for a CT scan while they waited for the results.The scan and second biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil: a tumor the size of a quarter in her throat.The disease is one of several that can be classified as throat cancers. According to the Mayo Clinic , smoking is considered a significant risk factor for developing the disease, as is excessive alcohol intake, human papilloma virus, a diet lacking in fruits and vegetables and gastroesophageal reflux disease.Moore was a smoker until she received her diagnosis. Then she quit cold turkey.“My husband and daughter have been nagging at me,” she said. “And my mother, April 30 she would have been gone a year. She had quit smoking for 25 years and still came down with lung cancer.”Her older sister also was recently diagnosed with esophageal cancer.“I'm more worried about her than I am for myself,” Moore said.Moore's cancer hadn't spread, and for that, she is thankful. Catching the disease this early means her prognosis is good.Aside from the soreness she had the day after her potato chip incident — from which it turned out there was no chip fragment lodged in her throat — she said she's felt fine.Metcalfe said his wife hasn't shown any real emotion yet, and they're still meeting with doctors and surgeons to plan her treatment.“The doctor said that without that potato chip it (her cancer) wouldn't have even shown up for another year,” he said.Moore admits to feeling apprehensive as she prepares for treatment. On Monday she went to the dentist for a cleaning and prep for her cancer treatment, “because radiation really does a number on your teeth,” she said.“I'm overwhelmed,” Moore said. “Yesterday I wanted everybody to leave me alone.”That includes her ebullient husband, who encourages her to tell the potato chip story, and even contacted Frito-Lay, the maker of Ruffles, to see if they were interested.The company sent her a couple of T-shirts and several coupons for free chips, Moore said.Next week she goes into the hospital to have a feeding tube put in, as well as a port in her chest for a new drug she'll take to reduce the chance the radiotherapy causes sores in her mouth and esophagus.“I'm going to be a guinea pig!” she said.Then starting April 25, she starts chemotherapy and radiation treatments at Providence Regional Cancer Partnership in Everett.“The light at the end of the tunnel is that they're thinking I'm going to be A-OK come August,” she said.She also wants to be well enough to attend daughter Monica's graduation from Marysville Pilchuck High School in June. Monica Metcalfe has been accepted into Everett Community College's nursing program.“She's a certified nursing assistant so this will be good practice to her,” Moore said.She hopes that she won't have to give up her chip habit, but she also knows the feeding tube is there for a reason, if her treatment makes her too sick to eat.“I thought I could be tough, I said, ‘I can eat, I can eat,' ” Moore said.Her doctors convinced her that might not happen, however.“Gosh darn it. I opened up a fresh bag today,” she said.Chris Winters: 425-374-4165; cwinters@heraldnet.com .

There are two main parts of the throat that can get cancer, one is called the larynx, which helps you talk, and the other is called the pharynx, which is like a hollow tube behind your nose and mouth. In 2015, about 39,500 people in the United States were found to have throat cancer. One thing that can cause throat cancer is called human papillomavirus or HPV. Another kind of throat cancer, which is caused by smoking, is becoming less common because fewer people smoke now. One lady in Washington found out she had throat cancer when a potato chip got stuck in her throat and caused her throat to hurt. She went to the doctor, and that's when they found out she had cancer. She had caught it early, which means that there is a very good chance that the doctors will be able to help her get better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: \\"What did Percy write in Geneva?\\"  Context: \\"In 1816 Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Shelley visited Geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings. During these visits Shelley wrote the poem \\"Mont Blanc\\", Byron wrote \\"The Prisoner of Chillon\\" and the dramatic poem Manfred, and Mary Shelley, who found the scenery overwhelming, conceived the idea for the novel Frankenstein in her villa on the shores of Lake Geneva in the midst of a thunderstorm. When Coleridge travelled to Chamonix, he declaimed, in defiance of Shelley, who had signed himself \\"Atheos\\" in the guestbook of the Hotel de Londres near Montenvers, \\"Who would be, who could be an atheist in this valley of wonders\\". By the mid-19th century scientists began to arrive en masse to study the geology and ecology of the region.\\"  Answer:","output":"Percy Bysshe Shelley, a prominent Romantic poet, wrote the poem \\"Mont Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni\\" during his visit to Geneva in 1816. His journey to Switzerland, accompanied by his wife Mary Shelley and renowned poet Lord Byron, played a significant role in inspiring the works of all three literary figures. The breathtaking landscape and picturesque sights of the region impacted the artistic expressions of these writers, often becoming the backdrop or core of their creative endeavors. \\"Mont Blanc,\\" which Shelley completed during the summer of the same year, is remarkable for its vivid depiction of the alpine environment and the power of natural forces. The poem consists of 144 lines and captures the immensity of Mont Blanc - the highest peak in the Alps. Shelley's observations of the mountainous terrain and the Arve River inspired him to explore themes and ideas prevalent in Romantic poetry, such as the relationship between human beings and the natural world, the role of imagination, and the concept of the sublime. As seen in \\"Mont Blanc,\\" Shelley engages with a contemplation of the awe-inspiring power of nature and the insignificance of human life in the grand scheme of things. The poem also reflects Shelley's passion for social justice and emancipation, as well as his rebellious spirit against established norms and structures. Through his vivid portrayal of Mont Blanc's sublime features, Shelley emphasizes the importance of individual thought and imagination in transcending the constraints of societal expectations. The influential visit to Geneva not only affected Percy Shelley's work but also inspired Mary Shelley to conceive the idea for her most famous novel, \\"Frankenstein,\\" and Lord Byron to pen both \\"The Prisoner of Chillon\\" and his dramatic poem \\"Manfred.\\" The landscapes of the Lake Geneva region had a lasting impact on these authors, as their literary masterpieces attest. Moreover, the beauty of the Alpine valley and its natural wonders captivated other contemporaries. As noted in the provided context, upon arriving in Chamonix, Coleridge could not help but express the impossibility of being an atheist amidst such wondrous surroundings. By the mid-19th century, the area became a hub for scientists who sought to study its geology, ecology, and other fascinating characteristics. In conclusion, Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote the poem \\"Mont Blanc\\" during his time in Geneva, which stands as an extraordinary example of how the sublime landscape of the region inspired artists, writers, and scientists of the time. This visit to Switzerland influenced the creative output and philosophical perspectives of the three famous literary personalities, contributing to the rich legacy of Romantic literature and enriching our understanding of the interconnectedness between human beings and the natural world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Niehause played for a club from Seattle.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Steve Niehause played for a club from Seattle, specifically the Seattle Seahawks, based on the provided context. The context shares several pieces of information that support this hypothesis, which we can outline as follows: 1. Steve Niehause was a defensive lineman in the NFL. This gives us an understanding of his role and the league in which he played, which is the National Football League (NFL). 2. He was the first-ever draft pick for the Seattle Seahawks. Being the first-ever draft pick means that he was the inaugural player selected by the Seahawks to join their team. The context also states that he was the second player taken in the 1976 NFL Draft, further substantiating his association with the NFL and the Seattle Seahawks. This is a strong piece of evidence that Niehause played for a club from Seattle, as the Seattle Seahawks are the only NFL team based in Seattle. 3. Niehaus was the 1976 NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. This achievement supports the fact that he played at a professional level during that time. NFC stands for the National Football Conference, one of the two conferences in the NFL, which also indicates his association with the league. 4. He holds the Seahawk rookie record for sacks in a season with 9½.

Summarize this article: Associated Press      By Erik Holm and Anupreeta Das      Pigs aren’t flying, lambs aren’t lying down with lions, and hell isn’t getting any cooler. But Warren Buffett is joining Twitter.      (It’s official. Buffett published his first tweet at 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time.)      Warren is in the house. — Warren Buffett (@WarrenBuffett) May 2, 2013      Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. who once admitted he didn’t know how to check his voicemail, is being dragged into the social-media age by his friends at Fortune. He’s sitting down for an interview with the magazine at noon for a panel called “Warren Buffett on Women and Work…and other Wisdom.”      The magazine is billing it as his first-ever interview to incorporate social media. And in preparation for the big day, Buffett’s assistant revealed the billionaire investor is setting up a Twitter account and will author his first tweet at some point today.      And she confirmed that existing Twitter accounts purporting to be Buffett, including one that’s been telling over 127,000 followers to “stay tuned” for news since 2009, are all bogus.      With powerful friends like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates able to retweet pronouncements from the Oracle of Omaha, expect Buffett’s follower count to climb quickly in the days ahead.      Buffett’s foray into the Twittersphere is notable in part because of his professed aversion to technology. He once said he missed a message about a potential deal to bail out Lehman Bros. before it collapsed because he didn’t know how to check the voicemail on his cell phone. For years, he repeatedly declined Gates’ attempts to send someone over to set up a computer in his home. And he still doesn’t have a computer on his desk at his office.      But signing up for a Twitter account is no guarantee that Buffett will become a regular and sustained user of the micro-blogging service. Carl Icahn launched a blog to chronicle his thoughts on corporate governance, and even hired a reporter from Reuters to contribute, but the project lasted for less than a year. The site, called The Icahn Report, hasn’t been updated since 2009.      But Buffett’s folksy aphorisms seem like they could be a good fit for Twitter. As Buffett once (almost) said: “B fearful when others r greedy. B greedy when others r fearful. #WordsToLiveBy” ||||| Hopefully this means we'll hear from the Oracle of Omaha on a more regular and informal basis.      Buffett has established himself as the most successful investor in history.      And he has never kept his investing methods secret.      In fact, when he shares his tips, he often does so in an approachable and entertaining manner.      So, as we get ready for this week's annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, we reflect on some of Buffett's best investing quips.      We compiled a few of Buffett's best quotes from his TV appearances, newspaper op-eds, magazine interviews, and of course his annual letters, which are always-must reads.      Investing novices and experts alike can learn from the advice that the he has articulated through the years.      If we've missed any of your favorites, let us know in the comments. ||||| Updated to include Warren Buffett's first and hopefully not last, Tweet.      NEW YORK (TheStreet) - Warren Buffett, the 82-year old head of investing conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has joined Twitter, countering some notions that the 'Oracle of Omaha' and International Business Machines (IBM) investor has little tech savvy.      At a Thursday afternoon Fortune Magazine panel titled \\"Warren Buffett on Women and Work...and other Wisdom,\\" Buffett made his first ever Tweet.      \\"Warren is in the house,\\" Buffett wrote, using handle @WarrenBuffett.      \\"It means my family can no longer say I am lodged in the 19th century,\\" Buffett said of his first Tweet, on a Fortune Magazine streaming panel discussion with Pattie Sellers.      \\"It's pretty daring but I'll try,\\" Buffett said as he was about to Tweet. \\"Does it bite?\\"      \\"We have set up an account,\\" Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's assistant said in a brief phone interview withearlier on Thursday.      Bosanek had said Buffett's first tweet would center on thepanel on women and an article Buffett wrote, which is featured on Fortune.com      \\"I believe the first one will be about this article,\\" Bosanek said. She also cautionedthat all other accounts claiming to be Warren Buffett are fake.      \\"Any accounts out there that purport to be Warren Buffett are bogus,\\" Bosanek said.      Joining Twitter may help Buffett counter reports he is decidedly tech unsavvy. Some media reports say Buffett doesn't have a computer in his Berkshire Hathaway office, whole others have noted the 'Oracle of Omaha's' problems with cell phones and voicemail.      Berkshire Hathaway has also avoided investing in tech sector giants likeand. Buffett has claimed he isn't able to fully evaluate such stocks.      Buffett's introduction to Twitter comes just ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 4.      \\"It is really going to be a good one this year,\\" Bosanek said of the meeting, while advising investors to bring a coat as a result of unseasonably cold weather. \\"Everything else will be perfect.\\"      Buffett's handle @WarrenBuffett gained nearly 10,000 followers within minutes of the 'Oracle's' first Tweet. His account was verified on the social network within about 15 minutes and now carries a blue checkmark.      Buffett's account states he is Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and provides a link to the company's website      Already, Buffett and his assistant Bosanek have a notable presence on the social network, which allows authors to make posts in 140-character increments and post links, photos and videos.      President Barack Obama used an op/ed written by Buffett in thecomparing his about 17% income tax rate as a billionaire to Bosanek's tax rate of over 30% to describe why millionaires and billionaires aren't paying their fair share of taxes.      Obama subsequently coined a piece of legislation called the Buffett Rule, which has taken off on Twitter under hashtag #BuffettRule.      On April 9, President Obama referenced Buffett in a tweet advocating a higher tax rate for top income earners. Obama used the #BuffettRule hashtag.      \\"RT if you agree: Congress should pass the #BuffettRule next week so middle-class families don't pay a higher tax rate than millionaires,\\" Obama wrote, in a tweet that was favorited 208 times and retweeted 5,218 times.      To be seen is whether President Obama and Buffett will follow each other on Twitter or whether retweets will come with more frequency.      Others have used Twitter to promote Buffett and Berkshire's upcoming shareholder meeting.      \\"Berkshire annual meeting or Kentucky Derby Day... For me, Berkshire by 10 lengths,\\" Mario Gabelli, head of GAMCO Investors, wrote on |||||","output":"A famous man named Warren Buffett, who is very good at making money, has decided to join a website called Twitter. People were surprised because he didn't use computers a lot, but now he can talk to his friends and tell them his thoughts online. Warren Buffett is important because he knows how to make businesses grow, and now people can follow him on Twitter to listen to his ideas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Angela was very happy..","output":"In the end, Angela was very happy. Rachel and Angela had been best friends since childhood, practically living in each other's houses as they grew up. They shared countless memories together, from the playground games they used to play, to the secrets they whispered to each other through the night during their sleepovers. Their bond was more than just friendship; it was sisterhood. When Rachel announced her engagement to her longtime boyfriend, Kyle, Angela was overjoyed for her best friend. She had witnessed their love blossom over the years and could not think of a more perfect couple. It was no surprise when Rachel asked Angela to take on the role of bridesmaid, a request met with tears and a fervent nod of affirmation. As the months went by, Angela found herself fully immersed in the world of bridal showers, dress fittings, and venue scouting. She accompanied Rachel on every step of the journey, providing her unwavering support and love. They spent hours laughing together over wedding mishaps and shared quiet moments reflecting on the significance of this new chapter in Rachel's life. Despite their joy, Angela couldn't help but notice her friend's anxiety levels increasing as the wedding date drew nearer. The planning, the pressure to make everything perfect – it was all beginning to take its toll on Rachel. That's when Angela decided to step up her game. She became Rachel's rock, her confidante, and her ultimate support system. Angela took on the role of fielding calls from vendors and chasing down last-minute details, all the while ensuring Rachel felt calm and collected throughout the process. The bride-to-be was immensely grateful for Angela's ability to turn difficult situations into lighthearted moments, with laughter being the biggest remedy. Finally, the day of the wedding arrived. The sun shone brightly, casting a warm glow over the garden venue. Family and friends gathered under the rustic wooden arch covered in roses, eagerly anticipating the nuptial ceremony. As Rachel stood in her breathtaking gown waiting to make her entrance, she could not help but glance over to Angela, standing by her side. A reassuring smile graced Angela's face, beaming with joy and pride for her sister-like friend. In that moment, Rachel felt her nerves dissipate, replaced by pure happiness and the knowledge that Angela was there beside her. The ceremony was nothing short of magical, with heartfelt vows and tearful \\"I do's\\" exchanged under the sunlit sky. As Angela delivered an elegant and heartfelt speech at the reception, Rachel was reminded of how thankful she was to have such a loyal and caring friend. A friendship that would never waver and would continue to grow just like the love between Rachel and her new husband. In the end, Angela was very happy – not just for being a part of Rachel's special day, but because she had been able to stand by Rachel's side, offering love, support, and a bond that transcended friendship. The wedding, after all, was not only a celebration of romantic love, but also a celebration of a strong and unwavering friendship that would last a lifetime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unmanned boats and submarines will travel 500km (300 miles) across an area off the southwestern tip of the UK. The aim is to test new technologies and to map marine life in a key fishing ground. In total, seven autonomous machines are being released in a trial heralded as a new era of robotic research at sea. Two of the craft are innovative British devices that are designed to operate for months using renewable sources of power including wind and wave energy. The project, led by the National Oceanography Centre, involves more than a dozen research centres and specialist companies. Marine robots come in a variety of strange shape and sizes, and no fewer than four different types are being deployed in this project, part of a new generation of devices designed to make marine research far cheaper and easier than with large crewed vessels. Autonaut: Powered by wave action and solar panels, Autonaut looks like a canoe with an aerial on top. It bobs on the surface and provides a platform for instruments. The result of a partnership between a management consultant and a former Royal Navy commodore, Autonaut was designed and built by MOST in Chichester. C-Enduro: Distinctively shaped with an in-built wind turbine reminiscent of an air-boat, C-Enduro is designed to operate on its own for up to three months. A diesel motor provides back-up power.  Instruments record water and weather data, and a winch can lower sensors below the surface. The machine is designed and built by ASV in Portchester in Hampshire. Waveglider: The Waveglider involves twin elements, one floating on the surface, the other being a system of miniature blades dangling underwater and harvesting energy. Billed as ideal for operating \\"for years at sea with no fuel, emissions or crew\\", the US makers have now turned out more than 100 units. Slocum Glider: Named after Joshua Slocum, the first solo round-the-world sailor, this American device looks like a torpedo. It dives and rises through the water with a system of variable buoyancy. Every time it surfaces, the glider can relay information by satellite and pick up new instructions. Chief scientist Dr Russell Wynn told BBC News: \\"This is the first time we've deployed this range of vehicles carrying all these instruments. \\"And it's exciting that it's the first time we can measure everything in the water column and all the life in the ocean simultaneously. \\"The ability to measure the temperature or the weather at the ocean surface, or dolphins and seabirds with the cameras on the vehicles - no-one's ever been able to do that at the same time hundreds of miles from the shore.\\" Data about the oceans is usually gathered by a combination of satellites, buoys and research ships, but all three have limitations in their coverage, and large crewed vessels are particularly expensive. The motivation for exploring the use of massed robotic vehicles is to assess whether they can provide near-constant coverage at far lower cost - the equivalent of CCTV offering round-the-clock surveillance. The target for the deployment is an area of ocean marking the boundary between Atlantic waters and tidal waters from the English Channel - what's known as an ocean front. Fronts like this usually create upwelling that brings nutrients from the seabed towards the surface and encourages plankton to thrive. That in turn attracts fish, whales, dolphins and porpoises. Most of the craft are being deployed from the Isles of Scilly for a three-week traverse of the ocean. The exact route of the journey is being withheld to avoid the risk of anyone interfering with the experiment. Instruments will record key parameters of the ocean, ranging from the concentrations of plankton to the clicks and whistles of dolphins and porpoises. Cameras on the surface vehicles will also attempt to capture images of seabirds and other marine life. According to Dr Wynn, the UK's 700,000 sq km of waters are highly productive as fishing grounds but the processes at work in them remain unclear. \\"Actually understanding how that sea works and how the animals are distributed is a real challenge if you've only got a small number of ships and a few buoys dotted around. \\"Having a fleet of vehicles that can go out, without humans on board, controlled by satellite, really gives us a chance to transform our ability to monitor the ocean. \\"At the moment a lot of decisions about how we manage the oceans are based on very few data - relatively simple things like where do dolphins and seabirds go to feed? We actually have very little information on that.\\" Until now, companies developing robotic vehicles for use at sea have focused on military and commercial customers such as the US Navy and oil and gas companies, and American firms have dominated the market for automated submarines. The British government's hope is that the UK may become a leader in unmanned surface machines - robotic boats - which can act as drones gathering information to help weather forecasters or do conservation work. Ministers have identified robotics as one of the \\"eight great technologies\\" that can help rebalance the country's economy and drive growth. Funding has allowed the National Oceanography Centre to support two UK companies, MOST and ASV, in developing their AutoNaut and C-Enduro robotic boats that are on trial now. The first phase of the deployment is planned to end in three weeks' time, when the vehicles will be retrieved from the ocean and the results analysed. Partners in the project include the universities of St Andrews and Exeter, Cefas, the Marine Biological Association, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, the British Oceanographic Data Centre, British Antarctic Survey, UK Met Office, Royal Navy and DSTL. Corporate partners include MOST, ASV, J&S, RS Aqua and Liquid Robotics. Summary:","output":"A fleet of autonomous boats and submarines are being tested in the UK to map marine life in a key fishing ground and monitor the ocean, potentially revolutionizing fisheries management and marine conservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film tells the story of Peter Parker struggling to balance his life as a college student, his relationship with Mary Jane, and his responsibilities as Spider-Man. During this journey, one of the main antagonists he faces is Dr. Otto Octavius, a brilliant and renowned scientist. Dr. Octavius undergoes a terrible accident while working on an experiment to create a renewable energy through fusion. The incident leads to the fusion of four mechanical tentacles to his spinal cord, granting him immense strength and control over these devices. Throughout the film, Octavius turns into the dangerous and mentally unstable Doctor Octopus, obsessed with recreating his failed experiment at any cost. Aunt May, Peter's loving and supportive guardian, finds herself in peril because of Doctor Octopus' actions. At one point in the film, Dr. Octavius kidnaps Aunt May, using her as a bargaining chip to force Spider-Man to bring him the tritium needed for his experiment. Spider-Man, knowing that Aunt May's life is at stake, fights Doctor Octopus to rescue her and ultimately save the day. Although Peter Parker (as Spider-Man) and his relationship with Mary Jane contribute to the complexity of the story and influence the overall plot, the primary cause of Aunt May's trouble in Spider-Man 2 is Dr. Otto Octavius, aka Doctor Octopus.

It was several moments before Seth could bring himself to believe that Dan and Bill Dean had utterly failed in their efforts to save Jip Collins from the would-be detective.  During the day he had given the matter comparatively little thought, believing that, having set out on their mission of mercy at such an early hour, his roommates would succeed in their efforts.

Even as a kid, I remember not liking it very much. I had some hope for the sequel though. I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better now than he was before. The film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain the kids but that's all. I realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. Lindsay Lohan was alright as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. He was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special. Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job. She tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder.

Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information, but they are related in a way that they deal with the perception and understanding of historical and present relations between Pakistan and India, which are two neighboring countries in South Asia. 1. Do all Pakistani people hate India? It would be incorrect and unfair to generalize that all Pakistani people hate India, as people's views and opinions on India would vary significantly based on their upbringing, personal experiences, knowledge of history, and political views. Both countries have had periods of conflict and shared historical experiences that may have contributed to negative sentiment among some people in both countries. However, it is important to remember that individual opinions cannot be generalized to the entire population of a nation. There are many Pakistani citizens who have maintained friendly relationships with their Indian counterparts. Some individuals from both countries have strong ties in the form of friends, families, and business associates across the border. The cultural and linguistic similarities between the two nations also contribute to shared experiences and mutual appreciation. Additionally, with the rise of social media and improved access to global communication, an increasing number of Indian and Pakistani youngsters are engaging in various dialogues and platforms to promote peace and understanding between the two countries. 2. I heard many Pakistani people saying that India did not exist before 1947. Is it true? The statement that \\"India did not exist before 1947\\" is not entirely true but can be contextualized to understand its meaning more accurately. The modern-day nations of India and Pakistan were created in 1947 as a result of the partition of British India, which led to the creation of two separate, independent nations primarily based on religious differences, India being predominantly Hindu and Pakistan being predominantly Muslim. India as a geographical region, consisting of cities, culture, and historical empires, has existed for thousands of years before 1947. The Indian subcontinent has a rich history, encompassing various cultures, religions, and empires. Historically, the region has been ruled by several empires and dynasties, like the Maurya, Gupta, Mughal, and British Empires. However, the political map of the region changed after the end of British colonial rule in 1947. It is this political map of India, consisting of its current borders, that one might argue did not exist before 1947. It is essential to differentiate between the geographical and historical existence of India and the modern political entity created after the partition. In conclusion, while there might be a variety of opinions and interpretations related to the history and the relationship between India and Pakistan, it is crucial to consider the diverse range of perspectives and individual experiences. It is also important to recognize the shared history, culture, and opportunities for collaboration and peace between the people of the two countries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can use this background: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  Now, I have a new situation: The inuit tribe lived and hunted on the shores of the Arctic ocean., very close to the North pole. The weather there was very cold throughout the year.

She was born on July 22, 1992, to Ricardo Joel Gomez and Mandy Teefey, who themselves were involved in the entertainment industry. Her full name is Selena Marie Gomez. Grand Prairie, a part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, is located in the central region of Texas. This city lies in the vicinity of the popular metropolitan areas of Dallas and Fort Worth, which could have influenced Selena's early interest in the entertainment business since these places have lively arts and cultural scenes. Furthermore, Grand Prairie has been home to several famous musicians and actors, adding to the city's rich cultural heritage. Selena Gomez first gained recognition as a child when she appeared on the children's television series, Barney & Friends. This early start gave her a platform to showcase her talents and subsequently led to her breakthrough role as Alex Russo on the Disney Channel's successful show, Wizards of Waverly Place. Throughout her career, she has appeared in numerous films, television shows, and has produced multiple chart-topping albums. Selena Gomez's birthplace, Grand Prairie, Texas, can be regarded as the beginning of her journey and has played an important role in her life.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Hello! Let me explain this in a simple way. Question 1: Can kinetic friction and static friction coexist? Kinetic friction is the force that resists the movement of two surfaces sliding against each other when they are already moving. Static friction is the force that resists the movement of two surfaces when they are not moving but trying to move. Imagine you have a toy car. When it's standing still and you try to push it, the force that resists you from moving it is static friction. Once the car starts moving, the force that slows it down is kinetic friction. Now, kinetic and static friction cannot happen at the same time. That's because when the car is not moving, it's static friction acting, and when it's moving, it's kinetic friction acting. Question 2: Can kinetic and static friction coexist? This question is actually the same as Question 1. It's just asking whether kinetic and static friction can happen at the same time. So, to answer both questions: No, kinetic friction and static friction cannot coexist, because they happen at different times. Static friction acts when an object is not moving, and kinetic friction acts when the object is already moving."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By population, Southampton is the largest monocentric city in the South East England region and the second largest on the South Coast after Plymouth.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"Yes, based on the provided information, the age group with roughly twenty five percent of people in a random population draw would be the 20–24 age range.  Here's a breakdown of how the information leads to this conclusion: 1. The text states that there are 119,500 males and 117,400 females in the city, making the total population 236,900. 2. The most populous age range is 20–24, with 32,300 people in this group. 3. To find out the percentage of people in this age range, divide the number of people in this age group (32,300) by the total population (236,900), and multiply by 100: (32,300 / 236,900) * 100 = 13.63% The actual value is not exactly twenty five percent, but the 20–24 age range is indeed the most populous, so in a random population draw, it would have the highest likelihood of being selected. If we were to take the closest age group that has approximately 25% of the population, we would have to combine age groups. For example, combining the 20-24 age range (32,300) and the 25-29 age range (24,700) gives a total of 57,000 people.

HuffPo reports support for legalizing marijuana is at an all-time high, yet the ACLU says the government is spending 3.6 billion every year enforcing possession laws. Expand this summary.","output":"In 2014, over 1.5 million arrests were made for drug-related offenses in the United States, with 40% of those arrests being for simple marijuana possession, according to the FBI. This represents an increase after seven years of declining arrests. The Marijuana Policy Project spokesperson Mason Tvert expresses concern over this increase, as fewer people than ever believe that marijuana possession should be considered a crime. Tvert argues that law enforcement shouldn't be spending their time and resources on arresting and prosecuting adults for marijuana use.  In 2014, the police in the United States solved less than 65% of murder cases, 40% of rape cases, and 30% of property crimes and robbery cases. In contrast, approximately 620,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession during this time period. Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, states that there is no good reason for so much of the police force's time and taxpayer money to be spent on marijuana-related arrests, while many murder, rape, and robbery cases remain unsolved. Moreover, support for legalizing marijuana is at an all-time high, as reported by the Huffington Post. However, the ACLU claims that the US government still spends a staggering 3.6 billion every year to enforce possession laws. These figures underscore the growing gap between the priorities of law enforcement and the shifting attitudes of the American public towards marijuana possession. As public opinion on marijuana continues to evolve, a growing number of states have moved toward legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. Advocates for marijuana legalization maintain that it can provide medical relief and help to reduce opioid addiction. They also argue that resources spent on enforcing marijuana possession laws could be better used on more pressing matters, such as addressing violent crimes or investing in education and healthcare. In summary, the increase in arrests for marijuana possession in 2014, despite a general decline in public support for its criminalization, raises questions about the prioritization of law enforcement resources. As more Americans express support for marijuana legalization, there is a growing demand to redirect the 3.6 billion spent each year on enforcing possession laws to tackle more pressing issues such as violent and unsolved crimes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Selling cigarettes in unbranded packs seems to make tobacco less appealing and encourages smokers to quit, suggests a study.","output":"Title: Unbranded Packs: A Step Toward Reducing Smoking Rates and Encouraging Quitting Introduction Tobacco consumption remains one of the most pressing public health concerns worldwide, with millions of lives affected by the detrimental consequences of smoking annually. Governments and health organizations have attempted various strategies to tackle this issue and reduce smoking rates, including increasing taxation, implementing smoking cessation programs, and raising awareness about the negative health effects. A recent study has uncovered another potential approach: selling cigarettes in unbranded packs. According to the research, plain packaging appears to make tobacco less appealing to consumers and can encourage smokers to quit. This article will delve deeper into the findings of the study and explore how unbranded packs can contribute to the global effort of reducing tobacco use. The Study The research, conducted by a group of global researchers, aimed to understand the effects of unbranded packaging on the appeal of cigarette products and the motivation to quit among smokers. They examined the behavior and perceptions of smokers from various countries with varying levels of smoking prevalence and tobacco control policies. The study compared the reactions of participants exposed to plain, unbranded cigarette packs to those exposed to branded packs, following a consistent methodology to ensure the validity of the findings. Findings: Unbranded Packs Make Tobacco Less Appealing The study discovered that unbranded packs notably reduced the appeal of tobacco products among participants. Plain packaging led to negative perceptions about the cigarettes and made them appear less attractive compared to branded packs. Researchers attributed this change in perception to the absence of colors, logos, and other design elements that can create positive associations in the minds of smokers. Moreover, the study found that unbranded packaging influenced smokers' beliefs about the product's quality. Participants tended to perceive the tobacco in plain packs as being of lower quality and less satisfying when compared to the same product in a branded pack. These findings suggest that removing branding elements from cigarette packaging may disrupt the perceived value and satisfaction derived from smoking and could consequently discourage tobacco consumption. Encouraging Smokers to Quit One of the most significant discoveries of the study was the potential for unbranded packs to motivate smokers towards quitting. Participants exposed to plain packaging were more likely to consider quitting smoking. Researchers believe that the reduced appeal of tobacco products in unbranded packs can enhance the effectiveness of warning messages and other interventions designed to encourage smoking cessation. Unbranded Packs and Policy Implications Given the robust findings of this study, governments and health organizations should consider incorporating unbranded packaging into tobacco control policies. Australia was the first country to implement plain packaging in 2012, and several other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, and Ireland, have since followed suit. Researchers have observed a decline in smoking rates in these countries after the introduction of plain packaging. Conclusion The study's findings reaffirm the potential role of unbranded packs in reducing the appeal of tobacco products and encouraging smokers to quit. By eliminating the influence of branding and visual cues, plain packaging can alter smokers’ perceptions of tobacco, making it less attractive and appealing. Policymakers and health organizations should take note of these valuable insights and incorporate plain packaging as part of comprehensive strategies to tackle the global tobacco epidemic. The health and wellbeing of millions of people depend on the implementation of effective measures to curb smoking rates, and unbranded packs may serve as an essential tool in this fight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When you're having a problem with someone, first try talking to a person you trust; whether it's a significant other or just a friend, sometimes it's easy to do things that make the problem worse before you have the chance to make them better.  For example, if you're having a fight with your girlfriend because she thinks you cheated on her (even if you didn't), don't make the problem worse by spending a lot of time out being social with other girls. This will only make you look worse and make it harder to argue with her from the moral high ground. Instead, take a vacation from people until you work things out with her. Another example for a problem with a friend is if your best friend is mad at you for blowing off their party in order to spend time with someone else. In this situation, you'll want to avoid seeming distant or disinterested in their feelings. Instead, try to do something nice for them. Avoid arguing because it will only make the other person defensive. Instead, come to a solution for whatever the problem is that the two of you are having. Make sure you understand what's really bothering them first. Sometimes people seem mad about one thing but really they're mad about something else. If you want to really fix the problem, it's a good idea to make sure you're working on the right problem first. For example, your boyfriend might say that he's mad you decided to go to the big state school in the next town over instead of going to the local college with him. Of course, you'll still be able to see each other all the time and date without serious problems: what he's really worried about is that all that time off on your own will lead you to meet someone new. When you're fighting with someone it's easy to feel that you're right or your way of doing something is best. You're working with your own brain after all. However, people rarely argue with you just to be contrary. They're doing the best that they can with what they know and the situation might look very different from their perspective. Try seeing things from their side of the field in order to help you find a way to meet in the middle. Sometimes, if you're having a hard time understanding their perspective, it can be really helpful to just ask them. Ask them to explain, at length, why they think it would be better to take another route. Say something like: “Can you explain your thinking to me? I’d really like to know better.” By walking through their feelings and thought process, you can often gain a better understanding of the problem and how to solve it. When people feel disrespected or cornered, they will often become more argumentative and combative, even if they would normally agree with you. If you see a personal situation developing, try taking steps to make that person feel like they have more control and that they are respected. You will find that suddenly they are much more willing to talk.  For example, you'll want to dial back your language. Don't insult them or use accusatory language like \\"you should have ______\\". Instead, use “I” statements to express yourself. Say things like, “I felt hurt after out last conversation,” or, “I get upset when you talk to me like that.” Make them feel in control by giving them choices or options, as well as doing things like coming up with what they think is a fair solution to the problem. Once you've taken those basic first steps towards solving the problem, you should start really talking through a solution. Communication is key here and communication is more than just telling them what you think. You'll want to think before you speak, being careful to think about how what you say comes across. You'll also want to be a really good listener, really focusing on what they're saying and working to understand them.  For these serious, problem-solving conversations, you should generally set aside a large chunk of time and meet in a place that's private and quiet. This will remove distractions and things which add more stress. Talking it out also shows the other person that you have put a priority on making things right, which can earn you some points and soften them up for finding a solution. The solution to more interpersonal conflicts will be a middle ground. This means you're going to have to stop seeing things in black and white. Don't see \\"my way\\" and \\"their way\\". You're both great people and you have so much to offer each other, so instead talk it out and find \\"our way\\" instead.  For example, if your girlfriend is upset because you can't agree which family to spend Christmas with, you can propose a third option: spending the week before Christmas with her family, the week after with your family, and the day itself with just each other. For example, if your friend is upset because they want to take one class with you but you want to take another class instead, you can suggest that you keep your classes separate but both take a study period that you can spend together studying in the library.

In order to analyze the sentiment of this sentence, it is important to examine the key words and the overall tone of the statement. In this case, the key words to focus on are \\"derivative\\" and \\"cliches.\\" The word \\"derivative\\" is used to describe something that is derived from, or markedly similar to, another source. In the context of a creative work, particularly when discussing a collection of horror and sci-fi themes, it implies a lack of originality or freshness. This term carries negative connotations because it suggests that the content is unoriginal and uninspired. The concept of \\"cliches\\" also carries a negative meaning, particularly when discussing a creative work. A cliche is a trite or overused idea or expression that has lost its impact due to excessive repetition or familiarity. Cliches are generally considered to be undesirable artifacts in literature, film, and other works of art, as they reflect a lack of originality and creativity on the part of the creator. In the context of horror and sci-fi themes, cliches may refer to predictable plotlines, stereotypical characters, or oft-visited story elements that do little to stimulate the reader or viewer's imagination.

This question tests the students' understanding of the initial theory in molecular genetics as mentioned in the first sentence of the passage, i.e., \\"one gene makes one protein.\\" 2. What process can enable a single gene to encode multiple proteins?  This question examines students' comprehension of the discovery that refined the initial model. According to the passage, the refinement arose from the discovery that \\"genes can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing.\\" 3. How does alternative splicing allow one gene to produce multiple proteins?  Although this information is not presented in the passage, the answer implicates an understanding of alternative splicing as a mechanism that allows a single gene to encode multiple proteins by variably including or excluding certain sections (exons) from the mRNA prior to translation. 4. What is \\"trans-splicing\\" as mentioned in the passage and how does it relate to coding sequences?  This question evaluates the students' understanding of the final part of the passage.

Question: If Paul wants to participate in the climbing camp from July 27 to July 29 and his brother from July 27 to July 31, it will cost them   _  . Answer: Answer:","output":"To find the total cost for Paul and his brother to participate in the climbing camp, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately, and then add those costs together. Paul wants to participate from July 27 to July 29, which is a total of 3 days. The cost for the first 3 days is 325/person. So, for Paul, it would cost 325. His brother wants to participate from July 27 to July 31, which is a total of 5 days. The cost for the 5-day camp is 575/person. So, for his brother, it would cost 575. Now, to find the total cost for both of them, we add their individual costs: Total cost = Paul's cost + Brother's cost Total cost = 325 + 575 Total cost = 900 So, if Paul wants to participate in the climbing camp from July 27 to July 29 and his brother from July 27 to July 31, it will cost them 900."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One evening near the small Serbian village of Stetl, early in the nineteenth century, schoolmaster Albert Müller witnesses his wife Anna taking a little girl, Jenny Schilt, into the castle of Count Mitterhaus, a reclusive nobleman rumored to be a vampire responsible for the disappearances of other children. The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood. Men from the village, directed by Müller and including Jenny's father Mr. Schilt and the Bürgermeister, invade the castle and attack the Count. After the vampire kills several of them, Müller succeeds in driving a wooden stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus curses the villagers, vowing that their children will die to give him back his life. The angry villagers force Anna to run a gauntlet, but when her husband intervenes, she runs back into the castle where the briefly revived Count tells her to find his cousin Emil at \\"the Circus of Night\\". After laying his body in the crypt, she escapes through an underground tunnel as the villagers blow the castle with gunpowder and set fire to it.

You are given a new situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  and a hint : In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  Please answer this question : In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","output":"Plant roots would play a greater role in soil development in Kenya. This is because Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grasslands in Africa, where much of the organic matter added to the soil comes from the deep, fibrous grass root systems. Grasslands typically develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter due to the significant contribution of roots. In contrast, Tanzania, with its vast forest cover, relies primarily on tree leaves falling on the forest floor as the principal source of soil organic matter. The soils under forests generally store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon, indicating that plant roots play a less significant role in soil development in Tanzania compared to Kenya."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

The return address is not required on postal mail. However, lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable; such as from damage, postage due, or invalid destination. Such mail may otherwise become dead letter mail. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that is it possible to send a letter without return address?  (1). no (2). yes The answer is:","output":"(2). yes It is true that it is possible to send a letter without a return address. However, as mentioned earlier, not including a return address comes with its own set of risks and potential issues. If a letter without a return address is undeliverable for any reason, such as damage, postage due, or an invalid destination, the postal service will be unable to return the letter to the sender. In such cases, the letter may become dead letter mail. A return address is essentially the sender's information, which is usually written on the top left corner or the back of the envelope. It includes the sender's name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Including a return address serves multiple purposes: - It allows the postal service to return the mail to the sender if it cannot be delivered to the recipient. This can happen due to incorrect or outdated recipient information, insufficient postage, or the letter being damaged beyond recognition. - It aids in faster processing and delivery of mail, as the postal service can easily recognize and handle any issues that arise during the delivery process. - It helps in identifying the sender and ensuring that the mail is credible and legitimate, which can be especially important for important documents, financial transactions, or sensitive information. Even though it is possible to send a letter without a return address, it is strongly advised to include one to minimize the risks associated with undeliverable mail and to ensure that the postal service can handle and process the mail effectively. By including a return address, you are improving the chances of your mail reaching its intended destination and preventing any potential issues or complications that may arise during the delivery process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the humanities, one sense of culture, as an attribute of the individual, has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication, in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry.[dubious – discuss] Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a false consciousness, such perspectives common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Around what time did Mass Culture end?","output":"Okay kiddo, let me explain it in a way that's easier to understand. Culture is like the way people do things, what they like, and how they behave. Sometimes people think that some ways of doing things are fancier or better than others, and that makes them feel special. Mass culture is when lots of people like the same things, and these things are easy to find and share, like toys and cartoons. To answer your question, Mass culture has not ended. It's still going on today because people keep enjoying and sharing things they like with others. So, we can't say when it ended because it's still happening now."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Dashboard Confessional is an American rock band from Boca Raton, Florida, led by singer-songwriter Chris Carrabba.

In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence).\\",  answer the following question.

Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross have had talks with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the Islamist terrorist group for the more than 200 Chibok school girls kidnapped in April, a source involved in the negotiations told CNN. The officials met four times in mid-August with two senior members of Boko Haram in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. The swap would involve the release of 30 Boko Haram commanders in the custody of the Nigerian government, according to the source, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. Boko Haram submitted a list with the names of 30 members who were either convicted or awaiting trial on terror offenses. The","output":"proposed exchange has sparked intense debate among government officials, humanitarian organizations, and the public, as they weigh the potential benefits of securing the kidnapped girls' freedom against the risks of emboldening the terrorist group and potentially endangering more lives by releasing high-ranking Boko Haram commanders back into the community. While many argue that the lives of the innocent Chibok school girls should be the top priority and see the swap as the most viable means of ensuring their safe return, others fear that such a deal would only serve to encourage further abductions and terrorist activities by Boko Haram, thereby perpetuating a cycle of violence and instability within the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What does nitrogen do when it's heated\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"if gas is heated then that gas will expand\\" and \\"nitrogen gas is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Choices: [I] Expands; [II] boiling; [III] moves; [IV] Solidifies; [V] Melts; [VI] heat; [VII] burning; [VIII] Condenses; A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What does nitrogen do when it's heated\\" would be: [I] Expands. As your teacher provided the hint \\"if gas is heated then that gas will expand,\\" this statement aligns with the general behavior of gases when subjected to heat. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of gas molecules. Consequently, the gas molecules spread out and move more quickly, causing the gas to expand. Additionally, your teacher mentioned that \\"nitrogen gas is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere.\\" While this fact is not directly related to how nitrogen behaves when heated, it serves to remind us that nitrogen is indeed a gas. This further reinforces the choice of \\"expands\\" as the correct answer. Here's a brief explanation as to why the other answer choices are not suitable: [II] Boiling: Boiling is the process of turning a liquid into a gas. Nitrogen is already a gas, so this is not applicable. [III] Moves: While heating a gas can result in movement, \\"expands\\" is a more accurate and detailed explanation of what specifically occurs to nitrogen when heated. [IV] Solidifies: Solidifying occurs when a substance cools down and transitions from a liquid or gas to a solid. This implies cooling rather than heating, making it an incorrect answer. [V] Melts: Melting is the process of turning a solid into a liquid. Since nitrogen is already a gas, this answer is not applicable. [VI] Heat: The term \\"heat\\" does not provide any information about the behavior of nitrogen when it is heated, and therefore is not a suitable answer. [VII] Burning: Burning typically refers to a chemical reaction that occurs in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the release of heat. Nitrogen, however, is generally unreactive under normal conditions. Burning is not the correct term to describe nitrogen when it is heated. [VIII] Condenses: Condensing occurs when a substance cools down and transitions from a gas to a liquid. This implies cooling rather than heating, making it an incorrect answer. In conclusion, based on the provided hints and the intrinsic properties of gases, the most accurate answer to the question \\"What does nitrogen do when it's heated\\" is [I] Expands."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer is:","output":"The third single from Taylor Swift's debut album, \\"Taylor Swift,\\" is a song called \\"Our Song.\\" It was not directed by a specific person since \\"directing\\" is typically associated with film or music video creation rather than individual tracks on an album. However, if we were to discuss the song's creation and production aspects, we can certainly delve into the people who were instrumental in crafting this hit. \\"Our Song\\" was written by Taylor Swift herself when she was just a teenager. The song serves as a reflection on an innocent high school relationship, capturing the essence of a youthful, carefree romance. It was officially released on September 9th, 2007, and is a testament to Swift's early talent for storytelling through music. When it comes to the production of \\"Our Song,\\" Nathan Chapman primarily handled that aspect. Chapman, who has collaborated closely with Swift throughout her career, was the producer behind the song and played a crucial role in shaping its sound. He contributed significantly to the album's overall success and ultimately helped Swift to become a global phenomenon, thanks in part to his work on \\"Our Song.\\" In regards to the music video, it was directed by Trey Fanjoy. The video portrays Swift in various nostalgic scenes, matched with the tune's upbeat and catchy melody. Trey Fanjoy was the one responsible for directing and bringing this music video to life, showcasing a more playful side of Taylor Swift and capturing moments that mimic the youthful, optimistic energy of the song itself. Fanjoy has collaborated with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert, among others. In conclusion, while there is no director for the third single from Taylor Swift's debut album \\"Taylor Swift\\" itself, the principal individuals involved in the song's creation were Taylor Swift as the writer and Nathan Chapman as the producer. Trey Fanjoy was the director of the song's music video, who successfully visualized and crafted the images to complement the sounds and sentiments of \\"Our Song.\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She is the healer and midwife of her rural, tribal people - she believes in life. But new laws are in force prohibiting unlicensed healers. On a rare trip to the city, she is approached by Maraea, the servant of a wealthy woman, Rebecca, who seeks her knowledge and assistance in order to hide a secret which could destroy Rebecca's position in European settler society.

Moto X Screen Price: The Moto X, developed and manufactured by Motorola Mobility, is a series of Android smartphones that includes several models such as the Moto X (1st Gen), Moto X (2nd Gen), and Moto X Style, among others. The price of a replacement screen for the Moto X can vary depending on the specific model and the quality of the screen. As of 2021, for an original Moto X screen (1st Gen), the price can range from 30 to 50. For a 2nd Gen model, the cost of a replacement screen falls within the range of 40 to 60. For the latest Moto X Style (also known as Moto X Pure Edition), the replacement screen might be slightly more expensive, ranging between 50 and 80. Keep in mind that these prices are for the screen components only. If you require assistance with the installation, labor cost might be added, depending on where you choose to get the service. The prices may vary between online retailers, local repair shops, or official Motorola service centers. 2. Best Film in the Underworld Series: The Underworld series is a popular action-horror film franchise that revolves around the centuries-old conflicts between vampires and werewolves (Lycans). There are currently five films in the series: a. Underworld (2003) b. Underworld: Evolution (2006) c. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009) d. Underworld: Awakening (2012) e. Underworld: Blood Wars (2016) Determining the best film in the Underworld series is subjective, as people's preferences may vary depending on their taste in movies and affinity for particular characters or plotlines.

Given the question: Question: \\"Which of the following is not a musician: Jenny Lind, Chopin or Stafford?\\"  Context: \\"In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea (£1.05 in present British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Stafford. In the given context, Chopin, Jenny Lind, and Stafford are mentioned in relation to musical events. Chopin was a renowned Polish composer and pianist, known for his exceptional skill and contributions to the Romantic era of classical music. Jenny Lind, on the other hand, was a famous Swedish opera singer (also known as the \\"Swedish Nightingale\\"), who performed in various concerts and operas across Europe and America. However, Stafford, in this context, refers to Stafford House, which was a significant location for musical events and gatherings during the time. This particular context does not indicate that Stafford is a musician, but rather a place where prominent musicians (like Chopin and Jenny Lind) performed for distinguished audiences, including Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. While Chopin and Jenny Lind are both well-known musicians, Stafford is not. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is Stafford."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Possible answers: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no","output":"The answer is (2). It is not possible to tell. Even though the two sentences are related in that they both express the speaker's negative emotional state, the first sentence \\"I got mad\\" is a broad statement that does not specifically point out the cause of the speaker's anger. In other words, the speaker could have been mad about anything or anyone. Without further context, one cannot decisively infer solely based on this statement that the speaker was specifically angry at women.  On the other hand, the second sentence \\"I was angry at the women\\" is more specific about the cause of the speaker's anger -- it suggests the speaker was angry at certain women. Therefore, even though the first sentence could potentially be true, whether the second statement is also true depends on the specific cause of the speaker's anger, which has not been provided in the first sentence. It is possible that the speaker was mad at something entirely different. So, it is not possible to determine the truth of the second sentence based on the first one.

But I think it's about his priorities. And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better? Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? the state was not doing so well OPT:  a). Yes  b). It's impossible to say  c). No","output":"a). Yes From the given paragraph, we can conclude that the statement \\"the state was not doing so well\\" is true due to the following points: 1. The state was \\"dead last in health care for families,\\" indicating that it was performing poorly in providing adequate health care services. 2. The paragraph questions why the governor would choose to give tax cuts to oil companies and others rather than addressing the pressing health care issues. It suggests that with the large surplus, the governor could have used it to improve the state's rank in healthcare services, but did not prioritize this problem. These points show that the state was facing challenges in providing proper health care to its families, and the choices made by the governor did not necessarily prioritize their well-being.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country caused less turbidity in the coastal water?  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"Congo caused less turbidity in the coastal water."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Where is a good place to keep many a pencil? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - office depot - cup - pencil shop - shelf - classroom A:","output":"The most suitable option to keep many pencils would be a cup. A cup is a versatile and easily accessible solution for storing a large number of pencils, whether at home or in a professional setting. Here's a detailed explanation of each option: 1. Office Depot: Office Depot is a retail store that offers various office supplies, including pencils and other writing materials. However, it is not a place to store your personal collection of pencils. It is a place to purchase new supplies, not for keeping your pencils organized. 2. Cup: A cup, typically a large and sturdy mug or container, is an excellent place to store many pencils. You can keep the cup on your desk or workspace, allowing quick and straightforward access to your writing materials whenever you need them. You can organize the pencils within the cup, either by color, size, or type, depending on your preference. In addition, cups are affordable and come in various designs and materials, allowing you to choose one that best matches your personal style or workspace decor. 3. Pencil shop: A pencil shop is a place where you can buy pencils and other writing materials. Similar to Office Depot, it is not an ideal location for storing your personal collection of pencils. The store is designed for purchasing new supplies, not for holding already-owned pencils. 4. Shelf: While a shelf can indeed serve as a storage location for many pencils, it might not be the most space-efficient or easily accessible option. Depending on the size and design of the shelf, you may need additional organizational tools, such as pencil cases or containers, to keep the pencils orderly and prevent them from rolling off or getting misplaced. However, if you have a designated shelf for organizing office or art supplies, you can incorporate pencils into the mix. 5. Classroom: A classroom is a shared space commonly used for educational purposes. While it is likely that a classroom will have a supply of pencils available for student use, it is not the ideal place to store your personal collection of pencils. Instead, you would keep your pencils in a cup or case within your desk or workspace at home or in your office. In conclusion, a cup is the most suitable option for storing many pencils. It is space-efficient, easily accessible, versatile in design, and can be personalized to match your preferences and decor. It is the best choice compared to other options that either serve as purchasing locations or are shared/communal spaces and may not be as convenient for day-to-day use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you follow the river to where it passes through a plain, what will the river most likely look like compared with how it looked on the mountain? Select from: (A). Much the same (B). Deeper and faster (C). Slower and wider (D). Straighter","output":"To determine what the river will most likely look like compared to how it looked on the mountain when it passes through a plain, let's consider the geography and hydrology of the river: 1. In the mountains, a river usually experiences a steep gradient, meaning there's a significant drop in elevation over a short distance. This leads to fast-moving water and high-energy flow, resulting in the river carving a narrow, V-shaped valley.  2. When the river reaches a plain, the slope decreases and the elevation change is less significant. This means that the water's forward momentum is reduced, and the water flow slows down. As a result of the slower flow, sediments from the mountains and the riverbanks are deposited on the plain, creating a wider river channel with more meander. Based on these considerations, the river will most likely look (C) Slower and wider when it passes through a plain compared to how it looked on the mountain."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: \\"What was the longitudinal range of the system in December 2012?\\"  Context: \\"The BeiDou-2 system began offering services for the Asia-Pacific region in December 2012.

With nearly 53 million items and 92 locations, the New York Public Library is the second largest public library in the United States (behind the Library of Congress), and fourth largest in the world. It is a private, non-governmental, independently managed, nonprofit corporation operating with both private and public financing. The library has branches in the boroughs of Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island, and affiliations with academic and professional libraries in the metropolitan area of New York State. The Library website provides access to the library's catalogs, online collections and subscription databases. It also has information about the library's free events, exhibitions, computer classes and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. The two online catalogs, LEO (which searches the circulating collections) and CATNYP (which searches the research collections) allow users to search the library's holdings of books, journals and other materials. The LEO system allows cardholders to request books from any branch and have them delivered to any branch.  The NYPL gives cardholders free access from home to thousands of current and historical magazines, newspapers, journals and reference books in subscription databases, including EBSCOhost, which contains full text of major magazines; full text of the New York Times (1995-present), Gale's Ready Reference Shelf which includes the Encyclopedia of Associations and periodical indexes, Books in Print; and Ulrich's Periodicals Directory. The New York Public Library also links to outside resources, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook, and the CIA's World Factbook. Databases are available for children, teenagers, and adults of all ages.  The NYPL Digital Collections (formerly named Digital Gallery) is a database of over 700,000 images digitized from the library's collections.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious.  But I can use this background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  What is an answer for this question: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Mary candied raspberries, apricots, and apples. She did not candy plums, cherries, and pears.

Yamane Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Tokyo Requiem\\" Genre: Sci-fi, Mystery, Thriller Act 1: Dr. Yamane, a brilliant but reclusive Japanese scientist, has dedicated his life to researching a mysterious phenomenon that has been causing bizarre natural disasters in various parts of the world, such as sudden melting of glaciers, unexplained volcanic eruptions, and unseasonal hurricanes. The frequency and scale of these incidents are increasing, and they can no longer be dismissed as mere coincidences. As he delves deeper into the data, he discovers a connection between these disasters and an ancient myth about a hidden underworld city known as Shambhala, which is said to possess knowledge and technology beyond human comprehension. Driven by his curiosity, Dr. Yamane sets out to decode the mythological literature and unlock the secrets of this lost city. Act 2: Yamane's ground-breaking research draws the attention of several international agencies, including a powerful and secretive consortium with a vested interest in harnessing the power of Shambhala for their own gain. They attempt to recruit Dr. Yamane into their ranks, but he declines, choosing instead to continue his research independently. With the help of his loyal assistant, Dr. Sato, and a world-class geophysicist named Dr. Sofia Rios, they work together to decipher the ancient texts and uncover more evidence supporting the existence of Shambhala. Meanwhile, news breaks of a global conference held in Tokyo, where Dr. Yamane is set to present his findings. Observers from conflicting global factions, as well as an array of international intelligence operatives, are dispatched to the event in order to gauge its potential implications. Act 3: The day of the Tokyo conference arrives, and tensions are high. Security forces are dispatched to maintain order and protect Dr. Yamane's presentation, as the fate of nations hangs in balance. As he unveils his findings, he shares evidence that supports the existence of Shambhala, and the advanced technology that could be harnessed to prevent further natural disasters. He also warns the audience of the grave consequences they may face should they choose to exploit this knowledge for their own benefit instead of using it responsibly. However, just as Yamane is about to disclose the location of Shambhala and how to access it, an assassination attempt is carried out, leaving the audience panicked and clamoring for answers. In the chaos, key information about accessing Shambhala is stolen by an unidentified assailant. Act 4: Dr. Yamane, Dr. Sato, and Dr. Rios go into hiding, determined to find the stolen information before it falls into the wrong hands. They embark on a perilous journey across the world, following the clues left behind by the ancient texts in order to piece together the pathway to Shambhala. Along the way, they form an unlikely alliance with a rogue intelligence agent, codenamed \\"The Falcon,\\" who possesses vital information about the shadowy consortium that ordered the theft. Together, they piece together the puzzle and eventually find the entrance to the hidden city. Act 5: As they venture into Shambhala, they encounter incredible, advanced technology that could hold the key to reversing the global climate crisis. However, they soon learn that the shadowy consortium has already infiltrated the city, seeking to weaponize the technology for their own nefarious purposes. In a final standoff, Dr. Yamane and his team battle the consortium's forces in a race against time to prevent them from unleashing catastrophe on an unsuspecting world. Ultimately, they manage to overcome their adversaries and secure Shambhala and its powerful knowledge, but not before paying a heavy price. The film ends with Dr. Yamane and surviving members of his team returning to the surface, determined to honor the memory of their fallen friends by sharing the secrets of Shambhala with the world, working together to rehabilitate the planet and prevent further disasters, setting up the possibility for future sequels and spin-offs exploring the challenges and adventures ahead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Which person inherited a parcel with fewer grass root systems in its soil?  Kim and Jane inherited some land. Kim inherited some grassland, while Jane inherited a forest. They both took good care of their properties.  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Identify the main points in the paragraph to answer the question. The paragraph provides information about how organic matter is added to the soil in grasslands and forests. It also highlights the differences in the distribution of organic matter in both types of ecosystems: - In grasslands, deep fibrous grass root systems contribute much of the organic matter. - In forests, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter. - Soils under grasslands develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter. - Soils under forests store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and a thin A horizon. Step 2: Analyze the differences between Kim and Jane's inheritances. Kim inherited grassland, characterized by a deeper distribution of organic matter from fibrous grass root systems. Meanwhile, Jane inherited a forest, which has most of its organic matter in the forest floor and a thin A horizon. The question asks us to determine which person inherited a parcel with fewer grass root systems in its soil. Step 3: Determine the answer based on the inheritance and characteristics of the land. Based on the information provided, we can infer that the soil in the forest, inherited by Jane, would have fewer grass root systems contributing to the organic matter compared to the grassland inherited by Kim.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. \\"We gig relentlessly,\\" says frontman Steve Garrigan. \\"Even when we have days off we'll find a place to play.\\" The band are ostensibly promoting their second album, Coming Up For Air - but admit that touring keeps them afloat. \\"We've never really had a big hit worldwide, but we have a big fanbase,\\" Garrigan says. \\"At the moment, our live shows are what's driving us.\\" After racking up 222,137 miles on the road in 2015 alone, Garrigan shares the highlights and horror stories of their world tour. I was out in Brisbane in a place called Lone Pine - which is actually a koala sanctuary. I got to hold a koala and feed the kangaroos, which was amazing, one of the things on my bucket list, but I didn't wear any sun cream. Now, I have very pale and pasty Irish skin, so I ended up getting sun stroke. Before I went on stage that night, I could barely stand up. I was so dehydrated. My legs were shaking the whole time. The only thing that got me through that gig was adrenalin but, even so, I dropped a few songs from the set, went straight to the hotel and spent the next day in darkness covered in after-sun and drinking buckets and buckets of water. Our first time playing Glastonbury, two years ago, we were playing the John Peel tent and we were super-excited. The tent was packed, people were trying to get in and they couldn't make it. For us, it was a career-defining moment. But when we play, we use these things called in-ear monitors, so we can hear everything we're playing. They were working perfectly and we were rocking out - but the crowd started chanting \\"off, off, off\\". We were like, \\"Oh my God. That was our 30 seconds on stage at Glastonbury and we were terrible. I guess we'll go back to our day jobs and give up the dream.\\" But it turned out the PA system wasn't working and the crowd couldn't hear anything. They were actually chanting \\"up, up, up\\". It worked out for the better in the end, because the crowd felt for us and they got back on our side. We get a lot of presents from fans in Japan and America. Lots of cup cakes - I don't know why. But I once said I'd like it if fans brought us socks. I've run out of socks before and when you're on a tour bus and you're wearing socks that are two or three days old, it can smell like a festival gone wrong. So I put a tweet out and then fans started turning up and giving me socks. I haven't had to buy a pair of socks in ages. I've had them thrown at me on stage. Tom Jones gets knickers and I get socks. Any time we have off, we'll spend in the studio. We wrote and recorded our last album in eight weeks. This next one, we're going to take a little more time. We're experimenting a bit with different sounds but it's still my voice, we're the same musicians. It'll still sound like Kodaline. We're very aware that bands come and go. Every album could be our last, but our dream is to have a career that could span the rest of our lives. But you can't tell the future. If you can do a good gig at a festival and hold a good crowd, I think it makes you better musicians and performers. If we got to a stadium, that would be the dream. We got a taste of it, actually, when Ed Sheeran invited us on stage in Croke Park in Dublin. We played one of our songs, called All I Want, and the whole stadium sang every word back to us. It was 80,000 [people] and I almost fainted with the nerves. Festival food is hit and miss. If you get there after everybody's gone in and they're running out of food, you get the stuff that's been sitting out all day. The best catering I've had so far was at a festival in Poland. It was a sit-down thing with waiters - all very fancy, and we're not very fancy people. I had a carbonara, which is pretty standard, but do you ever eat something and they do something tiny, like add an extra spice, and it makes the whole dish taste a million times better? I don't know what it was, but it was the best carbonara I've ever had. At V Festival this year, it was my birthday so the lads brought a cake on stage - but they forgot to light the candles! One of the crew just handed me the cake and I was like, \\"what am I supposed to do with this?\\" I had 20,000 people singing Happy Birthday to me, which was a bizarre experience. I was kind of embarrassed. We were over in LA and we got the opportunity to go into the studio with Johnny McDaid - who used to be in Snow Patrol. Somebody told us he was engaged to Courtney Cox, which we didn't really know about, but we went over to her house, stayed a few days and we ended up writing Love Will Set You Free. After that, we were hanging out and Courtney said she'd love to direct the video for it. We didn't really take her seriously but then she kept asking and we ended up shooting it in her house. We had some of our friends over from Dublin - girlfriends and fiancees - and I think she did a really good job capturing our personalities. We are huge fans of Friends. We've all got the box sets at home, and we were quite nervous about meeting her at first. But she's very chilled out and very cool and she puts you at ease. Luckily, we didn't call her Monica - but we were very, very aware of that. Kodaline begin a 10-date UK tour in December, culminating with four nights at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a band called Kodaline and their experiences while touring for their music. The lead singer, Steve Garrigan, explains that even though they don't have a big worldwide hit, they have many loyal fans and their live concerts really keep them going. There are also funny and interesting stories from their tours. For example, Garrigan once got sunstroke because he forgot to put on sun cream while at a koala sanctuary in Australia. Another time, they thought the crowd at a music festival was booing them, but actually, the crowd was asking for the volume to be turned up because they couldn't hear the music.  Additionally, Garrigan talks about how fans give them gifts like socks, how they spend their spare time writing songs, their plans for their next album, and their dream of performing at a stadium one day. He also shares food experiences and birthday celebrations during festivals and his story about meeting actress Courtney Cox.

Question: A team of archaeologists studied two human settlements, village Alpha from about 11000 years ago and village Beta, which existed 9000 years ago. Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village had a smaller food supply?  Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Answer:","output":"Village Alpha had a smaller food supply in comparison to Village Beta. Village Alpha, which existed about 11,000 years ago, was a time before the invention of agriculture (around 10,000 years ago). As a result, the inhabitants of Village Alpha relied on hunting, gathering, and foraging for food. This method of obtaining food was less dependable and provided a limited supply as compared to agriculture. On the other hand, Village Beta (9,000 years ago) had already adopted agriculture, which provided a larger and more consistent food supply. The practice of agriculture enabled its inhabitants to settle down in bigger villages, as they could now grow their own food and store surpluses. Due to the improved food supply, birth rates increased in Village Beta. However, the settled life in larger villages brought additional challenges such as crowded living conditions and disease spread, which led to higher death rates. Despite these challenges, the practice of agriculture in Village Beta contributed to a overall more abundant food supply compared to Village Alpha."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"There are five Great Lakes in North America shared between the United States and Canada. However, in Ontario, the province borders four of these Great Lakes. They are Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. 1. Lake Superior: This is the largest of the Great Lakes and the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. Lake Superior borders Ontario to the northwest, with its western portion also bordering the province of Manitoba. The lake covers an area of 82,100 square kilometers (31,700 square miles) and holds about 12,100 cubic kilometers (2,900 cubic miles) of water. Lake Superior is also the deepest of the Great Lakes, with an average depth of 147 meters (483 feet) and a maximum depth of 406 meters (1,333 feet). 2. Lake Huron: Lake Huron is the second largest of the Great Lakes, with a surface area of 59,600 square kilometers (23,000 square miles) and a volume of 3,540 cubic kilometers (849 cubic miles) of water. The lake borders the eastern part of Ontario and is connected to Lake Superior via the St. Marys River and to Lake Michigan via the Straits of Mackinac (though Lake Michigan is not in Ontario). Lake Huron has an average depth of 59 meters (195 feet) and a maximum depth of 229 meters (750 feet). 3. Lake Erie: Lake Erie is the fourth largest of the Great Lakes in terms of surface area, and the smallest by volume. It covers an area of 25,667 square kilometers (9,910 square miles) and has a volume of 484 cubic kilometers (116 cubic miles) of water. Lake Erie borders Ontario to the south and is connected to Lake Huron via the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River. Lake Erie is the shallowest of all the Great Lakes, with an average depth of 19 meters (62 feet) and a maximum depth of 64 meters (210 feet). 4. Lake Ontario: This Great Lake resides entirely within the boundaries of Ontario on its north shore and New York in the United States on its south shore. Lake Ontario is the smallest Great Lake by surface area, though it is larger than Lake Erie in terms of volume. The lake covers 18,960 square kilometers (7,320 square miles) and contains approximately 1,640 cubic kilometers (393 cubic miles) of water. It connects to Lake Erie through the Niagara River and the famous Niagara Falls. The average depth of Lake Ontario is 86 meters (283 feet), and its maximum depth reaches 244 meters (800 feet). While not all of the water bodies that make up the Great Lakes are within Ontario's borders, the province plays a significant role in preserving and maintaining these vital freshwater ecosystems. These lakes provide essential resources, including drinking water, recreational activities, and opportunities for transportation and trade, for both Canada and the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The dog's owner, an attractive young woman, seduces Ace to avoid paying the detective's fee- a feat that Ace hardly resists.Late in the night at Miami Stadium, a group of individuals break in and steal the Miami Dolphins' mascot- a trained dolphin named Snowflake. Next morning, the Dolphin's Head of Operations Roger Podacter (Troy Evans) and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl (out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players). A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this \\"pet detective\\" in to try investigating.Meanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of 25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible.

Retinol is another name for which vitamin????","output":"Retinol is another name for Vitamin A, an essential fat-soluble vitamin that plays a critical role in various physiological processes within the human body. Vitamin A exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid, which are collectively referred to as retinoids. Retinol is the most bioavailable and active form of Vitamin A, as it can be easily absorbed and utilized by the body. Vitamin A plays an essential role in maintaining good vision, supporting the immune system, promoting healthy skin, and aiding in cellular growth and differentiation. Here are more details about the key functions of Vitamin A in the human body: 1. Vision: Vitamin A, specifically the retinal form, binds to a protein called opsin in the rod cells of the retina, forming a light-sensitive molecule called rhodopsin. When light hits rhodopsin, it triggers a series of biochemical reactions that initiate the process of converting light into electrical signals. These signals are transmitted to the brain, allowing us to perceive visual stimuli and detect light in darkness, an essential component of night vision. 2. Immune System: Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the innate and adaptive immune systems. It is involved in the development and differentiation of white blood cells, which help the body recognize and fight infections. Vitamin A also plays a role in maintaining the structure and function of the mucosal barriers in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, which are the body's first line of defense against pathogens. 3. Cellular Growth and Differentiation: Retinoic acid, a form of Vitamin A, influences gene expression by binding to nuclear receptors, which mediate the transcription of specific target genes. Through this process, Vitamin A regulates cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, contributing to the proper formation and development of tissues and organs throughout the body. 4. Skin Health: Vitamin A is essential for maintaining healthy skin, as it promotes cell turnover and modulates the function of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the outermost layer of the skin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful in treating skin conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and eczema. Vitamin A can be obtained through a variety of dietary sources, both from animal products (in the form of retinol or retinyl esters), and from plant-based sources (as provitamin A carotenoids, like beta-carotene). Animal-based sources include liver, dairy products, eggs, and fish, while plant-based sources include dark leafy greens, orange and yellow vegetables, and certain fruits. It is important to consume Vitamin A within the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) because both deficiency and excess can lead to health problems. Vitamin A deficiency is associated with impaired vision (such as night blindness or xerophthalmia), poor immune function, and impaired growth and development. On the other hand, an excess of Vitamin A, known as hypervitaminosis A, can result in dizziness, nausea, headaches, and even more severe symptoms like liver damage, bone issues, and birth defects when consumed excessively during pregnancy. In summary, retinol is another name for Vitamin A, an essential fat-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in supporting vision, immune function, healthy skin, and many other critical physiological processes. It is crucial to maintain a balanced intake of Vitamin A from both animal and plant-based dietary sources while staying within the RDA to ensure optimal health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"Weymouth Sands is a novel written by the prolific British author, John Cowper Powys. Published in 1934, it is the third of Powys’ Wessex novels, a series set in the fictionalized region of Wessex in southwest England. The author, John Cowper Powys (1872-1963), was born in Derbyshire, England, and was a versatile literary figure. He was not only a talented novelist but also a poet, essayist, and lecturer. His works often revolve around themes of philosophy, spirituality, and the exploration of human desires and impulses. Powys is known for his descriptive, stream-of-consciousness writing style that takes readers on a deep and immersive journey into the minds of the characters. Set in the seaside town of Weymouth, Weymouth Sands explores the lives, loves, and pursuits of a multitude of characters that are both highly developed and expertly interwoven with each other. Using the town as a backdrop, Powys examines local customs, the social class system, and the interactions among the various individuals who inhabit Weymouth. The author's observations on nature and his description of the shifting sands of the beach lend a symbolic touch to the novel, reflecting the fluid nature of human emotions and relationships. Central to the novel are the three main characters - Jobber Skald, Sarnia Starr, and Mammon. Jobber Skald, an ex-boxer, is considered the chief protagonist. His journey from physical power to spiritual enlightenment serves as a core narrative thread throughout the book. Sarnia Starr, a beautiful and enigmatic woman, is the primary female character. She is torn between her love for the impoverished but idealistic Jobber and the wealthy and pragmatic Mammon, whose affluence offers her security and societal standing. Weymouth Sands explores Sarnia's struggle to reconcile her emotions with her position in society. The novel is rich in its exploration of themes such as love, desire, spirituality, and the complexities of human nature. Powys utilizes the unique setting of Weymouth to explore the interplay between local history, the natural environment, and the characters' experiences, ultimately framing their lives against a backdrop of shifting sands and a constantly changing landscape. Weymouth Sands received critical acclaim for its vivid portrayal of the characters and its exploration of human desires and conflicts. While it may not be as widely known as some of Powys' other works, such as Wolf Solent or A Glastonbury Romance, Weymouth Sands remains an outstanding example of Powys' literary prowess and his ability to delve into the human psyche. In summary, Weymouth Sands is an engaging, thought-provoking novel by John Cowper Powys, featuring deep insights into human nature, passion, and spirituality. Set in the scenic seaside town of Weymouth with its ever-changing landscape, Powys weaves a tapestry of well-developed characters, each connected to the others in complex ways, and provides readers with an insightful journey into the human experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The fund was set up in 2010 to improve access to cancer drugs that would not be routinely available on the NHS. The fund, which is expected to have cost £1.27bn by April 2017, has helped more than 80,000 cancer patients. Before any drugs can be given to patients on the NHS, they have to be recommended by the health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which looks at how well they work and whether they are cost-effective. But if drugs are not recommended or have yet to be appraised by NICE, the Cancer Drugs Fund can step in and choose to fund cancer treatment. The fund was initially managed by strategic health authorities. But since April 2013, it has been managed by NHS England. The MPs' committee says there is no evidence the fund is benefiting patients, extending lives or a good use of taxpayers' money. Money has had to be diverted from primary care to cover two years of overspends. The £480m budget for the two years from 2013 to 2015 was overspent by £167m. Its total budget, of £1.27bn, takes the fund to April, when the system will be overhauled. The MPs recommend more thorough information is collected about how patients are benefiting from the drugs. And they say tough decisions will need to be made about spending. The fund has already had to drastically reduce the number of treatments it pays for, and the MPs' report questions whether it has done enough to fund medicines for rarer cancers. A spokesman for NHS England said: \\"While we welcome the committee's support for a redesigned cancer drugs fund, we hope their explicit call for cuts to cancer drugs prices charged to the fund will be borne in mind as complex decisions on its future are taken in the next few months.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the findings of the Public Accounts Committee's (PAC) report on the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) and criticisms about the lack of clear benefits provided to patients by the fund. The CDF, established in 2010, was designed to improve access to cancer drugs that would not typically be available on the NHS. As of April 2017, the fund is projected to have cost £1.27 billion, having helped over 80,000 cancer patients. The Committee notes that the fund has been overspent by £167 million during the two years from 2013 to 2015, and there is no strong evidence to show that it extends lives or benefits patients. The MPs recommend collecting more comprehensive data regarding the number of patients who benefit from the drugs funded by the CDF and emphasize the need for difficult decisions to be made about spending. The report also questions if the CDF has done enough to fund medicines for rarer cancers. NHS England responded to the report, hoping that their call for reductions in cancer drug prices charged to the fund will be taken into consideration as the fund's future remains uncertain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: who led the charge of the light brigade?","output":"The Charge of the Light Brigade occurred on October 25, 1854, during the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War, fought between the Russian Empire and an alliance of the British, French, Ottoman, and Sardinian forces. Lord James Brudenell, also known as the 7th Earl of Cardigan, led the charge of the Light Brigade, which was a British cavalry unit consisting of approximately 670 men. Lord Cardigan was an aristocrat and experienced officer with various tenures in the British Army before the Crimean War. At the time of the Battle of Balaclava, Cardigan was the commander of the Light Brigade, a cavalry division formed primarily by light dragoons and hussars, two types of light cavalry soldiers intended for scouting and reconnaissance. The Charge of the Light Brigade was a result of miscommunication between British commanders. The original plan was to have the Light Brigade pursue and attack a retreating Russian artillery battery. However, due to an error in relaying the orders, Cardigan's cavalry unit ended up charging against heavily fortified Russian artillery positions situated at the end of a long, narrow valley, flanked by Russian troops on higher ground. As a disciplined commander, Lord Cardigan dutifully led the charge, despite the apparent danger and bleak odds of success. The British cavalry charged headlong into the valley, drawing fire from multiple directions and sustaining heavy losses. Remarkably, Cardigan survived the assault unscathed, but the Charge of the Light Brigade was ultimately a costly and tragic military blunder. Approximately 110 men were killed, and another 160 were wounded or taken prisoner during the charge. The incident has since become a symbol of bravery, military obedience, and the pitfalls of unclear communication in warfare. It was famously captured in the poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, titled \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" which immortalized the event with the lines \\"into the valley of Death rode the six hundred.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: The terrace wall was very high. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"No, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true because the premise, \\"Two people look over a terrace wall,\\" does not provide any information regarding the height of the terrace wall.  The act of \\"looking over\\" a wall could apply to walls of various heights, depending on the height of the people involved. Quite possibly, the wall may be of average or low height, which might still be easy for people to overlook, specially if they are standing close to it.  In addition, people can look over walls of all different heights depending on their vantage point or whether they were using aiding tools (for example, standing on a chair to make themselves taller, using binoculars or other vision-enhancing technology, or even using a drone to see what's on the other side).  Successful conclusions depend on premises providing enough detailed, supportive information to affirm the predictions or assumptions made in the hypotheses. In this case, the premise does not give us any information about the height of the wall, which is what the hypothesis is concerned with. So, a conclusion that the wall's height can be determined based on the premise would not be logically sound. To confidently accept the hypothesis that \\"The terrace wall was very high,\\" we would need more information. For example, if the premise specified that the people were standing directly next to the wall, and were craning their necks to see over it, or were unable to see over it even from standing right next to it, we might deduce that wall is indeed high. However, the given premise does not provide such details. So, in this instance, we do not have supporting evidence from the premise to correctly infer that the terrace wall is very high. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is correct based on the given premise. The height of the terrace wall remains unknown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. The infection may have contributed to three deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. \\"Preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials in multiple states comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons has suggested peanut butter as a likely source,\\" the disease agency said in a written statement. \\"To date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores.\\" As with the OPTIONS: - CDC patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems. - CNN patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems. - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems. - King Nut patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems. - Minnesota patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems. - Virginia patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems. - WASHINGTON patient, both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses, which means they had weakended immune systems.","output":"Ah, so this is about how we want to end a story about some people getting sick from peanut butter.

He moved from the town after he witnessed his brother, Wayne, murdered by a gang of greasers in 1963. The murderers themselves were killed shortly afterward by an oncoming train, having parked on the tracks. Jim has nightmares about his brother's murder as he starts teaching in the town. Students that are close to him start to be involved in various accidents that look like suicides. One by one, students are slain so the greasers, disguised as living teens, can return to class. The greasers plan to kill Jim the same way they murdered Wayne to keep themselves out of Hell. They intend to have a child witness the event, leading them to try to kidnap Jim's son Scott. Jim finds out that there is a way to let his own brother return. The gang also needs the remaining living member of their gang, Carl Mueller, who left before the train struck. Jim finds Carl, who panics, thinking Jim wants revenge. He runs back to town, fulfilling the gang's plan for a reunion. The gang harasses Jim's family to ensure Jim's compliance in reenacting the murder. After the gang releases the family, Jim hides them inside a church, which the demonic gang cannot enter. Jim tries to bring his brother back in the church's graveyard as the gang lures his wife and son outside and hold them hostage. Jim finds that something is blocking Wayne's return, and must cooperate with the thugs in reenacting the murder. It also reveals that when Jim was a boy, Jim took the murderers' car keys that lead to their deaths. Jim recovered the keys. He returns to the train tunnel in which the first murder took place, though both he and Carl change their dialogue and actions from those taken 27 years before. Frustrated, the gang leader stabs Carl, which allows Wayne to come back. Wayne distracts the gang while Jim gets his family out of the gang's car. Jim gave the gang back their car keys.

Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.  Guess a valid title for it!

Here's a question: Where would you enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects?  Here are possible answers to this question: - bowling alley - hockey game - sporting event - croquet - fridge  I believe the correct choice is \\"bowling alley\\", here's why: A:","output":"First, let us explore each of the options provided in the question and analyze how effectively they address the requirements. 1. Bowling Alley:  A bowling alley is a facility where the sport of bowling is played. Bowling is a game in which heavy spheres, known as bowling balls, are rolled down a lane towards ten white pins. The objective is to knock as many of the pins down as possible. Bowling alleys often feature snack bars or lounges where you can purchase a variety of foods and beverages, including beer. Thus, you can enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres towards ten white objects in a bowling alley. 2. Hockey Game: Hockey is a sport that involves ice or field, sticks, and a small hard ball or puck. The objective is to score points by striking the ball or puck into the opposing team's goal. To play this sport, you need a playing surface, protective gear, and a substantial amount of physical effort. Drinking beer while participating in a hockey game would not be advisable, as it could impair one's performance and judgement. Additionally, one is unlikely to throw heavy spheres at ten white objects during a hockey game. 3. Sporting Event: A sporting event refers to any organized competition involving various sports such as football, basketball, soccer, or baseball. While attendees at sporting events often enjoy beer, throwing heavy spheres at ten white objects is not necessarily a standard feature of these events. The activities at sporting events are generally focused on the specific sport being played, and it is unlikely that one will engage in bowling-like activities while attending these events. 4. Croquet: Croquet is a sport that involves hitting wooden balls through hoops using a wooden mallet. The objective is to pass the balls through a series of hoops to reach a central peg. Although an enjoyable outdoor game, it does not involve throwing heavy spheres towards ten white objects. Furthermore, while you could potentially enjoy a beer while playing croquet, the game's main focus and mechanism are different from the question's requirements. 5. Fridge: A fridge is an appliance that is primarily used to store and preserve food and beverages at low temperatures. A fridge can indeed store beer, providing a convenient and enjoyable way to consume it. However, a fridge does not offer any opportunity to engage in the activity of throwing heavy spheres towards ten white objects. Upon assessing all the options, it is evident that the \\"bowling alley\\" best fits the criteria laid out in the question. Bowling alleys provide the perfect environment for enjoying a beer while actively participating in the sport of bowling, which requires the player to throw heavy spheres (i.e., bowling balls) towards ten white objects (bowling pins). This unique setting offers a lively, engaging, and fitting experience for those seeking to indulge in the activity mentioned in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes, and I am not proud of it, but grief makes you do some really stupid things. My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Life of Reilly Context: The film begins with Reilly recounting his childhood and his parents in New York City and Connecticut. We meet his familyâan institutionalized father, a racist, baseball bat-wielding mother, and a lobotomized aunt, amongst others. \\"Eugene OâNeill would never get near this family,\\" Reilly declares. Prior to being put into an institution, Reillyâs father, a Paramount Pictures poster artist and illustrator, was offered the chance to go into business with another illustrator with the intention of making their first animated film in color together. The catch was simply that the senior Mr. Reilly would have to move himself and his family to California. Perhaps a defining moment in young Reillyâs life, his father asked his mother her thoughts and she unceremoniously rejected the possibility. The other illustrator went west without the senior Mr. Reilly as a partner. That other illustrator was named Walt Disney. After this missed opportunity, Reilly's father began drinking heavily and eventually had a nervous breakdown. Upon being institutionalized, the family was forced to move out of the Bronx up to Connecticut to live with Mrs. Reillyâs family. When Reilly turned eighteen, he moved to New York City. \\"If you wanted to be an actor in those days,\\" he explains, \\"You did something thatâs really unheard of todayâ¦ you studied.\\" Young and hungry (literally), Reilly managed to find an acting class at New School. Its rather liberal open door policy allowed aspiring actors admission even if they didnât have the money to pay. Reillyâs class was taught by a young, award-winning, soon-to-be-legendary actress, Uta Hagen. In the class were such future stars and notables as Steve McQueen, Jerry Stiller, Anne Meara, Hal Holbrook, Jason Robards, Geraldine Page and Gene Hackman.

You inherit half of your genes from your mother. You inherit half of your genes from your father. Genes are a kind of code. A tree's genes tell what shape its leaves will be. A cat's genes tell what color1 its fur will be. Your genes tell what color1 your eyes will be. Your genes tell what color1 your hair will be. Everything about you comes from the code in your genes. Genes line up on strands called chromosomes in cells. Everything alive is made up of cells. Chromosomes are in the center, or nucleus, of cells.   An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants. He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s. One of the things, or traits  , Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short. He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants. These units were called genes.   In the mid-1900s, scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA. In the 1970s, scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering. Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases. Muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia are some genetic diseases--diseases caused by problems in genes.

They were merely putting to use one of the newest methods of locating minerals in the ground -- using trees and plants as signs that certain minerals may lie under the ground on which the trees and plants are growing. This newest method of searching for minerals is based on the fact that minerals deep in the earth may affect the kind of bushes and trees that grow on the surface. At Watson Bar Creek, a mineral search group gathered bags of tree seeds. Boxes were filled with small branches from the trees. Roots were dug and put into boxes. Each bag and box was carefully marked. In a scientific laboratory the parts of the forest trees were burned to ashes andtested. Each small part was examined to learn whether there were minerals in it. Study of the roots, branches and seeds showed no silver. But there were small amount of gold in the roots and a little less gold in the branches and seeds. The seeds growing nearest to the tree trunk had more gold than those growing on the ends of the branches.

Question: I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  Now, I have a new situation: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright.  Answer this question please: Which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. Danny made a fire using large logs he felled a few months back. 2. Large logs in a fire burn relatively slowly since they have a smaller surface area. 3.

Q: Background Paragraph: Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue. Small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue.  Story: Bill is going to see some sites this week. On Wednesday he is going to see Fox Glacier, and on Thursday he is going to see Cobra Lake, which has frozen over for the winter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have polygynous (\\"many females\\") or, rarely, polyandrous (\\"many males\\") breeding systems. Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilized through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilized, though unfertilized eggs do not produce offspring. Where are eggs usually laid?","output":"Eggs are usually laid in a nest, which is a structure built or chosen by the birds for the purpose of housing and protecting the eggs and, eventually, the hatchlings. Nests come in various shapes and sizes, and the materials and construction can vary greatly depending on the bird species. Some birds, such as eagles and hawks, build large, sturdy nests in trees or on cliff ledges. Smaller birds, like songbirds, often create cup-shaped nests in tree branches using twigs, leaves, grasses, and other materials. Certain species, such as woodpeckers, excavate nesting cavities in tree trunks or branches, while others, like kingfishers, burrow into the ground or riverbanks to create nesting tunnels. Ground-nesting birds, like plovers and ostriches, may lay their eggs directly on the ground with little to no nesting materials, often relying on camouflage and the surrounding environment for protection. Other species, like penguins, do not build typical nests; instead, they incubate their eggs on their feet, using their body warmth to regulate the temperature. The location of the nest plays a crucial role in the survival and development of the eggs and the eventual hatchlings. Birds will choose locations that offer protection from predators, adequate shelter from inclement weather, and access to nearby food sources. Depending on the species and their specific nesting requirements, nest sites can be found in trees, shrubs, rock crevices, riverbanks, cliffs, and even in human-made structures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(2). The woman took her sweater off..","output":"A plausible effect of the sun emerging from the clouds could be option (2): The woman took her sweater off.  When the sun emerges from the clouds, its rays start to reach the earth's surface more directly, increasing the temperature. This leads to people feeling warmer, especially if they are in a sunny spot. If the woman was dressed in warm, layered clothing, she might start feeling uncomfortable due to the increase in temperature. Therefore, she would likely take her sweater off to feel cooler and more comfortable. In more detail, let's paint a picture of the scene. The day started as overcast with a cool temperature, compelling the woman to wear a sweater while strolling through a park. As she was walking, the sun abruptly emerged from the clouds, casting its warm, golden light on the entire park. The woman, feeling the sudden increase in warmth, decided it would be best to take off her sweater to better enjoy the sun's pleasant rays. The trees and flowers surrounding her seemed to lean towards the sunlight, enjoying the warmth as much as she did. The sun's rays glided through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the grass and creating a serene ambiance. As the woman continued on her path, she passed other people who were also basking in the sun, some taking off their outer garments to fully embrace the warmth. Squirrels scampered through the foliage and birds soared overhead, singing sweet melodies, rejoicing in the newfound golden embrace of the sun. In conclusion, the most plausible effect of the sun emerging from the clouds in this situation is that the woman would take her sweater off in response to the increased temperature. This scenario highlights how changes in weather conditions can influence people's actions and comfort levels, as well as inspire a feeling of joy and appreciation for the beauty of nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\",  answer the following question.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\"  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The Texas forest protection service did so to clean the forest.\\" correctly answer the question \\"What caused the fires?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"The Texas forest protection service did so to clean the forest.\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What caused the fires?\\" Based on the paragraph, there is no mention of the exact cause of the wildfire in northern Texas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Tease some clay from your central ball to the back to create a tail. A thick base connecting your tail to its body will create sturdiness in the finished product. Avoid making your tail too long, as this can crack during backing or harden in a way that is brittle and delicate. Push down slightly on the base of your tail to give the effect that the tail is coming out from between the dragon's legs, and not from the top of your clay ball, which will eventually turn into the back of your dragon. Wings can be tricky, and while learning the basics of sculpting you may want to keep your wings thick and small. Create your wings by pulling some clay from either side of the top of your clay ball. If you find that you need more clay, knead a small piece and use your thumb to blend the new clay with that of your clay ball, and then work this clay into the simple shape of a wing on both sides.  Thick wings will keep the clay from cracking there when you bake it and will result in a sturdier sculpture. The wings, being such a delicate part of the sculpture, are the most fragile and breakable part of the dragon. Exercise care while forming these. Your dragon may be a hornless variety, but if you had planned on making a horned dragon, take a small amount of surplus clay and knead it in your hands. Then, shape two cones for your horns and lightly press each into the head of your dragon. Use a little water to dampen the base of your cones. This can help keep your horns in place. It's likely that your clay ball is still mostly round at this point, with limbs, head, tail, wings, and horns attached. However, the bodies of dragons are usually more elongated and oval in shape. Press gently on the rounded sides of your clay ball to squish the circular shape into a longer oval one. At this stage, your dragon should be mostly formed, but you should consider using a little extra clay and your knitting needles to add a ridge along the back of your dragon. This can be done by:  Kneading some extra clay. Pulling off little pieces. Rolling tiny cones, damping the base of the cones, and pressing the cones along the spine of the dragon. Adding a contour line with your knitting needles to either side of the spine. Dragons, in most mythologies, have bat-like wings. These often come to a point at the highest point and have some bones dividing the wings into parts or sections. Using your finest knitting needle, you should carefully:  Trace a line along the inside of the outer boundary of your wing. Add lines from the top of the wing to the bottom of the wing, splitting each into regular sections. Avoid thinning your wings too much or applying too much pressure. Thin clay cracks easily when baked or after being baked, and even well formed wings will be delicate. The small size of this amateur model will limit the amount of detail you are adding unless you have a very steady hand and very precise needles. However, you should be able to use your knitting needles to gently carve out the shape of two eyes and a mouth line around the outer rim of your triangular head.","output":"In the process of creating a clay dragon sculpture, start by forming a tail from the central clay ball, ensuring it has a thick base for sturdiness and keeping it a moderate length to prevent cracking. Position the tail to seem like it emerges from between the dragon's legs. When sculpting wings, consider making them small and thick while learning the basics to prevent breakage. Create wings by pulling clay from the top of the clay ball and blending in additional clay if needed. Form the wings on both sides, maintaining thickness to avoid cracking during baking. If you wish to create a horned dragon, knead a small amount of clay and shape two cones for the horns, pressing them into the dragon's head while dampening the base for better attachment. Transform the dragon's body into an elongated oval shape by gently pressing the rounded sides of the clay ball. Your dragon should now have limbs, head, tail, wings, and horns attached.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  and a hint : It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  Please answer this question : Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","output":"Team A, which heated the can of soup over the fire without venting it first, had a higher likelihood of their can exploding.

The Piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet (300 m) in the west. Because of the rapid population growth in the Piedmont, a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers, housing, and corporate offices. Agriculture is steadily declining in importance. The major rivers of the Piedmont, such as the Yadkin and Catawba, tend to be fast-flowing, shallow, and narrow. At what point does the coastal plin transition to the Piedmont region?","output":"The coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.

Ross, a lawyer, lived on the Upper West Side with their two daughters and were content to spend weekends in an 1810 clapboard farmhouse in Amenia, N.Y. But that was before they were seduced by Holleywood. Their contractor, Rob Anderson of Sharon, Conn., was the one who made the introduction. It was the fall of 2010, and he was renovating their farmhouse kitchen when he happened to mention that he had come across what he called the deal of the century: an Italianate-style manor named after Alexander Hamilton Holley (a governor of Connecticut who built it in 1853) that had just been listed for 1.475 million. The house, in Lakeville, Conn., on the shore of Lake Wononscopomuc, had exceptional bones, he said: a limestone foundation, a basement that was bone dry, a post-and-beam frame without any rot, and floors that didn’t creak. Still, it was a bit of a fixer-upper. It sat on nearly nine acres overgrown with weeds and vines. The kitchen was a relic from the 1970s, complete with metal cabinets and fluorescent lights. The floors were covered in layers of dirt. And the four-story octagonal turret had stained-glass windows that were so dark and grimy, it was hard to tell what condition they were in. Ms. Ross was curious. So the next day, she drove over to see for herself. And there, amid the brambles, was what looked like a haunted house. “When I walked in the door, I felt I was gripped by madness,” said Ms. Ross, 59. “It was like falling in love. You know when you’re smitten with someone and you can’t get enough of them — their touch, the sound of their voice, the smell of their hair? It was like that.” Mr. Ross, who is now 70, didn’t share those feelings at first. “I slid into it,” he said of his relationship with the filth-encrusted house. But after a tentative “dating period,” he added, “I fell in love.” John Holley Rudd, a great-great-grandson of the original owner, sold it to them for 900,000, and they began a meticulous restoration, one that would cost 2.2 million and take two years. Mr. Anderson; Frank Garretson, an architect in Sheffield, Mass.; and various local artisans assisted the Rosses in their efforts to bring the house back to its origins. They peeled off layers of wallpaper to find the original paint colors and ripped out the dropped ceiling in the kitchen to reveal the 10-foot-high one above it. They scraped off decades of dirt, uncovering striped parquet floors made of white ash and mahogany, and restored the original radiators and the kitchen stove to working order. Along the way, they discovered clues to the home’s history: an 1887 Indian-head penny hidden under a bookcase; a BB gun buried in the yard; two metal hair curlers tucked into a cabinet. Ms. Ross hired Jackie Mock, an artist who works with everyday ephemera, to turn these and other found objects into art pieces that fill a “museum” in the turret. Holleywood has 20 rooms, but the Rosses spend most of their time on the first floor. Their favorite room is the library overlooking the lake, where they read by the fireplace. They eat most of their meals in the breakfast room, where a converted 1915 coal stove now burns wood. The adjacent kitchen has been modernized as well, with a six-burner DCS stove. To the delight of guests, though, some of the kitchen’s original features remain, including the annunciator bell, which was once used to summon the servants. It now works as well as it did when the house was built. But as Ms. Ross said ruefully, “The only one it calls into service is me.” An earlier version of this article and the accompanying slide show misstated the shape of the home’s turret. It is octagonal, not hexagonal.","output":"This news article is about a couple, Helen and Donald Ross, who fell in love with an old Italianate-style house called Holleywood.

She put lipstick   and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop. In 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe.

State media said a third person from the case was also pardoned. It is not clear if this is the Australian Peter Greste, who was deported in February. They were sentenced to three years in prison last month after a retrial. Prosecutors accused them of collaborating with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood after the overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi by the military in 2013. The journalists denied the allegation and said they were simply reporting the news. Legal experts said the charges were unfounded and politically motivated. A statement from President Sisi's office issued on Wednesday said Fahmy and Mohamed were named on a decree pardoning 100 young people \\"who had received final court sentences, having been convicted on the grounds of violating the anti-protest law and assaulting police forces\\". \\"Other prisoners were pardoned due to their health conditions and on humanitarian grounds,\\" it added. Also named were the prominent activists Yara Sallam and Sanaa Seif, who were jailed in 2014 for taking part in an \\"illegal protest\\". After their release, the two journalists were dropped off in a Cairo suburb still wearing their prison uniforms. \\"The whole nightmare is over,\\" said Mr Mohamed. \\"We're going to travel the world, we're going to celebrate, we're going to party,\\" said Mr Fahmy. \\"I will continue fighting for press freedom.\\" Al Jazeera said in a report on its website that it \\"continues to demand all charges and sentences against its journalists are dropped\\", noting that Greste and six other employees had been convicted in absentia. The pardons were issued by Mr Sisi ahead of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha and a day before he travels to New York to address the UN General Assembly. He had said he would be willing to pardon the Al Jazeera journalists once the judicial process had ended. Fahmy, who renounced his Egyptian citizenship to qualify for deportation in February, is expected to leave for Canada following his release. The case against the journalists began in December 2013, when they were arrested at a hotel used by Al Jazeera English to report from Cairo after its bureau was raided by police. The journalists were initially convicted in June 2014 after a trial that was widely condemned. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to seven years in prison, while Mohamed was given a 10-year sentence after also being found guilty of possessing a spent bullet casing. In January, Egypt's Court of Cassation ordered a retrial after ruling that the original court had been \\"hasty in pronouncing its verdict\\". Their convictions at retrial on 29 August were described as an \\"outrage\\" and an embarrassment for President Sisi by Amal Clooney, one of Fahmy's lawyers.

Write an article based on this \\"Google charges marketers even when its own checks indicate that adverts were not viewed by human beings, according to researchers.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Google Charging Marketers for Ads Unseen by Humans Raises Concerns In an increasingly digital world, online advertising has become indispensable for businesses and marketers to reach their target audience. The rapid growth of the internet and the vast amounts of data generated by users have led to the development of sophisticated methods to target potential customers. Google, being the dominant player in the online advertisement industry, holds considerable market power and influence over the advertising ecosystem. However, recent research has revealed that Google may be charging marketers for ads that have not been viewed by humans, leading to serious concerns over transparency and advertising effectiveness. Google AdWords, the popular advertising platform, enables businesses to create ads targeting specific keywords, interests, and demographics. A crucial aspect of online advertising is calculating the views and impressions generated by ads, which factor into the cost per click (CPC) and cost per thousand impressions (CPM) models set by Google. However, researchers have discovered that Google charges marketers even when its own checks indicate that the advertisements were not viewed by human beings. The implications of these findings are significant, not only for marketers and advertisers investing in Google ads but also for the advertising industry as a whole. Charging for ads that were never seen by potential customers leads to wasted marketing budgets and affects businesses' return on investment (ROI). Moreover, it erodes trust between the company and its clients, further hampering the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns. It is worth noting that the challenges of effectively targeting and serving ads to human audiences are not new. Online advertising has faced issues like ad fraud, where bots are used to generate fake impressions. Also, there is the problem of ad misplacement or serving ads alongside unsuitable content. These issues require constant monitoring and improvement by ad platforms to ensure that businesses are getting the desired results from their advertising investments. Given the current findings, it is crucial to ask why Google would allow such practices. There seem to be two plausible explanations: 1. Pressure to meet financial targets: Advertising is the primary source of revenue for Google, accounting for around 80% of its total earnings. Fierce competition from other advertising platforms, as well as an ever-changing digital landscape, may increase the pressure to meet financial targets. This pressure could lead to questionable practices like charging marketers for unseen ads. 2. Inadequate monitoring and filtering: Google's advertising machinery is vast, catering to millions of customers globally. There could be instances where its systems fail to adequately monitor and filter out ads that were not seen by humans. While this does not absolve Google of its responsibility to ensure transparency, it indicates that flaws in the system may be leading to undesirable outcomes. Considering the impact on both marketers and the advertising industry, Google must take these findings seriously and take immediate steps to rectify the issue. A multi-pronged approach can be adopted, such as: 1. Enhancing transparency: Google needs to provide clearer communications related to ad impressions and views, along with the details of how these are calculated. A comprehensive breakdown of the costs incurred for viewed and non-viewed ads, as well as reasons for non-viewed ads, will enable marketers to make informed decisions. 2. Improving monitoring and filtering mechanisms: Google should invest in enhancing its checks to identify and filter out ads not viewed by humans. Robust measures need to be in place to ensure that marketers are only charged for genuine views and impressions. 3. Industry collaboration on ad fraud prevention: Google can work with other industry players to develop and implement best practices and standards in addressing ad fraud and other online advertising challenges. By fostering a collaborative environment, the advertising ecosystem will benefit and move toward greater transparency and effectiveness. In conclusion, the revelations about Google charging marketers for unseen ads raise serious concerns that need to be addressed by the company and the advertising industry. By enhancing transparency, improving monitoring and filtering mechanisms, and fostering industry collaboration, Google can work to rebuild trust with its clients and ensure that the potential of online advertising is realized for businesses and marketers alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Reese's Puffs is a breakfast cereal inspired by a candy created in what year? Answer:","output":"Reese's Puffs is a delectable breakfast cereal produced by General Mills, which was inspired by Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, a popular chocolate and peanut butter candy. The iconic Reese's Peanut Butter Cups owe their existence to H.B. Reese, a former dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Milton S. Hershey, the founder of Hershey's chocolate. In 1928, H.B. Reese decided to start his own candy company, the H.B. Reese Candy Co., in his basement in Pennsylvania, with the goal of providing delicious confections to the public. While Reese manufactured a variety of candy, he was eventually inspired to create a unique product that combined the flavors of rich chocolate and creamy peanut butter. This delightful treat was christened as Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups quickly gained popularity and were eventually assimilated into the Hershey's chocolate lineup when the H.B. Reese Candy Co. merged with the Hershey Chocolate Corporation in 1963, after H.B. Reese's passing. In 1994, General Mills cleverly reimagined this long-standing favorite candy into a tasty breakfast cereal named Reese's Puffs. This innovative cereal features sweet and crunchy puffs made with real Reese's peanut butter and delectable Hershey's cocoa, thus providing an enticing fusion of the original Peanut Butter Cup's flavors in a breakfast option. In conclusion, Reese's Puffs cereal, inspired by the beloved Reese's Peanut Butter Cup candy, can trace its origins back to 1928 when H.B. Reese first created the iconic chocolate and peanut butter treat. The endearing popularity of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups has persisted for decades, leading General Mills to transform these classic flavors into a delicious breakfast cereal in 1994, which now continues to be enjoyed by many worldwide."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

PUBLISHED:. 07:35 EST, 27 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:03 EST, 27 August 2013. Three years ago I underwent the menopause at the age of 50, shortly after losing my dear sister to breast cancer (she was just 50). I started to experience hot flushes, night sweats and high anxiety but was reluctant to take HRT because of the family history of cancer — my mother also died from the disease aged 64. As an alternative, my chemist recommended red clover with isoflavones and green tea. Since my first tablets a few months ago my periods have returned and I am starting to feel myself again. But could a herbal remedy have such a profound effect — or have my periods come back due to me overcoming my grief? J. Lipman, Surrey. Herbal way to happy: There are several supplements on the market which mimics the effect of the body';s natural oestrogen. The symptoms of the menopause can be extremely debilitating — and I’m sorry to hear of your distress and bereavement. The symptoms — such as hot flushes —  occur because of lack of production of the female hormone oestrogen by the ovaries, which have reached the end of their reproductive life and are gradually shutting down. The changing hormone levels may affect the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that acts as the body’s thermostat, and send it out of kilter. Your decision to avoid hormone. replacement therapy, which is very effective at easing these symptoms,. was wise given your strong family history of breast cancer. There is. much evidence that some, if not most, breast cancers are stimulated by. the presence of oestrogen, and HRT consists mainly of this. Popping pills: Taking herbal supplements could have a positive effect. You ask whether the restoration of your monthly cycle and the dramatic resolution of your unpleasant menopausal symptoms are down to the herbal remedy and the easing of your grief. Given that it’s three years since your menopausal symptoms started, I suspect it’s the remedy rather than the psychological change that has been at work. The remedy has had an instant and powerful oestrogen-like effect, stopping the hot flushes and restoring your cycle, as well as having a magical reaction on your mood. There are several such natural substances available, and we refer to them as gonadomimetic — meaning that they mimic the effects of your own natural oestrogen. My concern is that in terms of cancer risk, we do not know for certain that such preparations are any safer than taking HRT. There is a view that if these products are natural, or herbal, then they must be safer. But there have been no large-scale trials to address that specific issue. I have real concerns over the safety of this compound. If the oestrogen-like substances in the red clover are strong enough to relieve the symptoms of the menopause so effectively, then there is a possibility that these compounds may also raise your risk of cancer. You must consider this matter very carefully given your family history, despite the great benefit you have obtained. There are non-oestrogen alternatives to HRT, including lifestyle measures (some evidence suggests that regular, gentle exercise such as swimming can reduce the hot flushes) and medication options. Some antidepressants may also decrease hot flushes and improve mood, and the drugs gabapentin (an anti-epilepsy drug) and clonidine may also ease the episodes. Perhaps now is the time for an appointment with your GP to discuss your concerns and treatment options. I was diagnosed years ago with a slow heart rate, but have recently found that I feel very tired in the mornings — it takes me around an hour or so to get going. Is my heart condition to blame for my dreadful fatigue? Alan Cockayne, by email. You are describing, I believe, a condition called sick sinus syndrome or sinus node dysfunction. The sinus node is the natural pacemaker of the heart: it sets the rate. You have not stated how old you are, but ageing of the cells of that area of the heart muscle may result in this timer becoming unreliable (this condition is more common in the over-70s), and the heart rate can become slower. The condition, which is fairly uncommon, results in not enough blood being pumped around the body, triggering symptoms of light-headedness, breathlessness, fatigue or palpitations. In your case, these episodes seem to particularly strike at night, which is why you are feeling so tired in the morning. Diagnosis involves a 24-hour or even a seven-day ECG (an electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical activity of the heart). It’s also important to look for any easily treatable causes — for instance, certain medications can affect heart rhythm. You tell me in your longer letter that you are taking a small dose of amlodipine for high blood pressure. This is one of a group of medicines called calcium channel-blockers, which may affect heart rate and, therefore, be exacerbating your symptoms. (There are alternative medications for your blood pressure that won’t adversely affect the sinus node and it’s important to discuss this point with your GP.) One option for a slow heart rate is to have a pacemaker implanted. While this helps reverse any fainting or light-headedness in most patients — important for preventing falls — it may not have such a beneficial effect when the main symptom is fatigue, as in your case. And as there are potential complications from such surgery, including infection or bleeding, the decision to have a pacemaker fitted is more complicated and involves carefully weighing up the risks and benefits. Once the sinus node starts to deteriorate, it tends to continue doing so. For that reason I believe you should be having periodic reviews by a cardiologist — and every time you are seen, the correlation between your symptoms and  the ECG recordings should  be re-evaluated. Fork off: Modern westerners eat too much meat. When my children went to school, the. headmaster insisted they had swimming lessons from the first day. ‘No. one ever died from not learning French,’ he would say. But there was. another important message schools could have been passing on: the. importance of healthy living, or rather, healthy eating. However, this just wasn’t given any thought in those days. The. decades have passed and I am now a grandparent and I think about this a. lot. My patients, as a group, have aged with me, and many are suffering. the ravages of coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and. stroke. And I find myself constantly wishing that 30 years ago I’d been. as enlightened about healthy eating as I am now. Medical. men like me spend a lot of time seeking out the nooks and crannies of. science to see what can be applied to the quest for the better health of. our patients, as well as those close to us. But sometimes the answer is. closer to home — in the kitchen. I recently attended a fascinating. evening at Kew Gardens in London to learn more about the health benefits. of eating less meat. They. were not advocating ditching meat altogether — this was not a push. towards vegetarianism — but a careful, balanced look at why it can be a. good thing to eat less meat and more plant-based foods. Since. the days when I was at school the world population has doubled, and now. 70  per cent of land throughout the world is given over to agricultural. use to grow crops to feed animals. The result is we are over-eating the. foods — meat and dairy products — that are least good for our health. and  the environment. In my. childhood, the biggest treat at the end of the school holidays was to. have chicken for dinner: it was special and we called it ‘The Last. Supper’. Yet, thanks to mass production, by the time I was at university. even we impoverished medical students bought chicken by the bucketload. The. experts at Kew argued there could be much benefit to be gained from. tweaking the balance of what we eat, little by little, to ensure that at. least two-thirds of the food at each meal comes from plants —. wholegrain carbohydrates, nuts, beans, lentils, fruit, vegetables and. plant-based alternatives to dairy foods, including soya. Meat,. fish, eggs, and dairy foods can be a third — or less — but of better. quality. In this way we reduce the intake of bad types of fat, have a. lower incidence of heart disease, diabetes and even cancer, and place. less burden on the resources of the world. But. how can we achieve this change? It has to begin with education, and. this means teaching human biology and nutrition, instructing children. about food, the relationship to future health and how to develop good. eating habits. Let’s do it. Highlights:","output":"1. The author underwent menopause, experiencing hot flushes, night sweats, and high anxiety, but avoided HRT due to family history of cancer. 2.

Here is an article: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – A jury on Wednesday acquitted an Arizona woman accused of flashing underage boys at a bar mitzvah last year and performing a sex act on one of the teens. Lindsey Ann Radomski was found not guilty on all 18 misdemeanor counts. Radomski, 34, cried and hugged her attorneys after the verdict was read by a Scottsdale City Court judge. The jury got the case late Tuesday afternoon after a nearly seven-week trial. \\"I'm just incredibly happy it's over. Thank God,\\" Radomski said outside the courthouse. She faced a sentence of up to six months in jail, a 2,500 fine and three years' probation if convicted. Radomski was arrested in March 2015 on charges including public sexual indecency with contact and contributing to the delinquency of a child. A grand jury refused to indict her on felony charges because of a lack of evidence. Police said the yoga instructor invited seven boys ages 11 to 15 into a bedroom at a bar mitzvah and flashed her newly augmented breasts. She reportedly allowed the boys to fondle her breasts and then allegedly performed a sex act on a 15-year-old boy. Radomski said she was drinking that night and doesn't remember what happened. Her attorney said she was drugged while at the event, and she actually was the victim and the boys sexually assaulted her. Prosecutors said Radomski may have been drunk at the bar mitzvah, but she still should be held responsible for her actions.

He had money for the ice cream truck in his pocket and she was very happy. The ice cream truck had been parked at the curb waiting for children for a very long time. The ice cream truck driver thought that no more children were coming to get ice cream so he started pulling away from the curb when they got to the corner. They yelled. They screamed, \\"Stop!

Write a title for this article: Some church leaders in Kentucky say guns can be an effective way to beef up the flock. Organizers of a Baptist church convention said it will use guns giveaways across the state to attract nonbelievers who are more prone to go duck hunting than sit in a church pew, The Courier-Journal reported. The goal of the Kentucky Baptist Convention's \\"Second Amendment Celebrations\\" is to \\"point people to Christ,\\" the report said. \\"You have to know the hook that will attract people, and hunting is huge in Kentucky,” Chuck McAlister, a former pastor and ex host of an Outdoor Channel hunting show, told the paper. McAlister is also the convention’s team leader for evangelism. He said he can understand how the initiative can draw criticism. But he told the paper that traditional ways to reach out to the community have not been effective. \\"The days of hanging a banner in front of your church and saying you're having a revival and expecting the community to show up is over,\\" he told the paper. He insists that the gun giveaway is meant for hunters and for protection only, but that has not stopped critics who called the event a contradiction of the teachings of Jesus. One of those critics is Rev. Joe Phelps, the pastor of a Louisville Baptist church. Phelps quoted Jesus who said, \\"Put away the sword.\\" \\"Can you picture Jesus giving away guns or toasters or raffle tickets?... He gave away bread once, but that was a sign -- not a sales pitch,\\" he reportedly said. Organizers point to past events and say there's evidence of effectiveness. They expect about 1,000 people to attend one service at Paduch's Lone Oak Baptist Church, where attendees will be served steak dinners and have a chance to win 25 handguns, long guns and shotguns, the report said.

Chris Faraone argues that Hitler's argument outlining a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, which sees little in the way of hardcopy sales, is perfect for the more discrete and disposable world of digital books. Like erotica and romance novels, writes Faraone, readers who would otherwise be embarrassed may anonymously buy a copy of the text and stay under the radar while using an e-reader. The success of OPTIONS: - Adolf Hitler, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Amazon, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Chris Faraone, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Daily Mail, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Faraone, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Fifty Shades of Grey, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Hitler, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Jewish, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - Mein Kampf, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. - iTunes, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear.","output":"The success of Mein Kampf, which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012, may be an extreme example, the logic seems clear. The comparison between Adolf Hitler's racist manifesto and the popular erotica novel Fifty Shades of Grey may initially seem far-fetched. However, Chris Faraone's argument suggests that the common ground between these two best-selling ebooks lies in the fact that digital formats offer a discreet way for readers to consume content without the fear of judgment or potential embarrassment that may come with purchasing physical copies. The rise in popularity of e-reading devices such as Kindles, Nooks, and tablets has changed the way people interact with and consume written content. Many readers now prefer the convenience and portability that ebooks offer. This shift also has implications for the types of content that become popular as digital books. As Faraone points out, the anonymity associated with e-reading devices provides a level of comfort for those who might hesitate to purchase a physical copy of an erotica novel like Fifty Shades of Grey or a historically controversial book like Mein Kampf. The discreet nature of digital books allows readers to explore different genres and subjects without the fear of judgment that may come with carrying around a physical book that displays its content on the cover. This aspect of e-reading culture has undoubtedly impacted the popularity of certain books and genres, leading to sales surges in historically controversial or taboo topics. For some readers, the opportunity to consume these types of content in a less visible way could be a significant factor in their decision to purchase and read ebooks. Additionally, the digital world enables readers to access content more quickly and easily, often with just a few clicks. This instant gratification could further contribute to the appeal of ebooks, especially when dealing with stigmatized or controversial content. Readers may be more inclined to impulsively download an ebook than they would to take the time and effort to purchase and carry around a physical copy. The phenomenon Faraone describes of potentially controversial or taboo books like Mein Kampf and Fifty Shades of Grey finding success in the digital realm highlights the impact that new technology and shifting cultural norms can have on the consumption and popularity of written content. As e-reading continues to grow and evolve, it will be interesting to see how this trend further affects the types of books that become bestsellers and shape the overall literary landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Two sister villages, both situated near volcanoes, experience daily earthquakes. Green village started recording an increased size and number of earthquakes one day. Blue village didn't experience a change in the number of earthquakes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village had less magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them? Answer:","output":"Answer: Blue Village Step 1: Identify the factors affecting earthquakes in the villages In the given information, both villages are near volcanoes and experience daily earthquakes. The main factor affecting these earthquakes is likely to be the movement of magma in the volcanic system. Step 2: Analyze the changes in earthquakes in each village Green village has started recording an increased size and number of earthquakes. This suggests that there is more activity in the volcanic system, possibly more magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near the village. On the other hand, Blue village hasn't experienced a change in the number of earthquakes, indicating that the volcanic activity remains constant. Step 3: Compare the villages based on the volcanic activity Since Green village is experiencing an increase in the size and number of earthquakes, it's likely that more magma is pushing upward into the magma chamber near that village. In contrast, Blue village has not experienced this change, which suggests that there is less magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near it.

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"Albert Jennings Fountain was a distinguished individual who served in the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Cavalry during the American Civil War. The 1st Regiment was a cavalry unit that contributed significantly to the war effort under the command of the President, Abraham Lincoln. As a vital figure within the military branch, Fountain played a crucial role in shaping the battles and outcomes during this turbulent period in American history. Albert Jennings Fountain was born on October 23, 1838, in Staten Island, New York. His decision to join the military was fueled by his strong sense of patriotism and duty. During the Civil War, the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Cavalry was called into action, and Fountain enlisted, serving as an officer in various capacities, from first lieutenant to colonel of the regiment. His dedication and leadership abilities were instrumental in the success of the regiment as it faced numerous challenges and adversities throughout the war. The American Civil War, which lasted from April 12, 1861, to May 9, 1865, was a defining conflict in the history of the United States. It resulted from deep-rooted economic, political, and social divisions between the Northern and the Southern states that culminated in a fierce struggle over states' rights and the continued existence of slavery. During this conflict, Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States and served as the commander-in-chief of the Union Army. Lincoln was a steadfast advocate for the abolition of slavery and the preservation of national unity, and he issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. He led the nation through its darkest hour and played a vital role in shaping the outcome of the Civil War. While serving in the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Cavalry, Albert Jennings Fountain and his fellow soldiers fought in several significant battles, contributing to the larger goals of the Union Army in their quest for victory. It is worth noting that the New Mexico Territory was located far from the primary battlegrounds of the Civil War, yet the troops stationed there endured harsh conditions as they engaged in critical skirmishes designed to protect the territory from invasion and secure vital supply routes. Following the end of the war, Albert Jennings Fountain went on to have a successful career as a lawyer, politician, and newspaper publisher. However, his time served in the military and in the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Cavalry during the American Civil War was a defining period in his life. Without a doubt, his service under President and commander Abraham Lincoln shaped his worldview and granted him a unique perspective on the complexities of a nation divided against itself."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who assisted Bevel, King, and the SCLC to lead the Selma to Montgomery marches?  Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs  Question: \\"Republicans cut which organization's budget deeply in 1996?\\" Answer: \\"The Legal Services Corp\\" Is this answer correct?

What cheese is good to substitute for manchego cheese? What's a good blue cheese pizza? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose your answer from: 1). no; 2). yes;","output":"1). No, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question asks about a suitable cheese that can be substituted for Manchego cheese. Manchego cheese is a Spanish cheese made from sheep's milk and has a firm, slightly crumbly texture with a rich, buttery, and slightly nutty flavor. If you need a substitute for Manchego cheese, there are a few options that can closely mimic its taste and texture. Some good substitutes include: 1. Queso de la Serena: This is another Spanish sheep's milk cheese with a slightly milder flavor than Manchego but shares a similar firm, crumbly texture. 2. Queso Iberico: This Spanish cheese is made from a blend of sheep's, goat's, and cow's milk, and has a smooth texture and slightly pungent flavor that is similar to Manchego. 3. Pecorino Romano: An Italian sheep's milk cheese that has a sharp, tangy flavor and a hard, crumbly texture, making it a good substitute for Manchego, especially when grating over dishes. 4. Idiazabal: Another Spanish sheep's milk cheese with a firm texture, it has a smokey, slightly tangy flavor which can work well as a substitute for Manchego. 5. Zamorano: This Spanish cheese is also made from sheep's milk and has a similar firm, crumbly texture, and nutty flavor to Manchego. The second question asks for a recommendation for a good blue cheese pizza. Blue cheese pizza typically refers to a pizza that uses blue cheese as one of the main ingredients. Blue cheese is a type of cheese characterized by its distinctive blue or green veining and sharp, pungent flavor, often caused by the presence of the Penicillium mold. Here's a recipe for a delicious blue cheese pizza: Ingredients: - Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade) - Olive oil - 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese (such as Gorgonzola, Roquefort, or Stilton) - 1/2 cup grated mozzarella cheese - 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion - 1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes - 2 cups fresh arugula - Balsamic glaze or reduction (optional) Instructions: 1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and prepare your pizza stone or baking sheet. 2. Roll out your pizza dough to your desired thickness on a lightly floured surface. 3. Transfer the pizza dough to your prepared stone or baking sheet. 4. Lightly brush the pizza dough with olive oil and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, leaving a small border for the crust. 5. Evenly distribute the crumbled blue cheese, red onion slices, and cherry tomatoes on top of the mozzarella cheese layer. 6. Bake your pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. 7. Remove your pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes before topping it with fresh arugula. 8. Optionally, drizzle some balsamic glaze or reduction on top of the arugula for an extra touch of flavor. 9. Slice the pizza and enjoy! In conclusion, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question pertains to finding a substitute for Manchego cheese, while the second question is about creating a delicious blue cheese pizza."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  book publisher  for the following movie plot:  The quiet life of a Paris family is disturbed when they receive a series of surveillance tapes of the exterior of their residence from an anonymous source. Georges Laurent is the successful host of a French literary television program, living with his wife Anne, a book publisher, and their 12-year-old son Pierrot. Unmarked videocassettes arrive on their doorstep, tapes that show extended observation of their home's exterior from a static street camera that is never noticed. At first passive and harmless, but later accompanied by crude, disturbing crayon drawings, the tapes lead to questions about Georges' early life that disrupt both his work and marriage. But because the tapes do not contain an open threat, the police refuse to help the family. One videotape leads Georges to the modest HLM apartment of Majid, an Algerian man whose parents worked for Georges' family before they were killed in the Paris massacre of 1961. The orphaned Majid remained in the Laurent home, and the parents at one time intended to adopt him. Georges confronts Majid about the tapes, but he denies involvement. However, the encounter intensifies his guilty flashbacks and recurring nightmares of a young Majid spitting blood, cutting off a rooster's head, and menacing him. One day Pierrot does not come home from school and Anne cannot locate him. Georges and Anne suspect that he is kidnapped by Majid. They go to the police, who accompany Georges to Majid's apartment. There they find Majid's son, and father and son both deny knowledge of a kidnapping. The police arrest them but they are released the next morning. Pierrot returns home shortly afterwards; he had spent the night at a friend's house without telling anyone. When Anne scolds Pierrot, he accuses her of adultery because he had witnessed Anne permitting a few ambiguous caresses from a family friend.

Philosophy of Science: Why are temples closed and people are not allowed to move outside on an eclipse day? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Hindu temples are closed during eclipses due to various religious, cultural, and traditional beliefs originating from ancient Hindu scriptures.  The explanation behind this custom can be divided into two key areas: spiritual reasons and scientific reasons. 1. Spiritual Reasons: According to Hindu mythology, the demon Rahu and Ketu are believed to cause solar and lunar eclipses. As the story goes, the demon Rahu once consumed the divine nectar or amrita in a deceptive manner, which made him immortal. However, just as Rahu swallowed the nectar, the Sun and Moon informed Lord Vishnu of what transpired. Consequently, Lord Vishnu severed Rahu's head and body, which remained immortal due to the nectar. Enraged, Rahu and Ketu continuously take revenge on the Sun and Moon by consuming them during eclipses. Hinduism emphasizes the importance of purity in temples, as they are considered abodes of the deities. During eclipses, it is believed that negative energies and impurities are dominant in the environment. Thus, out of respect for the deity, and to maintain the purity and sanctity of the temple, people avoid visiting temples during eclipses. 2. Scientific Reasons: Across history, science and religion have been intertwined in various ways, and some ancient customs often arose from scientific observations. Many rules and regulations followed in ancient times were established to safeguard the health and well-being of the community. In the past, it was discovered that the harmful solar radiation increases during an eclipse. The lack of proper understanding of these phenomena led people to link the events with misfortune. As a result, these observations took a religious tone, and certain customs and beliefs emerged, such as not venturing outside during an eclipse or avoiding food during this time. The two questions presented focus on different aspects: a. \\"Why are Hindu temples closed during eclipses?\\": This question specifically addresses the custom of closing temples during eclipses, which is rooted in religious and cultural beliefs. b. \\"Philosophy of Science: Why are temples closed and people are not allowed to move outside on an eclipse day?\\": This question combines two separate topics: temple closure and restrictions on outdoor activities during eclipses. While it touches on the religious aspect of temple closures, it also asks for an explanation concerning the restrictions on movement outside during an eclipse, incorporating scientific understanding. In conclusion, although these two questions seem similar, they explore different dimensions of the custom surrounding eclipses in Hinduism. The first question primarily focuses on religious reasons for temple closure during eclipses, whereas the second question delves into the broader context of restrictions, encompassing both religious and scientific aspects."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century.

Text: In combinatorial game theory terms, Go is a zero-sum, perfect-information, partisan, deterministic strategy game, putting it in the same class as chess, draughts (checkers) and Reversi (Othello); however it differs from these in its game play. Although the rules are simple, the practical strategy is extremely complex. Question: is the game go the same as othello?","output":"Answer: No, the game of Go is not the same as Othello (also known as Reversi). Although Go and Othello are both zero-sum, perfect-information, partisan, deterministic strategy games, and share some similarities in basic principles, they differ significantly in terms of rules, gameplay aspects, and strategic depth. 1. Game Rules: The rules of Go and Othello are quite distinct from each other: Go: Go is played on a grid of either 19x19, 13x13, or 9x9 intersections, with the main objective being to surround a larger area of the board than the opponent. In Go, each player has a supply of flat stones, with one player using black stones and the other using white stones. The players take turns placing a stone on any vacant intersection, with the aim being to encircle the opponent's stones to capture them and control territory. Players can pass their turn if they feel there are no beneficial moves to be made, and the game ends when both players pass their turns consecutively. Othello: Othello is played on an 8x8 board, with 64 reversible black and white disks. Each player takes turns placing a disk of their color on the board to enclose and capture the opponent's disks between their own. Captured disks then change to the color of the capturing player. The game ends when the board is filled or when no valid moves are left for either player. The player with the majority of disks of their color on the board at the end of the game wins. 2. Gameplay Aspects: While both games involve players taking turns to place pieces on the board, the gameplay aspects of each game are different: Go: In Go, the emphasis is on encircling territory using chains of stones and capturing opponent's stones to gain more control over the board. Strategic concepts like life and death, influence, aji, and sente and gote play vital roles in determining the course of the game. The scoring system rewards the player for the territory they control and for captured stones. Othello: In Othello, the gameplay primarily revolves around capturing and flipping the opponent's disks to turn them into the player's own color. Simple rules lead to strategic decisions, as the placement of a disk affects not just the adjacent disks but also the overall balance of the board. The game focuses on quantity (majority of disks) rather than on territory. 3. Strategic Depth: In terms of strategic depth, Go is widely regarded as being a more complex game than Othello: Go: Go offers a vast number of potential board positions and moves, giving players immense strategic freedom, and results in a game with significant complexity. The larger board size also offers more variety in strategic and tactical possibilities. Aspiring Go players usually study a variety of opening and mid-game patterns, as well as the “endgame” technique in order to improve their skill level. Othello: While Othello also demands strategic thinking, its 8x8 board size and simpler capturing mechanics make it comparatively easier to learn and analyze. Many games, once reaching an advanced stage, can be solved using basic counting techniques and pattern recognition. Othello is often considered to be more approachable for casual players while still maintaining a high level of strategic interest for enthusiasts. In summary, Go and Othello are not the same games despite sharing some basic principles. They present distinct rules, gameplay aspects, and strategic depth that differentiate them from each other, with Go exhibiting a higher degree of complexity in comparison to Othello."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But one day, something unexpected happened. Big, white snowflakes began to fall from the sky and covered the whole city like a fluffy white blanket. Now, this snow was lovely to look at, but it also made it very hard for the people in the city to move around. The roads and streets became slippery, and the cars, buses, and trains had a difficult time getting through the snow. Because of all this, people called \\"commuters\\" who had to travel to work or school found themselves stuck in the snow, unable to move. Imagine being in a car, trying to go to your favorite place, but being surrounded by a wall of snow and not being able to get there. That's how these commuters felt, and some of them said, \\"it just felt hopeless.\\" They were sad and frustrated because they wanted to get to their destinations, but the snow was making it very hard to do so. When people get stuck like this, they often need help to get out of it. Thankfully, brave men and women called \\"snowplow drivers\\" came to their rescue. These special drivers have big, strong trucks with a wide blade on the front to push the snow out of the way and clear a path. This allowed the commuters to move and finally reach their destinations safely. The people in the city were very thankful for the snowplow drivers and all the hard work they did, but they also knew that they needed to be prepared for situations like this in the future. They decided they would plan smarter ways to travel when it snows, like leaving earlier, finding different transportation, or working from home if possible. In the end, the snowy day taught everyone a valuable lesson. They learned that sometimes life can be challenging and throw unexpected obstacles in our way, like a sudden snowstorm. But even if it feels hopeless at times, there's always hope - with a little help from our friends and a push in the right direction, we can overcome these obstacles and keep moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The awkward movement methods and constant script interuptions makes for a very frustrating game experience (I thought such games were supposed to be fun). I made it to the beginning of the second level and decided that it was time to quit the game for good since any further effort would only add to my already high frustration level. Perhaps I was expecting too much as a result of just finishing Myst III Exile (an awsome game).Oh well, I tried it. Perhaps I can find someone with more patience and gaming skills than I who would appreciate a freebee. The answer is:","output":"The review would decrease the chances of you buying the product.

Hypothesis: Two boys are outside. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Choose your answer from: [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","output":"[I] yes The premise states that two boys are splashing each other in the ocean. Since they are engaging in this activity within the ocean, it certainly means that they are outside. In the natural world, bodies of water, such as oceans, are typically outside or outdoors. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis stating \\"Two boys are outside\\" can be considered true if the premise is true. Let us analyze the situation in more detail:   - Premise: Two boys splashing each other in the ocean implies that they are physically present in a body of water 'ocean'. The ocean is situated outdoors or in an open environment; hence, they are not indoors or in any kind of enclosed space.    - Hypothesis: The hypothesis, in this case, is that the two boys are outside.   - Relevance to the premise: The hypothesis in question pertains to the same two boys involved in the activity mentioned in the premise. In both cases, we are analyzing the location or environment of these two individuals.  - Conclusion: It is valid to affirm that if the premise (two boys splashing each other in the ocean) is true, then the hypothesis stating that these boys are indeed outside holds true. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis represents a logical connection. The ocean, being an outside environment, validates the hypothesis' claim when the premise is known to be true. This demonstrates that we can conclude the hypothesis is true if the premise is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  I am facing a new situation today: Croatia and Italy were two countries of similar size and population located on opposite shores of the same sea. Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country caused the formation of fewer dead zones? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it appears that Croatia, with an economy based on tourism and fishing, would cause the formation of fewer dead zones compared to Italy, which bases its economy on conventional agriculture.  The reasoning behind this is that conventional agriculture often makes use of fertilizers and other chemicals to ensure high crop yields. When these chemicals run off into rivers, they eventually make their way to the ocean, contributing to marine pollution. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals from agriculture can lead to hypoxia, which in turn creates dead zones in the ocean. On the other hand, tourism and fishing industries do not involve the use of fertilizers or similar chemicals, and thus the level of such pollutants entering the ocean is likely to be lower. While any industry can contribute to marine debris and pollution through improper waste management, the key factor in the formation of dead zones - the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals - is more directly linked to agricultural practices. As such, Croatia's tourism and fishing-based economy would likely cause fewer dead zones compared to Italy's agriculture-driven economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the review, it can be concluded that the user likely would not recommend this product. There are several indicators in the review that support this conclusion: 1. The user experienced a significant issue with the product, as it stopped working after just two months of use. This demonstrates that the product may be unreliable and prone to malfunctioning. 2. The warranty process seemed to be a source of frustration for the user. The user mentions that they had to wait a month to get the product back after sending it in for repairs, during which time their warranty period was effectively reduced by a month. This could indicate potential shortcomings in the company's customer service and support. 3. The user also mentions that newer versions of the product now come with only a one-month warranty. This change in warranty time suggests that the company may not have confidence in the long-term durability and reliability of their product, which might deter potential customers from making a purchase. 4. The user had difficulties in communicating with the company's support team, which was based in India. The language barrier seemingly exacerbated the user's frustrations and might have left them feeling unsatisfied with the support they received. 5. The user explicitly recommends purchasing an iPod instead of the reviewed product. This statement implies that the user believes there are better, more reliable alternatives on the market, which they wished they had chosen in the first place. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is reasonable to conclude that the user would not recommend this product to others based on their own negative experience."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K.

Income: It denotes the money or earnings an individual or a business receives from various sources like salary, business profits, interests, dividends, or other forms of investment within a specified period, commonly a financial year. An individual's income can fall into various categories such as earned income (salary or wages), unearned income (dividends, interests), passive income (rental income, copyrights), and portfolio income (income from investments).  2. Taxes: Taxes are the compulsory financial charges or levies imposed on individuals or companies by a government entity (local, regional, or national) to fund various public expenditures. Taxes can be direct or indirect. Direct taxes are paid straight to the government and typically include income tax, corporate tax, and wealth tax. Indirect taxes are levied on goods and services, e.g., sales tax, VAT, and GST. 3. Abroad: This term refers to a location that is not one's original or current place of residence or operation. It is usually used to refer to another country or countries. When associated with income, taxes, or such elements, it mainly involves the rules and regulations regarding the transference or receiving of goods, services, or earnings from outside one's home country. 4. Denmark: This is a country located in Northern Europe. It is part of Scandinavia and shares southern border with Germany. When we talk about income taxes abroad in relation to Denmark, we consider the tax rules and regulations that Denmark has for non-resident workers or businesses operating in Denmark or Danish residents receiving income from foreign sources.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: After failing the rescue attempt of a raccoon in the Himalayas (a parody of the opening to the film Cliffhanger), Ace Ventura undergoes an emotional breakdown and goes on a personal soul-searching quest by becoming a Tibetan monk. He is approached by Fulton Greenwall, a British correspondent working for a provincial consulate in the fictional African country of Nibia. Being that Ace's influence is disruptive to the monastery, the Grand Abbot eagerly gives Ace excuses by which to justify his departure.Greenwall asks Ventura to find a sacred animal called Shikaka, which has become a point of contention. Shikaka, which is a great white bat, is a sacred animal for the Wachati and Wachootoo tribes of Nibia; whenever its name is spoken, the tribesmen must bow. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey, Spike, Ace travels to Africa and returns to his pet detective work.After arriving in Nibia and meeting with the head of the consulate, Vincent Cadby, Ace begins learning about his case as well as the possible suspects. Ace, normally an animal lover, must overcome his fear of bats in order to continue studying the case. He travels to the Wachati tribal village, where he learns that Shikaka is meant as a wedding present from the Wachati Princess, who is set to wed the Wachootoo Prince. If the bat is not returned in time, the Wachootoo will declare war on the Wachati tribe instead. Much of Ace's activity involves eliminating various suspects and enduring the problems of dealing with the Wachati and the Wachootoo, who refer to him as the \\"white devil\\". This proves difficult, and is made more so by other incidents including attempts to kill him. Reduced to the limit of his ability to solve mysteries, Ace consults the Grand Abbot via astral projection.Advised by the Abbot, Ace finally discovers that Vincent Cadby had taken the bat and hired Ace as a cover for his own crimes. Cadby plans to let the tribes destroy each other and take possession of their land, using the numerous bat caves containing guano to sell as fertilizer. Ace...

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what grinds rocks over time?\\" is \\"erosion\\", given that  weathering grinds rocks down? Answer:","output":"Yes, I believe that \\"erosion\\" is a valid and accurate answer to the question \\"what grinds rocks over time?\\". Erosion is a natural process that contributes to the shaping and transformation of the Earth's surface. It is crucial to understand the distinction between erosion and weathering, as both processes influence the degradation of rocks. However, they act in complementary and interconnected ways. Weathering is the process by which rocks are broken down into smaller fragments or chemically altered due to various factors, such as contact with air, water, and temperature fluctuations. Weathering is categorized into three main types:  1. Mechanical (or physical) weathering: Occurs when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces without any chemical change. This type of weathering includes processes like freeze-thaw action, thermal expansion, crystal growth, and abrasion due to wind, water, or ice transport. 2. Chemical weathering: Occurs when the minerals within the rocks are changed chemically, often due to reactions with water, oxygen, or other chemicals. Examples of chemical weathering include hydration, oxidation, dissolution, and hydrolysis. Over time, these processes can weaken rocks and make them more susceptible to physical weathering or erosion. 3. Biological weathering: The breakdown of rocks as a result of the actions of living organisms, such as plant roots breaking through rocks, lichen releasing chemicals that break down rock surfaces, or animals burrowing into the ground, creating spaces for water and air to enter. Erosion, on the other hand, involves the movement of weathered rock material from one location to another. The agents of erosion include water, wind, ice, and gravity. Over time, these forces grind down rocks, soil, and other particles, transporting them away from their original location. Erosion can generate a variety of landforms and contribute to the dynamic nature of Earth's landscape. While weathering breaks rocks into smaller fragments or alters their chemical composition, they may still remain in their original location. In contrast, erosion entails the transportation of these weathered materials. Moreover, weathering mainly focuses on the rock itself, whereas erosion accounts for the broader interaction between rocks, the landscape, and various erosive forces. To sum up, the term \\"erosion\\" is the appropriate answer to \\"what grinds rocks over time?\\" as it encompasses the process of weathering and further expands upon it by including the transport of weathered material. The two processes work together to reshape our planet, creating a diverse array of geological features over geological timescales."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the two people who the genre of Chinese travel literature became popular with?, using the article: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The two people who made the genre of Chinese travel literature popular are Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi.

Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs.

Given the context: How would Jan feel as a result? Answer:","output":"Considering the context provided, it is likely that Jan would feel (C). embarrassed as a result of being forced into the new club by Riley last night. Being \\"forced\\" into a situation often implies that an individual did not willingly consent to participate in a particular circumstance or event, suggesting a level of discomfort, awkwardness, or unease. As a result, it is reasonable to infer that Jan experienced some level of embarrassment as they were coerced into joining the club. Embarrassment can be the outcome of several factors, including a sense of vulnerability, being exposed to unwanted attention, feeling judged or self-conscious, or lacking control over the situation. In this case, Jan could feel embarrassed for a multitude of reasons: 1. Public exposure: Entering a new club, especially when forced to do so, could make Jan feel like they are in the spotlight. This may lead them to become self-conscious and worried about how others are perceiving them, generating a feeling of embarrassment. 2. Unwanted attention: Clubs are often associated with social interactions and mingling. Jan could be embarrassed due to the feeling of being coerced into engaging with strangers, which might be an uncomfortable experience for some individuals. 3. Reluctance to participate: Given that Jan was forced into the club, it can be assumed that they were hesitant or reluctant to be there in the first place. This reluctance, combined with Riley's insistence on their participation, could contribute to a feeling of embarrassment, as Jan might perceive their reluctance to be shameful or awkward. 4. Lack of decision-making power: Being forced into a situation often implies one's autonomy has been diminished. Jan might feel embarrassed as they were not able to make their own decision whether to participate in the activity, potentially leading them to question their ability to make choices and stand up for themselves. 5. Social relationships: As Riley was the one who forced Jan to enter the club, it can create tension between the two. Jan might feel embarrassed because they do not want to upset or disappoint Riley by refusing to participate or showing that they feel uncomfortable. They might worry about how to address their real feelings or balance their own interests with Riley's expectations. In summary, Jan's experience of being forced into the new club by Riley implies a level of discomfort and unease, largely contributing to a feeling of embarrassment. This emotion may stem from concerns such as public exposure, unwanted attention, reluctance to participate, lack of decision-making power, and challenges in managing their social relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries.  - The Battle of Worcester took place on 3 September 1651 at Worcester, England, and was the final battle of the English Civil War. Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarian \\"New Model Army\\", 28,000 strong, defeated King Charles II's 16,000 Royalists, of whom the vast majority were Scottish.  - The Little Dart River is a tributary of the River Taw in Devon, England. It joins the Taw a mile west of Chulmleigh.  - Chulmleigh is a small Saxon hilltop market town and civil parish located in North Devon in the heart of the English county of Devon. It is located north west of Exeter, just north of the Mid Devon boundary, linked by the A377 and B3096 roads. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north by the parishes of King's Nympton, Romansleigh, Meshaw, East Worlington, Chawleigh, Wembworthy (a short border only), Ashreigney, Burrington, and Chittlehamholt. In 2001 the population of the parish was 1,308, decreasing to 1,017 at the 2011 census. An electoral ward with the same name also exists whose total population at the same census was 2,081.  - The Long Parliament was an English Parliament which lasted from 1640 until 1660. It followed the fiasco of the Short Parliament which had been held for three weeks during the spring of 1640, and which in its turn had followed an 11-years parliamentary absence. In September 1640 writs were issued summoning a parliament to convene on 3 November 1640 by King Charles I. The parliament was summoned to pass financial bills, a step that was necessary as a result of the cost of the Bishops' Wars. It received its name from the fact that through an Act of Parliament, it could be dissolved only with the agreement of the members, and those members did not agree to its dissolution until after the English Civil War and close to the end of Interregnum on 16 March 1660. It sat from 1640 until 1648, when it was purged by the New Model Army. In the chaos following the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, General George Monck allowed the members barred in 1648 to retake their seats, so that they could pass the necessary legislation to allow the Restoration and dissolve the Long Parliament. This cleared the way for a new Parliament to be elected, which was known as the Convention Parliament. But many of these original members of Long Parliament, such as were barred from the final acts of the Long Parliament, claimed that the Long Parliament was never legally dissolved.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million.  - A bay is a body of water connected to an ocean or lake, formed by an indentation of the shoreline. A large bay may be called a \\"gulf\\", a \\"sea\\", a \\"sound\\", or a \\"bight\\". A \\"cove\\" is a smaller circular or oval coastal inlet with a narrow entrance; some coves may be referred to as bays. A \\"fjord\\" is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial  based on feudal responsibilities  and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court.  - A gatehouse, in architectural terminology, is a building enclosing or accompanying a gateway for a castle, manor house, fort, town or similar buildings of importance.  - Dorset (or archaically, Dorsetshire) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast.

Covering an area of , Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density.  - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties:  - Worcester is a city in Worcestershire, England, southwest of Birmingham and north of Gloucester. The population is approximately 100,000. The River Severn flanks the western side of the city centre, which is overlooked by the 12th-century Worcester Cathedral.  - Plymouth is a city on the south coast of Devon, England, about south-west of Exeter and west-south-west of London, between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west where they join Plymouth Sound to form the boundary with Cornwall.  - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry.  - Teignbridge is a local government district in Devon, England. Its council is based in Newton Abbot.  - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.  - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642  c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point.  - North Devon is a local government district in Devon, England. Its council is based in Barnstaple. Other towns and villages in the North Devon District include Braunton, Fremington, Ilfracombe, Instow, South Molton, Lynton and Lynmouth.

Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence  though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace.  - A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century.  - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton.  - Roundhead was the name given to the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War. Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings. The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration.  - The River Taw rises at \\"Taw Head\\", a spring on the central northern flanks of Dartmoor, crosses north Devon and close to the sea at the town of Barnstaple, formerly a significant port, empties into Bideford Bay in the Bristol Channel having formed a large estuary of wide meanders which at its western extreme is joined by the estuary of the Torridge.  - East Devon is a local government district in Devon, England.

Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would Kenya have less or more organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania? The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, we need to compare the organic matter stored in the O horizon of the soil in Kenya's grasslands and Tanzania's forests. 1. Understanding the two habitats:    - Kenyan grasslands: Grasslands primarily consist of grass species and few trees, resulting in less biomass produced and less organic matter returned to the soil after the grass decomposes.    - Tanzanian forests: Forests have a higher density of trees and other vegetation, which produce a larger amount of biomass and, consequently, more organic matter returned to the soil through decomposing plant material. 2. Analyzing the O horizon in both environments:    - The O horizon is the uppermost layer of soil that consists of organic matter, such as partially decomposed plant and animal material.    - In Kenya's grasslands, the O horizon might be relatively thinner and store less organic matter due to the lower biomass production and decomposition rates.    - In Tanzania's forests, the O horizon would likely be thicker and store more organic matter because of the higher rates of biomass production and decomposition from the more diverse and dense vegetation. 3. Comparing the organic matter stored in the O horizon of Kenya and Tanzania:    - Based on the differences in vegetation and biomass production between grasslands and forests, it is reasonable to assume that the O horizon in Tanzania's forests would store more organic matter compared to Kenya's grasslands. The answer to this question is: Kenya would have less organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But we needed some things so Dad was elected to go to the grocery store. This turned out to be a big production; Dad was trying remember what all was needed without writing a list, and Mom kept adding things even as he was trying to leave. Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway. He’d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: “what’d he forget this time?” But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt. She & her family had gone swimming to cool off; apparently she’d gotten a cramp or something and gone under while nobody was looking, and by the time she was missed it was too late. To this day, my Mom is miffed at some family members that we had to find out that way (she was pretty close to this sister so she feels someone should’ve called before it got on the news) but as for me, I will never forget that look on my Dad’s face. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the aunt drowned, how does dad feel? Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, we can deduce that after the aunt drowned, Dad feels shocked, devastated, and deeply concerned. The description of the look on his face - one that chilled the author to the core and conveyed something bad was coming - indicates that he was deeply affected by the news of the tragedy. Additionally, his initial hesitation to share the news with Mom, hoping he had heard it wrong, further demonstrates his emotional response to the situation. The drowning being an unexpected and tragic event likely adds to Dad's emotional turmoil. Dealing with the sudden loss of a close family member can evoke feelings of sorrow and confusion as the family struggles to come to terms with what has happened. Moreover, given the circumstances leading up to hearing the news - a casual, hot summer afternoon, and the plan for a family cookout - the contrast between a seemingly ordinary day and the sudden tragedy might have intensified Dad's emotions even further."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random. Problem:Concept: violin, Relatum: peg. Solution:","output":"The relation between 'violin' and 'peg' can be termed as a meronym (mero) relationship. This is because a 'peg' is a part or component of the 'violin'. In the context of a violin, pegs are used to tune the strings by adjusting the tension. Thus, a peg constitutes a part of the overall structure of a violin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johan van Banchem, was one of the leaders of the lynching of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt on August 20, 1672, he was rewarded for this crime with an appointment as \\"baljuw\\" of The Hague by which office of steward, designated a medieval official and then a national leader, William III? The answer to this question is:","output":"Johan van Banchem, a Dutch citizen, was indeed one of the key figures involved in the brutal lynching of the De Witt brothers, Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt, on August 20, 1672. The brothers were prominent Dutch politicians, with Johan serving as the Grand Pensionary of the Dutch Republic (1653-1672) and Cornelis being a prominent military leader. The events leading up to their lynching were a result of political turmoil. The De Witt brothers were strong advocates of the Republican cause in the Dutch Republic and opposed the monarchical ambitions of the Orangist party, who wanted Prince William III of Orange to hold a higher role in the government. Tensions between the two groups escalated during the rampjaar or \\"disaster year\\" of 1672 when the Dutch Republic was invaded by France and its allies, leading to military defeats and economic hardship. The Orangists blamed the De Witts for the crisis, accusing them of betraying the Dutch Republic to the French and inciting public unrest. On June 21, 1672, Johan de Witt was severely wounded in an assassination attempt, and his brother Cornelis was later arrested on charges of treason. Both brothers were held captive in the Gevangenpoort prison in The Hague. On August 20, 1672, a mob led by Johan van Banchem and other Orangist supporters stormed the Gevangenpoort prison, dragged out the De Witt brothers, and brutally lynched them in the streets of The Hague. Van Banchem played an active part in the act and his involvement was well-known. As a direct result of his actions, he was rewarded by Prince William III of Orange, who ascended to the office of Stadtholder in 1672 as a result of the political crisis generated by the Orangist coup. Prince William recognized Van Banchem's role in the lynching and the removal of the De Witt brothers from power as a significant contribution to the Orangist cause. To reward Van Banchem for his role in these events, Prince William appointed him as the baljuw (steward or bailiff) of The Hague. The baljuw was a medieval official responsible for overseeing law enforcement, public order, and the administration of justice within his jurisdiction. In the case of The Hague, this meant that Van Banchem was given substantial responsibility for ensuring the safety and stability of the city. In becoming the baljuw of The Hague, Johan van Banchem thus received a considerable promotion and recognition from the new Stadtholder, William III, for his part in facilitating the rise of the Orangist party and securing their political influence in the Dutch Republic."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the album released in 1994 by the band from Athens, Georgia?  R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If this person has a problem with substance abuse, gambling, binge eating, or other destructive behaviors, there's a good chance they're a pathological liar.  For example, you may notice a co-worker drinking extra at a company party. You may see them filling up their drink when no one else is at the bar, or even notice them carrying a flask. You may also notice you don't see one co-worker eat at lunch, but sometimes find evidence of food having been in their office. They may be very secretive about eating habits, and habitually turn down offers to get food with co-workers. Pathological liars are often disconnected with reality. A lot of times, they may believe parts of their lies themselves. They may be deluded about themselves and their abilities.  A pathological liar may have a tendency to exaggerate their importance. They may see something innocuous, like a compliment from a boss, as a sign of personal greatness. When recounting the compliment, they may fluff its importance. A pathological liar may lack basic life skills, but  may not see this as a problem. If the person has a distorted view of reality, they may honestly believe what they are saying. While this is not true of all pathological liars, consider the possibility that the person is not lying out of malice. Pathological liars tend to have unstable relationships. Consider anything you know about this person's relationship history. Look for any warning signs of instability.  Does this person have stable friendships or romantic relationships? A lack of longterm friends, and a series of failed romances, may indicate a pathological liar. A pathological liar may also be estranged from their family. A pathological liar tends to bluff their way into jobs. A pathological liar may have many jobs on their resume. However, most of these jobs will be short term. They may also dodge questions about why certain jobs did not work out longterm.  For example, a pathological liar may have a long resume. Most of the jobs will only have been short term. If you ask the pathological liar about their career, they may dodge questions. In some cases, a pathological liar may have moved around a lot due to sudden career changes. Pathological liars often burn bridges with employers. Summary:","output":"Someone who lies a lot might also have trouble with other bad habits like drinking too much or eating too much. They might not know what's real and what's not, and sometimes believe their own lies. They can have problems with their relationships, not have many long-term friends or romantic partners, and might not get along with their family. They often change jobs quickly and don't do well at work. If you know someone like this, they might be a pathological liar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer based on context: Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by Kobe Bryant). That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordans home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. However, neither of Jordans final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the List of first overall NBA draft picks in the 2001 NBA draft, Kwame Brown.

In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Sir Stephen House, 57, said the time was right to take up new challenges after 35 years as a police officer. He has been under severe pressure over the three days it took his officers to respond to a fatal crash on the M9. He has also been criticised over armed officers being put on routine patrol and his force's policies on stopping and searching juveniles. Sir Stephen had previously indicated he was likely to stand down when his four-year contract expired in September of next year. Confirming the details of his departure at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) in Stirling, he outlined some of the successes of Police Scotland, including the new national approach to domestic abuse and sexual attack. He added: \\"As the leader of a national organisation that provides a vital public service 24 hours every day of the year, there can never be a convenient time to move on, but after nearly 35 years as a police officer and the last nine as a chief constable in Scotland, I believe the time is right for me to take up a new challenge and thereby allow the process to recruit my successor to begin. \\"Much has been achieved since the creation of Police Scotland and I firmly believe that Scotland is better served for it. Not only in managing the changes brought about by reform and substantial financial cuts, but most importantly in the public service we provide.\\" He acknowledged: \\"There remains a lot to do, but knowing as I do the quality of our officers and staff, I am confident that the challenges will be met. \\"The dedication and commitment of our people is truly outstanding and I know will serve Scotland well in the future under a new chief constable.\\" Paying tribute to the chief constable, SPA chairman Vic Emery said he firmly believed that Sir Stephen had been \\"the right individual at the right time\\" to lead Police Scotland through the \\"combined challenges of major reorganisation, fundamental reform, and reduced funding\\". He added: \\"Sometimes the public don't always see the real person behind the public profile. Steve has always been a constable first, and a chief officer second.\\" Sir Stephen, who was previously the chief constable of Strathclyde Police, oversaw the complex amalgamation in 2013 of Scotland's eight regional police forces into the single national force, which is the second largest in the UK. Since then, he has overseen successes such as the policing of last year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. But he was criticised over his decision to allow armed officers to attend routine incidents, as well as the force's policy on stopping and searching juveniles. The force is also under pressure over its response to the M9 crash in July in which John Yuill and his partner Lamara Bell died after it took three days for officers to respond to reports of their car leaving the road near Stirling. When Sir Stephen House was appointed the first chief constable of the new Police Service of Scotland he was credited with being the best candidate because of his \\"impressive track record of leadership, partnership working and delivery\\". Those were the words of the then Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, who believed Sir Stephen would make \\"an outstanding\\" chief constable. Before the 57-year-old took on the role in October 2012 - seven months before Police Scotland came into being - he already had an impressive CV of public service both north and south of the border. Sir Stephen's police career began 34 years ago when he joined Sussex Police. He was a uniform officer between 1981 and 1988, initially working for Sussex and then later transferring to Northamptonshire Police followed by West Yorkshire Police. Sir Stephen's first taste of high command came in 1998 when he joined Staffordshire Police as an assistant chief constable, initially in territorial policing and later in crime and operations. After three years in that job he joined the Metropolitan Police Service as a deputy assistant commissioner. Despite what he described as his \\"estuary English\\" accent, Sir Stephen is Scottish, having been born in Glasgow. Read more here Police Scotland officers are being investigated by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner over the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died in police custody after being arrested following an incident in Kirkcaldy on 3 May. And there have also been reports that Police Scotland was one of two unnamed UK forces accused by a watchdog of spying on journalists and their sources. Sir Stephen had faced calls to resign from opposition politicians in the wake of the controversies, but Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has always insisted she had full confidence in him. Responding to his announcement, Ms Sturgeon thanked Sir Stephen for his \\"years of dedicated service\\" with both Strathclyde Police and Police Scotland. She said: \\"Strong policing has ensured recorded crime is at a 40-year low. Sir Stephen provided leadership at a crucial time and his strong focus on tackling violent crime made a major contribution to that achievement. \\"Reform of policing in Scotland was absolutely vital to sustain the policing upon which Scotland's communities depend and Sir Stephen's contribution to that was invaluable.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who has been a fierce critic of the single force, said Sir Stephen's departure would not by itself solve the \\"deep-rooted problems\\" in Police Scotland and that the force needed a \\"fresh start\\". He added: \\"Ultimately the SNP government must accept responsibility for this chaos. They rammed through the centralisation of our police service despite warnings. They set up the toothless Scottish Police Authority. They appointed the chief constable.\\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Sir Stephen was \\"bowing to the inevitable\\" by resigning, and said it was \\"essential that his replacement is up to the task of tackling the problems that have afflicted the single force since its inception\\". Scottish Labour's justice spokesman, Graeme Pearson - who was formerly a senior police officer - said the process of reforming Police Scotland \\"can begin now if the SNP government are willing to take responsibility for their mistakes\\". But the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said Sir Stephen had made a \\"monumental contribution\\" to policing. The federation's chairman, Brian Docherty, said: \\"He has delivered the most significant public sector restructuring in a generation against a background of a brutal austerity agenda. \\"He has delivered some very impressive policing results on crimes of violence, particularly domestic violence. I have little doubt that history will prove to be kinder to Sir Stephen than the current commentary which at times has been vindictive and deeply personal. \\"Many people feared that a single police service could be susceptible to political interference and those who have called for the head of the chief constable as some form of trophy need to consider that.\\" Niven Rennie, president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, said on Twitter that the first chief constable of Police Scotland \\"was always going to be on a hiding to nothing\\". He also said that critics of the force should \\"recognise the great achievements of Police Scotland in its formative years not concentrate on the mistakes.\\" Mr Rennie said Sir Stephen's decision would give the force a chance to rebuild on a \\"crazy\\" two years, and that he believed a \\"change in style will help\\". Martin Bell, the brother of M9 crash victim Lamara Bell, said: \\"It's over to the government now to see what changes they will bring in. \\"We have no faith in Police Scotland at all and no faith that we will see real change as a result of Sir Stephen standing down. \\"What happened to Lamara really can't happen again. They need to stop making cuts to emergency services and put as much funding into them as they possibly can.\\"","output":"Police Scotland's Chief Constable, Sir Stephen House, is to stand down earlier than expected, following controversy over his force's recent handling of several high-profile cases, such as an armed police incident and the slow response to a fatal road crash."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tampa Bay Lightning at Toronto Maple Leafs game preview Expectations in hockey-mad Toronto appear to be taking their toll on the Maple Leafs, whose coach is aware of both the issue of his job security and the tension surrounding his struggling team. Randy Carlyle's club has lost three straight heading into Thursday night's home matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning, and he's aware that improvement needs to come quickly. A 9-2 home loss to Nashville on Tuesday had Carlyle on the defensive the next day, as he often appeared agitated during his post-practice news conference. \\"You're always in a position of doubt when things go awry with your hockey club. When you take these jobs, you can expect that,\\" he said. \\"In this market it's a little bit more intense at times, just by the number of (media) that are here today. We have some faces that we haven't (seen) all year, and it's very similar to last night, that it seems that negativity brings a lot more people out to ask the questions, and rightfully so.\\" Toronto (9-8-2) hadn't allowed nine goals since a 12-1 loss to Pittsburgh on Dec. 26, 1991. It's been outscored 17-5 during its losing streak, including a 6-2 loss to lowly Buffalo on Saturday. Carlyle also spoke about his beleaguered players \\"squeezing the stick\\" in practice Wednesday. \\"Honestly, we've got to quiet the noise,\\" defenseman Cody Franson said. \\"We are feeling a lot of pressure right now and it's tough not to feel that and just focus on hockey. I think we're in a situation where everyone is feeling the heat.\\" The Leafs went 6-1-1 in their eight games before their skid, during which they've lost twice at home following a four-game winning streak at Air Canada Centre. \\"When you get beat like that in professional sports it is embarrassing, and when you get beat like that in front of your home fans it compounds things,\\" captain Dion Phaneuf said. \\"It is unacceptable.\\" They'll look to bounce back against a Lightning team coming off a 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Tampa Bay (13-5-2) had won its previous two but looked sluggish late in second of a back-to-back set. Alex Killorn and Ondrej Palat scored for the Lightning, which lost center Cedric Paquette in the first period to a lower-body injury. The status of Paquette, who had five goals in his previous six games, is unclear. \\"That's a tough one for us,\\" coach Jon Cooper said. \\"We gave them six power plays. We lost a forward, so we're playing 50 minutes in a back-to-back with 11 forwards.\\" The Lightning could get a boost from the return of winger Brett Connolly, who has missed the last 12 with a leg injury. He said he's hoping to \\"sneak into the lineup\\" against Toronto, but Cooper has given no indication if Connolly will play. Ben Bishop should be back in goal after Evgeni Nabokov made 31 saves against the Islanders. Bishop is 8-1-1 in his last 10 starts and has a 1.72 goals-against average in his past four. It's uncertain who the Leafs will go with in net after Tuesday's disastrous performance. Jonathan Bernier was pulled before the second period after allowing three goals on 12 shots, and James Reimer gave up six for the second straight game after taking the loss against the Sabres. \\"We need a better performance from everybody,\\" Carlyle said. \\"Goaltending is part of that.\\" Tampa Bay has won the last two meetings. Steven Stamkos had a hat trick in a 5-3 victory March 19 - giving him four goals and two assists in his last three against the Leafs - before Palat scored twice in a 3-0 win April 8. Summary:","output":"The Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey team is feeling pressure because they have lost three games in a row. Their coach, Randy Carlyle, is aware that people might want him to lose his job because of the team's struggles. They will be playing against the Tampa Bay Lightning, and they hope to do better in this game.

Question: Who was Shazam's champion 5000 years before? Movie plot title: Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam Movie plot: The film opens with a young couple overlooking the city from a hillside as an apparent meteor streaks across the sky, and into the Earth. It smashes into the couple's car, with them still in it, on a hillside beside the lookout over Fawcett City. It's revealed that that meteor is in fact Black Adam returning to Earth from his long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a seemingly rundown slum with very little food and rats for pets. He rises from his bed wearing a fan t-shirt bearing the Superman crest. He goes to his kitchen to find food, but only finds potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to rendezvous with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees three bullies robbing a homeless man. After attempting to defend the homeless man, Billy himself earns a black eye for his trouble. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, and calls him \\"The Captain\\". Billy responds by telling him he always try to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only currency he has - a subway token. On arriving at the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfast specials, and tells him his intended story will bring the plight of him and those in his situation to public light. Billy tears into his plates ravenously. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering above the ground outside the diner and causes a destructive force by clapping his hands together and blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and transforms himself into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard's choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy is completely unaware of what he means. Black Adam picks up a passing fire engine, but Superman appears and intervenes before Black Adam can use it to crush him. Billy then makes good his escape. Superman...","output":"The movie plot provided for \\"Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam\\" does not offer specific information regarding who Shazam's champion was 5000 years prior to the events of the film. The plot primarily focuses on the character of Billy Batson, a young boy who is seen living in impoverished conditions and encounters Clark Kent, who later transforms into Superman when Black Adam makes an appearance. Black Adam refers to Billy as the Wizard's next choice, indicating that he may take on the role of Shazam's champion, but the plot doesn't discuss the history or past champions of Shazam.  In the wider DC Comics lore, Black Adam himself was a previous champion of the wizard Shazam, from about 5000 years before the present day in many storylines.

The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. Input: Premise: PersonX gets plenty of sleep Hypothesis: Before, PersonX needed have dinner Update: PersonX was sleepy from eating too much. Output:","output":"To complete this task, follow these simple steps: 1. Read the given premise, hypothesis, and update.    - Premise: PersonX gets plenty of sleep    - Hypothesis: Before, PersonX needed to have dinner    - Update: PersonX was sleepy from eating too much 2. Determine if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis. 3. Based on the given information, see if the update makes it more or less likely that the hypothesis is true.    - In this case, the update suggests that PersonX was sleepy from eating too much, which could imply that dinner made them sleepy and supports that they needed to have dinner before. Therefore, the update strengthens the hypothesis. 4. Output the appropriate response.    - Since the update strengthens the hypothesis, the output should be 'strengthener'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 1: Let's add 33*t to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -33*t on the right side: -25*t + 33*t = -33*t + 33*t + 40 This simplifies to: 8*t = 40 Step 2: Now, we need to get 't' all by itself.

Kenneth was very talented and auditioned for the part in the play unlike Brian, therefore  Select from: (I). Kenneth got the part.. (II). Brian got the part..","output":"(I). Kenneth got the part. Kenneth's talent was truly commendable. He had this effortless way of immersing himself into a character that made the world around him fade into the background. Believe it or not, Kenneth had been honing this craft from a very young age. He was born and raised in a family of actors. His father had been a local theatre artist and his mother, a former Broadway actress. So, it was safe to say that the performing arts had been a large part of his life ever since the beginning. His parents used to say that Kenneth started mimicking characters when he was barely able to walk. Kenneth never showed an interest in anything other than acting. He was happiest when he was on stage, floating effortlessly between realities and creating a universe that belonged to him and his audience alone. His propensity for conveying emotions convincingly was the staple of his performances. From the slight furrowing of his brows showing confusion or worry to the way his eyes twinkled with mischief or joy, every detail was artfully expressed.  Auditioning for the play was just another day for him. Not because he did not respect the process or was too arrogant to acknowledge the hard work it took, but because the process felt so organic and deeply rooted in his life's rhythm that he lived for such moments. The part was for the lead role of a melancholic poet in a tragic story. A character that required an understanding of the human mind's depths and the ability to translate into cathartic performances. Unlike Kenneth, Brian was relatively new to the acting world. He had just started dabbling into community theatre and was still exploring his comfort zone on stage. Though he had a certain appeal to his acting talent, Brian needed time to grow and develop. He was also auditioning for the same role, clouded with uncertainty because of his inexperience.  After his audition, Kenneth could see some definite potential in Brian, but he knew the part needed an actor with the panache to evoke strong emotions, much more than what Brian was capable of at his current stage. Brian's performance was decent but lacked the depth that the character required.  On the day of the result, unsurprisingly, Kenneth's name echoed through the auditorium. He had successfully bagged the role of the melancholic poet. His talent, experience, and skill had won him the part. Though it was a victory, Kenneth felt a pang of sympathy for Brian, for he saw a younger version of his own in Brian, trying to battle through the daunting world of acting. Kenneth decided to mentor Brian. He knew getting the part was only half the battle won. The real test would be on the live stage in front of an audience. But for that, he had time, and the most important aspect, he had all the motivation he needed in Brian. Kenneth remembered the times when he was fresh and new to the stage, and the guidance of his seniors had helped him. So, he decided to pass on the legacy, the lessons, and the wisdom. And that's how Kenneth got the part, and Brian earned a valuable mentorship with the seasoned actor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This would help the government give money to help businesses grow (private investment) while still saving.

(CNN) -- Centuries from Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli helped India defeat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one-day international in Kolkata to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.  Upul Tharanga had hit a superb 118 and Kumar Sangakkara made a fine 60 as the visitors reached an imposing 315 for six after choosing to bat first.  However, Gambhir struck an undefeated 150 and Kohli made 107 -- his maiden century -- the two adding 224 for the third wicket as India easily overhauled the target, the highest one-day run chase at the famous Eden Gardens ground.  After the tourists opted to bat, India began well with the ball, conceding a measly nine from five immaculate overs sent down by new-ball bowlers Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra.  But Tillakaratne Dilshan broke the shackles by driving Nehra through the covers in the sixth over for the first boundary and from then on India gradually lost control.  Nehra, who had dropped Tharanga on seven when he failed to hold on to a fairly straightforward return catch, went some way to atoning for that error by snaring Dilshan early and Sanath Jayasuriya, batting at three, also departed cheaply.  But then Sangakkara, who was handed a reprieve before he was even off the mark when Harbhajan Singh squandered a simple chance at third man, and Tharanga built a solid base.

Buffalo Springfield was a Canadian-American rock band active from 1966 to 1968 whose most prominent members were Stephen Stills, Neil Young, and Richie Furay. The band released three albums and several singles, including \\"For What It's Worth\\". The band combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion and psychedelic-rock influences, and, along with the Byrds, were part of the early development of folk-rock. With a name taken from a brand of steamroller, Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Neil Young and Stephen Stills met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Young was there with the Squires, a Winnipeg group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with The Company, a spin-off from the Au Go Go Singers. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the West Coast, where he worked as a session musician and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, the Monkees. Told by record producer Barry Friedman there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player Ken Koblun to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group 3's a Crowd.  In early 1966 in Toronto, Young met Bruce Palmer, a Canadian who was playing bass for a group called the Mynah Birds. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for Motown Records when their singer Ricky James Matthews--James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as Rick James--was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL. With their record deal canceled, Young and Palmer headed for Los Angeles, where they encountered Stills.  Drummer Dewey Martin, who had played with garage rock group the Standells and country artists such as Patsy Cline and the Dillards, joined at the suggestion of the Byrds' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of steamroller made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on April 11, 1966, at The Troubadour in Hollywood. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for the Dillards and the Byrds. Entity:","output":"Buffalo Springfield"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vaikka en voi kommentoida suoraan kaupallisten vakuutusten saatavuutta, voin kuitenkin tarjota joitain perustietoja vakuutusmarkkinoista ja siitä, miten ne tyypillisesti toimivat Suomessa. Suomessa on useita vakuutusyhtiöitä, jotka tarjoavat monenlaisia vakuutuspalveluita sekä kuluttajille että yrityksille. Kaupallisiin tarkoituksiin suunnatut vakuutukset kattavat monenlaisia riskejä ja niiden tarkoituksena on suojata yrityksiä ja niiden omistajia mahdollisilta taloudellisilta menetyksiltä ja haitoilta. Näihin vakuutuksiin voi sisältyä esimerkiksi yrityksen omaisuuden vakuutus, liiketoimintakatkosvakuutus, vastuuvakuutus ja työntekijöiden sairaus- ja tapaturmavakuutus. Suomessa vakuutusmarkkinat ovat melko kilpailukykyiset, joten yrityksillä on yleensä hyvät mahdollisuudet löytää sopiva vakuutusratkaisu tarpeisiinsa. Vakuutusten hintaan ja saatavuuteen vaikuttavat kuitenkin monet tekijät, kuten yrityksen toimiala, sen koko, riskitaso ja vakuutuksen kattavuus. Jos olet kiinnostunut hankkimaan kaupallisen vakuutuksen, suosittelen kääntymään paikallisen vakuutusasiantuntijan puoleen, joka voi auttaa sinua arvioimaan yrityksesi vakuutustarpeet ja löytämään sopivan vakuutusratkaisun. Voit myös tutustua eri vakuutusyhtiöiden tarjontaan verkossa ja pyytää tarjouksia vertaillaksesi eri vaihtoehtoja. Lopuksi on tärkeää muistaa, että vakuutusten ehdot ja hinnat voivat vaihdella yhtiöittäin, joten on hyvä käyttää aikaa eri vaihtoehtojen tutkimiseen ja vertailuun.

The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems. The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made). I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other.

Please enlighten us as to when was the first and last time you were in a Native village.  Come on now, be very specific and tell us what your purpose was being in that village.  As always, your ass(umptions) are skewed.","output":"Part #1: Classifying the comment into two classes: sexual-explicit and non-sexual-explicit. Usage: \\"The video is so hot, they were having sex like animals!\\" This comment meets the criteria for sexual-explicit classification because it is explicitly describing a sexual situation. Part #2: Identifying if the comment portrays sexual matters explicitly. Usage: \\"I love that new song, it has a great rhythm and catchy lyrics!\\" This comment meets the criteria for non-sexual-explicit classification because it is discussing a song and its qualities, not portraying any explicit sexual content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Fran: Looks horrible, I can't seem to do nothing about it. Mom: Don't exaggerate, honey. Just tie it up or something. Fran: I hate myself. Mom: Relax, dear. Everybody’s got a bad hair day once in a while=) What was going on in that conversation?","output":"In the given conversation, Fran, who is assumed to be a child or a teenager, is expressing their reluctance in going to school to their Mom, citing issues with their hair. Fran is likely experiencing a bad hair day and feels that their appearance looks horrible, which causes them to struggle with confidence and self-esteem. This emphasizes the role appearances often play in young people's lives and how they perceive themselves, which can directly impact their willingness to engage in social activities like attending school. In response, Mom tries to downplay the issue and comfort Fran with practical advice to tie their hair up or find alternative solutions instead of giving into their insecurities. Mom is encouraging Fran not to let a bad hair day dictate their decisions, and she tries to put it into perspective by explaining that everyone experiences such days occasionally. At the end of the conversation, Fran expresses self-loathing, indicating an underlying deeper issue with self-esteem or self-image, which might not be just rooted in their hair but can stem from several factors, such as peer pressure or an innate desire to fit in with their peers. Amidst this situation, Mom tries to reassure and calm Fran down, using a light-hearted comment and reminding them that bad hair days are an ordinary part of life. In summary, this conversation deals with self-esteem, the significance of appearance in young people's lives, parental support, and the importance of managing negative self-talk and emotions associated with physical appearance. Mom is trying to help Fran understand that minor issues like bad hair should not dictate their life decisions or impact their self-worth, emphasizing the role parents play in guiding and supporting their children through various challenges they face."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who accidentally puts the diaper on while the baby crawls off?  Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer. The baby then playfully bonks Tom on the head. A:","output":"Tom is the one who accidentally puts the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off.

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with","output":"The phrase \\"disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with\\" would be generally considered negative due to the language used and the context around the concept.  To analyze the phrase in-depth, let's break it down into its components: 1. \\"Disguised\\" implies that something is being intentionally hidden or misrepresented. This term carries a negative connotation, as it suggests deceit or dishonesty. 2. \\"War tribute\\" alludes to an act or symbol meant to honor the sacrifices and achievements of those involved in warfare. Depending on the context and the listener's perspective, a war tribute could be seen as either positive or negative. Some people see these tributes as a form of respect and expression of gratitude for those who have served their country. On the other hand, others might argue that war tributes glorify conflict, violence, and its consequential suffering – leading to a more negative perception. 3. \\"Disgusting\\" is an inherently negative word. By definition, it conveys feelings of strong disapproval, revulsion, or distaste. 4. \\"To begin with\\" indicates that the speaker's strong negative reaction to the situation is their initial response, and it is likely that additional negative aspects or implications might be revealed. When you put these components together, the phrase suggests that something is being deceitfully presented as a war tribute, and this deceit is seen as repulsive or distasteful. The use of the word \\"disgusting\\" is a clear indicator of negative sentiment. Additionally, the purposeful act of hiding something or presenting it falsely adds to the negative impression.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Apples in Stereo, styled as The Apples in stereo, are an American rock band associated with Elephant Six Collective, a group of bands also including Neutral Milk Hotel and The Olivia Tremor Control. The band is largely a product of lead vocalist/guitarist/producer Robert Schneider, who writes the majority of the band's music and lyrics. Currently, The Apples in Stereo also includes longstanding members John Hill (rhythm guitar) and Eric Allen (bass), as well as more recent members John Dufilho (drums), John Ferguson (keyboards), and Ben Phelan (keyboards/guitar/trumpet). The band's sound draws comparisons to the psychedelic rock of The Beatles and The Beach Boys during the 1960s, as well as to bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and Pavement, and also draws from lo-fi, garage rock, new wave, R&B, bubblegum pop, power pop, punk, electro-pop and experimental music. Several conflicts would lead Parfitt to leave the band in early 1994. John Hill, a former bandmate of McIntyre's, would join the band as a rhythm guitarist while Schneider began to grow more comfortable playing lead guitar. It was also at this time that Schneider began to take stronger creative control of the band, shifting its sound from its stronger rock qualities to a spacier pop sound. The band started work on a debut full-length album, but it instead became Hypnotic Suggestion, a second EP. However, after SpinART Records offered to buy the band an 8-track in return for an album, new plans for an LP arose.  In mid-1994, after Hypnotic Suggestion, McIntyre would be the second to leave the band, due to a number of personal distresses as well as stylistic changes that arose with Parfitt's departure. Having great difficulty finding a new permanent bassist, the band would rotate a number of frequent bass contributors, including Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel, Kurt Heasley of The Lilys, Kyle Jones, Joel Richardson, and Joel Evans. Jim McIntyre would also occasionally guest on bass. This continued to be the makeup of the band as they toured the country in late 1994, recording the first half of their new album in Glendora, California. In early 1995, the band finished the album, Fun Trick Noisemaker, at Kyle Jones's house (the birthplace of Schneider's Pet Sounds Studio).  Now with a full-length LP to support, the band began touring again. Eric Allen, whom the band had previously auditioned as a guitarist after the departure of Chris Parfitt, joined the band as a much welcomed permanent bassist. Late 1995, Schneider relocated Pet Sounds Studio to Jim McIntyre's house. McIntyre continued to be involved in the recording and engineering of the band's albums until the mid-2000s.  A significantly different band from the original 1992 four-piece, the official name of the band gradually became \\"The Apples in Stereo\\", with the \\"in stereo\\" usually somewhat under-emphasized, whether in lower-case or in parentheses. Schneider described this in an interview: \\"It's very clearcut, actually: we're The Apples, the music's in stereo. It's not actually the band name - it's a step back from it, a band name once removed. We're The Apples, in stereo. Kind of like a TV show, 'in stereo!' That always seemed to be a really big deal, that it was in stereo.\\" McIntyre later remarked, \\"It's cool the name changed cause the Apples and the Apples in Stereo were really two different entities.\\" What year did the band start?","output":"The band started in 1992. Just think, it's like a group of friends who started making music together a long, long time ago, even before you were born!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Do those questions have the same meaning? pick from the following. (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"Backward time travel has been a captivating concept for centuries, often featured in science fiction literature and films. The possibility of traveling into the past raises numerous paradoxes and complexities, which have challenged scientists and philosophers alike. To evaluate the possibility of backward time travel, we need to rely on our existing scientific understanding of space and time. According to Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, space and time are interconnected and form a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. Massive objects, such as planets and stars, curve this fabric, which gives rise to the force of gravity. Time dilation, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory, occurs when an object's velocity or the presence of a strong gravitational field affects its passage through time relative to an object at rest or in a weaker field. This has been experimentally tested and confirmed, and opens the door for the possibility of time travel under the right conditions. Einstein’s equations also led to the theoretical discovery of \\"closed timelike curves\\" by mathematician Kurt Gödel in 1949, which suggest that closed loops in spacetime might allow time travel into the past. However, the presence of such curves is highly debated and their existence would necessitate cosmic conditions far beyond our comprehension and current technology to access. More recent theories, such as those involving wormholes or black holes, have also been proposed as potential gateways to time travel. It is theorized that if one could stabilize a wormhole and adjust its ends within spacetime, one might facilitate travel into the past or future. In the case of black holes, their immense gravity can create an effect called \\"gravitational time dilation,\\" in which time moves slower the closer you get to a black hole. In theory, it might be possible to orbit a black hole close enough that time dilation occurs, allowing the traveler to move into the future. However, these theories have not been experimentally verified, and it is uncertain whether it would ever be possible to implement or control these phenomena in practice. Addressing the second part of your question: The two questions \\"Is backward time travel possible?\\" and \\"What is the possibility of time travel becoming a reality?\\" are similar but not equivalent. The first question specifically refers to the feasibility of backward time travel, while the second question is broader and encompasses both the feasibility and development of time travel as a whole, including travel to the future. It is important to note that our current understanding of physics does not prohibit the possibility of time travel completely, but backward time travel, especially, is laden with numerous challenges that we have not found a way to overcome. With our current level of technology and understanding of the universe, it is impossible to predict with certainty whether time travel will ever become obtainable. Scientists are continually exploring the intricacies of spacetime, and future discoveries might shed new light on the subject. Based on the context provided, the answer would be (a). No - the two questions do not have the exact same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

He also has a lifelong crush over the perfect girl, beautiful Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner), but she doesn't want a fat, snub-nosed loser as her husband. That would ruin her chances to have perfect genetically beautiful, pretty babies. The setting for the story is somewhat odd. Nobody can actually lie about anything, they don't even know about the word as its not invented yet. Mark is about to get thrown out of his apartment for his inability to pay the rent. So, he goes to the bank to withdraw all his cash. But, there's a technical glitch in the computers and they ask the amount he has to withdraw from his account. He asks for 800 instead of 300 and the systems are back on. But, the lady says there must be a mistake as the system shows 300 and she gives him 800 thinking the system is corrupt! Here inadvertently, Mark invents the art of lying. He is the first person ever to lie and its as easy as drinking water to him and everybody believes whatever he says.

In this fictional world, lying has not been invented, and everyone always tells the truth. People in this world don't even know the concept of lying and there is no word for it.  Mark's life takes a significant turn when he goes to a bank to withdraw the remaining money from his account. Due to a technical glitch, the bank employee asks him the amount he wants to withdraw instead of checking his account balance. Mark, intending to withdraw his actual balance of 300, suddenly decides to ask for 800, realizing that he can lie and nobody will suspect it. The bank employee believes him and gives him the money, thinking the computer system is at fault. This event marks the first time when Mark learns the art of lying in a society where no one else can. Mark begins using this newfound ability to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. He lies about an afterlife to provide comfort to his dying mother, which leads to a series of misunderstandings and an overnight transformation into an international authority on the concept of the afterlife. People start camping on his lawn to learn more about his stories. As he lies more and more, Mark develops a story about the \\"Man in the Sky\\" who functions like God, creating a religion and putting together ten commandments-like rules on two pizza boxes. Mark uses lying to change his life completely - he sways his old company to rehire him and becomes rich and famous. In conclusion, the habit that Mark picks up in the movie \\"The Invention of Lying\\" is lying itself.

Paragraph: Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan and the Greco-Indian Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). The first figural portrayals of the Buddha, previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth. The Yavanajataka and Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence.

Among these astonishing moments are the moments where players have made record-breaking touchdown runs. These plays have become immortalized in the memories of football fans, etched into sports history, and discussed around water coolers across the country. However, one question that arises in the minds of football enthusiasts is how many yards longer the longest touchdown run was compared to the shortest touchdown run? This article will dive into the history of the NFL's most memorable touchdowns to explore this fascinating comparison. The Longest Touchdown Run The longest touchdown run in NFL history is held by Derrick Henry, who achieved this record-breaking feat while playing for the Tennessee Titans in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 6, 2018. Henry's staggering 99-yard touchdown run is the pinnacle of running back achievements, having cemented his place in the history of the league. This incredible dash down the field occurred when Henry took a handoff from his quarterback, Marcus Mariota, on his team's 1-yard line, and took off down the sideline, stiff-arming multiple defenders on his way to the end zone. This unforgettable play not only showcased Henry's incredible speed and skill but also highlighted an impressive display of determination and endurance. The 99-yard run equaled Tony Dorsett's record run that took place on January 3, 1983, during a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings. The Shortest Touchdown Run On the other end of the spectrum lies the shortest touchdown run in NFL history. Though there is no official \\"record\\" for the shortest touchdown run, many players have experienced scoring a one-yard touchdown. The one-yard touchdown can occur in several scenarios, such as a running back plunging through the defensive line to reach the end zone or a quarterback sneaking the ball in behind the offensive line on a goal-line stand. While these plays may not garner as much attention as their longer counterparts, they still contribute to the team's overall score and can often be just as pivotal in a game's outcome. Examples include Marshawn Lynch's numerous \\"Beast Mode\\" one-yard runs or Tom Brady's iconic quarterback sneaks. The Yardage Difference Now that we have established the extremes in touchdown runs, we can answer the question at hand—how many yards longer was the longest touchdown run compared to the shortest touchdown run? The answer is simple and straightforward: the longest touchdown run in NFL history, held by Derrick Henry, spans a remarkable 99-yard distance, while the shortest touchdown run covers only one yard. Consequently, the difference between these two touchdown runs is 98 yards. This vast yardage difference demonstrates the diverse range of talent and skill that professional football players possess and further emphasizes the varied and awe-inspiring moments that fill the annals of NFL history. Conclusion In conclusion, the longest touchdown run compared to the shortest touchdown run in NFL history spans 98 yards, showcasing the astounding spectrum of achievements that professional athletes are capable of. These football plays, as well as all the moments in between, continue to captivate fans, spark intense debates, and fuel the passion for this beloved sport.

His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o'clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him. A dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel. The man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends. As he walked, he looked charily at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death. At about twelve o'clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand, opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze. He hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again. A half hour later, at a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man's feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Owen inherited two pieces of land. The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture.  But I can use this background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  What is an answer for this question: Which land had fewer wetland plants growing on it? Answer:","output":"From the information provided in the scenario, the Western land would have fewer wetland plants growing on it. Here's why: Your scenario mentions that the Eastern land was covered in wetlands, while the Western land had good, rich soil more conducive to agriculture. Wetland plants typically thrive in, as their name suggests, wet lands. They are plants that are adapted to and often thrive in conditions where hypoxia—a state of low oxygen—is prevalent. This is typically the case for soil that is flooded, causing its oxygen to be consumed faster by soil microorganisms than it is supplied, which is common in wetlands. Consequently, these conditions would create an ideal environment for wetland plants, leading us to conclude that more of them would grow on the Eastern land. On the other hand, the Western land with fertile and presumably less water-saturated soil would not be as suitable for wetland plants. This type of environment is more suitable for agricultural crops or other plant species better adapted to such soil conditions. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that there would be fewer wetland plants on the Western land due to its soil and environmental conditions, as well as its stated use for agriculture.  Moreover, the consideration of hypoxia and the presence of aerenchyma—a modification of parenchymal cells, found in many wetland plant species that enable them to transport and ‘breathe’ oxygen under saturated soil conditions—would not significantly impact this assessment. This is because these mechanisms would primarily be beneficial to the wetland plants in the Eastern land, aiding their survival in the wet, oxygen-depleted soil conditions these plants are adapted for.  In conclusion, given that the Western land is well-suited to agricultural use and not identified as a wetland, it's reasonable to assert that the Western land would have fewer wetland plants than the Eastern land."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Compared to Iron Man 1, which I really like, Iron Man 2 has more action, better special effects and is funnier. In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces two enemies--a weapon producer named Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a horrible-looking Russian who wants revenge   for something related to Tony's father. Besides the two enemies, Tony is also facing his own death. His man-made heart, which gives his Iron Man suit its power, is also harming his body. My favourite part of the movie was when Iron Man uses his laser   against an army of Hammer's Iron Man robots. Everyone in the theater was cheering. My favourite special effects scene was the fight scene at a car race. Ivan tore Tony's car apart piece by piece. A funny part in the movie is when Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is inside a boxing ring   with Happy Hogan (played by director Jon Favreau). Happy Hogan tries to hit Natalie Rushman. However, he is the one who ends up on the floor. The only problem I had with the movie was that I didn't understand why Ivan had so much hate toward Tony. I loved Iron Man 1 very much, and I expected Iron Man 2 to be much better. And after watching the movie, I'd like to say it is even better than I expected.

(For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)

People have money problems, work problems, family problems, health problems..... the list goes on. And we usually think that people who are happy and successful are having fewer problems than us. Look at the successful people we often mention. They have money they need, they have jobs they love, they have good friends, they have obedient  kids, they have the successful business, they have loving families etc. Everything goes well with them. That is why they are happy and successful. But in fact, the more successful you are, the more problems you have to face. More success means more challenges they have to face, and more success means more risks they have to take. Young and old, rich and poor, successful and unsuccessful, educated and uneducated, all have problems. The difference is that their problems are different from each other.  Rich and successful have big problems. Poor and unsuccessful have small problems. Still they all have problems which they can face. Successful people are successful just because they are ready to face challenges larger than ordinary people. Winning the US elections  makes Obama very happy.

This can include TVs, cell phones and computers and other office electronics, electronic toys and videos machines. Today, the average turnover rate for a computer in the United States is every two years, according to the environmental group, Greenpeace. The group's Dai Yun says e-waste is a global problem. \\"The electronic industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The high speed of growth in this industry means more and more electronic products are being wasted and thrown away. If no one decides to retrieve the old products and process them properly, the electronic waste will sweep over the earth like the huge wave behind me and pollute the Earth seriously.\\" Greenpeace works out that 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are produced globally each year. The components in many electronic products contain harmful chemicals that pollute ground water and the environment. At present , the U.S. has no federal law for the disposal   of e-waste although a few states have e-waste recycling programs in place, but there is no law. The U.S. exports much of its e-waste to third world countries, such as India and China, where workers took apart computers for valuable parts, hoping to sell them for money. But harmful wastes expert, Dr. Bakul Rao, says that's a dangerous practice. \\"From now on, the recyclers are not very educated. All they know is they can retrieve copper or gold out of it.

Everyone knew it was the most expensive, the most famous of schools. You had to be entered at birth, if not before. Besides, even at 12 or 13, I. understood my father.

He always knew his proper station in life, which was in the middle of the middle class; our house was medium-sized; he had avoided joining Royal Liverpool Golf Club and went to a smaller one instead; though once  he had got a second-hand Rolls-Royce at a remarkably low price, he felt embarrassed driving it, and quickly changed it for an Austin 1100.

Given the question: Information:  - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence.  - John Nichols Dalton ( July 11 , 1931 -- July 30 , 1986 ) was the 63rd Governor of the U.S. state of Virginia , serving from 1978 to 1982 . Dalton won the office with 55.9 % of the vote , defeating Democrat Henry E. Howell , Jr and Independent Alan R. Ogden . Dalton had previously served as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia .  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Ralph Shearer Northam (born September 13, 1959) is an American physician and politician, currently serving as the 40th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. On November 5, 2013, Northam became the first Democrat since Tim Kaine in 2001 to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, defeating the Republican nominee, E.W. Jackson.  - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range.  - The Lieutenant Governor is a constitutional officer of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Lieutenant Governor is elected every four years along with the Governor and Attorney General. The office is currently held by Democrat Ralph Northam. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately and thus may be of different political parties. The lieutenant governor's office is located in the Oliver Hill Building on Capitol Square in Richmond, Virginia. The lieutenant governor serves as the President of the Senate of Virginia and is first in the line of succession to the governor; in the event the governor dies, resigns, or otherwise leaves office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Unlike the governor, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia can run for re-election.  - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - A lieutenant governor, lieutenant-governor, or vice governor is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction, but is often the deputy or lieutenant to or ranking under a governor  a \\"second-in-command\\". A notable exception to this would be in Canada and a few other Commonwealth realms, in which the lieutenant governor is the representative of the monarch in that jurisdiction.  - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.  - Richmond is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. It is the center of the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Greater Richmond Region. It was incorporated in 1742, and has been an independent city since 1871.  - The Senate of Virginia is the upper house of the Virginia General Assembly. The Senate is composed of 40 Senators representing an equal number of single-member constituent districts. The Senate is presided over by the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Prior to the American War of Independence, the upper house of the General Assembly was represented by the Virginia Governor's Council, consisting of up to 12 executive counselors appointed by the Colonial Royal Governor as advisers and jurists.

Write a \\"B.\\" movie review (Options are: A. negative; B. positive;).","output":"Title: \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" Review: \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" is an exhilarating, tongue-in-cheek B-movie that absolutely deserves a place of honor among the cult classic science fiction films of the past few decades. With its endearing blend of comedy, action, and sci-fi thrills, this campy, low-budget joyride will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most unexpectedly entertaining films in recent memory. Directed by the up-and-coming auteur Jackson Samuels, \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" tells the story of a tiny, peaceful American town suddenly besieged by an invasion of otherworldly, killer tomato-shaped creatures. The film's unique blend of nostalgia, camp, and absurdity transports audiences back to the 1950s, when B-movies featuring alien invasions and monstrous creatures from outer space were all the rage. One of the movie's most notable strengths lies in its ensemble cast, which delivers pitch-perfect performances that effectively mix earnest acting with impeccable comic timing. Leading the film is the charming Parker Dawson, who plays Bill, a capable yet humble grocery store employee forced to defend his town from the rampaging Tomatoids. Dawson deftly channels the spirit of classic B-movie heroes, while adding his own flair and impressive physicality to his role. Ably supporting Dawson in the film are local diner waitress Molly, played with spunk and sass by Emma Landon, and conspiracy theorist-turned-vigilante Dr. Ned Kipp, played to mischievous perfection by the scene-stealing James Vickers. \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" truly shines in its use of practical special effects and innovative low-budget filmmaking techniques. The film's eponymous creatures, brought to life by a combination of handcrafted puppetry, stop-motion animation, and clever camera tricks, are a visual treat that evokes the charm and artistry of classic creature features. It is evident that the film's creators poured their hearts and souls into every frame of their work, investing this zany, apocalyptic adventure with an undeniable sense of love and dedication which bleeds through the screen. While the storyline is decidedly tongue-in-cheek, the screenplay never slacks in its commitment to delivering outrageous twists and turns, not to mention its fair share of quotable one-liners. This gleefully self-aware approach to storytelling complements the film's inherent absurdity, resulting in a narrative that is both wildly unpredictable and consistently engaging. Composer Rebecca Wright provides the film with a unique score that artfully straddles the line between atmospheric, otherworldly ambiance and catchy, rockabilly swing. The music adds an extra layer of character and energy to the film while simultaneously paying homage to the B-movie sci-fi horror flicks of yesteryear. Ultimately, \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" is everything a modern B-movie should be: unapologetically campy, utterly ridiculous, and endlessly entertaining. Despite its low budget and underdog status, the film easily outshines many of its more mainstream counterparts and genuinely earns its place alongside the best-loved cult classics of the science fiction genre. Do yourself a favor and bask in the misadventures of Bill, Molly, Dr. Kipp, and the rest of the gang as they daringly defend their small town (and the world) from the impending Tomatoid takeover. Time to buckle up and relish the ride!"},{"instruction":"Question: Read the bio below and try to give details on john korfas 's:    - career end     - career position     - height in     - years     - draft year     - college     - cyears     - team     - cteam       - height ft     - birth date     - career start     - name     - nationality     - birth place     Bio: jon anthony korfas -lrb- ; born august 21 , 1962 -rrb- is a retired greek american professional basketball player and a professional basketball coach .

Holkham was built by 1st Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke, who was born in 1697. A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting.  He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio. However it did not adhere to Palladio's... A:","output":"The last names of the two people Coke met in Italy are Burlington and Kent."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer:","output":"In order to provide the correct facts to answer the question \\"What did the Ottoman Empire look like?\\", I will need to gather information about its geographical extent, historical timeline, cultural aspects, and administrative structure. Step 1: Research the historical timeline of the Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman I in 1299 and lasted until the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923. It reached its peak during the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th century. Step 2: Investigate the geographical extent of the Ottoman Empire At its peak, the Ottoman Empire spanned three continents, covering parts of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. Its territories included modern-day countries such as Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria. The empire also had extensive control over maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean, Red, and Black Seas. Step 3: Explore the cultural aspects of the Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire was a melting pot of various cultures and religions due to its vast territorial extent and diverse population. As a predominantly Islamic empire, it adhered to Sunni Islam, while other religious groups like Christians and Jews could practice their faith within the bounds of the empire's legal system. The official language was Ottoman Turkish, but many other languages were spoken within the empire, such as Arabic, Greek, Slavic languages, and more. Step 4: Understand the administrative structure of the Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire was an absolute monarchy, ruled by a Sultan. The Sultan was both the political leader and the religious leader (Caliph) of the empire. The administration was highly centralized, with a hierarchical structure of regional governors, military commanders, and other officials answering directly to the Sultan's authority. The empire's legal system was based on a combination of Islamic and secular laws, with the Sultan having the ultimate authority in all matters. Answer: The Ottoman Empire was a vast and diverse empire founded by Osman I in 1299 and lasting until 1923. At its peak during the 16th century under Suleiman the Magnificent, it covered parts of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa.

Based on the premise \\"For example, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act requires OMB to ensure that federal agencies, when practicable, allow individuals and other entities the option to submit information to the agency electronically and maintain records electronically by October 21, 2003.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The paperwork in the government is quite excessive.\\" is true?","output":"To evaluate whether the hypothesis \\"The paperwork in the government is quite excessive\\" is true, based on the premise provided, we need to consider the context and intent of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), as well as other factors that could contribute to excessive paperwork in government. The GPEA, enacted in 1998, was a response to a growing concern about the increasing amount of paperwork generated and maintained by federal agencies. The main aim of the Act was to promote the use of electronic documents, signatures, and record-keeping in an effort to reduce the administrative burden on citizens and businesses and improve the efficiency of the government. The Act mandated that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should ensure federal agencies provide the option of electronic submission of information and maintenance of records wherever practicable by October 21, 2003. It is important to note that the GPEA was passed more than two decades ago, and since then, technology and the use of electronic documentation have continued to evolve. As a result, many government agencies have made significant progress in reducing their reliance on paper documents and transitioning to electronic systems. However, the premise provided indicates that there was an issue of excessive paperwork, at least at the time GPEA was enacted. Government functions, regulations, and operations can contribute to the generation of large amounts of paperwork. Factors such as bureaucratic processes, the requirement for physical signatures, and the need to maintain records for long periods of time can all contribute to paperwork accumulation. Taking these factors into account, it could be inferred that the premise at least partially supports the hypothesis that paperwork in the government was excessive at some point, at least around the time when the GPEA was enacted. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the situation has evolved over the years, and government agencies have taken steps to reduce paperwork and streamline processes through various initiatives, including digitization. In conclusion, while the premise supports the idea that excessive paperwork was an issue around the time the GPEA was enacted, it does not provide definitive evidence for the current state of paperwork in government agencies. In order to assess whether paperwork is still excessive now, updated information and data on the current state of government record-keeping and documentation processes are needed. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation should consider factors such as the efficiency of modern electronic systems in government agencies, the decreased reliance on paper documents, and the effectiveness of the GPEA in achieving its objectives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: I. at the cerebrum; II. at the medulla oblongata; III. at the meninges; IV. at the pons; Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Secondary Vesicles The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles become five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the diencephalon. The telecephalon will become the cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures; two that will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina. This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully formed nervous system. The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The midbrain is an established region of the brain at the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain develops around it and constitutes a large percentage of the mass of the brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is useful in considering its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking. The rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning “little brain”) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself. The most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of the same vesicle. The myelencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the medulla oblongata. The structures that come.   Q: Where is the most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain?   A: Answer:","output":"IV. at the pons; In the paragraph provided, it is described how the brain develops from its primary to secondary vesicles. During this process, the rhombencephalon differentiates into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon then corresponds to the adult structure known as the pons and gives rise to the cerebellum. The most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain occurs at the pons, as the paragraph states: \\"The most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of the same vesicle.\\" This indicates that the pons plays a crucial role in connecting the cerebellum to the rest of the brain, facilitating the flow of information and coordination between these parts of the brain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which now retired English football referee booked Croatian Josip Simunic three times (playing against Australia) in the 2006 World Cup?","output":"The now-retired English football referee who famously booked Croatian Josip Šimunić three times in a match against Australia during the 2006 FIFA World Cup is Graham Poll. Poll is a former top-level referee, having officiated in the English Premier League and numerous international tournaments, including UEFA Champions League and European Championship matches. He was regarded as one of the best referees in the world during his career. This unusual incident occurred on June 22, 2006, during the final group stage match between Australia and Croatia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, held in Stuttgart, Germany. Šimunić was first shown a yellow card by Poll in the 61st minute for a sliding foul on Australian winger Brett Emerton. In the 90th minute, Šimunić fouled an Australian player again, and Poll showed him a second yellow card, which technically equates to a red card for an immediate dismissal from the match. However, Poll failed to realize that he had already booked Šimunić earlier and didn't send him off at that point. Moments after the final whistle, Šimunić approached Poll to argue about a decision and was shown a third yellow card for dissent, followed by a red card. Later, it was learned that Poll had mistakenly recorded Šimunić's first booking under the name of Australian defender Craig Moore, which led to the confusion. The match ended in a 2-2 draw, and Australia advanced to the round of sixteen, while Croatia was eliminated. In the aftermath, FIFA conducted an inquiry, and Poll took responsibility for his mistake. As a result, Poll was not appointed for any further matches in the tournament and subsequently retired from international refereeing soon after the World Cup. Despite his successful career as a referee, Graham Poll's oversight in the match between Australia and Croatia, unfortunately, remains one of the most remembered moments of his refereeing career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After they delivered it, we noticed that it was extremely firm! nothing like the mattress we laid on in the store. We were told by our Salesman Cameron that it would soften up, which it never really did.  After weeks of waking up with back aches, we decided to return the mattress and try something different.  That's when we learned their \\"120 day comfort guarantee\\" or your money back, is very deceptive.  Since they had matched a competitors price on the original mattress, we needed them to match a competitors price our replacement mattress in order to have an even or similar exchange.  When I asked my salesman Cameron if they would match a competitors price on the replacement mattress, he got very rude and condescending.  He said that because they were taking back the original mattress, they were doing me a favor, so I would have to pay full list price for the replacement mattress and pay the difference, which was hundreds of dollars more!  We didn't like the way he treated us so we decided to just returned the mattress and got with hit with an OUTRAGOUS 20% RESTOCKING FEE!! and another 70 delivery fee for them to pick it up!

There are specific complaints about:      - The product purchased: The mattress did not meet the customer's expectation.     - The deceptive 120 day comfort guarantee provided by the store, failed to meet its promise.     - Salesman Cameron's rudeness and condescending attitude.     - The restocking fee and delivery charges, which were not foreseen by the customer. 3. Having considered these complaints, it's clear that the customer had a very bad experience at the store. As such, the rating for this place should be low.
