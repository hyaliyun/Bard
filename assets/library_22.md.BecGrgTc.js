At first, it may just seem like a flash of white, but upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that this little critter is a white squirrel. The sight of a white squirrel can be both enchanting and bewildering, as it feels like catching a glimpse at something rare and remarkable. Despite the odds of such an occurrence being quite slim, these charming creatures do exist and showcase the marvelous diversity in the animal kingdom. In this article, we will explore the rarity of the white squirrel, what causes its unique appearance, and the significance of these animals in various cultures. The Rarity of the White Squirrel White squirrels are indeed rare; it is estimated that the odds of a squirrel being born with white fur are one in 100,000. The reason behind the existence of these uncommon creatures lies in their genetics. White squirrels are the result of a genetic mutation, specifically the partial or complete absence of the pigment melanin. It is this pigment that determines the coloration of animals, including squirrels. The absence or reduction of melanin results in a range of white coloration, from pure white to varying shades of gray. White Squirrels: Albinism versus Leucism White squirrels can be broken down into two categories: albinistic white squirrels and leucistic white squirrels. Albinism is a recessive genetic condition that results from a specific gene mutation, causing the complete absence of melanin production. Albino squirrels are characterized by their pure white fur, pink or red eyes, and light-colored skin. Leucistic squirrels, on the other hand, are not entirely devoid of melanin but have a reduced amount. This condition leads to white or patchy fur, but unlike albinos, these squirrels have dark-colored eyes and skin. While albino squirrels may face various challenges in the wild, like increased sensitivity to sunlight and a higher chance of being detected by predators, leucistic squirrels do not share these difficulties, as they still retain partial melanin presence. White Squirrels in Various Cultures The appearance of white squirrels has long been associated with various cultural beliefs and superstitions. In some Native American tribes, the white squirrel is considered a symbol of prophecy. The Cherokee people believed that the sight of a white squirrel was a sign to avoid conflict or war. In modern times, white squirrels have become a symbol of pride and identity for some communities. For example, in Olney, Illinois, the town has adopted the white squirrel as their mascot and has even established protective measures to ensure the continued survival of their unique furry residents. There are also annual white squirrel festivals organized in various towns, like the White Squirrel Festival in Brevard, North Carolina, which celebrates these rare animals and raises awareness about their conservation. Conservation and Protective Measures Given the rarity and the vulnerability of white squirrels, particularly albino ones, it is essential that we work towards protecting and conserving these animals. Habitat preservation, monitoring squirrel populations, and educating the public about these species' unique needs and challenges are critical steps in ensuring their survival. As awareness about these creatures grows, more individuals and communities will take up the responsibility to safeguard them. Conclusion The white squirrel may seem like a mystical creature that only exists in urban legends, but they are very much real and truly captivating to behold. These unique animals provide us with a glimpse into the diverse and wonderful world of nature and remind us that sometimes the most extraordinary things can be found right in our own backyards. So the next time you catch a glimpse of a white squirrel, take a moment to appreciate the serendipity of the experience, snap a picture if you can, and share the story of these fascinating creatures with others. The knowledge and awareness about white squirrels not only add to the richness of our natural world but also reminds us of our collective responsibility to preserve and protect the precious environment that we share with them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You can have an amazing date at almost any type of restaurant, not just fancy and expensive ones. It can be a cantina with great margaritas, a French restaurant with luxurious entrees, even the new ice cream place.   You may want to choose a place you have been to before, or that someone you know has recommended. Nothing sours a date like ending up in a restaurant with prices that are shockingly high or food and service that's sub par. Check on the menu pricing. You can often get a sample menu online, and many restaurant reviews will give an idea of what you can expect to pay. This helps avoid an uncomfortable situation: finding yourself short of money, or at an unexpectedly extremely cheap or expensive eatery. Plan to pay for your date's meal if you are the one who's organizing the date. If you spent the day kayaking in the ocean, consider having a casual meal. You could get lunch or dinner from a food truck, or buy sandwiches from a deli near the beach. If you are both sandy, sweaty, and wearing your beach gear, it might not be appropriate or practical to go to the expensive seafood restaurant.   If you're going to be quite active all day, you could consider packing a picnic. Bring a bottle of champagne or wine to share to make it extra special. While casual dining is great for a date, avoid eating at a fast food place if at all possible. It's not the price of the food that matters, but the originality. Take your date somewhere special.  When your date recounts details to her best friend, you don't want her description to include, “And then we went to McDonalds.” Nothing could be more romantic than planning and cooking an entire meal for your date. If you're planning to have a date night in, it's a way to make your date feel very special. Plus, having good cooking skills is impressive and sexy. Just be sure to cook something you have made before, so you know it'll turn out and taste delicious.  You don't have to make a complicated six-course meal, but you also probably should not invite someone over for frozen pizza. If you are going to cook at home, make something quality. Or at least from a high-quality market. Sometimes making dinner together can be fun and romantic. Pasta dishes are easy to make, and relatively inexpensive. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: Having an amazing date isn't dependent on expensive or fancy restaurants. Consider spots with great food and ambiance, whether it's a cantina, a French restaurant, or an ice cream place. Make sure to check menu prices beforehand to avoid uncomfortable situations. When planning, consider the day's activities and choose appropriate dining options such as casual meals, picnics, or even cooking a meal at home.

Write some highlights for the following article: England captain Eoin Morgan has urged his team-mates to 'stand up' to the next World Cup challenge of New Zealand after overseeing a humbling opening-day defeat to Australia. Morgan's men suffered a crushing 111-run loss in Melbourne after Australia plundered 342 for nine - the highest score England had ever conceded at a World Cup. The visitors could only reply with 231 in 41.5 overs and next up in Pool A are New Zealand, who host Morgan's team in Wellington next week. Eoin Morgan was unable to stop England losing to Australia after they performed poorly in the field. Morgan discusses tactics with James Anderson during their 111 run loss to Australia. Morgan told Sky Sports World Cup Live: 'They'll probably be the toughest two games of the group stage and we know they're a good test of where we're at. 'If we keep testing ourselves against the best sides and learning as the tour progresses, hopefully we'll hit our straps come the quarter-finals. 'But I think the senior players have got to stand up, myself included, and lead the way from the front.' The Irishman admitted England had fielded poorly, with Australian centurion Aaron Finch among the big-hitters dropped on Saturday. Mitchell Marsh celebrates dismissing Morgan for a duck in at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 'I think we probably let ourselves down in the field - we didn't have a great day there. I think we needed all guns firing to chase down 340,' added Morgan. 'That's probably the most frustrating thing. We started a little bit slowly and a bit cold, which again has been disappointing.' Reflecting on the positives, Morgan praised Steven Finn following his five-wicket haul - which included a hat-trick - and pointed to the unbeaten 98 from James Taylor. Australia made their highest ever one-day score against England in their World Cup opener. He added: 'Finny taking the second five-for on this tour has been great and James Taylor was clearly very unlucky not to get a hundred at the end, as he struck the ball very cleanly.' Australia were largely indebted to Victorian batsman Finch, who hit 135 from 128 balls on his home ground. 'It was nice, a little bit surreal and it will take time for it to sink it but it's a great feeling to get a win first up,' he said. 'It's always a little bit iffy the first game of the tournament and there were a few nerves about but it's nice to get that out of the way. 'Everyone contributed right through the order with either bat or ball, or did something special in the field, so it's a great feeling to get this one out of the way and hopefully we'll take a lot of momentum through the rest of the tournament.' Australia next tackle Bangladesh in Brisbane on February 21.","output":"1.

Write an article based on this summary: There are few Irish businesses more exposed to the fall in value of sterling than mushroom producers.","output":"Title: The Impact of Sterling Devaluation on Irish Mushroom Producers Introduction The fall in the value of sterling has made a significant impact on the global market, affecting several industries and businesses worldwide. Among those most exposed to this situation are Irish mushroom producers. Ireland boasts a thriving mushroom industry with the United Kingdom being its primary export market. This article will explore the consequences of the sterling devaluation on Irish mushroom producers, including the challenges they face and possible solutions they can consider. The Dependence on the UK Market Irish mushroom producers heavily rely on the UK market, with approximately 90% of their produce exported to their British neighbors. As a result, any currency fluctuations can create a domino effect on the industry. Since the 2016 Brexit referendum, the value of sterling has fallen significantly, leading to major financial challenges for the Irish mushroom sector. Loss in Profits and Sustainability The devaluation of the sterling directly affects the income of Irish mushroom producers. As the currency's value decreases, so does the profit the farmers receive when converting from sterling to euros. This has led to a drop in income for mushroom farmers, affecting their ability to maintain a sustainable business. With increased competition from other European countries, Irish mushroom producers now find it increasingly difficult to compete in price with their counterparts. Imminent Closure of Mushroom Farms The financial pressures caused by the devaluation have led to some mushroom farms shutting down their operations. With reduced income and mounting business costs, the sustainability of these farms is being threatened. Several Irish mushroom farmers have had to make the difficult decision to close their businesses, leading to job losses in the industry and a reduction in the overall production capacity. Possible Solutions and Strategies To combat the challenges posed by the devaluation of the sterling, Irish mushroom producers must explore new strategies and adapt their business models. Some potential solutions include: 1. Diversification:  Expanding the product range can help Irish mushroom producers become less dependent on the UK market. By introducing new varieties, packaging, and value-added products, they can tap into new markets and attract a wider customer base. 2. Seeking Alternative Markets:  By looking for opportunities beyond the UK, Irish mushroom farmers can reduce their exposure to currency fluctuations. With the European Union as a large market and neighboring countries seeking quality produce, there is potential for Irish mushrooms to penetrate new markets. 3. Hedging Strategy:  Implementing a hedging strategy can help mitigate the risks involved with currency fluctuations. By using financial instruments such as options and forward contracts, Irish mushroom producers can protect their businesses against further devaluation and potentially benefit from favorable exchange rate movements. Conclusion While the devaluation of the sterling has undoubtedly presented significant challenges to Irish mushroom producers, it is essential for them to remain proactive and agile, adapting to the new market conditions. By exploring alternative markets, diversifying products, and implementing risk mitigation strategies, Irish mushroom farmers can safeguard their businesses and secure a sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options:  A. vaporate  B. cool off  C. form crystals  D. melt  E. keep things cold A:","output":"D. Melt When ice is not ice anymore, it usually means it has undergone a phase transition due to an increase in temperature or a change in pressure. In this case, the most probable and common-sense option is that the ice has melted. Melting is the process where a solid, such as ice, transforms into a liquid, in this case, water. The melting point of ice is typically at or around 0°C (32°F) at a pressure of 1 atmosphere.  When ice melts, the molecules of water gain energy and start vibrating more, weakening the bonds that hold them together in a solid-state. Eventually, the bonds break, and the water molecules become more separated from each other, causing the ice to turn into a liquid. This is a natural and common process that occurs when the temperature of the environment surrounding the ice increases. The other options do not align with the concept of ice not being ice anymore: A. Vaporate (evaporate): This refers to the process of a liquid turning into vapor or gas. While evaporation can occur with water after the ice has melted, it does not directly explain the change in the state of ice itself.   B. Cool off: This implies a decrease in temperature. If ice were to cool off, it would remain ice or potentially become colder; it would not cause a change in its state. C. Form crystals: This option could describe the process of ice crystallizing from liquid water as it freezes. However, it does not correlate with ice not being ice anymore, as it represents the opposite transformation. E. Keep things cold: This option does not refer to a change in the state of ice; rather, it refers to its thermal property of absorbing heat and maintaining a lower temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options:  1). yes;  2). no;","output":"Answer: The provided answer does not address the original question adequately. The initial question asks about a process becoming cheaper in a specific century, but the answer given discusses the introduction of paper to the West and its initial name deriving from the city of Baghdad. Therefore, the question is not answered satisfactorily. Option: 2). no; To answer the original question, it would be important to identify which process the person is referring to. Since no specific process is mentioned, it is not possible to provide a precise century in which it became cheaper. Different processes or inventions might have become more affordable in various centuries, depending on advancements in technology, increased efficiency, and changes in demand or supply dynamics. For example, the process of producing paper became cheaper with the invention of the papermaking machine in the 19th century, while the process of producing steel became more affordable with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the mid-19th century. To provide a detailed and accurate response, more information about the specific process in question is needed."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: \\"Did you ever have one of those days,\\" inquired Julia of her cat, Cecil, who lay in the crook of her arm and was pushing his head into the fingers of Julia's right hand, \\"when you think you've noticed something everyone else has missed?\\" Cecil didn't respond directly, but instead rubbed the side of his cheeks against the spine of Gravity's Rainbow which Julia held lopsidedly in her left hand. \\"Pynchon keeps bleating about the preterit, right?\\" Cecil, who began licking his paw and washing his face, did not respond. \\"-and the elect who are out to destroy them, but he's the one who's treating his characters savagely.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Firstly, I will answer the second question to provide a context for the first question. A \\"sin\\" refers to an immoral act or wrongful deed committed against a moral, social, or religious code. In religious contexts, sin often refers to transgressions against the divine or holy laws. In a more general sense, sin can also encompass unethical behavior, like dishonesty, cruelty, or disrespect. As I interpret your question, \\"sin\\" refers to the wrongdoing or immoral actions of an individual, and you are asking about the perceived or real wrongdoings of a political figure, Narendra Modi. Now, I'll address the first question about the alleged sins of Narendra Modi. Narendra Modi is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014 and the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014. As with any political figure, there have been numerous controversies and criticisms surrounding his tenure. A few notable concerns are as follows: 1. 2002 Gujarat riots: One of the most significant controversies surrounding Modi's tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat was the communal violence in 2002. Following the death of 58 Hindu pilgrims in a train fire, riots erupted in Gujarat, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 1,000-2,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi's administration was criticized for their handling of the situation, with accusations of not doing enough to prevent the violence or protect the Muslim population. While Modi has been cleared by the Supreme Court of India, many still hold him responsible on moral or political grounds. 2. Economic policies: Modi's economic policies have sparked debate among citizens, with proponents claiming they stimulate growth and critics arguing they have adverse effects on various sectors of society. For instance, the demonetization in 2016, which invalidated 86% of India's currency overnight, aimed to combat corruption and unaccounted wealth. While the move received initial praise, it was criticized for hurting the informal economy, causing a temporary slowdown and financial distress for the Indian public. 3. Social and religious tensions: Critics argue that Modi's affiliation with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) promotes Hindu nationalism and exacerbates social and religious divisions within India. There have been concerns about the marginalization of religious minorities, such as Muslims and Christians, under his leadership. 4. Suppression of dissent: Modi's administration has been criticized for suppressing dissent and free speech, often using legal means to silence or threaten critics, journalists, or political adversaries. Critics argue that this stifles democratic processes and results in an erosion of democratic values. 5. Environmental concerns: Modi's government has been criticized for relaxing environmental regulations and prioritizing economic growth at the expense of the environment. Instances of this include the approval of industrial projects in ecologically sensitive areas and changes in policies that undermine environmental safeguards. It is essential to recognize that these \\"sins\\" are a matter of contention and subject to varying opinions. Some people believe that Narendra Modi has done a great deal of good for India, while others hold these concerns valid and consequential. In answer to your third question, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about the perceived or real wrongdoings of a specific political figure, Narendra Modi, while the second question seeks a definition for the concept of \\"sin.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"The exact lifespan of a flat membrane roof largely depends on the type of material used, the climate where the building is located, how well it was initially installed, and how it has been maintained over the years. There are three main types of materials used in flat membrane roofs: Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), and Thermoplastic Olefin (TPO).  EPDM is a synthetic rubber roofing membrane that's widely used in low-slope buildings. It's resistant to weathering, abrasion, and extreme temperatures. With proper maintenance, EPDM roofs can last for 20 to 25 years. PVC roofing is one of the oldest and most reliable solutions for flat roofing. It's highly resistant to chemical damage, UV light, and fire. The lifespan of a PVC roof ranges from 20 to 30 years. TPO is a single-ply membrane that's made up of a blend of polypropylene and ethylene-propylene polymers. It's known for its durability, energy efficiency, and resistance to ozone, algae, and ultraviolet light. TPO roofing can usually last for 22 to 30 years. As for the statement, \\"Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system,\\" it is a reasonably accurate description of how drainage should work with flat roofs. Water pooling is one of the biggest concerns with these kinds of roofs. A slight pitch or incline, typically at least 1/8 inch per foot, helps to facilitate the runoff. This prevents water from pooling and seeping into the building, which can lead to issues such as roof damage, leaks, and structural deterioration.  In conclusion, a flat membrane roof, when properly installed and maintained, can last from 20 to 30 years depending on the materials used. And yes, it's ideal for the roof to have a slight inclination or camber to allow the water to run off into a gutter system, as water pooling can significantly reduce the lifespan of the roof."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Write highlights for this article: One of the most difficult parts of a trial, especially in front of a jury, is accurately describing the crime scene. A number of courtrooms have begun projecting 3D images of scenes onto walls - but these can only reveal a limited amount of information. To take criminal courtroom reconstructions to the next level, experts have created a 3D immersive system that virtually transports people inside the scene using an Oculus Rift headset. The setup uses an Oculus Rift headset (d), the OptiTrack optical tracker (e), laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. The computer system is shown at (a), (b) is the Oculus USB connector, and (c) is a wall-mounted tracker. It has been dubbed 'forensic holodeck' after the environment simulator used in sci-fi show Star Trek. The low-cost setup uses an Oculus Rift headset, the OptiTrack optical tracker, a laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. It also uses gaming software called Unity 3D. This creates an immersive world in which the jury, judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3D high-resolution detail - similar to Star Trek’s hologram setup. ‘In Switzerland, scenes are routinely reconstructed by combining 3D laser scans of the scene to post-mortem surface scans and medical images, such as CT and MRI,’ explained lead researcher Lars Ebert from the from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Zurich. To demonstrate the system, the researchers chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe (pictured). The scene was recorded by a surveillance camera, and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings. The aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room. The low-cost setup uses an Oculus Rift headset, the OptiTrack optical tracker, a laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. This creates an immersive world in which the jury, judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3D high-resolution detail. Oculus Rift is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time, allowing for calculation of the scene with the correct perspective. Oculus Rift (pictured) is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time. The headset consists of a screen that is split in half, delivering half the 1280 x 800 pixel resolution for each eye. In the front of the screen, two plastic lenses help create a diagonal viewing angle of 110-degrees. The Rift is then connected to the PC using a HDMI cable, and a USB transfers information about the head orientation to a computer. Head orientation is measured using a combination of gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers. When used for gaming, the headset doesn’t typically need to use positional information of the head is usually not required. To overcome this problem for the forensic holodeck system, the researchers added an optical tracker to measure the user position. This meant they could freely move inside the virtual scene. To demonstrate the system, the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe. The scene was recorded by a surveillance camera, and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings.  The aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room. ‘The purpose of these reconstructions is to create a visualisation of an event to make it possible for a state attorney or judge to properly assess a situation based on the bullet trajectories, visibility, speed and distance.’ Mr Ebert continued, however, that although the data used for these reconstructions are high resolution, and allow for a spatially correct display of the scene, they typically use a 3D reconstruction on a 2D display. This reduces the amount of spatial information available. The technology is similar to the fictional holodeck in Star Trek (pictured with  Deanna Troi played by Marina Sirtis left and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker right). Holodecks were installed on starships, space stations, and at Starfleet for entertainment, training, and investigative purposes. And although 3D screens partially solve this problem, estimating distances is still difficult because the perceived depth depends on the size of the display. Mr Ebert believes his Oculus Rift system is a solution to this. To demonstrate the system, the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting. During the incident in an internet cafe, a known drug dealer was approached by policemen and women in civilian clothes as well as in uniform for the purpose of arresting him. A Holographic Environment Simulator, or holodeck for short, was a form of holotechnology designed and used by Starfleet in Star Trek. Holodecks were installed on starships, space stations, and at Starfleet institutions for entertainment, training, and investigative purposes. A typical holodeck consisted of a room with a hologrid containing so-called omnidirectional holographic diodes. Holographic projections could be shown by manipulating photons contained within force fields. It was also used in an episode of The Next Generation, called A Matter of Perspective, to recreate the events leading up to a space station explosion for forensic investigations. Source: Memory Alpha. Despite being surrounded, the man was able to get up from his chair and draw a handgun. One of the policemen managed to grab onto the arm bearing the gun while the others attempted to take cover. In the course of the struggle, seven gunshots were fired and one of the bullets hit a policeman on his hand. The entire scene was recorded by a surveillance camera in one of the top corners of the room, and these recordings were used to reconstruct the sequence of events. The team then used a laser to scan the surroundings, and used to this to pinpoint the final position of the projectiles. This, along with the camera footage, were used to reconstruct every bullet fired. The aim of the reconstruction was to show how close the bullet trajectories came to severely injuring one of the people in the room. 'During a police congress, we were able to demonstrate the system,' continued the researchers. 'The comments by the police officers involved in the presented incident were promising.' Further work will be carried out to make the technology more accurate before it is used widely in courtrooms. 'The forensic holodeck: an immersive display for forensic crime scene reconstructions' was published in the Springer journal Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology.","output":"A team of experts has developed a 3D immersive system that virtually transports members of the jury, as well as other members of the court, inside a crime scene using an Oculus Rift headset.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What are hosted, but don't usually kill their host?\\" with the following options:  - ferns  - deadly viruses  - insects  - tapeworms  - bacteria  - orchids  - deadly diseases  - white blood cells Answer:","output":"Among the given options, tapeworms are the ones that are hosted but don't usually kill their host. Tapeworms are internal parasites of vertebrates, including humans. They belong to a class of flatworms called Cestoda. As a parasite, they rely on their hosts for their survival and thrive within the host's body, particularly in the digestive system. Unlike some parasites that have the potential to kill their host, most tapeworms do not cause immediate or severe harm to their host. They attach themselves to the intestinal wall and absorb nutrients from the host's digested food. Usually, the host's body can still function adequately despite the presence of a tapeworm. However, it is essential to note that tapeworms can still cause health problems and discomfort, especially when their population grows unchecked or if they migrate to other parts of the body. Possible symptoms and complications associated with tapeworm infestations include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, malnutrition, and even neurological issues in rare cases where the worm spreads to the brain. While other options listed like bacteria and white blood cells can be found within specific hosts, they do not fit the criteria as accurately as tapeworms do. Bacteria can be both beneficial and harmful to hosts, depending on the type, and white blood cells are not parasites but part of the host's immune system, defending against infections and foreign substances. Deadly viruses, deadly diseases, and some insects can be harmful and potentially lethal to their hosts, making them unsuitable options. Neither ferns nor orchids fit the description as they are plants and not hosted by living organisms in the same sense as parasites. While some species of orchids have specialized relationships with fungi, they are not parasites on hosts to the degree that tapeworms are."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(May 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In the small town of Oakey Oaks, Chicken Little (Zach Braff) causes widespread panic and mayhem when he rings the alarm bell, claiming the sky is falling. He is humiliated in front of his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) and the entire town when, after telling everyone a piece of the sky 'shaped like a stop sign' had hit him on the head, he is unable to find it. All the residents assume an acorn must have fallen on him, and Chicken Little becomes a laughing stock. One year later, Little is still being ridiculed for the incident and is bullied at school by Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris) and her band of cronies. His friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina) advise him to talk about his feelings with his father, but Little is more concerned with restoring his reputation outright. Following a bust-up with Foxy, his father is called in, and Little overhears the school principal stating that Buck had been the school baseball star in his youth. Determined to rekindle his relationship with his father, Chicken Little signs onto the baseball team. In the final inning of the big Oakey Oaks pennant game, with all the other players injured, he is called up to bat, and manages to hit an inside-the-park home run. Despite some confusion, the umpire ultimately declares the game won; Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant. Later that evening, Chicken Little prepares to go to a victory party being thrown for him by Abby, Runt and Fish, but another 'piece of the sky' identical to the one he had been hit by the previous year falls through his bedroom window. Not wanting to bring the matter up with him again, Little hides the sky piece from his father and examines it more closely, discovering it to be a bizarre panel-like device designed to blend in...

Write a negative yelp review (Possible answers:  - negative  - positive).","output":"Title: An Utterly Disappointing Experience One star (☆☆☆☆★) I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience to help others avoid disappointment. I visited the restaurant last weekend with high hopes after reading so many positive reviews, only to be thoroughly let down right from the start. Upon arrival, my friends and I were left waiting at the entrance for a solid 15 minutes before someone finally acknowledged our existence. We tried to be understanding, thinking it might be a busy night, but it was only the first of many issues we encountered during our meal. Once at our table, we were shocked at the dismal state of cleanliness. Not only were the table and chairs covered with food stains and crumbs, but the menus were sticky, tattered, and appeared to have not been replaced in ages. Frankly, it was both unhygienic and unappetizing. As we tried to look past these facts, our first encounter with the waiter was far from pleasant. He was inattentive, disinterested, and overall incredibly rude, venturing nowhere near a simple smile. It felt as if asking him questions about the menu options and ingredients was an inconvenience. The dining experience continued to deteriorate as we ordered our appetizers. When the dishes finally arrived, after a prolonged wait, what we received was a far cry from what the menu promised. My friend, who has an intense shrimp allergy, was shell-shocked to find shrimp in her ceviche despite the menu advertising otherwise. We informed the waiter of this grave oversight, and he offered no apology, merely shrugging it off and taking the dish away. When we finally started on our main courses, the quality of the food left much to be desired. My steak was significantly overcooked, arriving closer to well-done than the medium-rare I had requested, while another friend's fish was undercooked and not seasoned. The portion sizes were abysmal too, with one meal barely offering enough food to satisfy an appetizer. Throughout the entire meal, we overheard another table nearby sharing similar complaints, highlighting that this was not an isolated experience. The last nail in the coffin was the exorbitant bill, which we honestly felt insulted to pay after such a disappointing and subpar experience. To rub salt in the wound, the waiter took his sweet time to process the payment, ending the evening on yet another sour note. In conclusion, I highly discourage anyone from visiting this restaurant. Poor service, unclean dining areas, and a substandard culinary experience make it a waste of both time and hard-earned money. I hope that the management takes heed of the criticisms shared here and in other reviews, and I implore them to address these issues to improve the overall guest experience promptly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  David is an environmental scientist. Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B? Answer:","output":"Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would experience higher rates of chemical weathering. This is due to the following reasons: 1. Elevated temperatures: Tropical forests have higher temperatures, which increase the rate of chemical reactions, thus accelerating the weathering process. 2. Higher insolation: With more sunlight absorption, the overall energy available for various processes, including chemical weathering, is increased. 3. Increased rainfall: Tropical forests receive a larger amount of rainfall compared to temperate forests. Higher rainfall leads to a higher volume of water interacting with the soil, which promotes chemical weathering. 4. Faster decomposition: The warm and moist conditions in tropical forests lead to higher rates of organic matter decomposition, creating a more chemically active environment. 5. Less podzolization: Tropical forests have little to no podzolization, resulting in soil layers that do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts. This allows for a more uniform environment for chemical weathering to occur. Hence, considering these factors, Forest A (the tropical forest in Brazil) would have higher rates of chemical weathering than Forest B (the temperate forest in Germany)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead of focusing on yourself, you focus on what another person is thinking and feeling so that you can understand them better. Place more focus on understanding the experiences of others to build empathy. For example, imagine what it would be like to live somebody else’s life - with all of their circumstances - and how that would make you feel. You’ll undoubtedly meet people you disagree with or don’t get along with. Instead of digging your heels in further to defend your own thoughts and opinions, hear theirs out. Listen closely and seek to understand other people. Spend less time explaining yourself and more time gaining an understanding of someone else. Your ego will tell you to defend yourself or that the other person’s viewpoint is invalid or stupid. Push these thoughts aside and seek to understand the differences more. If you think that you always know best for other people, recognize that this is part of your ego. Even if you disagree with someone, don’t feel the need to tell them what to do or give them advice. While it’s nice to be helpful, don’t be pushy. If you want to provide your opinion or advice, first ask, “Can I give you my opinion?” or, “Would you like some advice?” What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article highlights the importance of forgiveness, empathy, and understanding in personal growth and relationships.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft KCB , CMG , DSO , AFC ( 13 May 1883 -- 20 February 1958 ) was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps who went on to become a senior commander in the Royal Air Force .  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'conflict' with 'world war i'. Answer:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'conflict' with 'World War I' is the Central Powers, which consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. They were one of the two main factions during World War I (1914-1918) and faced the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente. The Central Powers were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers, after which the Central Powers alliance was dissolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Person A: Hey, I've been wondering about something lately. Why is there no national health insurance here? Person B: Well, it mainly boils down to the public's opinion on the issue. A significant number of people don't think the government is capable of handling health insurance effectively, and they believe private companies could do a better job. Person A: Really? What makes them think that the government couldn't handle it? Person B: There are several reasons behind this mindset. For one, some people are concerned that the bureaucracy involved in government-provided health insurance would make the process slow and inefficient. They worry that a national health insurance program could become bogged down in red tape and lead to delays in care and increased costs. Person A: That's an interesting perspective. I can see why they might have those concerns. What about individuals who argue private companies are superior at managing health insurance? Person B: Well, proponents of private health insurance argue that competition among insurance companies acts as a driving force for innovation and efficiency. They believe that the private sector can deliver better services and lower costs through competitive forces. They also assert that government intervention could stifle such innovation and competition. Person A: I can see that perspective as well. But, aren't there countries with successful national health insurance programs? Person B: Yes, that's true. Many countries, like Canada and many European nations, have implemented national health insurance systems that seem to work well for them.

The popular Japanese manga  provides us with an escape from reality into a world of fantasy, adventure and romance.With much less text and pictures running for pages, it fits perfectly into today's fast, throwing away city lifestyle. But Tsai Chih-chung,a famous Taiwanese illustrator  , doesn't agree.He believes cartoons can be a bridge connecting traditional Chinese culture and wisdom with the modern  world in a much wittier and more acceptable way. He has interpreted Lao Zi, Confucius, Mencius,Zhuang Zi and Sun Zi and made their works accessible to a global audience. He has also produced two books about Zen  , introducing oriental philosophy. His cartoons are humorous yet full of wisdom and are admired as an easy way to learn Chinese classics. After avoiding the public for ten years, Tsai made a comeback in late April with seven new works. But does his age, 61, work as a gap between him and his young readers? Tsai doesn't think so. The topics he has covered range from philosophy in a time of individuality to the learning and memorizing techniques used at school. \\"Every child is a genius and has the potential beyond his own imagination, \\" he said. If popular Japanese manga is purely for entertainment, Tsai's work, to a large extent, is to light the power of thinking in a light-hearted way. Tsai uses differenr forms of water to refer to people. In his eyes some people are like an ocean, some are like vapor, while others may be ice or rain. But in essence they share a similarity-human being's forever chasing for the true and the good. \\"The person who thinks over life issues is not necessarily a scholar or a philosopher,\\" he said. \\"I've dedicated my whole life to thinking and individual freedom, not making a living.\\" Question: According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE about Tsai Chih-chung?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.  and the situation: Jacob is an avid street car racer who is driving in his sleek black Mustang. He comes to a red light and sees the car next to him is an expensive looking Honda Civic, owned by a man named Alejandro. Jacob and Alejandro agree to race, and when the light turns green they both slam their feet on the gas pedal and take off. Jacob's car arrives at the light pole down the street from the light sooner than Alejandro's car, and he wins the race.  Answer the following question: Which person's car, Jacob's or Alejandro's, must have accelerated slower? The answer to this question is:","output":"Alejandro's car must have accelerated slower.  To better understand the reason behind this, let's dissect the given situation and analyze the concepts involving acceleration. As mentioned in the background information, acceleration is a measure of how quickly an object's velocity changes. It accounts for speed and direction, and it can involve changes in either or both of these aspects. In the situation described, both Jacob and Alejandro agreed to race their cars, starting from a red light. When the light turned green, they both hit the gas pedal and began racing each other until they reached a designated point - a light pole down the street. Jacob's car arrived at the light pole earlier than Alejandro's, which means he reached their agreed endpoint faster than Alejandro did.  Since both drivers started their race under the same circumstances (same starting point and time), we can compare their speeds and accelerations as follows: 1. Both cars started from a stand-still position, meaning their initial velocities were equal (0 m/s). 2. They raced on the same path, so external influences like inclines or wind resistance can be assumed to be equal in impact. 3. Jacob reached the light pole ahead of Alejandro, indicating his car achieved a higher top speed and/or had a higher acceleration. Given these factors, it is safe to conclude that Jacob's car accelerated faster than Alejandro's car. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Jacob reached the end point sooner, confirming that his car's acceleration was more rapid. Faster acceleration allows a car to increase its velocity more quickly, and in this particular case enabled Jacob to win the race. Consequently, Alejandro's car must have accelerated slower than Jacob's, resulting in a lower final velocity and longer time required to reach the light pole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Imagine picking apples on Christmas or going skating on May Day. What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift  about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get.

It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft KCB , CMG , DSO , AFC ( 13 May 1883 -- 20 February 1958 ) was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps who went on to become a senior commander in the Royal Air Force .  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.    What is the relationship between 'charles longcroft' and 'world war i'? Answer:","output":"Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft, also known as Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Longcroft, was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) during World War I. The RFC was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, which later merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force (RAF) on 1 April 1918. Longcroft played a significant role in British military history as a senior commander in the Royal Air Force."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This article: English jeweller and naturalist William Bullock and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its independence, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science. The bird specimens were given to naturalist William John Swainson, their countryman, to formally describe, which he did in 1827. Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra. Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus. In 1873, English naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus Ergaticus, where it remained for more than a century.The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink-headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala. Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered conspecific. Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species (C. melanauris) and a southern white-eared species (C. rubra). A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers found that the red and pink-headed warblers are each others' closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina, a suggestion which has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).There are three subspecies, which differ slightly in appearance: C. r. rubra, described by Swainson in 1827, has white ear patches and is found from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who, along with their colleagues, recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina?, what is it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Irby Lovette is the full name of the person who, along with their colleagues, recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina. This recommendation was made in a comprehensive 2010 paper analyzing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers, and has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's simplify the numbers that don't have 's' next to them. So our equation looks like this:  5081 * s + (26287 - 16103 + 45768) = -45668 Now let's add the numbers in the parentheses: 26287 - 16103 + 45768 = 10194 + 45768 = 55962 So our equation is now: 5081 * s + 55962 = -45668 Now, we want to bring the number 55962 to the other side of the equation so that we only have 's' to solve for. We can do this by subtracting 55962 from both sides of the equation: 5081 * s + 55962 - 55962 = -45668 - 55962 Now, we're just left with: 5081 * s = -101630 To solve for 's', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5081: s = -101630 / 5081 When we do the division, we get: s ≈ -20 So, the answer is s is about -20."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood these words of our Lord's ascension and coming again in glory.  They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead.  And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them.  Christ seemed to have left the world.  The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while.  Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory.  And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.  Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.  And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

Context: Still searching for their first win, the Bengals went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cleveland Browns in Round 1 of 2008's Battle of Ohio.  With QB Carson Palmer out with a sore right elbow, back-up QB Ryan Fitzpatrick was named the starter. In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Browns kicker Phil Dawson got a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Bengals took the lead with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 42-yard and a 45-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, Cleveland regained the lead in the fourth quarter with QB Derek Anderson completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards, along with RB Jamal Lewis getting a 1-yard TD run.  Cincinnati would respond with Fitzpatrick completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Chad Ocho Cinco, yet the Browns pulled away with Dawson nailing a 29-yard field goal. With yet another loss, the Bengals fell to 0-4 while the Browns improved to 1-3. Question: How many more total yards did Graham have compared with Dawson? Answer:","output":"To determine how many more total yards Graham had compared with Dawson, we need to consider the field goals made by each kicker during the game. Shayne Graham of the Bengals made two field goals: 1. A 42-yard field goal 2. A 45-yard field goal Total yards = 42 + 45 = 87 yards Phil Dawson of the Browns made two field goals: 1.

The app claims to offer a convenient way to view notifications on the lock screen, but half the time it just doesn't work. My screen either doesn't turn on at all or lights up with significant delays when new notifications arrive.  Additionally, the app seems to drain my battery at an alarming rate, even when I'm not actively using my phone. My battery life has been reduced by almost half since I started using AcDisplay. Worst of all, the actual functionality of displaying notifications is unreliable. Notifications disappear randomly or don't even show up at all on the lock screen. I am also unable to interact with them or dismiss them, which is highly inconvenient. I've tried reaching out to the support team, but they seem unresponsive, leaving me to struggle with these issues on my own. I can't recommend this app to anyone.

Later down the line it got warmer, some of the birds stayed in the warmer area and adapted to it growing thinner feathers. Some of the others decided to migrate to colder areas instead. More time passed and the birds in the warmer area eventually evolved into a very dangerous creature with sharp talons to defend itself from predators. The birds that moved to the colder environment had less predators so they remained basically harmless..  Question: Given an increase in predators in both areas, which set of birds has a higher chance of survival, the birds in the warm area or the cold area? Solution:","output":"the birds in the warm area"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little.

He was known for his meticulous and accurate translations, which have been instrumental in helping Western audiences understand and appreciate Japanese culture and literature for several decades. Born on August 18, 1944, in Nashville, Tennessee, Wilson pursued a degree in political science at Dartmouth College before moving to Japan in 1966, where he studied Japanese language, history, and martial arts. Upon returning to the United States, he continued his studies at the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies and completed a graduate course in Japanese history at the University of Hawaii. Wilson’s career in translation began with a focus on literary works, such as \\"Tales of Heike,\\" \\"The Book of Five Rings,\\" and \\"The Tale of Genji.\\" Over time, he expanded his focus to include historical samurai texts, and in doing so, contributed significantly to the understanding and appreciation of Japanese samurai culture in Western countries. Among his published translations are \\"Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai\\" and \\"The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi.\\" Wilson received various awards for his work, including the 2005 Donald Keene Center Prize for the promotion of Japanese culture, the 2008 Japan-United States Friendship Commission Translation Award, and the Order of the Rising Sun, a prestigious Japanese honor that is given to those who have made significant contributions to the promotion of Japanese culture around the world. Wilson passed away on June 16, 2019, but his work continues to be celebrated and appreciated by scholars and readers interested in Japanese literature and culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting the building into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for \\"Dogs\\", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part \\"Pigs on the Wing\\". Wright commented: \\"It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there.\\" Mason recalled: \\"Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately.\\" Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: \\"Animals ... wasn't a fun record to make ... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me.\\"Released in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three.

When she was nine months old, Cunningham's four-year-old daughter Elena ate a spoonful of yogurt and broke out in hives. Elena is allergic to eggs, tree nuts, dairy and peanuts, and even brief contact with one of the these hard-to-avoid items is all it takes to set off a potentially life-threatening immune reaction.  Cunningham's eight-month-old son Wyatt has a bad dairy allergy too.  In order to keep their kids safe and healthy, Emily Cunningham, a stay-at-home mother from Charlotte, North Carolina who writes the AllergenMenuMom blog, and her husband keep a completely allergy-free home, buying only food products that are free of any trace of their children's triggers.  But that protection comes at a high price. Between breathing medications and epipens of epinephrine, a drug used to treat anaphylactic shock, the Cunninghams spend about 1,000 a month to safeguard their children from their allergies, and that's before the grocery bill. Emily estimates her family spends 80 a month just on rice milk.

Founded in 1912, the University has an enrollment of more than 22,000 students. With twenty-five Chairs of Excellence and five state-approved Centers of Excellence, the school is the flagship institution of The Tennessee Board of Regents system.  - Otto John Schaden (August 26, 1937  November 23, 2015) was an American Egyptologist. He was the Field Director of the Amenmesse Tomb Project of the University of Memphis (Tennessee). In addition to his work on the tomb of Amenmesse (KV10) in the main arm of the Valley of the Kings, he has also cleared and reinvestigated tombs WV23, WV24, and WV25 in the Western Valley.  - Tomb WV25 in the West Valley of the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, is clearly the beginnings of a Royal Tomb, but was never finished or decorated. It is thought to be the start of Akhenaten's Theban Tomb.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - Tomb WV23, located at the end of the Western Valley of the Kings near modern-day Luxor, was the final resting place of Pharaoh Ay of the 18th Dynasty.  - A tomb (from \\"tumbos\\") is a repository for the remains of the dead. It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes.  - Amenmesse (also Amenmesses or Amenmose) was the fifth ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt, possibly the son of Merneptah and Queen Takhat. Others consider him to be one of the innumerable sons of Ramesses II. Very little is known about this king, who ruled Egypt for only three to four years. Various Egyptologists date his reign between 1202 BC1199 BC or 1203 BC1200 BC with others giving an accession date of 1200 BC. Amenmesse means \\"born of or fashioned by Amun\\" in Egyptian. Additionally, his nomen can be found with the epithet Heqa-waset, which means \\"Ruler of Thebes\\". His royal name was Menmire Setepenre.  - KV62 is the standard Egyptological designation for the tomb of the young pharaoh Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings, now renowned for the wealth of valuable antiquities it contained. The tomb was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter, underneath the remains of workmen's huts built during the Ramesside Period; this explains why it was largely spared from desecration and from the tomb clearances at the end of the 20th Dynasty, although the tomb was robbed and resealed twice in the period after its completion.  - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it.  - Tomb WV24 is an Ancient Egyptian tomb located in the western arm of the Valley of the Kings . It was reported by Robert Hay and John Wilkinson in the 1820s and visited by Howard Carter ; however , it was not fully explored until Otto Schaden 's excavations in 1991 .  - The Valley of the Kings, the \\"Valley of the Gates of the Kings\\", is a valley in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the 16th to 11th century BC, tombs were constructed for the Pharaohs and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom (the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties of Ancient Egypt).  - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - Howard Carter (9 May 18742 March 1939) was an English archaeologist and Egyptologist who became world-famous after discovering the intact tomb (designated KV62) of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh, Tutankhamun (colloquially known as \\"King Tut\\" and \\"the boy king\\") in November 1922.  - Tutankhamun (alternatively spelled with \\"Tutenkh-\\", \\"-amen\\", \\"-amon\\") was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th dynasty (ruled c. 13321323 BC in the conventional chronology), during the period of Egyptian history known as the New Kingdom or sometimes the New Empire Period. He has since his discovery been colloquially referred to as King Tut. His original name, Tutankhaten, means \\"Living Image of Aten\\", while Tutankhamun means \\"Living Image of Amun\\". In hieroglyphs, the name Tutankhamun was typically written Amen-tut-ankh, because of a scribal custom that placed a divine name at the beginning of a phrase to show appropriate reverence. He is possibly also the \\"Nibhurrereya\\" of the Amarna letters, and likely the 18th dynasty king Rathotis who, according to Manetho, an ancient historian, had reigned for nine yearsa figure that conforms with Flavius Josephus's version of Manetho's \\"Epitome\\".

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To make a burrito,","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to guide you through the steps of making a burrito. Here's a basic plan and some justification for each step : 1. Gather Ingredients: Burritos have highly customizable ingredient lists. Common ingredients can include tortillas, cooked rice, beans, proteins (like chicken, beef, or tofu), vegetables (like lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers), and condiments (like salsa, guacamole, and cheese). Gathering everything together before you start makes the assembly process easier and more efficient. Also, by having everything in one place you reduce the chance of missing an ingredient in the process. 2. Prepare Ingredients: Cook your protein and potentially some of the vegetables until they're fully done. Rice and beans typically need to be cooked in advance too. This is done to not only ensure proper cooking but also to make the final assembly process easier.  3. Warm the tortilla: This is important because warming a tortilla makes it more pliable and less prone to tearing. Also, it enhances the taste of the tortilla. You can do this in a microwave for about 15 seconds or over a stove top for a few seconds on each side.  4. Assemble the burrito: Lay the tortilla flat. Add a base layer of the cooked rice. Add the cooked proteins and your choice of vegetables, beans and condiments. The reason for layering it in such way is so that the mix of these flavors come together perfectly with every bite.  5. Fold the Burrito: First, fold up the bottom of the tortilla to cover over the filling. Then, fold the left and right sides in towards the middle. Finally, roll up the burrito. Carefully fold and roll the burrito to encase all the ingredients securely.  6. Optional Final Step - Heat the Burrito: Some people like to heat the assembled burrito on a panini press, in a pan on the stove, or in a microwave to add a little crunch to the tortilla and to fully meld the flavors.  By following these basic steps, you'll be able to make a delicious burrito. This task breaks down not only the assembly but also the preparation of ingredients to ensure the most flavorful result.

Given the question: Background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Q:And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

B) Research - Look up information on appropriate materials, mechanisms, and technologies that cater to the functions outlined earlier. - Compare various designs, identify pros and cons, and read user reviews if available. - Estimate the cost of the intended project. C) Acquisition - There are three main ways to acquire the desired hands: purchase, DIY, or 3D printing.   i) Purchase: Find reliable vendors or manufacturers who sell the desired hands following the specifications and budget.   ii) DIY: Gather necessary materials, tools, and components. Learn how to assemble the parts through tutorials, workshops, or online resources.    iii) 3D printing: Seek out 3D printing services or buy a 3D printer to create the hands. Find or create an appropriate design file for the 3D model, acquire the necessary printing materials and follow the given guidelines for printing. D) Assembly and Integration - Assemble the hands, following any necessary documentation or tutorial videos. - Integrate the obtained hands with the intended system (robotic arm, prosthetic, etc.) - Perform preliminary tests to ensure both aesthetics and functionality. E) Maintenance - Keep a record of any wear and tear or breakdowns. - Schedule regular maintenance to ensure longevity and functionality. - Replace or repair any broken or worn-out components as needed.  2. Improving one's hand skills: A) Identify Hand Skills - Determine which specific hand skills need improvement, such as dexterity, strength, coordination. B) Set Specific Objectives - Establish clear goals for each identified skill, such as “I want to improve my hand's strength to lift a certain weight” or “I want to improve my dexterity for playing piano.” C) Research Exercises and Techniques - Look up exercises that target specific hand muscles to improve strength, dexterity, and coordination. - Investigate ergonomics and grasp techniques appropriate for the desired skills. - Look into therapies and rehabilitation programs designed to improve hand function. D) Create a Training Plan - Draft a comprehensive schedule that includes the researched exercises and techniques. - Set aside dedicated practice time every day/week to ensure consistency and effectiveness. E) Track Progress and Modify - Monitor progress regularly using objective measurements, such as the ease of performing targeted tasks, lifting weights, or playing musical instruments. - Modify the training plan based on the achieved progress, incorporating new exercises, techniques or increasing practice time if necessary. F) Seek Professional Assistance - If progress is slow or stagnant, consider seeking guidance from professionals such as occupational therapists, physical therapists, or specialized trainers. - These experts can help identify roadblocks and recommend customized solutions tailored to individual needs.

Tom tasted a bit and realized it was stale. There was a hole in the bag he hadn't noticed. Tom threw it out and got a new box. Can we draw the following conclusion? the cereal tasted fresh","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot draw the conclusion that the cereal tasted fresh. In contrast, the details suggest that the cereal was, in fact, stale. Here is a summary of the events that led to this conclusion: 1. Tom was going to have some cereal and poured it out. The sound it made was unusual, which indicated there could be something wrong with the cereal. 2. He tasted a bit of the cereal and realized that it was stale. The taste of stale cereal is typically characterized by a loss of crispiness and a change in flavor, often becoming less palatable. 3. Tom further discovered a hole in the bag, which likely allowed air to enter and cause the cereal to become stale. This can occur due to improper storage or damage to the packaging during transportation and handling. 4. As a result, Tom discarded the stale cereal and got a new box. This action suggests that he did not find the cereal to be fresh or suitable for consumption. In conclusion, the information provided in the story does not support the idea that the cereal tasted fresh. Instead, the cereal was discovered to be stale, presumably due to the presence of a hole in the bag that allowed air to infiltrate and compromise the quality of the cereal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: oh i just read for escape  well i mean it's Sentence 2: I read to escape from issues at my house. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we need to examine both their meanings and the relationship between them. Sentence 1: \\"oh i just read for escape well i mean it's\\" This sentence is vague and incomplete, making it difficult to fully understand the context. It seems like the speaker is attempting to explain that they read for the purpose of escaping from something, but the sentence is cut off and lacks explicit information. The sentence appears to be casual and conversational. Sentence 2: \\"I read to escape from issues at my house.\\" This sentence is clear and complete. It provides a specific reason for why the speaker reads. They precisely state that they read to escape from issues at home and inform us about the context for their reading habit. To answer the question if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we may reason as follows: 1. Both sentences do share the concept of \\"reading for escape.\\" However, the first sentence does not specify what the speaker is trying to escape from. 2. The second sentence provides a clear context of escaping from issues at the speaker's house. Given these observations, we can conclude that the second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence is too vague and lacks the specific context provided in the second sentence. However, there is a connection between both sentences regarding reading as a means of escape. To establish entailment between the two sentences, the first sentence would need to provide more information on what the speaker is trying to escape from, such as explicitly mentioning \\"issues at my house.\\""},{"instruction":"The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where did the man who died on April 27, 1992 become professor of composition in 1966?  Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: [ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon...

Given the context: What will happen to Taylor? Answer:","output":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I will first provide some background information, and then analyze the given context to speculate on what will happen to Taylor. Background Information: Skylar and Taylor appear to be two individuals who are undertaking specific roles or tasks. The situation suggests that they are working together, with Taylor possibly being in a supporting or critical role, possibly in a problem-solving environment or within a team. It is important to note that Skylar made some reflections and changed courses of action, implying that there were decisions, adjustments, or even mistakes that needed to be addressed by Skylar before Taylor could take further steps. Additionally, Taylor restoring the power to Skylar's position indicates that Taylor might have some authority over resources and decision making, or at least the ability to execute actions that could support and facilitate Skylar's performance moving forward. Speculating on Taylor's future: Based on the context provided, the following outcomes for Taylor can be conjectured: 1. Improved trust and collaboration with Skylar: Since Taylor helped restore the power to Skylar's position after Skylar made the necessary adjustments, it demonstrates Taylor's willingness to support Skylar when needed. This could enhance the trust and collaboration between the two individuals, leading to a more effective working relationship. 2. Increased responsibility and recognition: By successfully managing the resources and aiding Skylar in their position, Taylor may gain more responsibilities within the team or organization they are a part of. The successful accomplishment of their tasks could lead to positive recognition from peers or supervisors and potentially increase their influence in decision-making processes. 3. Enhanced problem-solving skills: Through the experience of working with Skylar and handling challenging scenarios, Taylor may develop their problem-solving and analytical abilities. This could lead to Taylor becoming a more capable individual within their role and organization. 4. Lessons learned for future situations: Taylor’s involvement in helping Skylar may provide them with valuable insights and experiences that can be applied to similar situations in the future. This experience may also help Taylor to better anticipate potential challenges and proactively find solutions to address them, ultimately improving their overall performance. 5. Opportunity for personal growth and development: As Taylor assumes responsibility for restoring power to Skylar's position, they may reflect on their actions and consider how they can improve as an individual, both professionally and personally. This opportunity for self-reflection and growth could lead Taylor to become a more effective and empathetic team member. In conclusion, while the exact outcome for Taylor cannot be determined without additional context or information, this analysis suggests that Taylor is likely to experience positive results due to their actions. These results may include increased trust and collaboration with Skylar, enhanced problem-solving skills, and personal growth and development within their professional and personal life.

After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the Sonderbund). The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire. Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". How big was the impact the Sonderbundskrieg had on the psychology and society of the Swiss and Switzerland?","output":"The Sonderbundskrieg, despite being a relatively short and low-casualty conflict, had a significant impact on the psychology and society of the Swiss and Switzerland. While the war itself may not have been as devastating as other European conflicts during the 19th century, it is crucial to understand the long-lasting effects and transformations it had on the country and its people. The Sonderbundskrieg highlighted the divisions within Switzerland, particularly along religious lines (Protestant vs. Catholic). It led to a sense of urgency to fix these divisions to create a unified nation. The insecurity and fear caused by the conflict had a considerable effect on the Swiss people's mentality, pushing them towards seeking stability and unity. As a result, the Tagsatzung (the then central governing body) was replaced by the modern Swiss federal state, under the new Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. This marks a crucial turning point in Swiss history and is considered the beginning of modern Switzerland. The new constitution established a more centralized government and ensured equal rights and representation for all cantons, irrespective of their religious majority. This new structure diminished the power of the church in politics and helped reduce tensions between the cantons. The society of Switzerland saw an increase in cooperation and mutual understanding among cantons after the Sonderbundskrieg. The resolution to unify and utilize diplomacy allowed Switzerland to maintain its neutral stance in European politics. By strengthening its domestic ties and focusing on national priorities, Switzerland was able to transform itself into a stable, successful, and prosperous nation. In conclusion, the impact of the Sonderbundskrieg on the psychology and society of the Swiss and Switzerland was substantial. It led to the creation of a unified and stable federal state, the reduction of religious tension in politics, and the establishment of Switzerland's neutral stance in international matters. The conflict marked a turning point that allowed Switzerland to become a prosperous and peaceful country known for its strong diplomatic relations and stable society."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

It seemed like an odd sensation, bothersome and profoundly distracting. She knew it was crucial for her to give her all to this task, but her mind kept wandering. Caroline couldn't help but feel that something was amiss, and she couldn't shake the nagging sensation that she was being watched. Angelo, her project partner, seemed to be doing just fine. He was inherently focused and dedicated to the project, almost unnaturally so. Seeing how engrossed Angelo was, Caroline couldn't help but feel slightly frustrated by her own inadequacy in concentrating. She sought his guidance, hoping he could offer some words of wisdom. Instead, Angelo remained distant, ignoring her attempts at seeking help and advice. He buried himself in the work at hand, leaving Caroline to flounder on her own. As she tried to refocus her mind on the project, Caroline would sometimes catch herself daydreaming about the peculiar set of circumstances that surrounded them. The project they were working on was funded by an enigmatic company, with very specific instructions on timing and logistics. They were stationed in a small town, where the locals seemed to hold a variety of secrets. One of the most mysterious figures in town was Jobe Smith. An eccentric individual, Jobe lived in a garden shed located on the property of the local parish, the shed owned by the priest of the town. Jobe had struck a unique deal with the priest, who offered him shelter in return for performing maintenance and upkeep on the property. Rumors about Jobe's peculiar past swirled around town, creating an air of mystique and intrigue. In the midst of all the whispers, it was difficult not to notice that Jobe was tied to another notable character in town, McKeen's brother. The brother was a jack-of-all-trades, requiring someone with equally diverse skills to assist him with various odd jobs that were too time-consuming or laborious to handle on his own. With his murky past and his resourceful demeanour, Jobe seemed to be the perfect fit for this role. He would often be seen at McKeen's brother's side, working together with him on tasks ranging from plumbing to landscaping. As the work on the project carried on, Caroline and Angelo began to feel the pressure mounting. Struggling to find a sense of balance between her frustration and concern, Caroline tried to focus on the tasks at hand. Unknown to them, however, their progress was closely monitored by an unseen party. The project director, employed by a mysterious agency known as The Shop, had vested interests in seeing the project through to completion. Tasked with keeping tabs on the experiment, the agency operated mere ghosts, providing Caroline with an unexpectedly substantial reason for her unnerving feelings of being watched. As Caroline and Angelo continue to work on the project, the presence of The Shop looms large above them, unseen but influential. The vibrant characters of Jobe Smith and McKeen's brother provide texture to a small town with secrets tucked away within its walls. In this remote corner of the world, the individual private struggles of Caroline and Angelo become entwined with the larger machinations of shadowy organizations and enigmatic figures, ultimately weaving a tale that highlights the complexity of human experiences and the mysterious nature of the world around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.  Question: \\"How do plants respond to changes in light conditions during the day and night?\\" Answer: \\"Their leaves change color during the day and turn green again at night\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is incorrect. The correct answer should be: \\"Plants respond to changes in light conditions by opening their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and closing their leaves at night to prevent water loss.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Hello Sandy, We have just returned from our holiday. We went with our friends Edward Smith and his wife Tina to the Yorkshire Moors. This is a beautiful place. It is a natural park. There are lots of places to walk on the tops of the hills, miles of grassland with no people, just sheep and birds. Edward, who had just come out of hospital, could not walk as far as be used to. However this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then stopped at a cafe for lunch each day, before returning to the place we live. Edward and I slept in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for another walk. Very pleasant! I have taken lots of photos from the place we live, across the valley below us, of the morning sunrise, and the mist in the valley. Also, in England, the old steam powered trains are very popular. I have taken many photos of the train and from it. Yesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It is very early (we usually expect snow in January). It rained all day, then snowed in the evening. Today we have bright sunshine! Both Jenny and I are well I don't know if I told you, in the last e-mail, that Jenny is now working in a hotel. Although she has to work hard, people there are nice and she is enjoying the work. Please write to us to tell us your news. Yours, Victor Question: What kind of place is the Yorkshire Moors? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The Yorkshire Moors is a beautiful place characterized as a natural park. It offers an abundance of open spaces with lots of places to walk on the tops of the hills and expansive miles of grassland.

The landscape also includes a valley below and is known to have beautiful morning sunrises and mists.

People keep asking me what my dad might like for his 90th birthday on June 12. I think I can answer that one. He'd like to jump out of an airplane and feel that freedom one more time. He'd like to have his family and close friends around him for a quiet celebration. He'd like a good martini with a couple of olives. But most of all, I know he'd like you, on the occasion of his birthday, to give to others. Volunteer service is Dad's true north. He made it a centerpiece of his presidency, encouraging millions of people to look within to find \\"your own special genius for helping others.\\" He gave 1,020 Daily Point of Light Awards from the White House to inspire people to volunteer and to prove that \\"somewhere in America, every serious social problem is being solved through voluntary service, for therein lies the greatest national resource of all.\\" In the years since he left the White House, Dad joined forces with former President Bill Clinton to support victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami -- and the volunteers who showed up afterward to help rebuild. Opinion: What George H.W. Bush, at 90, can teach millennials. Last July, he and Mom traveled to the White House to join President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and hundreds of others in a special ceremony to present the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award to an Iowa couple fighting world hunger one meal at a time. So what would he really like for his birthday? He'd like you to go to BeOne.PointsofLight.org and pledge to pitch in. As Dad said, \\"It doesn't matter who you are. Everybody's got something to give: a job skill, a free hour, a pair of strong arms.\\" I hope you'll volunteer as a way to honor my Dad -- or yours (Father's Day is Sunday). Or volunteer as a way to be good to yourself; researchers say it leads to healthier, happier lives. Whatever your cause, whatever your motivation, I hope you'll agree with me that volunteer service is an extraordinary gift. Thanks for everything and happy birthday, Dad. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Celebrating a 90th birthday: The family of George H.W.

His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts., can you guess it ?

Peter cut the tip of his finger one day with a sharp blade. The manager sent Peter to get medical help. Peter saw a doctor who tended to Peter's wound. Peter was back to work within a few days. Can we draw the following conclusion? Peter was in a lot of pain","output":"To draw the conclusion that Peter was in a lot of pain, let's examine the information provided step-by-step: 1. Peter cut the tip of his finger with a sharp blade.    - This action typically causes pain, especially if the cut is deep or severe. 2. The manager sent Peter to get medical help.    - The manager's decision suggests that the injury was significant enough to seek professional attention. This could also indicate that Peter might have been in pain. 3. Peter saw a doctor who tended to Peter's wound.    - This step shows that Peter's injury needed medical treatment, which implies that the cut could have been painful. 4. Peter was back to work within a few days.    - This statement suggests that the injury was not severe enough to keep Peter away from work for an extended period. However, it does not provide direct information about the level of pain experienced by Peter. Based on these steps, although it is reasonable to believe that Peter might have experienced pain due to the cut, it is not possible to definitively conclude that Peter was in \\"a lot of pain\\" as we do not have specific details about the severity of the cut or the level of pain he actually experienced."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Republican Oklahoma lawmakers urge Obama impeachment over bathroom directive A group of Republican Oklahoma lawmakers introduced a resolution Thursday urging the state’s congressional delegation to start an effort to impeach President Obama over the White House’s directive to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identity. The Obama administration issued the recommendation to all public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choosing. The directive has caused fury among lawmakers across the nation. Reuters reported the bill introduced in Oklahoma calls on the state’s members of the House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Secretary of Education John B. King and several others. Lawmakers on Friday also introduced a separate measure that would allow students to use religious grounds to have separate but equal bathrooms to segregate them from transgender students. According to The Oklahoman, a state Senate committee approved a measure to grant religious accommodations for students who object to the transgender bathroom order. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration. John Bennett, a Republican state representative, said in a statement that the White House’s policy on transgender bathroom usage was “biblically wrong,” and a violation of state sovereignty. According to Reuters, advocates for Obama’s impeachment said that the president has “overstepped his constitutional authority.” However, supporters of the transgender bathroom guidelines called the impeachment resolution a promotion of fear mongering. \\"In a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,\\" Troy Stevenson, executive director of the LGBT advocacy group Freedom Oklahoma, told Reuters in a statement. The measure was introduced hours after Gov. Mary Fallin vetoed a bill that would have criminalized abortion procedures. Click for more from Reuters. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a group of lawmakers in Oklahoma who are upset with President Obama because he suggested that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. These lawmakers think this goes against their beliefs and that President Obama does not have the power to make such decisions. So, they want to start a process called impeachment, which is like a big time-out for the president. However, other people believe that these lawmakers should focus on fixing the problems in their state instead of trying to punish the president."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself . Meanwhile , after being placed in the Cairo Museum , the mummy of Prem is revived when Hasmid chants the sacred oath on the shroud . The mummy then proceeds to go on a murderous rampage to kill off the members of the expedition , beginning with Sir Basil after he escapes from the asylum . One by one , those who assisted in removing the contents of the tomb to Cairo are eliminated by such grisly means as strangulation , being thrown out of windows , and having photographic acid thrown in their face .

Given the context: What will happen to Sasha?  Possible answers: have to leave the building, regret the behavior and arguments, get a bonus for their job The answer to this question is:","output":"Since Sasha resigned after experiencing negative situations in Casey's office, it is likely that a few different things will happen. Firstly, Sasha will have to leave the building as they have decided to resign from their job, which means they are no longer an employee of the company. This also implies that they will need to return any company property and be prepared to move on from that work environment. It's possible that Sasha might feel some regret for any arguments or behavior that contributed to their decision to resign. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances and whether Sasha feels that their resignation was justified due to the unsuitable work environment. Lastly, regarding bonuses, it is generally unlikely for an employee to receive a bonus upon resignation, as bonuses are typically given based on performance or as an incentive to retain employees. It's essential to consider the company's policies on bonuses and the specific terms of Sasha's employment agreement. If Sasha has already earned a bonus, they may be entitled to receive it, but it will depend on the specific situations and contractual agreements in place. To summarize, Sasha will have to leave the building as they have resigned, may feel some regret for any arguments or behavior that contributed to their decision, but it is unlikely that they will receive a bonus for their job upon resignation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. Air Force posted its own Afghanistan-related tweet that raised eyebrows — this one referencing a viral audio clip that has sparked a lighthearted online debate among those who hear the word \\"Laurel\\" and others who hear \\"Yanny.\\" \\"The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,\\" read the Air Force tweet.

Milo, a charming and mysterious young man, takes up residence in an abandoned mansion at the edge of town. Almost instantaneously, whispers of suspicion and intrigue circulate amongst the townspeople who are both unnerved and captivated by Milo's enigmatic presence. As the town's folk become increasingly curious about their new inhabitant, local journalist, Crystal Evans (played by Emma Watson), begins searching for the truth behind Milo's past. Crystal, driven by her instincts and thirst for a great story, finds herself digging deeper into the town's history and soon realizes that Milo is not a mere mortal, but a vampire. Despite this shocking discovery, she senses that Milo is not like the malevolent vampires from the horror stories. Reluctant to the nature of his existence, Milo wants to rid himself of his vampiric curse. Crystal decides to help Milo on his quest for redemption, diving into ancient mythologies and seeking out some of the world's oldest and most powerful supernatural beings.

Perez, U.S. assistant attorney general heading the Justice Department's civil rights division, as his nominee for the next secretary of the Department of Labor, according to a White House official. A former federal prosecutor and an official in his home state of Maryland, Perez was sworn into his current post in October 2009. CNN's Jessica Yellin reported earlier this month that Obama would name Perez to the Cabinet position. If approved, he would take the position recently held by Hilda L. Solis, a former congresswoman who resigned in January. In a letter to colleagues announcing her departure, Solis said she'd \\"taken our mission to heart.\\" \\"As the daughter of parents who worked in factories, paid their union dues and achieved their goal of a middle class life, and as the first Latina to head a major federal agency, it has been an incredible honor to serve,\\" she wrote. Perez, who is himself Hispanic, and his office have been active in several high-profile cases in recent years. They include:. -- In 2010, Perez launched a probe into the law enforcement tactics of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio after the controversial sheriff's hard line anti-immigration policies led to accusations of civil rights violations. The Justice Department determined that Arpaio had engaged in \\"pattern or practice of wide-ranging discrimination against Latinos and retaliatory actions against individuals who criticized\\" his department's activities. Arpaio condemned the investigation as politically motivated and a \\"witch hunt\\" provoked by the Obama administration's disfavor of the state's controversial immigration law. -- In October 2010, Perez filed a legal brief in response to a lawsuit brought by local landowners trying to prevent the construction of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In the friend-of-the court brief, Perez argued that practicing Islam is a freedom protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. -- Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican lawmakers and became the target of a Justice Department Inspector General's report that slapped the department's voting rights section for having a lack of professionalism and pervasive warring between employees who disagreed politically. The case stemmed from a complaint against members of the New Black Panther Party who stood outside a polling station in Philadelphia on Election Day dressed in boots and berets and carrying a nightstick. Though civil charges for attempted voter intimidation were filed by the Bush Administration, they were dropped against three of four defendants after President Obama came in to office. Republicans called foul -- accusing the department's political leadership of getting involved in the decision. Though Perez had not yet been confirmed when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision. Horowitz was not satisfied with Perez's account of the situation, saying in his report that Perez should have tried to get more information before testifying. Perez was not accused of any wrongdoing, but he has been criticized for not doing enough to improve what the Inspector General described as a dysfunctional department with persistent ideological polarization spanning two administrations. Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. This office is charged with \\"safeguarding workers, protecting consumers, providing a safety net and cultivating a thriving workforce,\\" according to its website. Perez also was on the Montgomery County Council from 2002 to 2006. He had earlier spent 12 years as an attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights division, rising to become deputy assistant attorney general during the 1990s. Perez also worked for late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and spent the final two years of President Bill Clinton's administration as head of the Health and Human Services Department's civil rights office.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person studied more about the stable state? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Paul studied more about the stable state. This is because the Gaia hypothesis, which Paul is studying, deals with the concept of Earth achieving a stable state known as homeostasis. The Gaia hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and maintains a constant environment ideal for life. On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which is not directly related to the concept of a stable state or homeostasis. The Theory of Relativity primarily focuses on the fundamental principles of space, time, and gravitation, and does not delve into the concept of Earth's self-regulation or stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which area, Texas or Seattle, will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire?  Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime.  Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. A:","output":"A: Texas will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire. This is because the paragraph indicates that wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Since it is currently daytime in Texas and nighttime in Seattle, Texas will experience higher wind speeds at the time of the fire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? What type of law defines \\"states\\", and their role in an Exclusive Economic Zone? Answer:","output":"To comprehend the law that defines \\"states\\" or nations and their role in an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), we should refer to international law, more specifically, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The concept of an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) was formally introduced in international law within the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) held between 1973 and 1982. UNCLOS has been ratified by 167 countries and the European Union, making it a widely accepted international treaty governing maritime law, including the definition and role of \\"states\\" in relation to EEZs. The provisions concerning the Exclusive Economic Zone are found in Part V of the UNCLOS, from articles 55 to 75 and annexes, regulating the specific legal regime applicable. Under these provisions, the EEZ is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in UNCLOS, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal state and the rights and freedoms of other states are governed by the relevant provisions of this convention. In an EEZ, a coastal state assumes special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources, both living and non-living, in the water column and on and under the seabed. However, the state’s jurisdiction is limited mainly to resource management; other countries retain freedom of navigation and overflight, among others, but they must comply with the laws and regulations enacted by the coastal state. The EEZ of a state extends up to 200 nautical miles from its shores. Where there is an overlap of EEZs between states, such as with opposite or adjacent states, the delimitation is generally achieved by agreement on the basis of international law. The principle of balancing relevant considerations, which includes both geographical (proximity) and non-geographical (e.g., relative dependence on the sea, desirability of avoiding cut-off effects) factors, is often used. In the absence of agreement, the boundary line generally follows the median line, equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the territorial seas of each state are measured. The development of the UNCLOS, particularly the EEZ components, has notably expanded state sovereignty from a narrow coastal strip to much larger offshore areas. This expansion is balanced by the responsibilities of coastal states, which are mandated to ensure the protection and preservation of the maritime environment and conservation of species.  Overall, UNCLOS effectively regulates the delineation and role of states and their interactions in Exclusive Economic Zones, granting generous sovereign rights to coastal states while simultaneously upholding the principles of freedom on the seas, cooperation, dispute settlement, and environmental preservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"The American people.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" based on the premise \\"The American people,\\" we should first understand the meaning and context of both terms and compare them to determine if they correspond to each other.  \\"The American people\\" refers to individuals or residents who live in or belong to the United States of America. This term is often used in political and social contexts to address the collective population of the nation. It emphasizes the shared identity and values among the diverse groups of people that make up the country. In some instances, the term can also encompass broader aspects of culture, history, and experiences unique to the U.S. \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" primarily denotes individuals who possess American citizenship. These people are either born in the United States, born to American parents outside of the country, or have gone through a process of naturalization. U.S. citizens have rights and responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution and laws, including the right to vote, the right to run for public office, protection under U.S. law, and other obligations such as paying taxes and serving on juries.  Comparing these two terms, one can see both similarities and distinctions. In terms of similarities, both \\"The American people\\" and \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" refer to individuals who belong to or identify with the United States. They share a connection to the country and its culture, values, and institutions. The terms may frequently overlap in everyday language, as many people who live in the United States are, in fact, citizens of the country. However, there are differences between these terms that are important to consider. \\"The American people\\" is a broader, more inclusive term that can encompass not just citizens but also lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders), temporary visa holders, refugees, and even undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. These groups may fully participate in American life and contribute to the country's cultural, economic, and social fabric without having official citizenship status. On the other hand, \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" is a more specific term, focusing on individuals who hold American citizenship and are legally recognized as nationals of the United States. While this group constitutes a significant portion of the American population, it does not encompass the entirety of the diverse individuals who call the United States their home. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" can be considered partially true based on the premise \\"The American people,\\" as there is significant overlap between the two groups. However, it is worth noting that the terms are not completely synonymous, as \\"The American people\\" is a broader and more inclusive term that can encompass residents who are not legal citizens of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in Dallas, Texas, into a family of Mexican ancestry, Trevino was raised by his mother, Juanita Trevino, and his grandfather, Joe Trevino, a gravedigger. Trevino never knew his father, Joseph Trevino, who left when his son was small. Trevino's childhood consisted of attending school occasionally and working to earn money for the family. At age 5, he started working in the cotton fields. Throughout his career, Trevino was seen as approachable and humorous, and was frequently quoted by the press. Late in his career, he remarked, \\"I played the tour in 1967 and told jokes and nobody laughed. Then I won the Open the next year, told the same jokes, and everybody laughed like hell.\\"  At the beginning of Trevino's 1971 U.S. Open playoff against Jack Nicklaus, he threw a rubber snake that his daughter had put in his bag as a joke, at Nicklaus, who later admitted that he asked Trevino to throw it to him so he could see it. Trevino grabbed the rubbery object and playfully tossed it at Nicklaus, getting a scream from a nearby woman and a hearty laugh from Nicklaus. Trevino shot a 68 to defeat Nicklaus by three strokes.  During one tournament, Tony Jacklin, paired with Trevino, said: \\"Lee, I don't want to talk today.\\" Trevino retorted: \\"I don't want you to talk. I just want you to listen.\\"  After he was struck by lightning at the 1975 Western Open, Trevino was asked by a reporter what he would do if he were out on the course and it began to storm again. Trevino answered he would take out his 1 iron and point it to the sky, \\"because not even God can hit the 1-iron.\\" Trevino said later in an interview with David Feherty that he must have tempted God the week before by staying outside during a lightning delay to entertain the crowds, saying \\"I deserved to get hit...God can hit a 1-iron.\\"  Trevino said: \\"I've been hit by lightning and been in the Marine Corps for four years. I've traveled the world and been about everywhere you can imagine. There's not anything I'm scared of except my wife.\\" Did people find this funny?","output":"Yes, little one, people found it funny. The golfer, Mr. Trevino, told some jokes that made people laugh a lot. He even did some funny things, like throwing a rubber snake at another golfer, making a woman scream and everyone laugh.

In response, Australia and New Zealand have joined forces to address the rampant crime and disorderly conduct plaguing the island nation, thereby rebuilding a sense of stability and safety. Step 1: Assessing the Situation To kick off their joint operation, Australia and New Zealand are conducting thorough assessments of the Solomon Islands' current state. This involves analyzing crime rates, identifying areas most susceptible to violence and social unrest, and evaluating the weaknesses of existing law enforcement structures. Step 2: Providing Appropriate Aid Following the assessment, both countries will collaborate to supply the Solomon Islands with the necessary resources and support. This includes financial aid, personnel, equipment, and training for local law enforcement agencies. The primary aim is to empower these agencies by enabling them to effectively combat crime and maintain public order. Step 3: Strengthening Legal Institutions In order to promote long-term stability, Australia and New Zealand will work towards bolstering the Solomon Islands' legal framework. This involves assisting in the drafting of new laws, providing guidance on effective implementation, and collaborating to enhance the capacity of courts and other legal institutions. Step 4: Fostering Community Engagement A crucial aspect of restoring law and order involves engaging the local communities themselves. This includes open dialogues, awareness campaigns, and education programs that target the root causes of crime and social unrest. Encouraging community participation creates a sense of shared responsibility and gives locals a greater stake in their nation's future. Step 5: Monitoring and Evaluation Finally, Australia and New Zealand will constantly monitor the effectiveness of their joint efforts and make necessary adjustments to maximize their impact. The long-term success of this intervention hinges on continuous evaluation, learning, and adaptation to evolving circumstances within the Solomon Islands. Conclusion: Australia and New Zealand's joint effort in restoring law and order to the Solomon Islands signifies their commitment to regional peace and stability. By addressing the root causes of crime and social unrest and bolstering the nation's legal framework, both countries hope to foster a secure and prosperous environment for all Solomon Islanders.

The cause of death has not been released.      “She traveled with a gun, and she knew he had her gun, and she was terrified,” Rochelle said. “He kept her in the trunk for 12 hours.”      Rochelle said her mom was hysterical, and she was hard to understand. She didn’t even know if there was more than one kidnapper.      The conversation was only 10 minutes long.      “I told her that I loved her,” Rochelle said fighting for every word through her tears. “That’s the last thing she heard.”      The phone went dead or they lost a signal and were unable to reach each other again.      “We do know that Rita was in Helena visiting her relatives earlier that day,” Dutton said. “She fueled up and was headed back to Great Falls and stopped at a rest area, which she thought was south of Craig some place,” Dutton said.      Investigators believe the abduction occurred at a rest stop near Wolf Creek, which is south of Craig, Dutton said. Authorities searched for clues at two rest stops on Interstate 15 Wednesday, one on either side of Wolf Creek.      Based on what Maze was able to relay to police, they believe the crime occurred at the more rustic rest stop, south of Wolf Creek, Dutton said.      Wolf Creek is about 50 miles south of Great Falls on I-15.      Helena police put out an attempt to locate the vehicle nationwide, and a license plate reader spotted the vehicle in Post Falls, Idaho, east of Spokane, Dutton said.      Authorities were able to find the car by locating Maze’s cell phone.      Dutton said there is a person of interest in the case and that authorities are looking at a surveillance video from a convenience store.      Because of the interstate travel involved, the FBI is assisting in the investigation.      FBI media spokesperson Sandra Barker said the federal law enforcement agency was working in conjunction with the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office but would not confirm FBI agents were investigating a specific person of interest connected to the murder.      Investigators say the body of Rita Maze from Great Falls was found in the trunk of this car in Spokane after she was abducted at a rest stop in Wolf Creek. (Photo: KHQ Right Now photo)      Maze’s body was in her car found in a parking lot in an industrial area in the 7600 block of West Geiger Boulevard, which is west of Spokane.      “We had received some information that the car may be over here in our area,” said Deputy Mark Gregory of the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office. “So basically one of the agencies started pinging the cell phone, which helped us get an area to search and locate the vehicle.”      Spokane County Sheriff’s Office major crimes detectives and Spokane County Forensics personnel were called to the scene to continue the investigative process, Gregory said.      Maze worked for years as an aide, a crosswalk attendant and a head cook in Great Falls Public Schools. She was the “lunch lady” at Morningside from 2005 to 2009.      “My mom touched every person she made contact with,” said Rochelle. “She considered herself a lifetime member of PTA with Bill Salonen.”      “She, one, had such a positive presence,” said Bill Salonen, former principal at Morningside.      Salonen said he had an expectation that if you served food or cleaned classrooms that you’d do more than that — you would also make connections with kids.      “And really, Rita was the epitome of that,” Salonen said. “I could really trust that she was really going to take care of kids and build that trust.”      After leaving Morningside, Maze worked at Peres Food Basket, then later worked for two years at B/E Aerospace. She decided to take some time off to spend time with family.      “She loved her grandkids so much,” Rochelle said.      Her granddaughters, Addyson, 4, and Carly, 1, are her son Michael’s children. Michael, a sergeant in the Air Force, is stationed in Germany.      “Growing up, my mom was an amazing mom,” Rochelle said.      She was the mom in the pool with the kids, taking them to picnics at parks.      “She was fun loving and had an infectious smile and was goofy and a child at heart,” she said. “And she had fun all the time.”      Read or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/2cChDEL ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

First, make sure you have everything you need: an iron, an ironing board, a clean and dry piece of clothing with a sleeve, and the patch you want to attach. 2. Now, lay the clothing with the sleeve flat on the ironing board so that you can easily work with it. 3. Place the patch on the sleeve where you want it to be. Make sure it is in the right position and straight. 4. Turn the iron on and set it to the right temperature for your clothing material. Give it a little time to get warm. 5. Carefully place a thin cloth, like a soft dishtowel, over the patch to protect it, but make sure you can still see its edges. 6. Gently press the iron down on the cloth and patch, moving it slowly around the edges and over the entire patch. Do this for about 20-30 seconds or as the patch instructions say. 7. Lift the iron and check if the patch has stuck to the sleeve. If it hasn't, press the iron on it again for a few more seconds. 8. Once the patch is nicely stuck to the sleeve, let the clothing cool down. And there you have it! You've successfully ironed a patch onto a sleeve. Remember to be extra careful when using the iron because it can be very hot, and always ask for help from a grown-up if you need it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Mr Duncan Smith, who quit days after the 2016 Budget, is urging the PM to postpone a plan to raise the income tax threshold to fund the move. In 2015, cuts to the Universal Credit \\"work allowance\\" were announced - reducing the amount people could earn before benefit payments were withdrawn. A government spokesperson said there were \\"no plans\\" to reverse the cuts. Universal Credit's single payment replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Mr Duncan Smith drove its introduction under the coalition government, although it was beset by delays, IT problems and an entire \\"reset\\" of the system, and was the subject of tensions between the Treasury and the DWP. He argues the cuts to work allowance cost people up to Â£1,000 as they move off benefits into work. Now a backbencher, he chairs the Centre for Social Justice which is making the call to reverse the cuts made by former chancellor George Osborne - who was sacked by Mrs May when she became prime minister in July. The CSJ is pointing to Mrs May's own words in her first speech as PM, in which she promised those who were \\"just managing\\" that \\"when it comes to taxes, we'll prioritise not the wealthy, but you\\". Mr Duncan Smith argued that higher earners would benefit most from raising the income tax threshold - something the government has pledged to do by 2020 - and said the money should be spent on those who were \\"just about managing\\" instead. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former minister said: \\"One of the key elements as you cross into work, the work allowances, those were all reduced. The problem with that is it means it is more difficult to get people into work and keep them in work. \\"We want to get people into work, we want them to progress through work, but most importantly, we want to make sure work always pays.\\" He said raising the tax threshold for everyone would mean about 25p in every pound would end up with the lowest paid, while reversing the Universal Credit cuts was \\"a more direct way of delivering on Theresa May's statement, which was strong and powerful, to help those who try\\". The CSJ argues that Â£3.4bn cut from the Universal Credit budget by Mr Osborne would cost people up to Â£1,000 as they \\"transitioned\\" from Universal Credit into work, thereby undermining incentives to take a job and move off benefits. The government says Universal Credit work allowances have been simplified and people are getting extra help to move into work, as well as benefitting from increased tax allowances, childcare support and the National Living Wage. A spokesman for the DWP said: \\"There are no plans to revisit the work allowance changes announced in the budget last year. \\"Universal Credit is transforming lives with claimants moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system.\\" Mr Duncan Smith also defended his work at the DWP, following the new film by Ken Loach, 'I, Daniel Blake', which tells the story of a joiner in north east England on benefits. Mr Loach appeared on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, criticising the system that tells \\"the most vulnerable people\\" that their poverty \\"is their own fault.\\" Mr Duncan Smith said he had \\"high regard\\" for Mr Loach but added: \\"Whilst on the one level this was a human story, full of pathos and difficulties, I think is the film has taken the very worst of anything that can ever happen to anybody and said 'this is life how it is lived'. I don't believe that \\"Also, his portrayal of job centre staff was unfair. Yes, you will always get one of two, but the vast, vast, vast majority are there to work and help people. This idea that everybody is out to crunch you has really hurt a lot of job centre staff.\\" Summary:","output":"A former minister, Mr. Duncan Smith, wants the UK Prime Minister to delay a plan that raises income tax in order to help people with their jobs. He says that a plan from 2015 made things hard for people who wanted to work. The government says they won't change those decisions and that they are already helping lots of people with their jobs. A movie about problems with the system was talked about, but Mr. Duncan Smith thinks the movie shows the worst side of things and is not fair to the people who help with jobs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She had always thought that the Deadlands, a vast expanse of desolate and desecrated terrain, was nothing more than a place filled with the vengeful spirits of the deceased and ancient curses. However, Famine's words painted a picture of the Deadlands that was far different from the one Angelique had imagined. Intrigued by this newfound information, she asked Famine, \\"What is it like living in a cemetery? Aren't you afraid of the dead? And how do you manage to survive in such harsh conditions?\\" Famine chuckled softly, a smile creeping up on his face as he said, \\"Living in a cemetery is not as terrifying as you might think. Yes, it is home to the dead, but the spirits residing there are mostly harmless in nature. They have grown accustomed to our presence, so we coexist in relative peace. It's just like having unseen neighbors.\\" He continued, \\"The biggest challenge in the Deadlands is the environment. The lack of vegetation and water sources makes it difficult to find food and sustain ourselves. My family and I have developed unique ways to adapt to our surroundings. For example, we have learned to cultivate hardy plants that can survive in the arid conditions and created a system to collect rainwater during the scarce rainy season. In fact, living in the Deadlands has taught us the value of resourcefulness and working together as a family to overcome the challenges we face.\\" As Angelique listened to Famine's story, she couldn't help but feel a strange sense of fascination and respect. The life they led was undoubtedly tough and, in many ways, completely alien to her. Growing up in a bustling city, she had never experienced anything remotely similar to the kind of existence Famine and his family had carved out for themselves in the Deadlands. Looking at the cart again, Angelique now understood why the items it carried were so varied and peculiar. Famine and his family must have spent their lives collecting and repurposing whatever they could find in order to survive. Even the book she was holding must have been a precious resource to them. Handing the book back to Famine, Angelique found herself saying, \\"Your life sounds truly incredible. Thank you for sharing your story with me. I've learned that there is more to the Deadlands than I ever could have imagined.\\" Famine nodded, gently taking the book from her and placing it back in the cart. \\"Life in the Deadlands can be harsh, but it has also given me a deeper appreciation for the world around me and brought my family closer together. Every place, even the seemingly barren Deadlands, harbors secrets and wonders waiting to be discovered.\\" As Angelique and Famine continued their conversation, she felt her curiosity grow. She wanted to know more about the Deadlands and the fascinating way of life that Famine and his family had developed in order to thrive in the most inhospitable of terrains.

Despite the backlash, Daschle has stood his ground, defending the basis of his remarks. Step 1: Context of Daschle's Remarks Before delving into Daschle's defense, it's essential to provide context for his comments. At a panel discussion, he expressed concerns about the ongoing conflict in Iraq and questioned the U.S. government's approach towards the issue. Step 2: Criticism Received Following Daschle's remarks, he faced considerable backlash from his political opponents who accused him of undermining the government's efforts in Iraq. Some even claimed that his statements could potentially demoralize American troops stationed in the region. Step 3: Daschle's Defense In response to the criticism, Daschle defended his right to voice concerns about government policy, arguing that dissent and debate are fundamental components of a healthy democracy. He pointed out that questioning the government's actions does not equate to a lack of support for American troops risking their lives in Iraq. Instead, it demonstrates a vested interest in ensuring they are not placed in harm's way without adequate justification. Step 4: Reiteration of Key Concerns As part of his defense, Daschle reiterated his key concerns regarding Iraq, such as the lack of a clear exit strategy, the continued violence that plagues the region, and the drain on U.S. resources and manpower. He also addressed the potential long-term consequences of the conflict on both American soldiers' morale and the reputation of the United States as a whole. Step 5: Call to Action Daschle concluded his defense by emphasizing the need for a thorough debate on the Iraq issue, without fear of being labeled unpatriotic. He called for open discussions among lawmakers, military experts, and the general public, highlighting the importance of evaluating the government's approach and course of action in Iraq. Summary: Despite facing significant backlash for his critical comments on the situation in Iraq, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle remains resolute in defending his position. He maintains that questioning government policy is crucial to preserving a healthy democracy, and calls for open discussions to ensure the best possible outcome for American troops and the nation as a whole."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.

The sentence states that, unlike most popular styles of music that are written in relatively simpler song forms, classical music is known for developing more complex and sophisticated musical forms. These sophisticated forms include the concerto, symphony, sonata, and opera. The concerto, symphony, sonata, and opera are examples of advanced classical music forms, each having distinct characteristics and structures: 1. Concerto: A concerto is a musical composition typically featuring a solo instrument accompanied by an orchestra. The solo instrument can be a violin, piano, or any other instrument, and the piece is usually composed of three movements – fast, slow, and fast. This form highlights the virtuosity and expressive capabilities of the soloist, as well as the contrasting textures between the soloist and the orchestra. 2. Symphony: A symphony is a large-scale orchestral composition, typically consisting of four movements that follow a specific structure. The first movement is usually fast and in sonata form, the second movement is slow and lyrical, the third movement is a dance-like minuet or scherzo, and the fourth movement is fast and energetic, often using a rondo or sonata form. The symphony allows composers to express a variety of emotions and ideas, showcasing the full potential of the orchestra. 3. Sonata: A sonata is a musical composition for a solo instrument (usually a keyboard instrument such as the piano) or for a solo instrument accompanied by a keyboard. It generally has three or four movements, structured similarly to symphonies. The sonata form plays a crucial role in the first movement, where the exposition, development, and recapitulation sections create a narrative arc that explores different themes and harmonic areas. 4. Opera: Opera is a dramatic art form that combines music, singing, acting, and sometimes dance to tell a story set to a musical score. Operas can vary in size and style, with compositions ranging from small chamber works to grand, full-scale productions. They are typically sung throughout, with solo vocal lines called arias, and other elements such as recitatives (a narrative style of singing), choruses, and orchestral interludes. Opera allows composers and performers to bring together various elements of drama and music to create a powerful and emotional storytelling medium. In conclusion, the given sentence answers the question by identifying the concerto, symphony, sonata, and opera as examples of sophisticated classical music forms. These forms represent the complexity and depth of classical music, setting it apart from more popular and simpler song forms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The team includes Charlie Croker, a professional thief; Lyle, or Napster, a computer expert; Handsome Rob, their wheelman; Steve, their inside man; and Left Ear, their explosives expert. They successfully complete the theft by stealing the actual safe and stealing the gold from it after the safe lands underwater while the gangsters are occupied with a decoy led by Rob and Napster. After leaving the city, the team agrees to split up the gold and part ways once they return to the United States. However, Steve turns on them: in the Alps near Austrian border, he and his own men intercept their van on a bridge and take the gold. When John confronts him, Steve kills him. Rob drives the van into the lake off a bridge, where they keep themselves alive using oxygen tanks from the heist. Steve assumes they are dead and leaves with the gold. A year later, Charlie and the others have returned to the States and have located Steve under his new false identity, changing his last name to Frizelli, moving to Los Angeles and laundering the gold for money. Charlie goes to Philadelphia and meets with Stella Bridger, John's estranged daughter and also a skilled private safecracker working for the police, who is furious with him, believing that Charlie was responsible for the death of her father, but Charlie instead convinces her to help get revenge on Steve by helping with the heist to steal back the gold.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the fact that:  At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster.  Answer the question:   When observing reactants and their particles, Shane increases the temperature they're exposed to, noting that they now move faster or slower? A:","output":"When observing reactants and their particles, as Shane increases the temperature they're exposed to, he would notice that they now move faster. The reason behind this phenomenon lies in the basic understanding of the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles present in the system. The kinetic energy is directly proportional to temperature. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. This relationship can be expressed mathematically using the following formula: Kinetic energy (KE) = (1/2) * mass (m) * velocity^2 (v^2) Here, mass is the mass of a particle, and velocity is its speed. Temperature affects the kinetic energy of particles by increasing the velocity at which the particles move. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases, causing them to move faster. The faster-moving particles have more energy available to overcome the activation energy barrier, which is the minimum energy required to initiate a chemical reaction. In the context of chemical reactions, the increase in particle velocity (and, consequently, kinetic energy) has the following effects: 1. Increased collision frequency: Faster-moving particles collide more frequently with each other, thereby increasing the likelihood of reactions occurring between the reactants. 2. Enhanced reaction rate: As the number of collisions between reactant particles increases, the overall reaction rate also increases. This is because more of these collisions have the necessary energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, leading to a more significant number of successful reactions per unit of time. 3. Broader distribution of energy: At higher temperatures, the distribution of molecular energies becomes broader, resulting in a greater number of molecules possessing energy equal to or higher than the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. Therefore, when Shane increases the temperature of the reactants and observes their particles, he would see that they now move faster due to the increase in kinetic energy from the temperature rise. This would lead to more frequent collisions, a higher reaction rate, and a greater proportion of molecules with sufficient energy to participate in the reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What happens if you trip while playing basketball? - sweat - dribbling - hurt yourself - fall down - make baskets  The best answer is","output":"If you trip while playing basketball, there could be several outcomes based on what aspect of the game you are referring to or the situation at the time of the trip: 1. Sweat: Tripping while playing could be a result of sweating a lot, as your hands might get slipped and you could lose balance. And the sweat drops on the floor could also make the floor slippery, leading to tripping incidents. This is why players often wipe their shoes and officials pause the game to wipe the floor in professional basketball games. 2. Dribbling: If you trip while dribbling the ball, this could result in you losing control of the ball. Additionally, your dribbling might be considered as a travel or double dribble, depending on how you've interacted with the ball during your fall, both are considered violations in the game and will result in loss of ball possession.  3. Hurt Yourself: Depending on how you fall, you could potentially hurt yourself. Injuries could range from minor ones, like scratches or bruises, to more serious injuries, like sprained ankles, knee injuries or even fractures. This is why it's always recommended to maintain good physical health, balance, and coordination to minimize the risk of falling or tripping during the game.  4. Fall Down: If you trip, naturally, you would fall down. This could disrupt the flow of the game, and depending on the force or the manner of the fall, it could potentially lead to serious injuries as mentioned above. 5. Make Baskets: If you're attempting a shot or a layup and trip in the process, it could affect the success of your shot. If you trip before you've released the ball, chances are your shot will fall short or go wayward. If the ball was already in the air when you tripped, it could still potentially be a successful basket. However, if your trip is due to a foul by an opposing player while shooting, you can get free throw attempts. In any case, tripping during a basketball game is considered a natural part of the sport, since it involves a lot of movements, quick turns, jumps, but is certainly something that players try to avoid for uninterrupted game play and for safety reasons."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The frame is the metal or carbon-fiber body of the bike, and, unlike the handlebars or seat (known as a \\"saddle\\"), it is not adjustable. Thus, buying the proper frame is the most important thing you can do when shopping for a bike. There is a variety of frames available on the market, but the frame shape generally changes based on the type of riding the bike is made for. Know, however, that there are as many different frame configurations as there are bike makers, each with \\"specialized\\" functions. However, the general shape of the bike helps determine its function more often than not:   Road bikes are most often used by commuters, fitness, and racing fitness riding. The frames are usually large, isosceles (all sides the same length) triangles with a top bar, or top tube, that is parallel to the ground. Racing bikes usually have smaller frames, while touring or commuter bikes often have larger frames. Road bike frame sizes are measured in centimeters.  Mountain bikes have a lower center of gravity to keep you on balance riding over roots, rocks, and mud on the trail. The center triangle is more compact, with the top tube sometimes angling down, away from the handlebars. Mountain bike frame sizes are measured in inches.  Hybrid bikes combine features of road and mountain bikes. You can use these for both street riding and casual trail riding. These frames are usually measured in centimeters.  Cruiser bikes have odd, sideways S-shaped or curved frames that allow you to sit nearly upright while riding. The handlebars are high above the seat and the pedals slightly in front of you so that you comfortably cruise around town. Sometimes called \\"city bikes\\" or \\"commuter bikes,\\" these are made for short distances. Fitting these bikes is less about measurements than pure comfort on a test ride.   Kids bikes have smaller frames similar to mountain bikes, helping them keep their balance with a lower center of gravity. They are very adjustable to compensate for quickly growing kids. They are usually measured by wheel size. Stand with your feet 6 inches apart, then measure from the inside of your foot up to your crotch, where your leg meets your waist. Think of the seam on the inside of a pair of jeans. You need to measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to where your seat should be. If you are sizing a mountain bike, measure in inches. If you are sizing a road bike, measure in centimeters. For the most precise measurement:  Take a thick, hardcover book and \\"sit\\" on the spine as if it was your bike seat. Still standing, measure to the top of the book from the floor. Multiply your inseam measurement, in centimeters, by .67 to get your suggested seat tube (bar reaching from seat to pedals) length.  The seat tube is usually, though not always, measured from the top of the tube to the center point of the crankshaft.  Know that this measurement is simply a starting point -- you will likely need to make specific adjustments later on. Multiply your inseam (in inches) by .67, then subtract 4\\" from the answer to get the length of your top tube. Use the top-tube for your measurement when possible if you are a mountain biker, as seat tube (pedals to seat) measurements are tricky and change from manufacturer to manufacturer.  For example, if you have a 33 inch inseam, you would need a 17.5\\" top tube (17.75\\" tubes are hard to find):33\\" x .67 = 21.75\\"    21.75\\" - 4\\" = 17.75   Some mountain bikers prefer to measure by seat tube length, like road bikers. If your bike shop gives frame size by seat tube length, take your inseam and multiply it by .185. The resulting number is the recommended distance between your seat and the middle of the crankshaft, which is the circular piece the pedal rotates on. Most kid bikes are adjustable, accommodating random growth spurts so you don't need to buy a new bike every year. That said, a child's bike should still fit them so they can put their feet flat on the ground while they’re sitting on the saddle.   For a child's inseam of 12-17 inches: 12-inch wheels  For a child's inseam of 18-22 inches: 16-inch wheels  For a child's inseam of 22-25 inches: 20-inch wheels The height of the seat is easily modified on a bike to fit you, and the right size frame will feel wrong if the seat isn't high enough. You want to have it raised so that, on the bottom of your pedal stroke (one foot is at the lowest point), your knee is slightly bent, not straight. Have a friend or someone at the bike shop hold the bike in place while you get on. Pedal backward, stopping with one foot at the very bottom of the pedal's rotation, and adjust your seat height so that it is slightly bent.  It is very rare that the last person who tested the bike needed the same seat height as you, so you must adjust this before knowing if the frame is the wrong size. Make sure you are not shifting or dropping your hips with each pedal stroke, as this will make your foot drop lower than it should and result in an improper fit. Straddle the top tube of the bike with your feet shoulder width apart. Grab the stem that connects to the handlebars with one hand and the seat with the other hand. Pull the frame up against your pelvic bone. Have a friend measure the distance between the ground and the wheels. A road bike should only have 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) of space between the wheels and ground. If not, then you need a bigger frame. A mountain bike should have 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of space beneath the tires. If it’s any more or less, change the frame size. Everyone's body is a little different, and the proportions of your arms, legs, and torso might mean you need a different frame to feel comfortable. Use your inseam measurements to get a starting frame size, then go to a local bike shop and test it out. Then test out a size bigger and size smaller. If you are in between sizes that both feel comfortable, think about your riding style:  Smaller bikes are generally lighter and a bit more maneuverable. However, this difference is negligible, and you might not be able to adjust the bike a size if you find yourself uncomfortable later on. Many mountain bikers and racers opt for the smaller frame. Larger bikes can make you reach a bit too far, but you can often raise and lower the handlebars to a greater degree, allowing you better customization options if you decide you need a better fit further down the road. Many road bikers chose the larger bike for a more comfortable fit. Most bicycle stores will help you determine the best size for your comfort and needs. They will take measurements for you and let you test out different types of bikes. If you don't want to size your bike yourself, this is a quick and easy option. Everyone is different, so if you don't feel comfortable riding a bike the \\"should\\" fit you, you need to get it re-sized. Test a few different frame sizes before buying, and feel free to play with the seat and handlebars until you find your sweet spot.  Rent a few bikes before buying so that you can get 2-3 days of riding in. Talk to you local bike staff, even if you might buy a bike online. Let them know about any specific issues you've had and possible reasons. Summary:","output":"1.

With investors eagerly watching, the stock market appeared to bounce back, demonstrating the resilience and ability to rebound amid the plethora of factors that influence market behavior. The positive trend can be attributed to a number of global developments, market analysis, and speculation regarding the anticipated referendum results. Global Developments Shaping Wall Street Economic and political uncertainties have been pervasive during the week leading up to the UK referendum. Investors have been paying close attention to the potential implications of the Brexit decision, as the event has a significant bearing on global economic stability. The heightened tensions and fear of a global recession have led to volatile market fluctuations, particularly in the European and US stock markets.  Recent polls have suggested that the 'Remain' campaign appears to be gaining momentum, offering a glimmer of hope that the UK may choose to stay a part of the European Union. This has had a positive impact on market sentiment, giving Wall Street a much-needed boost in morale. The result is a more optimistic outlook from investors, generating increased interest in stocks and driving the market upward. Another significant development that has played a crucial role in the shifting market trend is the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at current levels, instead of increasing them as planned earlier. This, along with the prospect of the UK remaining in the EU, injected a dose of confidence into the financial market, making it more appealing for investors. Market Analysis and Expert Opinions In the midst of market volatility, expert opinions and analysis become increasingly influential in shaping investor behavior. Prior to Wall Street's strong performance on Thursday, several experts had speculated that the tumultuous environment was a temporary phase and would not lead to long-term damage to the stock market. This optimistic prediction, along with improving global circumstances, has contributed to the turnaround witnessed in the market's performance. Furthermore, the resilience of the US economy has played a pivotal role in the market's recovery. Ongoing economic growth and a robust labor market have helped alleviate the concerns surrounding Brexit to a certain extent. Moreover, the economic fundamentals have led to confidence in the long-term potential of the market despite short-term fluctuations. Looking Ahead While Thursday's market surge can be seen as a positive turnaround in the right direction, the outcome of the UK referendum is still uncertain. Market analysts have maintained a cautious approach, reminding investors that a victory for the 'Leave' campaign could trigger a wave of selling and potentially send financial markets into a spiral. Nonetheless, Wall Street's ability to bounce back under pressure demonstrates its resilience and indicates that further global developments will continue to shape its performance. In the coming days and weeks, Wall Street will likely remain under intense scrutiny, as experts and investors alike assess the ongoing impact of the UK referendum result on global stocks and the economy at large. Conclusion Wall Street's positive closing on Thursday serves as a reminder of the market's ability to adapt and respond to changing global circumstances. Despite the stress it faced due to Brexit woes, it managed to demonstrate encouraging signs of recovery and resilience. Even as uncertainty lingers over the UK referendum's outcome, investors can take comfort in the fact that the stock market has a history of weathering turbulent times, and with the right mix of events, analysis, and speculation, will continue to remain a key player in the global financial sphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the 1.00/W mark. The 1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.","output":"One possible title for this article could be \\"Achieving Grid Parity: The Surprising Decline in Solar PV Module Prices and its Impact on the Industry.\\" This title captures the main themes of the article, which discusses the significant price drop in photovoltaic modules since 2008, the achievement of grid parity, and the various factors leading to further price reductions in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \\"Amazing\\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.  - Hugo Gernsback (August 16, 1884  August 19, 1967), born Hugo Gernsbacher, was a Luxembourgish-American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine. His contributions to the genre as publisher were so significant that, along with the novelists H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes called \\"The Father of Science Fiction\\". In his honour, annual awards presented at the World Science Fiction Convention are named the \\"Hugos\\".  - Lloyd Arthur Eshbach (June 20, 1910  October 29, 2003) was an American science fiction fan, publisher and writer, secular and religious publisher, and minister.  - Experimenter Publishing was an American media company founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1915. The first magazine was \\"The Electrical Experimenter\\" (19131931) and the most notable magazines were \\"Radio News\\" (19191985) and \\"Amazing Stories\\" (19262005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones.  - Edward Elmer Smith (also E. E. Smith, E. E. Smith, Ph.D., E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith, Doc Smith, \\"Skylark\\" Smith, orto his familyTed; May 2, 1890  August 31, 1965) was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and an early science-fiction author, best known for the \\"Lensman\\" and \\"Skylark\\" series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera.  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Skylark Three is a science fiction novel by author Edward E. Smith , Ph.D. , the second in his Skylark series . Originally serialized through the Amazing Stories magazine in 1930 , it was first collected in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press .  - Fantasy Press was an American publishing house specialising in fantasy and science fiction titles. Established in 1946 by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach in Reading, Pennsylvania, it was most notable for publishing the works of authors such as Robert A. Heinlein and E. E. Smith. One of its more notable offerings was the Lensman series.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What was the nickname of Avril Coleridge-Taylor's father?","output":"Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Avril Coleridge-Taylor's father, was a notable and influential British composer, conductor, and music professor during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is best known for his choral and orchestral works, including the highly successful and frequently performed \\"Hiawatha's Wedding Feast\\" from his cantata trilogy \\"The Song of Hiawatha.\\" His music is often characterized by its inclusion of African and African-American cultural themes, as a reflection of his heritage and identity. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was affectionately nicknamed \\"The Black Mahler\\" or \\"The African Mahler.\\" This moniker was derived from his comparison to the widely renowned Austrian composer Gustav Mahler. The nickname is a testament to Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's tremendous talent, skill, and impact on classical music, as Gustav Mahler is viewed as one of the most preeminent composers in the history of Western classical music. Samuel's daughter, Avril Coleridge-Taylor, followed in her father's footsteps and pursued a career in music. She became an accomplished pianist, composer, and conductor, and went on to teach at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London, the same institution where her father also taught. Avril Coleridge-Taylor played a significant role in preserving her father's musical legacy and promoting his works after his untimely death in 1912. However, she is also respected for her own contributions to the world of music, ensuring that the Coleridge-Taylor family name would remain synonymous with artistic excellence and innovation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  I am facing a new situation today: Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Whose device would have less distance for applied force, Archimedes or Ptolemy? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, we need to consider the fundamental concept of machines: they make work easier by altering the force, distance, or direction of the applied force, while not changing the amount of work done.  In the given situation, Archimedes has designed a great machine, while Ptolemy's device is not considered a machine. Since machines alter the force or distance required to achieve the same work, we can deduce that Archimedes' machine should either increase the force and decrease the distance, or decrease the force and increase the distance over which the force is applied. On the other hand, Ptolemy's device is not a machine, which means it does not have the ability to redistribute force, distance, or direction. Consequently, Ptolemy's device would require more direct effort, implying that he would need to apply more force over a longer distance to accomplish the same work as Archimedes' machine. Given this information, we can conclude that Archimedes' device would likely have less distance for applied force compared to Ptolemy's device. This is because Archimedes' machine should be designed to increase efficiency by either decreasing the distance while increasing the force or vice versa. In contrast, Ptolemy's device, as it is not a machine, would not provide the same level of efficiency and would therefore require more effort (force and distance) to achieve the same work."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

NEIL CAVUTO, HOST OF \\"YOUR WORLD\\": All right, we are just getting word now that the U.S. has evacuated all personnel from Benghazi to Tripoli. The Tripoli embassy itself reduced to emergency staffing only, in light of the killing of our ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, as they try to get to the bottom of what happened here in a state that seems to be just a mess right now. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. Senator, the growing debate is whether that state deserves any more money from us. What do you say? SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: Not one penny. I wouldn't send them a penny until they can guarantee that our embassy can be protected, until they've turned over who committed this atrocity. I want to know where the RPGs came from. We got rocket-propelled grenades used here. They didn't make them in Libya. I want to know if they came from another government or if they were left over from Qaddafi. And I want to know who did this and I want them turned over to our FBI. But it's inexcusable. In our country, if an embassy were attacked of any country, we would defend that embassy. We would should thousands of troops there immediately. Apparently, there were warnings in Egypt and they said the mobs coming. But they didn't send soldiers. They just said the mobs coming, get ready. It's inexcusable. CAVUTO: You have also expressed doing the same that is USA aid to Pakistan, if in fact they end up arresting or worse this doctor who helped identify the whereabouts of Usama bin Laden in his compound, where we ultimately succeeded in gunning him down. So is there something going on in the entire region -- we talk about Egypt as well -- that we should just go slow on just pouring money, good money after bad here? You know, we had something called the Arab spring. And I am not sure what the conclusion of the Arab spring is and I';m not sure if we are better or worse off. Democracy in the Middle East is sometimes bringing people into power who really don't like America. We have given billions upon billions of dollars to these countries. And my question is, if you want to be an ally of America, act like it. But if you're not going to act like an ally of ours and you are going to disparage us, if you're going to kill our ambassador, should we be giving you any taxpayer money? Not to mention the fact that we don't have any money and we've got to borrow it from China to send it to Libya, to send it to Egypt, to send it to Pakistan. And these countries disrespect us and then they put our friends in jail, Dr. Afridi. So, I'm still fighting this on the floor. I am filibustering all legislation right now. I'm objecting to any legislation in the Senate. And I'll do everything I can to stop any votes from occurring until we vote on this, because the American people are sick and tired of sending their money to two-bit tinhorn dictators who don't like us.

Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A simple piece of clothesline hangs between some environmentally friendly Americans and their neighbors. On one side stand those who see clothes dryers   as a waste of energy and a major polluter of the environment.As a result, they are turning to clotheslines as part of the \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism.\\" On the other side are people who are against drying clothes outside, arguing that clotheslines are unpleasant to look at.They have persuaded Homeowners Associations (HOAs) access the U.S.to ban outdoor clotheslines, because clothesline drying also tends to lower home value in the neighborhood. This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them. North Carolina lawmakers are saying that banning clotheslines is not the right thing to do.But HOAs and housing businesses believe that clothesline drying reminds people of poor neighborhoods.They worry that if buyers think their future neighbors can't even afford dryers, housing prices will fall. Environmentalists say such worries are not necessary, and in view of global warming, that idea needs to change.As they say, \\"The clothesline is beautiful.Hanging clothes outside should be encouraged.We all have to do at least something to slow down the process of global warming.\\" Question: Who are in favor of clothesline drying?

Here are the steps to solve for w: Step 1: Let's start by isolating the term with w on one side of the equation by adding 6 to both sides of the equation. We do this to cancel out the -6 on the right side. -48 + 6 = 14w - 6 + 6 This simplifies to: -42 = 14w.  Step 2: Next, to isolate w, we will divide both sides of the equation by 14. (-42) / 14 = 14w / 14 This simplifies to: w = -42 / 14 Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation to get the value of w.  w = -3 So, the solution to the equation is w = -3.

John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB?  Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.","output":"To determine which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB, we need to consider Aristotle's theory based on the information provided: 1.

Now let's analyze the information given: - An adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB. - A tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Considering these factors, we can infer that: 1. Since tetA is heavier, it likely has a smaller brood size compared to tetB (according to rule 1). 2. TetA has a longer gestation period, which means it could have a longer lifespan compared to tetB (according to rule 2). 3. If tetA has a longer lifespan, its fecundity (number of offsprings) would be lower compared to tetB (according to rule 3). Based on Aristotle's theory and the information provided, it can be concluded that tetB would have more offsprings in their lifetime compared to tetA."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding  I am facing a new situation today: In the sub-Saharan African country of Nigeria, there are two main species that tend to travel in groups. The antelope tend to travel in groups in high numbers, and thus exhibit a high density. Meanwhile, the bison tend to travel in groups of small numbers, and therefore exhibit low density. Both the antelope and the bison have natural predators that exist in Nigeria.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Individuals from which species, the antelope or the bison, will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the characteristics of the antelope and bison populations in Nigeria, it can be inferred that individuals from the bison species will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior. The background article discusses the benefits of aggregation in terms of protection against predation. It mentions that many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. In the context of the new situation in Nigeria, the antelope travel in groups of high numbers, exhibiting a high density, while the bison travel in smaller groups, exhibiting low density. Since the bison have a lower density, it can be inferred that they are likely to exhibit higher per-individual rates of predator vigilance behavior. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, potentially reducing the fitness of an individual bison living in smaller groups. On the other hand, the antelope, which travel in larger groups with higher density, might benefit from the confusion effect mentioned in the background article. With more individuals present in the group, their herding behavior can create confusion for predators and enhance the group's overall anti-predator defense. The higher density might also allow the antelope to spend more time on foraging and reduce the per-individual vigilance behavior necessary for detecting and avoiding predators. In conclusion, individuals from the bison species, with their smaller group sizes and lower density, are likely to exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior compared to the antelope individuals that tend to travel in larger groups with higher density in Nigeria."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Starting next month, Marines at Camp Pendleton and other bases will be subject to random Breathalyzer tests twice a year under what is billed as the toughest anti-drinking policy in the U.S. military.      An order issued last week by Lt. Gen. R.E. Milstead Jr., deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, calls for any Marine or sailor who tests positive at .01% or higher to be referred for counseling. Any Marine or sailor who tests .04% or higher will be referred to medical personnel to determine their fitness for duty.      Milstead's order notes that while the new order \\"is primarily for deterrence and education,\\" nothing precludes commanders from handing out punishment. Each unit will have a staff non-commissioned officer to act as the alcohol screening program coordinator.      In California, a driver with .08% blood alcohol is considered drunk, and his or her driver's license is immediately suspended. A single drink can lead to a positive test of .01%.      In September, a study by the U.S. Institute of Medicine, sponsored by the Department of Defense, found that binge drinking among military personnel in all branches has increased. In 1998, 35% of personnel admitted to binge drinking in the previous year. In 2008, the last year for which statistics were available, that figure had risen to 47%.      Noting that \\"alcohol has long been part of military culture,\\" the study's authors, including professors from USC and UC San Francisco, called for better leadership from the top of the chain of command in curbing excess drinking. Among the recommendations was \\"routine screening for excessive alcohol consumption.\\"      ALSO:      L.A. Now Live: NASA debunks Dec. 21 'end of the world' fears      Northridge shooting victim’s family angry suspect wasn't in prison      L.A. gun buyback day next week: Mayor, LAPD announce locations      -- Tony Perry in San Diego ||||| The Marine Corps‘ new on-duty standard for drinking alcohol is so strict that less than one drink at lunch would trigger a “positive” and get a warrior in hot water.      The Washington Times reported earlier this week that the Corps sent a Dec. 12 message to commanders officially beginning mandatory breath tests for all 197,000 Marines twice each year.      A reading of just .01 percent subjects a Marine to counseling. A Marine who registers a .04 must be examined by medical staff for fitness for duty.      The Corps is the first among the Army, Air Force and Navy to begin random mandatory testing of all personnel.      The Army leaves test decisions up to a commander and prohibits a blood alcohol content (BAC) at .05 percent or higher. The Air Force also instructs commanders to order alcohol tests when appropriate but has no compulsory program.      The Navy said last March it plans to conduct mandatory breath tests. A spokeswoman says the program will not start until next year.      Overall, this makes the new Corps anti-alcohol testing the military’s strictest.      The Marine memo calls a “positive test result” a reading of .01 or greater, which results in automatic “screening and treatment as appropriate.”      “I think it’s outrageously low,” said Neal Puckett, a defense attorney and retired Marine Corps judge advocate. “Guess it’s zero tolerance for alcohol just like the zero tolerance for drugs.”      “No one would be impaired at a 0.01 alcohol concentration,” said Bruce Goldberger, a University of Florida professor and a renowned forensic toxicologist, to The Times.      For an average-size man of 150 pounds, one drink would register a .02 reading, Mr. Goldberger said. For an average woman, he said, a single drink would result in a .03.      “So if you look at a scenario where someone in the Marine Corps goes to a bar and drinks two drinks, that would give him a BAC of a .04,” he said. “It would take him about two to three hours to clear the alcohol in the bloodstream.”      “It’s possible if a Marine goes to a bar and is drinking a substantial amount of alcohol over the course of an evening, and he gets himself to a BAC of 1.5 or 2.0, if they are tested first thing in the morning when they report to duty, they may still have some alcohol in their blood and test positive,” he added.      Mr. Goldberger, who is director of toxicology at the university’s Department of Pathology, said various breath testers, often referred to as “Breathalyzers,” are reliable and accurate.      He said any Marine picked for a random test who has recently gargled with mouthwash should be given 20 minutes or so to let the alcohol disappear before blowing into the machine.      A reading of .01 “is very low,” he said, meaning the Marine Corps must ensure that the breath testers it uses can discern a “negative” score from a minimal reading.      Mr. Goldberger said the “industry standard” is generally .02 for employees, a less strict measurement than the Corps‘.      Marine spokeswoman Maj. Shawn Haney told The Times that the Corps conducted pilot random testing from May to October at three locations, including the Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. Of 797 Marines tested, 99.99 passed, she said.      A Corps statement said: “Breathalyzer testing will enable commanders to test 100 percent of the Marines in their unit in order to take appropriate actions related to the health and safety of Marines such as training, education and referral to substance abuse counseling.”      The Marine Corps did not respond to a question from The Times on why it chose .01 as a “positive” reading requiring corrective action.      Army regulations say an on-duty soldier with .05 BAC or more is subject to discipline under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and can receive a less-than-honorable discharge.      Commanders may set limits below .05 and bar alcohol consumption altogether on deployment.      “Someone who blows a .05 while on duty could potentially be not fit for duty since there are effects of alcohol even at low levels,” said Mr. Goldberger, who was a key defense witness in the acquittal of former Major League pitcher Roger Clemens on charges he lied about taking performance enhancing drugs.      A blood-alcohol content of .08 — which means eight one-hundredths of 1 percent of the blood by volume is alcohol — is the U.S. standard for drunkenness while driving. Concentration, reasoning, depth perception and other skills can be impaired by a blood-alcohol content lower than .08.      The armed forces for years have required mandatory drug testing. The services have wrestled with the idea of doing to same for alcohol given the belief that domestic violence and sexual assaults are often rooted in excessive drinking.      In September, in a study requested by the Pentagon, the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded drug and alcohol abuse by military personnel constitutes a “public health crisis” and “both are detrimental to force readiness and psychological fitness.” ||||| Summary:","output":"Starting next month, the Marines at some US bases will have random breathalyzer tests twice a year. This new rule is the toughest anti-drinking policy in the US military. If a Marine or sailor tests positive at .01% or higher, they will be referred for counseling. If they test .04% or higher, they will be referred to medical personnel to check their fitness for duty. In the US, an alcohol level of .08% in a driver's blood is considered drunk, and their driver's license is taken away. Binge drinking among military personnel in all branches has increased, so this new rule is to help reduce excess drinking and keep people safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What did Richard Owen do for a living?\\" is in \\"The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process.

After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

First, we need to combine the terms that contain 'r' in them. We have -3847*r and +3826*r. If you take away 3826*r from -3847*r, you will get -21*r. So, the equation now is: 0 = -21*r - 231 Then, let's put the 231 onto the left side of the equation to have only 'r' left on the right side. To do that, we need to add 231 to both sides of the equation, which will cancel out the -231 on the right side. The equation now becomes: 231 = -21*r Now, we need to get 'r' by itself. To do that, we should divide each side by -21.  So if we divide 231 by -21, we get 'r' equals to -11. So the solution for r in your equation is -11! And if you put -11 back into the original equation, you'll find that it makes the equation work, so -11 is the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Blitz, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye, where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. The three children attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. Miss Price reveals she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort, and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob, and adds only Paul can work the spell, since he's the one who handed it to her.  Later, Miss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate Professor Emelius Browne.

Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K.

They knew they would need a different amount of clay for each one, so they thought carefully about how much they should use. They decided to use 1 pound of clay for the vase and 2 pounds of clay for the bowl. This would make sure that the bowl was bigger than the vase, you see. Sally started to work on the vase. She took her 1 pound of clay and shaped it into a tall, skinny shape. She then made pretty patterns on the vase with little clay flowers and leaves. This way, when the real flowers were put in the vase, it would look extra beautiful. Bob, on the other hand, started working on the bowl with his 2 pounds of clay. He wanted the bowl to be wide and deep enough to hold lots of delicious fruits, like apples and oranges. He shaped the clay into a round shape with a nice flat bottom, and he added some cute clay animals around the edge, like bunnies and squirrels, just for fun. When Sally and Bob were finished with their creations, they let the vase and bowl dry under the sun. After the clay dried up, they painted both the vase and bowl with bright, beautiful colors that would make anyone feel happy when they looked at them. Finally, their vase and bowl were finished, and they put them on display in their village market.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Henry Alfred Kissinger (; German: ['kIsINGa]; born Heinz Alfred Kissinger, May 27, 1923) is an American political scientist, diplomat and geopolitical consultant who served as the United States Secretary of State and National Security Advisor under the presidential administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. A Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1938, he became National Security Advisor in 1969 and United States Secretary of State in 1973. Under Kissinger's guidance, the United States government supported Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Kissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in the Indian Subcontinent as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by India and the USSR, and sought to demonstrate to the People's Republic of China (Pakistan's ally and an enemy of both India and the USSR) the value of a tacit alliance with the United States.  Kissinger sneered at people who \\"bleed\\" for \\"the dying Bengalis\\" and ignored the first telegram from the United States consul general in East Pakistan, Archer K. Blood, and 20 members of his staff, which informed the US that their allies West Pakistan were undertaking, in Blood's words, \\"a selective genocide\\". In the second, more famous, Blood Telegram the word genocide was again used to describe the events, and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the US government had \\"evidenced [...] moral bankruptcy\\". As a direct response to the dissent against US policy Kissinger and Nixon ended Archer Blood's tenure as United States consul general in East Pakistan and put him to work in the State Department's Personnel Office.  Henry Kissinger had also come under fire for private comments he made to Nixon during the Bangladesh-Pakistan War in which he described Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a \\"bitch\\" and a \\"witch\\". He also said \\"The Indians are bastards\\", shortly before the war. Kissinger has since expressed his regret over the comments. What happened to him during the Bangladesh war?","output":"During the Bangladesh war, Henry Kissinger, a very important man in the United States government, was helping and supporting a country called Pakistan. He was worried about another big country, the USSR, becoming too powerful in that area. He didn't listen to people who told him about the bad things happening to the Bengali people in East Pakistan.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: For grown-ups,an afternoon snooze  is often easier said than done.But many of us have probably experienced just how simple it can be to catch some sleep in a gently rocking hammock .By examining brain waves in sleeping adults,researchers reported in the June 21issue of Current Biology,a Cell Press publication,that they now have evidence to explain why that is. \\"It is a common belief that rocking causes sleep:we fall asleep in a rocking chair soon and,since ancient times,we cradle our babies to sleep,\\"said Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva.\\"Yet,how this works had remained a mystery.The goal of our study was made up of two parts:to test whether rocking does indeed improve sleep,and to understand how this might work at the brain level.\\" Schwartz,Michel Muhlethaler,and their colleagues Laurence Bayer and Irina Constantinescu asked twelve adult volunteers to nap on a custom-made bed or\\"experimental hammock\\"that could either remain still or rock gently.All participants were good sleepers who didn't typically nap and did not suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day.Each participant took two 45-minute afternoon naps,one with the bed still and one with the bed in motion,while their brain activity was monitored. \\"We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swinging condition,\\"Muhlethaler said.\\"Surprisingly,we also observed a dramatic boosting of certain types of sleep-related brain waves.\\" More specifically,rocking increased the length of stage N2sleep,a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep that normally occupies about half of a good night's sleep.The rocking bed also had a lasting effect on brain activity,increasing slow brain waves and bursts of activity known as sleep spindles . Schwartz and Muhlethaler say the next step is to find out whether rocking can improve longer periods of sleep and to find out whether it may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders,such as insomnia . Options: A The participants were divided into two groups. B The participants had some problems in falling asleep. C Twelve adults and children were invited to take part in it. D The participants'brain waves were examined during their nap. Answer: D The participants'brain waves were examined during their nap.

Is the premise \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\" true if \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\" is not directly related to or true based on the statement \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house.\\" Let's examine the two statements more closely to understand why. 1. \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\": This statement implies that there are two artists working together to create some form of artwork on a table. The artwork being created is likely smaller in scale, considering it is being made on a table. The type of artwork, medium used, and the identities of the artists are not specified in this statement. 2. \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house\\": This statement describes a single artist who is in the process of painting a mural on the exterior of a house. A mural is a large-scale artwork that covers a wall or other large surfaces. This statement specifies that the artwork being created is a painting and provides a clear image of the setting (a house). However, similar to the first statement, the identity of the artist and the nature of the mural are not provided. There are several key differences between these two statements: A. Number of artists involved: The first statement involves two artists working on a piece, while the second statement describes a single artist painting a mural. Their relationship, if any, is not specified. B. The type of artwork being created: The first statement does not specify the kind of artwork being produced, while the second statement mentions a painting specifically. C. Setting: The first statement describes a table as the surface on which the artwork is being created, while the second statement introduces a house as the location where the painting is taking place. D. Scale: Although not explicitly mentioned, we can reasonably deduce that the first artwork is smaller, given that it's being created on a table, while the second artwork takes up significantly more space due to being a mural on a house. To conclude, the two statements describe different scenarios that are not directly linked or related. Therefore, the premise \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\" cannot be considered true based on the statement \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house.\\" They are separate, independent scenarios involving different numbers of artists, types of artwork, and settings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? When you’re performing and nervous, it’s natural to get a bit quieter. Before you perform, practice your songs until you can sing them without even thinking about it. Knowing you're prepared can give you the confidence you need to sing loudly and clearly. It may even calm your nerves. Be sure to select songs that work with your vocal range. If you're unsure whether a song will work with your range, ask your vocal coach for feedback. While breathing exercises will strengthen your muscles and open up your lungs for full breaths, avoid taking deep breaths and holding them. When you're nervous about singing, just try to breathe normally. Stay relaxed so you're not creating tension. Practice your breathing before you begin singing. Do something simple like count your breaths in and out. For example, breathe in for five counts and release for five counts. Continue doing this until you're calm and ready to sing. Remind yourself why you want to sing. Chances are, if you keep your mind on your love for singing, you'll overcome your anxiety and be able to sing loudly and clearly. To help you focus, consider closing your eyes and paying attention to the words of the sing. Really let your emotions come through the music and worry less about your fears. If you close your eyes, remember not to tilt your chin upward, which can make it harder to sing loudly. One of the most helpful things you can do to sing louder, is to find a vocal teacher. A voice coach can give you valuable feedback on your singing technique. It will also be useful to have someone to tell you if you are, in fact, singing louder than before. Listen to your teacher's suggestions for improvement and remember that your teacher is there to help you become a better singer. Find a vocal teacher who specializes in a genre of singing that you want to do.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process you described, which outlines the progression of an earthquake, is the accumulation of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces. This comprehensive explanation of the process, including the missing first step, is provided below: 1. Accumulation of stress and strain in the Earth's crust: The Earth's lithosphere is composed of a series of tectonic plates that are constantly moving due to processes such as subduction, rifting, and continental collision. As these plates interact with one another along their boundaries, stress accumulates within the Earth's crust. This stress is stored as potential energy, with the rocks in the crust becoming increasingly strained and deformed as the forces continue to act upon them. Over time, this strain builds up to a point where the rocks can no longer withstand the tectonic forces. 2. The energy causes the fault lines to give way: Once the stress within the rocks has reached a critical level, the rocks can no longer maintain their strained state and they rupture, giving way along pre-existing fault lines or forming new ones in the process. This sudden release of stored energy takes the form of seismic waves that propagate through the Earth's crust, leading to the occurrence of an earthquake. 3. The Earth's plates move: As the fractures along the fault lines widen, the tectonic plates shift along the fault plane, accommodating the movement that was prevented by the now-ruptured rocks. This movement can take the form of vertical, horizontal, or even diagonal displacement, depending on the type of fault and the specific tectonic forces acting on the region. 4. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions: As the seismic waves generated by the rupture of the fault lines propagate through the Earth's crust, they spread out in all directions from the earthquake's source, also known as the hypocenter or focus. There are two types of seismic waves: body waves, which travel through the Earth's interior, and surface waves, which propagate along the surface of the Earth. 5. The seismic waves shake the Earth as they move through it: As the seismic waves propagate through the Earth's crust, they cause the ground to shake and vibrate, resulting in the familiar shaking and often destructive effects of an earthquake. The intensity of shaking experienced at any given location depends on several factors, including the distance from the hypocenter, the type of seismic waves, the nature of the underlying geological materials, and local site conditions. Additionally, the release of energy at the fault can also generate secondary hazards, such as landslides, tsunamis, and ground liquefaction, all of which can compound the overall impact of an earthquake. In summary, the missing first step is the accumulation of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces. This stress buildup eventually leads to rock failure and rupture, initiating the sequence of events that ultimately result in an earthquake and its associated shaking and secondary hazards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

BA, KLM, Easyjet, Flybe, Aer Lingus, Loganair and Eastern Airways have cancelled services on Tuesday, and some flights over the Atlantic were delayed.      The threat of further disruption led US President Barack Obama to fly out of the Republic of Ireland a day early to get to London for a state visit.      Ash from another Icelandic volcano led to huge disruption in Europe last year.      Air Force One      Mr Obama had been due to fly to the UK on Tuesday morning, but White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said the decision to bring his arrival forward had been taken \\"due to a recent change in the trajectory in the plume of volcanic ash\\".      The Met Office forecasts the ash cloud will reach northern and western Scotland overnight, and will clip northern parts of Northern Ireland early on Tuesday. None of England is likely to be affected.      A Met Office spokesman said it was difficult to forecast the cloud's direction beyond that because weather systems were changing so rapidly.      A number of airlines are choosing not to fly through Scottish airspace on Tuesday:      British Airways is not operating any flights between London and Scotland until 1400 BST      KLM cancelled flights to and from Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as some to Newcastle      EasyJet cancelled flights to and from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen scheduled for between 0500 and 0900 BST      Flybe cancelled flights to and from Aberdeen and Inverness      Aer Lingus cancelled a number of its flights between the Republic of Ireland and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen      Glasgow-based Loganair has cancelled 36 flights. Only inter-island routes in Orkney are unaffected      Eastern Airways will not be operating any services in or out of Scottish airspace      Transport Secretary Philip Hammond told BBC Two's Newsnight that \\"most, if not all, flights into and out of Glasgow and Edinburgh and airports to the north will be stopped\\" on Tuesday morning.      But he said services should resume from Glasgow and Edinburgh by about lunchtime, and in other airports by Wednesday morning. Any disruption later in the week should be \\"limited\\", he added.      Earlier, Mr Hammond said there had already been \\"modest delays\\" to flights, particularly those crossing the Atlantic.      \\"Clearly, this is a natural phenomenon which we cannot control, but the UK is now much better prepared to deal with an ash eruption than last year.\\"      A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said it was anticipating disruption to many services on Tuesday.      In a statement on Monday evening, he said: \\"Only Ryanair is intending to operate a full service from Edinburgh Airport. Passengers should not travel to the airport without checking with their airline first regarding the status of their flight.\\"      Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, said he hoped to avoid a repeat of last year's travel chaos, but he admitted it was still unclear how badly flights would be affected.      \\"We know so much more about the volcanoes. We have an improved model.      \\"We have better measuring equipment and we have better relationships with airlines so it should be much better but we're still at the hands of both the weather and the volcano; those are the two uncertainties.\\"      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Andrew Haines, of the CAA, said UK aviation had \\"learned a great deal\\"      Champions League finalists Barcelona are already considering bringing forward their flight to London ahead of Saturday's final at Wembley against Manchester United.      The Catalan club had originally planned to travel on Thursday.      \\"Let's see what they [the experts] tell us and if they say we shouldn't risk it we'll travel tomorrow or the day after,\\" said Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.      During last April's six-day shutdown only a handful of flights took off or landed in the UK.      Thousands of Britons found themselves stranded overseas forcing many to make long and expensive journeys home by land. Airlines estimated the shutdown cost them 1.7bn (£1.1bn).      The CAA said ash levels would now be graded as low, medium or high, and airlines would be notified if levels reached medium or high.      Airlines would then consider whether to fly, according to risk assessments already carried out, the CAA added.      The Foreign Office is advising passengers to remain in regular contact with their travel agent or airline for the latest news on the status of flights and bookings.      The Grimsvotn volcano in Vatnajokull National Park began erupting on Saturday with ash rising to 20km (12 miles) but, although still active, is now not as powerful with a plume of 13km (8 miles).      Iceland's airspace has been closed for a period as a result.      Ash from the volcano, which is 60 miles (97km) from the nearest human settlements, has settled over farmland and livestock, causing difficulties for some farmers and tourists have been evacuated from the country's main national parks.      The Grimsvotn volcano lies beneath the ice of the uninhabited Vatnajokull glacier in south-east Iceland. The latest eruption is its most powerful eruption in 100 years.      Experts say this eruption is on a different scale to the one last year and ash particles are larger and, as a result, fall to the ground more quickly. ||||| The spread of dense ash from the erupting Iceland volcano could force the cancellation of up to 500 commercial flights in Northern Ireland, Scotland and parts of Scandinavia, the European air traffic agency said Tuesday.

(Associated Press)      Between 200 and 250 flights had already been canceled, said Brian Flynn, head of network operations at Eurocontrol. There are just over 30,000 flights within Europe on average every day at this time of the year.      Ash from the Grimsvotn volcano already forced President Barack Obama to shorten a visit to Ireland, and has raised fears of a repeat of huge travel disruptions in Europe last year when ash from the Eyjafjalljokull volcano stranded millions of passengers.      Flynn said he did not expect Obama's European tour to be further affected and authorities have said they don't expect the kind of massive grounding of flights that followed last year's eruption. They say procedures have been improved since then and the cloud is currently not expected to move over continental Europe.      The British Civil Aviation Authority said strong winds over Scotland was making it hard to predict the direction in which the ash would move, but air traffic controllers said it would reach airports in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland on Tuesday afternoon.      British Airways suspended all its flights for Tuesday morning between London and Scotland, while Dutch carrier KLM and Easyjet canceled flights to and from Scotland and northern England at the same time. Three domestic airlines also announced flight disruptions.      National Air Traffic Services, the agency that controls air traffic over Britain and the eastern Atlantic, said airports will remain open but flights will be affected between 1:00 p.m. (1200GMT) and 7 p.m. (1800GMT) local time.      NATS said in a statement that the ash will affect airports in Londonderry in Northern Ireland, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Prestwick in Scotland, and Newcastle, Carlisle, Durham Tees Valley and Cumbernauld in northern England. It advised passengers to check with their airlines before travelling.      Budget airline Ryanair said it did not believe there was a need to cancel all flights between Ireland and Scotland, and said it would meet with regulators Tuesday morning to discuss the issue.      Norwegian airport operator Avinor said the ash cloud that swept over southwestern Norway earlier Tuesday has now moved away from the coast and no longer affects the airports in Stavanger and Karmoey. However, it said the ash is expected to return to southern Norway in the afternoon. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Flights in and out of Scotland have been cancelled as a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland's Grimsvotn volcano heads towards the UK, with airlines such as BA, KLM, Easyjet, Flybe, Aer Lingus, Loganair and Eastern Airways cancelling services on Tuesday.

He told voters at a rally in Ohio yesterday that despite his tax-cutting plans, they shouldn't \\"be expecting a huge cut in taxes because I'm also going to lower deductions and exemptions.\\" Romney plans to cut all income tax rates by 20% and lower the corporate tax rate to to 25% from 35%, but his staffers describe the plan as a tax reform, not a tax cut, and argue that it will not significantly increase the deficit. President Obama, meanwhile, is pushing \\"economic patriotism\\" ahead of the debate, the AP reports. In a new ad airing in seven battleground states, the president outlines an economic plan he says will create a million new manufacturing jobs. Some conservative Mormons are doing their own debate preparation, according to an email obtained by BuzzFeed. The email—not officially sanctioned by the church—is circulating in at least four states and urges Mormons to fast and pray for Romney for 24 hours to ensure he will be blessed in the debates, which start Wednesday. In the debates, Romney needs to be assertive and \\"draw a sharp contrast between a Romney recovery and Obama stagnation,\\" Newt Gingrich tells Politico. \\"If he is as assertive and direct with Obama as he was with me in the two Florida debates, he’ll be fine,\\" Gingrich says. \\"He's got to go in there, not be hostile but be assertive, clear, and direct, and not back off.\\" Article:","output":"Let's pretend that two people, named Mitt and Mr. Obama, are going to have a big talk in front of lots of people.

Question: What weapon is Jack's attacker using in the last scene? Title: The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon Movie plot: The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.

The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment.

Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

The gruesome discovery sheds light on a case that has been under investigation for a while and continues to shock the nation. In this article, we delve into the details surrounding this chilling incident, the ongoing investigations, and the broader implications of this high-profile case. Step 1: Detailing the kidnapping incident The kidnapping took place several weeks ago when a group of young people, aged 16 to 34, were abducted from a bar in Mexico City’s Zona Rosa district. The busy nightlife area, usually known for its vibrant atmosphere, was abruptly marred by violence and fear as the unsuspecting victims were taken by force. The motives behind the kidnapping remain unclear, with authorities tirelessly pursuing leads to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. Step 2: Discovering the charred corpse The Mexican police recently stumbled upon a gruesome piece of evidence as they located the charred corpse of a man, now identified as a suspect in the kidnapping case. This disturbing development points to a possible escalation of violence within the criminal world, exposing the alarming levels of brutality that often go hand-in-hand with such abductions. Although the identity of the deceased suspect has not been released, the authorities are hopeful that this will be a breakthrough in the investigation. Step 3: Ongoing investigations and efforts to find the missing persons In response to this harrowing case, the Mexican police have stepped up their efforts in tracking down the missing individuals and solving the kidnapping mystery. Reports suggest that authorities are examining possible links to organized criminal networks, as well as other unrelated motives in an attempt to understand this cruel act. The families of the victims, who have been living in constant anguish, place their hope in the diligence of the investigators as they continue to search tirelessly for answers and, ultimately, the safe return of their loved ones. Step 4: Broader implications This shocking incident underscores the need for stronger security measures and a greater focus on crime prevention throughout Mexico. With high-profile cases of kidnapping and violence becoming all too common, it is imperative that both the government and local communities work together to implement strategies that will protect citizens and combat these heinous acts. Furthermore, this case serves as a stark reminder that awareness and vigilance are essential for anyone living in or visiting the country, especially in areas known for higher crime rates. Conclusion: The discovery of the charred corpse of one of the suspected kidnappers in this distressing case presents both a significant advancement in the investigation and a grim reflection on the brutal world of abductions and criminal activity in Mexico. As the search continues for the 12 missing individuals, we can only hope that the perpetrators of this atrocious act are brought to justice, and that the victims are reunited with their families as soon as possible. In the meantime, the ongoing quest for safety and prevention of such crimes must remain a top priority for Mexico’s law enforcement and citizens alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Double jeopardy is a procedural defence that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges and on the same facts, following a valid acquittal or conviction. As described by the U.S. Supreme Court in its unanimous decision one of its earliest cases dealing with double jeopardy, \`\`the prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial.'' can u be tried for the same crime twice?","output":"In most jurisdictions and according to the legal principle of double jeopardy, a person cannot be tried again for the same crime if they have already been acquitted or convicted. Double jeopardy is commonly understood as a procedural defense that protects against being tried twice for the same criminal offense. The principle of double jeopardy is firmly established in many legal systems around the world, based on respect for the finality of legal decisions and the notion that it is unjust to subject a person to successive trials for the same alleged act. It is considered a fundamental tenet of common law and a constitutional right. In the United States, the protection against double jeopardy is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which declares that no person shall \\"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\\" The intent of the double jeopardy clause is to protect individuals from the emotional, financial, and social consequences of successive prosecutions for the same conduct. It also restricts the power of the state and maintains the integrity of the criminal justice system.  However, there are certain exceptions to this rule. For example, if it is discovered that a trial was tainted by fraud or if there are extraordinary circumstances such as the uncovering of substantial new evidence that was not available at the time of the trial. In some jurisdictions, a person can be tried for the same act but under a different law. For example, civil and criminal trials, which are different kinds of legal proceedings, can be conducted for the same incident.  Also, the \\"dual sovereignty doctrine\\" allows for a person to be tried for the same crime in both state and federal courts because they are separate sovereigns. This is a significant exception to the double jeopardy rule in the U.S. However, applying these exceptions requires very careful consideration because the principle of double jeopardy is strongly rooted in the conviction that preventing the start of a new prosecution is a guarantee of fairness and legal certainty.  In conclusion, while the principle of double jeopardy generally precludes a person from being tried twice for the same crime, there are exceptions. The applicability of these exceptions depends on various factors such as the circumstances of the case, the jurisdiction involved, and the specific laws in place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\"?  The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: \\"I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues\\".

Lors de son arrestation, il est possible que les autorités sri lankaises aient des raisons de suspecter que le plaignant était un militant du LTTE (Tigres libérateurs de l'Eelam tamoul), en s'appuyant sur la présence de cicatrices sur son corps. Cette hypothèse pourrait être renforcée par le contexte historique et politique qui a longtemps prévalu au Sri Lanka. Dans cette île située au sud de l'Inde, les tensions ethniques et politiques entre les communautés cinghalaise et tamoule ont souvent été marquées par des violences et des actes de terrorisme. Le LTTE était un groupe armé séparatiste tamoul, qui a mené une longue lutte armée pour la création d'un État tamoul indépendant dans le nord et l'est du Sri Lanka. Fondée en 1976, l'organisation a été active jusqu'en 2009, date à laquelle les forces gouvernementales ont réussi à vaincre les derniers bastions du LTTE. Tout au long de cette période, le LTTE a mené de nombreuses opérations militaires, y compris des attentats-suicides, qui ont parfois pris pour cible des installations gouvernementales et militaires. Dans ce contexte, les autorités sri lankaises ont dû développer des mécanismes de renseignement et de vigilance pour déjouer les menaces potentielles et identifier les affiliés potentiels du LTTE. C'est pourquoi les cicatrices sur le corps d'un individu pourraient éveiller des soupçons, surtout si elles correspondent à des marques typiques d'entraînement militaire ou de torture. Toutefois, il est important de rappeler qu'une telle suspicion ne constitue pas en soi une preuve formelle de l'implication d'un individu avec le LTTE. Les autorités devraient recueillir des éléments de preuve supplémentaires et mener une enquête approfondie pour établir la véracité des allégations. La présomption d'innocence, qui est un principe cardinal de la justice, doit toujours prévaloir tant que la culpabilité n'a pas été établie au-delà de tout doute raisonnable. En conséquence, les autorités sri lankaises doivent veiller à respecter les droits fondamentaux et les garanties processuelles de tout individu arrêté, indépendamment des soupçons qui pèsent sur lui et de son origine ethnique ou politique."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Schools across the country reported problems as Nick Clegg’s flagship policy of giving free meals to all young children was introduced yesterday. The initiative was hailed a ‘massive success’ by the Liberal Democrats, but even schools in Mr Clegg’s Sheffield backyard admitted they couldn’t cook their own hot meals. Nine primaries in the city are bussing in meals cooked at neighbouring schools amid claims of a £400,000 shortfall in funds to upgrade kitchens. Food for thought: Nick Clegg marking yesterday's launch of his flagship meals policy at a school in London. Reports also emerged of canteen renovations over-running and deliveries of vital equipment such as tables and chairs failing to turn up. One school is offering hot meals on a ‘first come, first served’ basis while another even considered serving airline food supplied by local airports before opting for cold sandwiches. As they battle to implement the controversial £1billion policy, some schools are seating children for lunch in classrooms, music rooms or Portakabins because they lack dining space. Others are running three lunch sittings, restricting pupils’ choice of food and asking seven-year-olds to serve drinks to younger pupils to take pressure off staff. Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws declared the scheme, which involves offering free lunches to all four to seven-year-olds, a ‘massive success’, while Mr Clegg insisted that giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons. The Deputy Prime Minister said that ‘giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as, if not more, effective than many of the, say, literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom’. Teething problems? Schools in his own constituency could not cook hot food for pupils on the first day. But critics claim the educational and health benefits touted by Mr Clegg have yet to be rigorously proven. They also claim councils and schools have been forced to raid other budgets to push the initiative through because the Government failed to properly fund it. Oliver Coppard, Labour’s candidate against Mr Clegg in next year’s national polls, said: ‘In trying to get this policy in place before the General Election, Nick Clegg has – as usual – over-promised and under-delivered.’ At Dudley Infant Academy in Hastings, East Sussex, hot meals are on a ‘first come, first served basis’, with a cold packed lunch available as an alternative. In Portsmouth, Solent Infant School will use its music room as a lunch area and a Portakabin has been installed at Devonshire Infant School to provide additional dining space. Bournemouth Council said 12 primary schools – half of the town’s total – will start the year by offering free cold packed lunches to some or all of its key stage one pupils rather than hot meals. Nick Clegg yesterday made a string of assertions about why his policy was destined to be an overwhelming success. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK sorts the claims from the reality. CLAIM: All the evidence, and this has been stress-tested and analysed, shows it has a dramatic effect on educational performance. REALITY: The Department for Education’s own evaluation of pilots in London and Durham found a 1.9 percentage point increase in the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level in reading at Key Stage 1 and a 2.2 percentage point increase for maths. Critics says that, overall, this is barely statistically significant. For the highest performing children, there was no positive impact. Crucially, the authors of the study admit the reasons for the improvement in overall performance were not clear. The pilots included a wider programme to promote healthy eating, such as providing advice to parents, which may also be responsible. CLAIM: It is good for children’s health. REALITY: The evaluation stated there was no evidence the two-year pilot led to significant health benefits. For instance, it found ‘there was no evidence of any change in children’s Body Mass Index’. Researchers also found the pilot did not appear to significantly improve children’s behaviour or absence rates from school. CLAIM: The policy is about having children share a healthy meal together at lunchtime rather than having children parcelled off, one group at one end of the room on free school meals and the other not. REALITY: Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said he could think of no examples in ‘living memory’ of schools segregating pupils who receive free school meals. CLAIM: I strongly dispute this idea that as we balance the books we don’t do more to invest in a future in which every boy and girl irrespective of their birth gets the best possible chances in life. REALITY: The key point. Firstly, with the deficit still running at more than £100billion, the Government is not ‘balancing the books’. The money to pay for school meals amounts to £1billion of extra borrowing. Many head teachers argue it could be spent far better elsewhere. Coincidentally, councils warned last month of a £1bn shortfall in the funding they need to provide the school places needed to cope with Britain’s rapidly growing population. The number of children in classes of more than 30 has increased by 200 per cent since 2010 – breaking the Prime Minister’s promise to create ‘small schools with smaller class sizes’. Julian Rutherford, of Principals Catering, which supplies schools in the South East, said: ‘We are ready to launch the expanded free meals policy but it is likely there will be teething problems. ‘We are having to transport food into 16 schools which do not have kitchens, mostly in Faversham and Sittingbourne.’ In Somerset, the BBC reported that 46 schools out of 201 are unable to provide hot meals. In Buckinghamshire, the figure was 45 out of 159. Lynda Mitchell, contracts manager for North Somerset Council, said she had been ‘almost reduced to tears… by builders not meeting agreed deadlines and not apparently caring’. Jo Wotton, a catering manager for five schools in Cornwall, tweeted that one school was refusing to offer free meals at all ‘until they get their kitchen in October’. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There will be some schools that will be providing a cold meal this term while they wait for the building work to finish off. ‘The logistics of getting large numbers of children through, how you schedule the timings of lunch and whether you’ve got kids eating in their classrooms or not – all that will be quite difficult for schools. They’ll manage it but it’ll put a huge burden on them.’ Some £1billion has been earmarked over two years to cover the cost of meals, while £150million has been spent upgrading kitchens, with an additional £22.5million going to smaller schools. The Department for Education said only 239 out of 16,500 schools would be providing a cold meal instead of a hot one this week. Mr Laws said: ‘I am absolutely delighted that our statistics, which come from local authorities and schools, show that 98.5 per cent of schools across the country – 16,500 schools – are delivering a hot meal option from the start of term.’ It was a ‘massive success’, he said.

Review: This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the viewer comments, I was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy. Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre. That sure is misleading, isn't it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I fully expected it to simply be a Drama. I'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes.Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. Someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. That is, how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops, if you will. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' in the world.Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color. It was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside but White on the inside.The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written, directed and acted (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure to witness. I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (don't want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom -Two is going to or when she releases it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the denouement is great. You know that life on that street will never be the same.My favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems, some pain, do their dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on. As an audience member, I may learn something or be inspired. Question: is it a positive review?","output":"Step 1: Read the review carefully and identify the key points made by the reviewer.

WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Article: A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy.

Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band, as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell, cemented the supergroup's permanent demise. On January 20, 2017, three days after announcing their reunion, Audioslave performed together for the first time in over a decade at Prophets of Rage's Anti-Inaugural Ball. In the early hours of May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit, at the age of 52, after playing a Soundgarden show.

The old cards could not squeeze into the boxes because the  Choose from: (1). cards were too thick.; (2). boxes were too thick.;","output":"(1). The story of the cards that were too thick. Once upon a time in a tiny, hidden village nestled in the mountainside, there was a quaint little shop. This shop, named \\"Peculiar Pastimes,\\" was owned by a curious elderly gentleman called Mr. Archibald. Mr. Archibald was known far and wide for his collection of the most exquisite and unusual playing cards. Adventurers and collectors alike would journey to this village to visit his store in hopes of procuring some of these unique treasures. One blistering summer's day, a lively girl named Eliza came by Mr. Archibald's store. She could not help but be captivated by the variety of wonderful and strange decks of cards that filled the crowded shelves. The colors, designs, and exquisite patterns of the cards fascinated her. Inch by inch, she examined every single deck with an enthusiastic but untrained eye. Eliza's interest piqued when she noticed a set of twelve antique boxes nestled in between the stacks of playing cards. The dusty containers lay in a row, and each appeared to have a card sitting at the foot of its locked and mysterious door. A tiny placard stood by them, explaining that each box contained a playing card that was said to possess magical powers. The mystery and beauty of these boxes intrigued Eliza, who immediately inquired with Mr. Archibald more about them. \\"These cards, my dear, are not only magical — they are ancient and extremely rare, \\" said Mr. Archibald with an enigmatic smile, \\"But I must warn you, they say that each card carries a price for its use. It’s not something to be taken lightly.” Despite the warning, Eliza's curiosity couldn't be contained. She asked to see more of the cards, and Mr. Archibald, who could see the genuine passion in her, agreed to show her the cards up close under one condition — that she would not feel tempted to use any of them without first understanding the consequences. With a solemn nod, Eliza agreed, and Mr. Archibald began to remove the cards from their boxes. However, when he tried to put the cards back into their respective containers, he found that he could no longer squeeze them in. To his and Eliza's surprise, the cards seemed to have doubled in thickness since they were taken out. Determined to find the solution to this puzzle, Eliza began pouring over the countless books and scrolls in Mr. Archibald's vast library, which housed a collection of ancient tomes, magical grimoires, and historic chronicles of enchanted playing cards. Days became weeks, and weeks turned into months, but Eliza never gave up her relentless search for the answer to the cards' dilemma. Mr. Archibald couldn't be happier as, during this time, he found a kindred spirit and apprentice in the young girl. Finally, in the dark of the night, on a windy, full-moon eve, Eliza stumbled across a passage that explained the growing thickness of these magical cards. The text read, \\"As power is drawn from the enchanted cards, their essence grows and becomes more potent, signifying by the expansion of their form.\\" In her excitement, Eliza shared her finding with Mr. Archibald. Together, they decided to design new boxes that could accommodate the cards, retaining a balance of harmony and practicality. Over time, the cards revealed their powers to Eliza, and she learned to wield the magic wisely, never abusing the trust Mr. Archibald had placed in her. Years passed, and Eliza inherited \\"Peculiar Pastimes\\" from Mr. Archibald after his peaceful passing. She continued his legacy of collecting and preserving these enchanted cards, teaching young enthusiasts about the beauty and the artistry behind them. As for the twelve magical cards, they remained a reminder of the mystical bond and friendship that formed between a curious girl and a wise old shopkeeper on that fateful day they first met."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities  of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults  in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends. And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable, honest and understanding, I know I've found a friend! Question: This passage mainly discusses   _  .

The article explains how these qualities contribute to a meaningful friendship. Now, let's compare these main points to the options given: A: the qualities of a friend - This option is a strong match as the article revolves around the qualities the author looks for in a friend. B: how to get along with friends - While it is somewhat related, this option is not the main focus of the article. The article does not provide explicit instructions on how to cultivate relationships with friends.

D: the importance of the qualities of a friend - This option is relatively close in relevance, but it does not fully encompass the article's main discussion, which is about the qualities of a friend rather than emphasizing the importance of those qualities. After evaluating each option based on the article's content, I can conclude that the right answer is: A: the qualities of a friend - The passage mainly discusses the qualities the author looks for in a friend, making this option the best match."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While other competitors struggled to break the 10-second barrier, Bailey-Cole managed to accomplish this incredible feat, proving once again why he is considered one of the fastest men in the world. Despite Bailey-Cole's stellar performance, there was a palpable sense of disappointment at the meeting due to the absence of Usain Bolt, the reigning world record holder for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints. Bolt was forced to withdraw from the Zurich Diamond League meeting after sustaining an injury, and his presence was certainly missed by fans and fellow athletes alike. However, the event was not without its memorable moments. In the women's 4x100-meter relay, the British team comprising Desiree Henry, Anyika Onoura, Asha Philip and Ashleigh Nelson emerged as the proud winners. The quartet of talented sprinters worked seamlessly together, showcasing their exceptional teamwork and commitment to their sport. As the British women's relay team stood atop the podium, their victory not only underscored the incredible depth of talent currently present within the world of athletics, but also served as a testament to the dedication and hard work that is required to succeed at such an elite level. Their performance undoubtedly inspired other aspiring athletes to strive for greatness, serving as proud ambassadors for their country and their sport. In conclusion, the Zurich Diamond League meeting proved to be an eventful and exciting showcase of some of the world's most talented athletes, despite the absence of renowned sprinter Usain Bolt. With Kemar Bailey-Cole returning to form in the men's 100-meter final and the outstanding performance of the British women's 4x100-meter relay team, the event served as a thrilling reminder of the incredible achievements that can be accomplished through dedication, teamwork, and raw talent. As the world of athletics continues to evolve and grow, it is certain that these extraordinary athletes will inspire future generations to push the limits of human ability and pursue their own dreams of success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Police in Germany have queried Jeremy Clarkson's claim he was barred from a UK-bound flight by an airport employee because of a 2014 Top Gear controversy. Article:","output":"Title: Jeremy Clarkson's UK-bound Flight Debacle: Fact or Fiction? Introduction In a recent incident, former 'Top Gear' host Jeremy Clarkson alleged that he was denied boarding on a UK-bound flight by an airport staff member due to a controversy dating back to 2014. The incident, which occurred in Germany, has left the public with several questions about the legitimacy of Clarkson's claim. Police in Germany have since looked into the matter, aiming to shed light on the truth behind the allegations. The 2014 Top Gear Controversy To fully understand the context of the recent incident, we must revisit the turmoil that unfolded in 2014. The controversy began while filming a Top Gear episode in Argentina, where Clarkson, along with co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May, found themselves in the midst of a political dispute. The trio, who famously pushed boundaries on the popular motoring show, drove a Porsche with the license plate H982 FKL, which some interpreted as a reference to the 1982 Falklands War between the UK and Argentina. The license plate drew the ire of locals and led to violent protests, forcing the Top Gear crew to flee the country hastily. The incident left diplomatic relations between the two nations strained and put the BBC in an unfavorable position. Clarkson's Claim of Denied Boarding Fast forward to the recent airport fiasco, Jeremy Clarkson alleged that an airport employee in Germany barred him from boarding a UK-bound flight as a form of retribution for the 2014 Top Gear controversy. According to Clarkson, the staff member was holding a personal grudge against him and intentionally delayed processing his travel documents, ultimately causing him to miss his flight. German Police Investigation Upon receiving word of the incident, German police opened an investigation into the matter, aiming to determine the truth behind Clarkson's claims. During their inquiries, authorities attempted to establish whether the airport employee had deliberately targeted Clarkson and whether the alleged actions were a direct consequence of the 2014 controversy. Key Findings and Conclusion After an extensive investigation, German authorities found no evidence to substantiate Clarkson's claim that he was intentionally barred from boarding his flight due to the past controversy. Rather, the investigation determined that the cause of the denied boarding was primarily due to standard flight protocols, which require passengers to arrive at the gate within a specific timeframe. As a result, it has become apparent that Clarkson's allegations lacked the necessary foundation to be considered a genuine, targeted incident. While tensions may certainly still exist following the 2014 Top Gear controversy, German police have concluded that the airport employee did not hold a personal vendetta against Clarkson, and the incident was not a direct form of retribution. In conclusion, while Jeremy Clarkson's allegations of being denied access to a UK-bound flight by an airport employee might have made for an interesting headline, the in-depth investigation by German authorities has found no evidence supporting the claim that the incident was fueled by a personal grudge or linked to the 2014 Top Gear controversy. As in many similar cases, the truth is often more mundane - this time revealing a simple matter of adhering to flight protocols and arriving at the gate in a timely manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? What did the author conclude about why people haven't lost weight and kept it off? - They are buying to many diet books - not enough information - They haven't found the right diet that works for them - They are bingeing and craving to be thing. Answer:","output":"The author concludes that the primary reason people haven't lost weight and kept it off is because they haven't found the right diet that suits their particular physical and emotional needs. It implies that individuals must find the optimal formula through a tailored diet and a proper fitness regime that specifically works for them, addressing their unique circumstances, rather than following generic, one-size-fits-all diet books and methods.  Furthermore, the author also acknowledges some of the misleading beliefs or narratives that keep people stuck in the cycle of losing and regaining weight: 1. The belief in a magic cure: People tend to think that there must be a perfect, ideal diet plan out there that, once discovered, will help them lose weight and keep it off for good. However, this constant search for the magic solution may cause them to overlook the importance of sustainable habits and practices that would support their weight loss journey in the long run. 2. The \\"one last diet\\" mentality: People often convince themselves that they just need to commit to one final diet and reach their goal, after which they can rely on mindful eating and paying attention to their body's hunger signals. This mentality does not take into account long-term behavioral changes, implying that once the \\"last diet\\" has been completed, there is little reason to continue maintaining the effort and discipline required for sustainable weight loss. 3. The illusion of loving health and fitness: Some may convince themselves that they enjoy being consumed by the process, spending significant time researching, planning, and tracking every aspect of their eating and training. However, it is crucial to break free from this cycle of obsession and understand the importance of balance and moderation in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, the author highlights that breaking free from the diet cycle requires shifting away from these misleading beliefs and recognizing that the magic cure has not yet been found. It is essential to critically examine the numerous diet books, e-books, and magazines that crowd our spaces, questioning whether they have provided sustainable and lasting solutions. To make lasting improvements in one's weight and overall health, finding a tailored approach, adapting life-long habits, and maintaining consistency in practice are key elements that need to be considered, rather than merely focusing on the endless pursuit of the \\"perfect\\" diet or magic cure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Before deciding to join the Amish, it is imperative that you learn as much about their religion, history, and lifestyle as possible. The Amish communities of today are descendants of Swiss Anabaptists who emigrated to the United States in the early eighteenth century.  There are approximately 250,000 people living in Amish communities across North America.  The largest Amish community is in Holmes County, Ohio; although there are other sizable Amish populations in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Indiana and smaller communities across the Eastern and Mid-Western states, as well as in Canada. Amish is a stricter branch of the Mennonite Anabaptist Church, with which it shares many beliefs and practices. The Amish, with other Anabaptists, reject infant baptism in favor of adult baptism, giving an adult the right to choose their religion and commit to joining the Amish community. The Amish refer to themselves as the \\"plain people\\" and to anyone outside of the Amish community, regardless of religion or race, as \\"Englishers\\" or \\"high people\\". There are many informative websites and books available that cover every aspect of Amish life. You should do your best to visit an Amish community as part of your research. This will give you some insight into what the day-to-day life of an Amish person is like. Despite popular belief, there are no restrictions on \\"English\\" people visiting Amish communities. You can visit Amish businesses and converse with the people, most of whom will be willing to answer any questions you might have.  It may even be possible to stay in a bed and breakfast run by a local Amish family. This will give you an even closer look at the Amish way of life, which places God and family above all else. If possible, try to visit several communities on your trip, as different Amish communities will vary slightly in terms of their customs, traditions, and level of strictness and you will need to find the one to which you are best suited. If you cannot travel to an Amish community, you may be able to set up correspondence with an Amish person to gain an insight into their beliefs and way of life. The Amish do not allow computers or, in most cases, telephones, so communicating by post will be your only option. Remember to respect their beliefs and do not take any identifiable photographs of them (the Second Commandment, Exodus 20:4 - \\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image...\\"). They may allow you to take pictures of their buggy or farms if you ask politely, however.  Be aware that some may not feel comfortable (especially women) with talking to outsiders extensively about their faith or lifestyle since they are taught to be modest in everything they do. After visiting one or several communities, you need to decide which community you would like to join. Once you have developed a short list of about 3 to 5 communities, you should begin contacting the leading bishop of each community to gauge whether you would be welcome to join their church. Finding the leading bishop should not be too difficult; if the community is on your short list, you have probably already visited it and hopefully developed some contacts there who can help you.  Although the Amish do not have any rules forbidding outsiders from joining, it is highly unusual and typically not encouraged, so contacting the bishop is a good way to judge what the community's reaction to a newcomer is likely to be.  If the bishop is open to the idea of you joining their community, he will invite you for an interview, where you can put forward your reasons for wanting to become a member of the Amish. You will need to demonstrate the strength of your faith, your willingness to renounce the ways of the modern world, and your commitment to the Amish way of life. As long as your motives are pure and you are fully aware of what life in an Amish community entails, there should be no objection to you coming to live in the community. Once you have made your decision and you have received the bishop's permission, you may begin your new life as a member of the Amish. You will first be placed with an Amish family, where you can learn their ways and participate in the household duties. During this time you must prove yourself to the Amish by living according to their religious principles and becoming a productive and valuable member of the community. Once you have done this (there is no set time period), you may be voted into the church and become a true member of the Amish community.  Unless you are coming from another branch of the Anabaptist Church with a very similar lifestyle, you are likely to find the transition to Amish living somewhat difficult. Living without electricity, cell phones and motor vehicles is a lot harder for someone who is used to having these luxuries, than it is for people who were brought up in the Amish community and don't know any differently. Although some Amish may be very welcoming and helpful to you as you make your transition, others may be more distrustful of you and not expect you to last very long. Give them time. Once you prove your faith and commitment, they will grow to trust and accept you.","output":"The Amish are a group of people who live a simple life, without many of the things we use every day, like electricity and cars. They came from a part of Switzerland a very long time ago and now live in different parts of the United States and Canada. People who want to join the Amish need to learn about how they live, believe, and do things.  To do this, they can read books, visit Amish communities, and talk to Amish people. The Amish believe in God and family, and it's important to respect their ways of doing things. If you want to join the Amish, you have to talk to their leader. If they think you really want to be part of their community, you can stay with an Amish family to learn their ways. Later, if the group decides you can join them, you become a true member of the Amish community. It can be hard to give up things we use every day, but with time, the Amish will trust and accept you if you show your commitment to their way of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - annoy - eat meat - open doors - need food - jog  The rationale to choose \\"open doors\\" as the answer is that:","output":"If cats were taller, the ability to open doors would likely be the most significant change in their behavior and capabilities. This is not to say that other options listed wouldn't also be affected, but let's first analyze each option and then establish why \\"open doors\\" would be the most impactful. 1. Annoy: Cats are known for their mischievous behavior, so making them taller could potentially increase their ability to knock over objects and access areas they wouldn't have been able to otherwise. However, their ability to be annoying is not necessarily dependent on their height alone. Cats are masterful in leveraging their current physical abilities, so the increase in annoyance would not be as drastic compared to the other options. 2. Eat meat: Cats, being obligate carnivores, already have the ability to eat and digest meat. As their height increases, they might be able to catch larger prey than they can currently hunt. However, the increase in height wouldn't necessarily alter a cat's diet too dramatically, as their diet primarily consists of meat in various forms, such as dry and wet commercial cat food, fish, and smaller animals like birds or rodents. 3. Open doors: This is where we see the primary impact of cats being taller. Currently, cats sometimes struggle to open doors due to their limited height and reach. With an increase in height, cats could use their increased reach to manipulate door handles and knobs, granting them the ability to access parts of the house, rooms, or spaces they couldn't before. This newfound ability would also contribute to the curiosity and exploratory nature of cats, affecting their overall behavior and interaction with their environment. 4. Need food: Cats already need food to survive, and their height would not significantly alter this fact. However, having increased height might lead to a proportionate increase in body mass, which might increase their energy expenditure and, in turn, increase the amount of food required to maintain their health. While taller cats might need more food, the fundamental need for food doesn't drastically change, unlike the ability to open doors. 5. Jog: Cats are already capable of jogging; however, taller cats could potentially cover more ground when jogging due to an increase in leg span and stride length. This benefit would be more of an adaptation to the increased height, rather than a newfound ability or significant behavioral change. In summary, while taller cats may experience changes in all of the listed areas, the ability to open doors would likely be the most significant and impactful ability gained from an increase in height. This new skill would fundamentally change the way cats interact with their environment, likely leading to even more curiosity-driven exploration and, ultimately, greater independence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children.

Review title: AWESOME! Product review: This is the best rear facing mirror! I have a small, fused headrest in my back center seat and none of the other mirrors one the market work. They all are so big and chunky they take up half the rearview mirror so you can't see out the window. BUT the Diono Back Seat mirror fits WONDERFULLY! Easy to install, no jumping in and out of the car a dozen times trying to get the perfect view. LOVE THIS MIRROR!!!! Do NOT spend 30 on one of those big bulky mirrors that sing and have lighting - the lighting is a joke and you can't hear the music if you have your car stereo on anyway. Answer:","output":"The given review would certainly increase the chances of me buying the product. There are several reasons why this particular review would influence my decision positively. Here is a detailed analysis of the review: 1. Enthusiastic review title: The title \\"AWESOME!\\" immediately grabs attention and sets a positive tone for the entire review.

Ease of installation: The reviewer mentions that the mirror is easy to install and does not require multiple attempts to get the perfect view. This information helps potential buyers understand that they do not need to spend much time or effort in setting up the product. 5. Strong recommendation against other alternatives: The reviewer suggests that there is no need to spend 30 on other mirrors with added features like lighting and music, as those features do not offer any significant advantages. By doing so, the reviewer makes a persuasive argument in favor of purchasing the Diono Back Seat Mirror, which offers more value for money. 6.

Q:What is the name of the man that appointed his brother as viceroy after taking easter Deccan?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

Q:Background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  Paragraph: Justin and Derek are accomplished competitive weight lifters. One day, Derek suffers a severe injury to his leg. Because of this injury, Derek is forced to stop exercising for several months. Justin remains injury free and continues to work out regularly on the other hand.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will lose less strength in their muscles? A:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph above, Justin will likely lose less strength in his muscles. This is because Justin remains injury-free and continues to work out regularly, maintaining his exercise routine and muscle usage. On the other hand, Derek suffers a severe leg injury and is forced to stop exercising for several months. As a result of this inactivity, Derek's muscles are not being used consistently, leading to a decrease in size and strength as per the \\"use it or lose it\\" principle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I don't know which is worse: that I actually bought this low-quality, home-produced dvd, or that there are people marketing this and calling it Capoeira. While the decription of warm-ups and instruments are passable, the rodas and demonstrations are singular and violent. This is not the dvd you want if you are a real Capoeira enhusiast. It is basically a taped class; All the games shown are a very violent regional style, Angola is not even mentioned, and \\"fighting techniques\\" are wrestling and boxing techniques that have nothing to do with Capoeira. Their music isn't very good, either. I have studied Capoeira under credible instructors for a while, and I can tell you that if you want a dvd on Capoeira, a company that makes budget aerobics videos is not the way to go. Answer: Answer:","output":"To determine the tone of this product review, let's analyze it step-by-step: 1. The title \\"Give me a break!\\" suggests frustration or annoyance. 2. The reviewer expresses disappointment in buying the low-quality DVD and condemns the people marketing it as Capoeira. 3. While the reviewer acknowledges some passable elements, they emphasize that the rodas and demonstrations are \\"singular and violent,\\" contrasting with what a real Capoeira enthusiast would want. 4. The review criticizes the DVD for only showcasing violent regional styles and ignoring Angola, while also mentioning that the \\"fighting techniques\\" are not related to Capoeira. 5. The music is also described as not being very good. 6. The reviewer concludes by advising others to avoid purchasing Capoeira DVDs from a company specializing in budget aerobics videos.

(Associated Press)      A man take a photo in the grounds of Ukrainian President Yanukovych's country residence in Mezhyhirya, Kiev region, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb, 22, 2014. Ukrainian security and volunteers from among Independence... (Associated Press)      These are some of the expenses detailed in financial documents found in President Viktor Yanukovych's abandoned residence, which was occupied by protesters after the leader fled the capital.      As thousands of Ukrainians continued to tour Yanukovych's opulent estate outside of Kiev on Sunday, evidence was uncovered of lavish spending in an economy that is teetering on the verge of default.      Yanukovych left Kiev on Friday night after opposition protesters took control of the capital and the national parliament in the wake of deadly clashes with police last week. More than 70 people were killed and hundreds were injured.      While visitors gawked in awe and outrage at Yanukovych's luxurious mansions, ponds and exotic animals, journalists combed through heaps of documents that appeared to show a leader who basked in extravagant wealth while his country sought bailouts from both the West and Russia.      Many of the financial and other documents were burned, while others were dumped in a lake before Yanukovych fled his closely guarded residence, flying to the eastern city of Kharkiv, where his support base is strongest. Divers were able to retrieve many of the documents, and activists laid them out to dry.      Photos of the documents were posted online by Mustafa Nayem, a top Ukrainian investigative journalist for the Ukrainska Pravda website and Hromadske.tv online news channel. Other respected Ukrainian news outlets also reported on the documents.      One was a receipt for 12 million in cash. Another invoice was for a payment of 10 million. Some 80,000 euros (about 110,000) went for curtains in a room called the \\"knight's hall.\\" Another 1.1 million euros (about 1.5 million) was spent on plants. Wooden decor for a handful of rooms cost 2.3 million.      Notably, 115,000 was spent for a statue of a \\"running boar,\\" possibly intended for Yanukovych, who is an avid hunter.      One page listed expenditures, and next to item No. 47 on the sheet was a payment of 32,580 hryvna (nearly 4,000) for what was described as a \\"bribe\\" used in a bidding process.      The documents were sure to fuel more anger among protesters.      Yanukovych's whereabouts were unknown Sunday. An aide said she last spoke to him Saturday night and he considered himself the legitimate president of Ukraine and did not intend to leave the country.      His residence in the Mezhygirya Park, about 140 hectares (345 acres) of forested hills along the Dnipro River had become for many Ukrainians a symbol of a corrupt administration. The president refused to answer questions about the estate, saying he lived in a modest house on a small plot of land on the grounds.      Journalists' investigations traced the property and buildings around it to Yanukovych's allies.      After Yanukovych's departure from Kiev, the estate was taken over by the opposition's self-defense units, which opened it to visitors and deployed activists to maintain order and prevent any looting or property damage. Ukrainians, many bringing their children, rushed to tour the parks. They reacted with wonder and revulsion at the opulence, including Yanukovych's private golf courses, pig farm and a small zoo with ostriches and peacocks.      Some have called for turning the site into a hospital, sanatorium or even a \\"museum of corruption.\\"      The Verkhovna Rada — Ukraine's parliament that is now controlled by the opposition — voted Sunday to turn over control of the estate to the government.      Yanukovych's lifestyle was on the minds of some in the crowd of thousands who flocked Sunday to the epicenter of the protests in Kiev's central square, known as the Maidan. The people paid their respects to those demonstrators who died in the unrest.      Yaryna Mosur, who left her two children in western Ukraine to take part in the protests, stood on the square wrapped in the Ukrainian flag as a black-robed Orthodox priest led prayers from a stage.      She said she was infuriated by the wealth on display in Yanukovych's estate.      \\"We are all in shock, but he will pay for it all dearly,\\" Mosur said. |||||","output":"During the Ukrainian anti-government protests in 2014, President Viktor Yanukovych fled his Kyiv residence, leaving behind a plethora of luxurious items reflecting his wealthy lifestyle. Journalists and protesters found financial documents listing extensive expenses, including a 12 million cash transfer receipt, dated just seven months after the president took office. Other expenditures included 31 million for ornate woodwork and expensive art pieces. Yanukovych was known for privatizing a state-owned property and converting it into his residence. Besides the financial records, the former president's abandoned residence held dossiers on social and political activists he was likely monitoring. The journalist who published the financial documents online also discovered invoices for lavish spending, like 110,000 for curtains and 1.5 million for plants. The residence also had a private zoo, vintage car collection, golf course, and personal church. The extensive spending and accumulated wealth documented in President Yanukovych's estate led to significant outrage among Ukrainians, as the country was on the verge of an economic crisis and was seeking bailouts from both the West and Russia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: CSKA Moscow officials have accused Manchester airport immigration officials of deliberately refusing their star player Zoran Tosic the right to play in the Champions League match at the Etihad Stadium. Former Manchester United winger Tosic is not in the team to face City after allegedly arriving at the airport on Tuesday with the wrong visa. The Serb was allowed in the country but not allowed to play in or even attend the match. Now directors of the Russian club have claimed the decision was a deliberate act aimed at sabotaging CSKA’s plans for tonight’s game in Group E. CSKA Moscow's Zoran Tosic was told he couldn’t play against Manchester City because of a visa issue. According to sources in Russia, the former Manchester United player was only in possession of a ‘transit visa’ rather than the necessary work visa. As such he was allowed in to the country but told he could not play in the game or even travel to the stadium for the game. It is understood that Tosic is currently at the CSKA team hotel in Manchester City centre. CSKA, meanwhile, are considering an official complaint, feeling that their player has been deliberately targeted because of the threat he carries on the field. City need to win after taking only two points from their first three matches. Tosic (left) apparently only had a 'transit visa' and so was forced to stay at the team's hotel during the match. CSKA general director Roman Babayev said: ‘Initially there was a discrepancy and he was issued not a tourist visa, but a transit visa. ‘The English consulate advised that Serbs do not really need a tourist visa, they may arrive as transit passengers without a visa and it is issued on the spot. ‘Nevertheless, the transit visa was issued, so he had the right to stay in the UK for 48 hours, that is enough. ‘But the English border guards showed some over-adherence to the rules and found on the internet that he is a CSKA player, and felt that he had come to England to work. ‘They demanded a wok visa, which is impossible and unacceptable. ‘After a long time of wrangling, he was admitted to the country because they had no right not to (let him in), as he had a visa. Sergio Aguero gives Manchester City the lead during the two side's clash at the Khimki Arena in Moscow. ‘However, they seized his passport, which is also the first time in our experience that a passport of a citizen of another country has been confiscated. ‘The English migration service has received several requests from the Serbian consulate in England and the Russian embassy in England. ‘They considered the matter at length and in the end, not only did he not go to the match, he was even forbidden to be a spectator at the stadium and they demanded that he leave the territory of Manchester before the match. ‘Will we submit a protest? English people still can’t calm down, but, I think there is already no sense in it, because it already won’t affect the result, but it’s not very pleasant. ‘I am sure that this would not have happened in any other European country.’","output":"CSKA Moscow has had some trouble with their star player, Zoran Tosic, playing in a big soccer game in Manchester. The Manchester airport immigration officials said Zoran arrived with the wrong type of visa, so he was allowed in the country but not allowed to play in the soccer game or even go watch it. CSKA Moscow is upset and thinks it was done on purpose because Zoran is a really good player, and they might make an official complaint."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: This article: Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

It has yellow and black stripes on its body and can sometimes sting. Bees are very important because they help flowers grow by spreading pollen. 2. \\"Pollen\\" - Pollen is like yellow dust that comes from flowers. Bees visit different flowers to collect pollen, and when they do, some of it sticks to their bodies. When they go to another flower, the pollen rubs off and helps that flower make new seeds to grow more flowers. 3. \\"Dahlia\\" - Dahlia is a special type of pretty flower that comes in many different colors like pink, orange, and purple. Bees like collecting pollen from dahlias because they have lots of yummy pollen. 4. \\"Park\\" - A park is a big open space outside where you can play, relax, and see lots of trees, grass, and sometimes flowers like the dahlia. Parks are places where people, animals, and plants can be together and enjoy nature.

Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves.

One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where do scientists think the earth's magnetic field is generated?\\" is \\"The outer core\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right!

A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

Information:  - The Reverend Doctor Christopher Syn is the smuggler hero of a series of novels by Russell Thorndike. The first book, \\"Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh\\" was published in 1915. The story idea came from smuggling in the 18th century Romney Marsh, where brandy and tobacco were brought in at night by boat from France to avoid high tax. Minor battles were fought, sometimes at night, between gangs of smugglers, such as the Hawkhurst Gang and the Revenue, supported by the army and local militias in the South, Kent and the West, Sussex.  - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.   - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Arthur Russell Thorndike (6 February 1885, Rochester, Kent  7 November 1972) was a British actor and novelist, best known for the Doctor Syn of Romney Marsh novels. Less well-known than his sister Sybil but equally versatile, Russell Thorndike's first love was writing and, after serving in World War I, he devoted himself to it.  - The Hawkhurst Gang was a notorious criminal organisation involved in smuggling throughout southeast England from 1735 until 1749.

What is the relationship between 'doctor syn on the high seas' and 'kent'? A:","output":"The relationship between 'Doctor Syn on the High Seas' and 'Kent' lies in the novel's setting and the author's background. 'Doctor Syn on the High Seas' is the second book in the series of Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. These novels revolve around the character of Reverend Doctor Christopher Syn, who becomes a smuggler hero in 18th century Romney Marsh, an area that is part of Kent county in South East England. The stories portray Syn's adventures in this region, which was rife with smuggling activities during that time. Furthermore, Russell Thorndike, the author of the Doctor Syn novels, was born in Rochester, Kent. His personal connection to this region might have influenced his choice of setting for the novels, as well as his interest in the historical events that took place there. Overall, the connection between 'Doctor Syn on the High Seas' and 'Kent' stems from both the novel's setting and the author's background and connection to the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal.  But I can use this background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  What is an answer for this question: Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running? Answer:","output":"Breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. This is because the body needs more oxygen for the increased energy demands during these activities, so the respiratory rate increases to deliver more oxygen to the cells for cellular respiration, allowing the production of more ATP to meet the energy requirements."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: \\"What is the third mentioned language of the scriptures?\\"  Context: \\"Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety.

Answer the following question: His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.'

Fox) is a recent graduate of Kansas State University who moves to New York City where he has landed a job as a financier. Upon arriving, he discovers that the company for which he is supposed to work has been taken over by a rival corporation. As a result, Brantley is laid off before he even starts working. After several unsuccessful attempts to get another job, mostly because he is either overqualified or underqualified and has little experience, Brantley ends up working in the mailroom of the Pemrose Corporation, which is directed by his uncle, Howard Prescott (Richard Jordan), the CEO. Pemrose was founded by Howard's father-in-law; Howard received presidency of the company by marrying his boss's daughter, Vera Pemrose (Margaret Whitton). Upon inspecting company reports, Brantley realizes that Howard and most of his fellow \\"suits\\" (executives) are making ineffective or detrimental decisions. After Brantley notices an empty office in the building due to one of Howard's frequent firings, he uses his access to the mailroom and his understanding of company processes to create the identity of Carlton Whitfield, a new executive. Brantley then assumes this role. While handling two jobs (switching between casual wear and business suits in the elevator), Brantley also falls head-over-heels for Christy Wills (Helen Slater), a fellow financial wizard who recently graduated from Harvard. Brantley meets Vera after driving her home in a company limo (at his employer's request). Vera persuades Brantley to stay for a swim and seduces him by stripping off his swimsuit and having an underwater kiss before she rips off her swimsuit and ultimately swims naked with him.

Question: Information:  - Superleague Formula was an open wheel single seater motor racing formula, which started in 2008, at Donington Park in the United Kingdom. The league introduced team sponsorship by association football clubs. It used the slogan 'The Beautiful Race: Football at 300 km/h'. By 2011 the link with football was fading with more than half the teams no longer associated with football teams. It was founded by businessmen Alex Andreu and Robin Webb. On 19 May 2010, Andreu stepped down in his role as series president, with his successor named as Alfredo Brisac not many weeks later. The season ran between April and November at the same time as most other European race series. Every team used identical cars and 750-horsepower V-12 engines. The Sonangol Group was the series' title sponsor from June 2009 until the end of the 2010 season.  - Donington Park is a motorsport circuit located near Castle Donington in Leicestershire, England. The circuit business is now owned by MotorSport Vision, and the surrounding Donington Park Estate is currently under lease by MotorSport Vision until 2038.  - The 2009 Superleague Formula season was the second Superleague Formula championship . The series was rebranded the \`\` Superleague Formula by Sonangol '' for this season and also 2010 with the Angolan oil company becoming the title sponsor . It began on June 28 at Magny - Cours and finished on November 8 at Jarama . The field remained at 18 clubs for the 2009 season but Beijing Guoan did not return to try to retain the title which they won with Davide Rigon in 2008 , however Rigon did return in the car of Olympiacos CFP despite GP2 commitments . In Estoril , María de Villota became the first woman to race in the series and Sébastien Bourdais became the most successful racing driver to enter the series having been dropped by Scuderia Toro Rosso just weeks earlier . Bourdais described Superleague as \`\` the best alternative to F1 '' . Liverpool F.C. , run under Hitech Junior Team with driver Adrián Vallés , were crowned series champions for the first time at the last event of the season .    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to '2009 superleague formula season' with the relationship of 'sport'.  Choices: - football  - motorsport  - united kingdom Answer:","output":"The entity related to '2009 Superleague Formula season' with the relationship of 'sport' is motorsport. While the Superleague Formula has connections with football through team sponsorship by football clubs, it is essentially an open-wheel, single-seater motor racing competition. The races took place on motorsport circuits like Donington Park in the United Kingdom, where the first season started in 2008. Drivers competed using identical cars and powerful V-12 engines, racing at high speed to showcase their skill and be crowned as champions. In the 2009 season, which was rebranded as \\"Superleague Formula by Sonangol\\" due to sponsorship from the Angolan oil company, teams represented various football clubs, and Liverpool F.C., run by Hitech Junior Team with driver Adrián Vallés, emerged as the season champions.

Cargo hold Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Frozen Equilibrium\\" The Frozen Equilibrium is the story of Flynn, a determined and skilled engineer who finds himself aboard the colossal spaceship, 'The Tempus,' which has been assigned to transport a secretive and precious cargo to a distant human colony living on the distant planet, Argon-9. In the year 3025, following Earth's devastating climate collapse, humanity has managed to build viable habitats on distant planets and moons. These habitats rely on highly sophisticated life-maintenance systems to regulate temperature and air quality, making air conditioning and ventilation crucial elements for human survival. Flynn, a 34-year-old engineer, has been handpicked for this mission due to his expertise in maintaining such complex systems. He joins 'The Tempus' as the lead HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) specialist. Flynn is ready for a routine assignment, but he is unaware that the cargo he's been entrusted with is the key to unlocking a new energy source that could save Earth's depleted resources and provide a new future for humanity. Unfortunately for Flynn, a powerful and sinister organization, the Galaxia Consortium, has learned of this groundbreaking energy source and will stop at nothing to acquire it for their own malicious intentions. To make matters worse, a mole has infiltrated the crew of 'The Tempus,' sabotaging the ship's ventilation system and putting the lives of everyone onboard at risk. As Flynn races against time to restore the air conditioning and ventilation throughout the ship, he discovers that the crucial systems have been tampered with, leading him to the cargo hold. Flynn realizes he must access the heart of the cargo hold's ventilation system, buried deep within the secure container housing the priceless energy source. With the crew's lives at stake and Galaxia Consortium hot on their trail, Flynn comes face-to-face with the mole who has been actively working to sabotage the mission. A thrilling battle ensues between Flynn and the mole as the two adversaries clash in the freezing cargo hold, each possessing the skill set necessary to repair or destroy the fragile air conditioning and ventilation system. As the temperature in the cargo hold continues to drop, Flynn's exceptional engineering skills are put to the ultimate test. He outsmarts the mole and successfully initiates repairs to restore the air conditioning and ventilation. Meanwhile, the captain of 'The Tempus,' Commander Evelina Troy, manages to outmaneuver and evade the Galaxia Consortium's fleet, ensuring the safe delivery of the invaluable cargo to Argon-9. Flynn's heroics in repairing the impaired system not only save the lives of 'The Tempus' crew, but they also ensure that hope is preserved for humanity's future. Upon their arrival at Argon-9, Flynn and the rest of the crew are celebrated as heroes. Flynn's newfound celebrity propels him into a unique position to lead a new generation of engineers to help secure the Earth's survival and heal the damage inflicted on it by centuries of neglect. The Frozen Equilibrium is an intense and adventurous journey that explores the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity, the significance of humanity's innate drive to endure and adapt, and the realization that the true measure of a hero includes their ability to preserve life."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: I had to go somewhere involuntarily is the same as?

Step 1: Identify the common elements in both premise and hypothesis. In this case, the common element is \\"the men that drive the trucks\\". Step 2: Examine the relationship between the elements in the premise. In the premise, we have two types of workers mentioned: \\"the men that drive the trucks\\" and \\"the guys that fix the power lines\\". It is mentioned that both of these groups of workers \\"aren't tested as much\\". Step 3: Compare the information provided in the premise to the hypothesis.

Sentence 1: - Stockfish - Cured - Fermentation - Cold-adapted bacteria - Maturing process - Cheese Sentence 2: - Stockfish - Adapted - Fermentation - Cold-cured bacteria - Maturing process - Cheese Step 2: Analyze the differences found during comparison. Differences between the two sentences include the use of \\"cured\\" in Sentence 1 and \\"adapted\\" in Sentence 2, and \\"cold-adapted bacteria\\" in Sentence 1 and \\"cold-cured bacteria\\" in Sentence 2. Step 3: Evaluate if the differences change the meaning of the sentences. The main difference lies in the use of \\"cured\\" and \\"adapted\\": In Sentence 1, it is implied that the fish undergoes a curing process through fermentation, while Sentence 2 states that the fish is adapted in the fermentation process. Likewise, in Sentence 1, the bacteria are described as \\"cold-adapted,\\" meaning they can survive in cold environments, whereas in Sentence 2, the bacteria are described as \\"cold-cured,\\" which doesn't convey the same meaning. Conclusion: The two sentences do not mean the same thing. There are slight differences in the choice of words that result in changes in meaning. The first sentence properly conveys the idea of fish being cured through fermentation with assistance from cold-adapted bacteria, while the second sentence incorrectly uses \\"adapted\\" and \\"cold-cured.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"No, \\"wanted Jesse to give baseball scores\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Ash suspect Jesse was having an affair?\\" The potential answer provided does not align with the context of the question and does not address the topic of suspicion regarding a possible affair. To provide a detailed and long explanation, we need to analyze the components of the given question and understand why the proposed choice is not valid. First, let us dissect the question \\"Why did Ash suspect Jesse was having an affair?\\" This question aims to inquire about the reasons that led Ash to think Jesse might be involved in an extramarital or unfaithful relationship. Such reasons may include, for instance:  1. Observing secretive behavior: Ash may have noticed Jesse hiding something or trying to keep certain affairs out of Ash's knowledge. 2. Increasing distance and lack of emotional connection: Ash and Jesse may not have been as emotionally connected as they used to be, making Ash question if there is someone else in Jesse's life. 3. Unusual changes in schedule or routine: If Jesse suddenly started coming home late, spending more time at work, or being unavailable without a clear reason, Ash might have wondered if there was an affair. 4. Discovering evidence of infidelity: This could range from Ash finding suggestive messages or photographs to seeing Jesse with someone else in a compromising situation. 5. Behavioral changes: If Jesse suddenly changed their appearance, began acting differently, or seemed nervous or guilty around Ash, it might have raised suspicion. Now, let us take a look at the answer choice provided: \\"wanted Jesse to give baseball scores.\\" This statement does not address any of the potential reasons that would lead Ash to suspect Jesse of having an affair. Furthermore, it is entirely unrelated to the topic of infidelity, as it pertains to an interest in sports information rather than a concern about the nature of the relationship between Ash and Jesse. In conclusion, the answer \\"wanted Jesse to give baseball scores\\" is not valid for the question \\"Why did Ash suspect Jesse was having an affair?\\" as it does not provide any relevant or plausible reasoning that corresponds to the suspicions surrounding an affair. A more suitable answer should be related to signs of infidelity or substantial changes in behavior, emotion, or communication that could indicate a breach of trust within the relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For this, I will search for reliable information about when class distinctions broke down in Britain. Step 3: Analyze the information found After researching, I can see that class distinctions in Britain did undergo significant changes during the 20th century. The statement provided by the user addresses the changing perspectives of the saloon and public bar as a symbol of class distinction. Step 4: Confirm or refute the statement Based on my research, it can be said that class distinctions did indeed begin to break down in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s. However, this process was gradual and had been happening since the end of World War II. The decreasing importance of class distinctions was intensified by factors such as increased social mobility, wider access to education, and changes in popular culture. Nonetheless, the statement given by the user is accurate in identifying the 1960s and 1970s as decades when class distinctions began to blur. Step 5: Address citation needed claims The user's statement contains several \\"[citation needed]\\" tags, indicating that they are looking for sources to back up this information. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I will search for relevant sources to support the claim. Based on my research, the following sources can be used to support the statement provided: 1. Cannadine, D. (1998). Class in Britain. Yale University Press. 2. Marwick, A. (1998). The Sixties: Cultural Revolution in Britain, France, Italy, and the United States, c.1958-1974. Bloomsbury. Step 6: Provide a final response Yes, the statement you provided is accurate. Class distinctions began to break down in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s, and the distinction between the saloon and the public bar was often considered archaic during these decades. You can refer to the sources mentioned above to further support this claim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Hrdina musí bojovat s ženou, zubatým stvořením, a zlomit její moc. Which language is this?","output":"The language you posted is Czech. It is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in Czechia (also known as the Czech Republic), but also by Czech communities in other parts of the world. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the extent that many linguists consider them mutually intelligible. It is also somewhat similar to Polish and Sorbian, other Slavic languages spoken in Central Europe. The sentence \\"Hrdina musí bojovat s ženou, zubatým stvořením, a zlomit její moc\\" translates to \\"The hero must fight the woman, a toothy creature, and break her power\\" in English. Czech is known for its complex grammar and large number of declensions. Like many other Slavic languages, it primarily uses a case system to indicate grammatical relationships in sentences. Therefore, word order is less rigid in Czech than it is in English. It is also notable for having a rich system of noun and verb inflection, which can be challenging for learners. The language also has several unique sounds that do not exist in English and most other languages. These include ř, a unique Czech sound that is a simultaneous trill and fricative, and ň, a palatal nasal. Czech also uses the Latin alphabet, extended with various diacritics, such as the acute accent (´), the caron (ˇ), and the ring (˚). These are used to indicate modified sounds or to distinguish words that would otherwise be homophones. Czech literature and media are extensive, dating back to the Middle Ages. Some of the most famous works in the Czech language include the Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek, and the works of Franz Kafka, who wrote in German but was of Czech-Jewish descent. In conclusion, the sentence you posted is from the Czech language, a West Slavic language with complex grammar and unique sounds, used primarily in the Czech Republic and by Czech communities worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if this does not work, experts recommend using rubbing alcohol to kill and preserve a tick after removal. This makes it easier for doctors to determine if the tick was a carrier of Lyme disease.  Use a clean cotton swab to apply rubbing alcohol to the area where a tick is attached. If you don't have cotton swabs, you can pour a little rubbing alcohol directly onto the skin.  Use clean tweezers (preferably after sterilizing them, which you can do with rubbing alcohol) to grip the tick's body as close to the surface of your skin as possible.  Gently pull the tick upward without breaking any part of the tick's body.  Drop the tick into a jar or bottle filled with a little rubbing alcohol. Be sure the tick is completely submerged.  Use rubbing alcohol to cleanse the skin's surface where the tick was removed. Use a spray bottle to apply rubbing alcohol to the inside of sneakers. The rubbing alcohol will kill the bacteria causing the smells, leaving your sneakers clean and odor-free. If you're out of nail polish remover, you can use rubbing alcohol in a pinch. Pour some rubbing alcohol onto a cotton swab, and rub hard on your finger nails to remove old nail polish. Nail polish won't come off as easily as with actual nail polish remover, but it will still strip away the old nail polish. A common folk remedy for fevers is to apply rubbing alcohol to the skin. As the alcohol evaporates, it's thought to offer a cooling sensation. However, pouring rubbing alcohol on the body, especially on children, can be extremely dangerous. A number of children have actually slipped into comas after their parents applied rubbing alcohol to treat a fever. For this reason, using rubbing alcohol to relieve the symptoms of a fever is highly discouraged. What is a summary?","output":"A summary for this article is: Rubbing alcohol can be used in different ways, like removing ticks, cleaning smelly sneakers, and taking off nail polish. It can also kill a tick for doctors to check it for Lyme disease.

To understand the reasoning behind this classification, let us break down the sentence and analyze its components: 1. \\"smug\\": This adjective is used to describe someone or something that is self-satisfied, complacent, or overly pleased with themselves. When employed in the context of a film or any artistic work, it implies that the content comes across as arrogant or self-congratulatory. This perception does not generally evoke a favorable reaction in the audience and is therefore associated with negative sentiment. 2. \\"convoluted\\": This term refers to something that is complex, intricate, or difficult to understand. If a piece of art, such as an action-comedy, is described as \\"convoluted\\", it implies that the plot, characters, or other narrative elements are unnecessarily confusing or complicated. This can diminish the audience's overall enjoyment of the work, which again results in a negative sentiment. When these two adjectives are combined to describe an \\"action-comedy\\", it suggests that the film in question is marked by an unwarranted sense of self-importance and a needlessly complicated narrative structure.

Can you imagine sitting in class and seeing your dad walk past the door of your classroom and wave his hand at you? In junior high? One girl in our class always made fun of me because my dad was a plumber and hers was a lawyer , and she would say things like, \\"Ew, that's gross !\\" I must admit I was sometimes embarrassed by what my dad did, especially in my early teens, when the only thing I really cared about was what the other girls thought. The girl lived a few streets away from us, and one winter day---the day her elder sister was getting married---the toilet in their main upstairs bathroom broke and there was water everywhere. Her father, the lawyer called every plumber in the Yellow Page, but nobody would come and because we were having a major snowstorm. Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.) My father fixed the toilet, help them clean up everything, and didn't take much time for his trouble. But as we were leaving, he told the girl, \\"If I ever need a lawyer, I'll be happy to call your dad.\\" As we walked to our car, he said to me, \\"Do you believe he didn't know where the main shut-off valve  was? What a dumb ass!\\" From that point on, her dad was known in school as Lawyer Dumb Ass. When my husband and I bought our house, the first thing my dad showed him was the main shut-off valve.

Beleaguered Malaysia Airlines suffered fresh embarrassment over the weekend after it was revealed a Christmas Day flight from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur flew in the wrong direction for eight minutes after air traffic controllers were given the wrong flight plan.      The New Zealand Herald reported the pilot of flight MH132 queried the route his Airbus A330 was taking after he noticed it was headed further south than expected.      Malaysia Airlines confirmed in a statement that there had been a mix up with the early-morning service's flight plans.      \\"On December 24th 2015 our flight MH132 from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur was given the latest flight plan by the airline's Operations Dispatch Centre,\\" the statement says.      SHARE      Share on Facebook SHARE      Share on Twitter TWEET      Link Malaysia Airlines' flight MH132 flew on the wrong path after air traffic controllers in New Zealand were given the wrong flight plan.      \\"Auckland's Air Traffic Control (ATC) was inadvertently given an earlier flight plan.\\"      \\"Both routes were following an approved flight path and the aircraft had enough fuel for both routes. The safety of both passengers and crew were never compromised at any time.\\"      Advertisement      The airline said it was investigating the incident.      A spokeswoman for New Zealand's Airways Corporation said the incident would be investigated by its internal team. \\"The flight plan the airline filed with us was going to Kuala Lumpur but via a slightly different route than the pilot was expecting,\\" she told the New Zealand Herald.      Malaysia Airlines' horror run began in March 2014 when flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board.      Just over four months later flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.      Earlier this year Malaysia Airlines appointed German airline executive Christoph Mueller as chief executive, tasking him with rebuilding the airline after the string of disasters. ||||| 1/10 Shot down in a military training exercise While the Australian officials leading the search for MH370 say they remain “absolutely convinced” it ended up in the southern Indian Ocean, some passengers’ families – and theorists – distrust the unprecedented satellite data analysis involved. Among those who support this view are the British journalist and author Nigel Cawthorne, who has controversially already published the first book on the plane’s disappearance. e supports one theory, based on the eye-witness testimony of New Zealand oil rig worker Mike McKay, that the plane was shot down shortly after it stopped communicating with air traffic controllers. At the time there was a series of war games taking place in the South China Sea involving Thailand, the US and personnel from China, Japan, Indonesia and others, and Cawthorne has linked this to Mr McKay’s claims to have seen a burning plane going down in the Gulf of Thailand.      2/10 Stolen by Putin Jeff Wise, a private pilot and science writer, claims he has evidence that the plane made its way to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which is run by Russia as its largest space launch facility. He claims Vladimir Putin ordered Russian special forces to hijack MH370 and fly it to the spaceport, but admits he has 'no idea' why the Russian president would want to do such a thing Getty Images      3/10 Flown north and shot down deliberately, prompting cover-up At a stage in the investigation when it was believed the plane could have flown for some time from where it disappeared along either a northern or southern corridor, many posted on forums suggesting that if it had been the former we would never hear about what happened. Some still support this view, and former RAF navigator Sean Maffett told the BBC that after 9/11, any unidentified airliner entering the airspace of another country would lead to fighter jets being scrambled. “If the plane is in the northern arc it could easily have been shot down,” he said. This theory also involves a national – or possibly international – cover-up, based on the premise that no country would want to admit to shooting down an airliner full of passengers from all over the world.      4/10 Tried to land on a desert island beach After reports that the plane had turned left shortly following its disappearance from civilian radar screens, speculation grew that it could have landed on a remote beach somewhere like the Andaman Islands, which lie between Indonesia and the coast of Thailand. Though CNN reported that locals dismissed the idea a Boeing 777 could land on an airstrip there undetected, the archipelago consists of hundreds of remote islands with some long stretches of sand. Former BA pilot Steve Buzdygan said it would be difficult – but not impossible – to bring a 777 down on a long deserted beach. AP      5/10 Landed at a US military base One of the more outlandish conspiracy theories that has gained some traction online is the idea that MH370 could have been “captured” and flown to a military base on the UK-owned tropical atoll of Diego Garcia, in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The base is run by the US, and some have reportedly said in forum postings that the Kremlin has put some credence into this possibility. Such is the strength of belief in this theory that the US government has been forced to issue a denial. A spokesperson for the US embassy in Malaysia told the local Star newspaper that there was “no indication that MH370 flew anywhere near the Maldives or Diego Garcia”. “MH370 did not land in Diego Garcia,” he added. Nasa      6/10 Headed for a remote airport in Langkawi, Malaysia One theory, put forward by another aviation blogger named Chris Goodfellow, has it that the sudden left turn came after major catastrophe knocked out a range of the plane’s electronics, from transponders to communications equipment. In this scenario and in the middle of the night, Goodfellow argued, the pilot would redirect towards the nearest safe airport. “This pilot did all the right things,” he said. “Actually he was taking a direct route to Palau Langkawi, a 13,000ft (4,000m) strip with an approach over water at night with no obstacles. He did not turn back to Kuala Lumpur because he knew he had 8,000ft ridges to cross. He knew the terrain was friendlier towards Langkawi and also a shorter distance.” This theory assumes that the plane was in fact controlled manually once it disappeared – and that it did not make it to Langkawi.      7/10 An explosion in the cockpit The theory of a sudden explosion within the cockpit before the turn left could explain why there was no attempt to signal for help. Since 9/11 cockpits doors have been fortified to become extremely difficult to bypass, and such a sudden incident could perhaps have incapacitated both pilots while keeping out the rest of the crew. This explanation does not seem to tally with the claims of some Malaysian officials, however, that the change in direction was the result of “seven or eight keystrokes into a computer on a knee-high pedestal between the captain and the first officer”.      8/10 A struggle at altitude Though Malaysian officials believe that the plane was deliberately diverted, and that its communications systems were turned off one after the other, a detailed background check into all 227 passengers has cleared all of suspicion. If, however, we do accept that the plane was the subject of a passenger hijacking, it remains to be explained why the hijackers did not try to do more than fly the plane into the middle of the southern Indian Ocean. One theory suggests that there was some kind of struggle for control of the plane that ultimately ended with mutual destruction. Further analysis of data by Malaysian officials suggests that the plane was flown erratically once it left civilian radar, climbing to 45,000ft before dropping very low. Buzdygan told the BBC he would resort to this sort of flying if faced with would-be hijackers. “I’d try to disorientate and confuse the hijackers by throwing them around,” he said. Getty Images      9/10 Pilot suicide As part of the ongoing criminal investigation in Malaysia, police are looking into the state of mind and possible motives of the captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. The Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar has said that “all possibilities” will be looked into, and there have been reports that Shah was going through a difficult marriage break-up.Yet such comments have been rubbished by the man’s relatives, who have described him since as a dedicated family man and model professional. Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director of Malaysia Airlines, described Shah as a seasoned pilot with an excellent record. “There have been absolutely no implications that we are aware of that there was anything untoward in either his behaviour or attitude,” he told Reuters. “We have no reason to believe that there was anything, any actions, internally by the crew that caused the disappearance of this aircraft.” ||||| Gilze-Rijen air force base: Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed last year after it was hit by a Russian-made Buk surface to air missile, an air safety investigation has found, which killed the pilots immediately but may have left passengers alive for up to a full minute and a half.      A report by the Dutch Safety Board, released on Tuesday in the Netherlands, found that a Russian-made Buk missile exploded just a few metres above and to the left of the plane's cockpit.      \\"(The) impact (of the missile shrapnel) was only instantly fatal to the occupants of the cockpit,\\" the report found.

In others, the exposure led to reduced awareness or unconsciousness in a very short space of time.\\"      Advertisement      However it was not possible to say when they died.      \\"It cannot be ruled out that some occupants remained conscious for some time during the one to one and a half minutes for which the crash lasted,\\" the report said.

Photo: Kate Geraghty      Risks not properly identified      The investigators' report found that the airline and air traffic bodies had not \\"adequately identified the risks to civil aviation brought about by the armed conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine\\".      Ukraine itself came in for strong criticism, for not closing the airspace over a region where scores of military aircraft had been shot down in the previous few months.      MH17 crashed in Ukraine's east on July 17, 2014, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew members aboard the Boeing 777 – including 39 people who called Australia home.      The report was presented at Gilze-Rijen air force base in the Netherlands, by Dutch Safety Board chairman Tjibbe Joustra, standing in front of a reconstruction of the front third of the plane, rebuilt from wreckage recovered from the fields of eastern Ukraine.      The reconstruction showed the cockpit area riddled with holes, punctured by shrapnel from the exploding missile. Buk missiles are designed to explode next to their targets, rather than collide directly with them.      \\"Flight MH17 crashed as a result of the detonation of a warhead outside the airplane,\\" Mr Joustra said. \\"None of the aviation parties involved recognised the risks posed to civil aviation by the conflict on ground.\\"      There was sufficient reason to close airspace as a precaution, Mr Joustra said, as more than 60 military aircraft had been brought down in the months prior, and there was evidence of weapons systems that could reach civil aircraft cruising altitude.      The reason for the omission was \\"straightforward and disquieting\\", he said – \\"Nobody had thought that civil aviation was at risk (even though) there was undeniably an armed conflict taking place on the ground.\\"      Ukraine, which was responsible for the safety of the airspace under international law, came in for strong criticism for not closing its airspace as a precaution. However other states and airline operators were also at fault, and international rules needed to be changed, the investigators said.      Alternative theories ruled out      Investigators forensically examined the wreckage of the plane, recovered from the fields of eastern Ukraine, and eliminated the possibilities that the plane was brought down by an internal explosion, by gunfire or air-to-air attack.      They even excluded one theory that it was hit by a meteor.      \\"We investigated and eliminated the possibilities one by one,\\" Mr Joustra said.      Investigators found a Buk warhead detonated outside the aircraft, slightly in front and above the left side of the cockpit. Thousands of pre-formed metal fragments penetrated the front of the plane with great force.      Computer simulations backed up this theory, and it was also corroborated by millisecond analysis of the cockpit voice recorder.      The front of the plane broke off, the rest of the plane broke up in mid air. The tail section crashed first, then the centre, with the engines, hit the ground upside down and caught fire.      Mr Joustra said the launch site of the missile could be narrowed to a 320 square km area in eastern Ukraine, but further work narrowing this area was beyond the investigators' mandate.      The finding contradicts one theory pushed by Russia and its supporters, that the plane was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet.      However the investigators did not directly confront another Russian theory: that the missile was fired by the Ukrainian army, rather than by Russian-backed separatists (or Russian soldiers working with the separatists).      Russian missile manufacturer rejects findings      Before the Dutch report was released, Russia's state arms producer (and Buk missile manufacturer) Almaz-Antey announced the results of its own investigation.      The manufacturer said it had fired Buk missiles at a decommissioned jet plane, similar to a Boeing 777, so they could examine the pattern of impact.      They said the results demonstrated that MH17 was shot down by an old form of Buk missile – a 9M38 – which was not in use by the Russian army, and is a decade past the 'use-by date' intended by the manufacturer.      The last missile of this type was produced in the Soviet Union in 1986 and Russia decommissioned its remaining 9M38s in 2011, Russian state-sponsored Sputnik News reported.      \\"The results of the experiment completely contradict the results of the Dutch commission on the type of missile and the location of its launch,\\" Almaz-Antey CEO Yan Novikov told journalists.      His company's report also said the missile was fired from near the village of Zaroschenskoye – an area reportedly under Ukrainian control at the time.      However they produced no eyewitness evidence of a Buk in that region at the time, in contrast to the significant amount of eyewitness, video and photographic evidence of a Buk in rebel-controlled territory on the day MH17 came down.      And Dutch TV reporter Rudy Bouma Tweeted that he had visited Zaroschenskoye recently and \\"villagers didn't witness (a) Buk launch previous to (the) crash\\", though the Ukrainian army was around 5km away at the time.      The Dutch report was not intended to address \\"questions of blame or liability\\", a DSB spokesman said.      However one DSB source told the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant the BUK missile is developed and made in Russia, and \\"It can be assumed that the rebels would not be able to operate such a device. I suspect the involvement of former Russian military officials\\".      World leaders react, vow justice      Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop released a joint statement welcoming the findings, saying their thoughts and prayers were with the families and loved ones of those killed on the flight.      Ms Bishop said the reports findings provided critical insight into the incident.      \\"It determines the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, consistent with the Australian government's initial assessment of the incident,\\" she said.      The criminal investigation into who was responsible for the tragedy is run separately by an international 'Joint Investigation Team', including Australian federal police, who recently told Fairfax it may be another year before the case is ready for prosecution.      And in any case it is still unclear where the case could be tried. Russia vetoed a proposal for an international tribunal that was proposed by Australia and the Netherlands at the United Nations in July.      \\"We, and other partner governments of the Joint Investigation Team, remain absolutely committed to seeing justice done,\\" said Ms Bishop.      Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak said countries must work together to hold those responsible for \\"this murderous\\" act after speaking with Mr Turnbull about the MH17 findings, and labelled the attack as \\"unforseeable\\".      \\"Fifteen months have passed but our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice remains as strong as it was on that fateful day when hundreds of innocent people lost their lives in a conflict that was not theirs,\\" Mr Najib said in a statement.      \\"This was an unforeseeable act and, of the 160 flights that were on MH17's general route that day, not one was advised by the relevant authorities about any specific threat,\\" he said.

Plot title: Seed Movie plot: John Boles, Lois Wilson and Genevieve Tobin in Seed Bart Carter has sacrificed a writing career so he can support his wife Peggy and their five children by working as a clerk in a New York City publishing house. When his former girlfriend Mildred Bronson, a literary agent who has been working in the Paris office, returns to the States, she arranges for Bart to draw his regular salary while working on a novel. Because his home life is so chaotic, Bart writes at Mildred's apartment during the day and frequently stays for dinner, and the two soon discover their old feelings for each other have been revived. Bart's novel is published, and when Seed becomes a critical and commercial success, he abandons his family and moves to France with Mildred. Peggy opens a dress shop and lives with the children in an apartment above the store. A decade later, the now-married Bart and Mildred return to New York. His grown children are delighted to see their father, who wishes to make amends for having left them. He suggests enrolling his daughter Margaret in finishing school, sending the twin boys to Harvard University, finding employment for his oldest son, and having the youngest boy live with him and Mildred. At her children's urging Peggy reluctantly agrees, although she feels she is losing them. Mildred assures her they will return to her one day, whereas she believes their renewed relationship with their father will place her own future with Bart in jeopardy. My question: Who all does Seed kill?","output":"Based on the plot summary provided, there does not appear to be any mention of the character named Seed or any other character killing someone in the course of the movie. The storyline primarily focuses on Bart Carter's career progression, his relationships and family dynamics. It explores his journey from a clerk to a successful author, his rekindled romantic relationship with Mildred Bronson, his abandonment of his family, and his eventual attempt at reconciliation with his children upon his return to New York a decade later.

Anna Nicole Smith gained notoriety after her short lived marriage to what Texas oil billionaire sparked a major court case, which continues to this day?","output":"Anna Nicole Smith, born Vickie Lynn Hogan on November 28, 1967, was an American model, actress, and television personality who became widely known after her high-profile marriage to a Texas oil billionaire. She gained notoriety when she married J. Howard Marshall II on June 27, 1994, at the age of 26, while he was 89 years old. J. Howard Marshall II, born January 24, 1905, was a businessman, oil tycoon, and lawyer who made a significant fortune in the oil industry. He was a co-founder of the Great Northern Oil Company, a prominent shareholder in Koch Industries, and held various other investments. At the time of their marriage, he was considered one of the wealthiest men in the United States. The circumstances of Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall II's 14-month-long marriage sparked widespread media attention due to the age difference and the notable contrast in their public images. Anna was a former Playmate of the Year and had been making a name for herself as a model, while J. Howard Marshall II was a successful and respected businessman. J. Howard Marshall II died on August 4, 1995, which led to the beginning of a protracted legal battle over his sizeable estate, which was estimated to be worth over 1 billion. The primary parties involved in the lawsuit were Smith, who had been left out of the will and trust documents; J. Howard Marshall II's son, E. Pierce Marshall; and other family members. Anna Nicole Smith asserted that her late husband had verbally promised to leave her half of his estate, and she filed a lawsuit in Texas probate court against E. Pierce Marshall, alleging that he had interfered with her rightful inheritance. The case received extensive media coverage as it unfolded over more than a decade with several state and federal court rulings, including two trips to the United States Supreme Court. Numerous appeals, cross-appeals, and procedural complexities made it one of the most complicated and longstanding probate court disputes in American legal history. Despite Anna Nicole Smith's untimely death on February 8, 2007, the legal battle over J. Howard Marshall II's estate continued. Her estate, represented by her executor, Howard K. Stern, remained engaged in the lawsuit. The legal dispute eventually reached a conclusion in 2011 when the United States Supreme Court ruled that Anna Nicole Smith's estate was not entitled to any of the money from J. Howard Marshall II's fortune. To this day, the marriage of Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall II is often remembered as one of the most scandalous and headline-grabbing celebrity unions in recent history. The convoluted legal battle that ensued after Marshall's death has left a lasting impact on the American legal landscape and provided an enduring testament to the complexities of inheritance law and the administration of vast fortunes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas. Agent Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle and partners up with Sophia, a local constable, to try and capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal.

The correct choice is 'David Price' as this is a human name and aligns with the context of marriage.  The other choices are incorrect due to various reasons: - 'Anthony' refers to Lysette Anthony herself so it would be wrong to say she married herself. - 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet' and 'Three Up, Two Down' are TV shows she has worked on, not someone she could have married. - 'Britain' is a country, not a person and therefore can't be someone she could have married. - 'Eighties TV' is a period or kind of TV, not a person, so it cannot be the object of marriage. - 'Lysette Anthony' is her own name, she could not marry herself. - 'Luc Leestemaker' and 'Simon Boswell' are both humans and potential valid choices, but there is no information in the passage to suggest she was married to them.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  I am facing a new situation today: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers, lighter or darker? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article, natural selection favors organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment.

The Portuguese Restoration War  was the name given by nineteenth-century Romantic historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668. The revolution of 1640 ended the 60-year Iberian Union. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War until 1648 and the Franco-Spanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch-Portuguese War until 1663. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War.

The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were much more varied in later periods? ?  Chinese imperial tombs are typically  approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied.  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture.

Things went to hell between them, and they split up. I ended up on her side because he accused me of sleeping with her behind his back, which pissed me off royally because I was loyal to a fault to him. She and I did everything together pretty much after that, and she was my favorite person in the world. I looked forward to seeing her when I'd get home from my hitches. But slowly I found myself thinking about her in ways that weren't pg. Pretty soon, I realized I had deep feelings for her. I realized this after I found myself getting jealous of men she brought around. Id stare at her when she wasn't looking. Bought her gifts, etc. She was always on my mind. Low and behold one night I was drunk, we were texting, and I finally confessed everything to her. She told me to listen to a song, and I did. I was elated because I thought finally I had been right about my feelings. Around valentines day I get a message from a mutual friend of ours asking me if I had sent her gifts. I said yes, I had. She told me our friend had been dating someone the whole time. I was crushed to say the least. I messaged her and asked her if it was true. Her only response was \\"I didn't know how to tell you\\". I told her it was my fault for opening my mouth, but I couldn't be around her any more. I heard in the coming weeks that she told everyone I had crossed a line, she saw me as a brother, etc. But she had dated another guy she considered a \\"brother\\" as well. I was hurt even more. This was months after my mother died unexpectedly too. So my emotional state was not well to say the least. The last time we spoke, I let loose on her all the stuff she had lied about, and made her leave the party she was at. I also told the guy she was with not to let her spend all his money.

Whether you're a three-pack-a-day smoker who doesn't like being lectured to about the health risks, or you're a person who doesn't touch cigarettes and wouldn't smoke one if you were offered a Ferrari in exchange, picture this:. Imagine, for a moment, that cigarettes had never been invented. And that in 2013 an eager entrepreneur went to the Food and Drug Administration seeking approval for a new product -- cigarettes -- that he wanted to sell to the American people. Imagine that the Food and Drug Administration, taking its time and doing its homework, came up with all the currently available medical evidence about the dangers of smoking. Whether you're a smoker or not, you know what the FDA's response would be to that hypothetical entrepreneur:. They'd laugh him out of the room. They'd ask him why he was wasting their time. They might, if they were feisty enough, point out the deadly impact of what he was asking them to authorize, and say to him:. \\"There's a legal term for knowingly causing death to people. In asking us to approve your product, sir, are you not setting us up to become accessories to murder?\\" But cigarettes are not a new product. They are perfectly legal in all 50 states, and they're going to stay that way. Which is why two cigarette-related events last week are so instructive. The federal government gave up its highly publicized battle to make every package of cigarettes carry large, gruesome-looking illustrations. FDA changes course on graphic warning labels for cigarettes. The proposed illustrations -- they included images of a diseased lung, of a tracheotomy hole in a man's throat, of rotting teeth -- were rolled out with great fanfare in 2010. The government wanted the illustrations to cover the entire top half -- front and back -- of every pack of cigarettes sold in the United States. Last week, faced with arguments from the tobacco industry that the mandatory images violated free speech rights -- the cigarette companies said the images were \\"intended to elicit loathing, disgust and repulsion\\" -- the government backed down. Attorney General Eric Holder wrote that the government will not fight the case in the Supreme Court. The FDA will instead reevaluate the proposed labels. Last week's second event took place in New York, where Mayor Michael Bloomberg asked for a law that would force merchants to hide cigarettes on sale in their stores. \\"Hide\\" in a literal sense. The legislation would mandate that any cigarettes sold in a store would have to be concealed in a drawer, or in a cabinet, or behind a curtain -- it would be unlawful for the packs of cigarettes to be visible to anyone visiting the store. Bloomberg's point is that the more difficult it is to purchase cigarettes, the fewer packs will be sold, and the healthier citizens will become. Bloomberg: Nanny-in-chief or health crusader? Bloomberg's proposal, and the case of the ghastly illustrations, both underline America's bizarrely bifurcated relationship with cigarettes:. The country -- smokers and nonsmokers alike --  realizes the dangers involved. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that around 443,000 people a year die because of cigarette use. But the product is as legal as a loaf of bread or a jar of pickles. So the cigarette manufacturers have a point when they say the government is overstepping by demanding nauseating images on their packages.  Free speech does not only refer to our right to say anything we choose; it also refers to our protection from having the government force us to say things against our will. Even convicted killers, when speaking in court before sentencing, are not required to say they are guilty. The government has a right to create, publish and broadcast the strongest anti-smoking campaigns it can come up with, but the cigarette companies make a compelling case in saying that, as long as their product is legal, they should not be forced to print repellent images on their packages. (And -- who knows? -- the federal government, in deciding not to fight the package illustrations battle in the Supreme Court, may be wary of what could happen there. What if the Supreme Court not only ruled against the proposed graphic illustrations -- but additionally, on similar grounds, opened up the question of whether the text-only warning messages on cigarette packs, the ones that have been there since the 1960s, also are an incursion on free speech?) In New York, Bloomberg's heart may be in the right place, but merchants who want to sell cigarettes should be justifiably puzzled: If any product is not legal, then they should be barred from stocking it, but as long as it is, how can anyone presume to tell them where to display it -- or, more to the point, that they can't display it? It all comes down to this:. While well-intentioned attempts to curb smoking may appear bold and decisive, they are in the end timid.  The big and most effective step -- outlawing cigarettes on the grounds that they undeniably, in the long run, sicken and kill the people who smoke them, and those around them -- is not going to happen. Politicians would be terrified to do it -- there are an estimated 45 million smokers in the United States, and no one is going to risk alienating them by completely cutting them off from cigarettes. In an already shaky economy, the repercussions from shutting down the tobacco industry -- the jobs suddenly lost -- would be, to put it mildly, highly problematic from a political and real-world standpoint. The memory of Prohibition would undoubtedly be on lawmakers' minds. The government once tried to take from people something they had been accustomed to, something that had been legal: alcohol. The outcome was anything but pretty. If there really were the political will to end cigarette use, there are ways. Each state sets its own laws for the minimum age to purchase cigarettes -- in most states, it's 18. If states decided to raise the age to, say, 80, that would do it. But the chances are zero. Like it or not, the country has painted itself into a corner. Cigarettes kill. They will continue to. If they were a new product, they'd never make it to market.  Don't bet against them still being here a century from now. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Cigarettes, although deadly, are a legal product manufactured and sold across the United States. This legal status creates a complex relationship between the government, tobacco companies, and public health initiatives. There are well-intentioned attempts to curb smoking, such as Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to hide cigarettes in stores and the FDA's now-abandoned plan to put graphic warning labels on cigarette packages, but they often encounter pushback from the tobacco industry citing their free speech rights. Despite the dangers of smoking and the alarming number of people who die annually due to cigarette use, a complete ban on cigarettes is highly unlikely. Lawmakers may be reluctant to anger the estimated 45 million smokers in the United States or contribute to job loss in the tobacco industry. Additionally, the messy aftermath of the Prohibition era serves as a cautionary tale. Cigarettes may be a harmful and potentially lethal product, but they are likely to persist in society for the foreseeable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter.

It is positioned in the middle to high end of the market, with the usual price range per head falling between £20-25, indicating that it recognizes and caters for customers looking to indulge in a fairly premium dining experience. However, it seems to yield a modest customer rating, securing only 3 out of 5 stars. This might imply that although its unique selling proposition - Japanese food in a coffee shop setting – is appreciated by many, there may be aspects of its service, food quality, or ambiance that leave room for improvement. It's also noteworthy that The Punter is not considered to be a family-friendly venue, suggesting that it is better suited for adult diners maybe focusing on providing a venue for casual meetings, solo diners, or people looking to relax, study or work. Its vicinity to Café Sicilia might mean that it aims to grab the attention of customers from an already established and perhaps similar venue, possibly encouraging a healthy local competition. This location could also offer some benefits in terms of driving footfall from potential customers who enjoy exploring different coffee shops and food experiences.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects swine intestinal cells causing enteric disease. Research has shown that the entry into these cells is through porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) receptor. To gain insights into mechanisms of PEDV-pAPN interactions, the present study aimed at identifying the domain that is critical for PEDV binding. To this end, NIH3T3 cell lines constitutively expressing pAPN or pAPN mutants were generated. The mutants were; domain VII deletion mutant and domains IV-VI deletion mutant. In the latter, domain VII was linked to the transmembrane segment through domain III. Results showed PEDV infection was restricted to pAPN and pAPN domain VII expressing NIH3T3 cells. Further, reducing PEDV titre 10 fold resulted in 37.8% decrease in foci indicating positive correlation. A time course test at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h showed that foci increased 6 fold in the overall time range. Also, PEDV harvested from pAPN or domain VII expressing NIH3T3 cells was induced indirect plaques in Vero cells confirming successful entry and replication. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PEDV recognizes pAPN and that the main interactive point is lodged within domain VII of the pAPN. These findings are important for therapeutic development as well as creating a platform for future studies on PEDV.

They were last seen departing from the remote Columbian town of Leticia which sits deep in the jungle on the border points between Brazil and Peru, to document the existence of cannibal tribes in the jungle. NYU's noted anthropologist Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) is assigned the task by the university to find out what happened to the conceited, and over-confident film crew.In the jungles of South America, a group of Columbian soldiers, led by a balding Negro lieutenant, are on patrol when they stumble upon a group of natives engaged in a spot of cannibalism; eating human remains. The soldiers attack and kill many natives while the rest flee. One fights back by shooting one soldier with a poison dart, hitting him in the arm before he is killed by the other soldiers. Despite the quick medical treatment, the soldier dies soon afterwards. The Columbian Lieutenant then meets with Professor Monroe who arrives by plane at the soldiers' outpost on the Amazon. The Lieutenant shows Monroe the captured native which they identify as a Yacumo, for to the soldiers, a Yacumo prisoner is like a ticket into the 'Green Inferno', the inhospitable jungle the South Americans call it.

Lee Ermey never smoked in his life.","output":"Based on the information provided about the film Body Snatchers (1993), we cannot infer that R. Lee Ermey never smoked in his life. The details supplied in the question are related to the movie and its cast members, rather than the personal life and health habits of R. Lee Ermey. However, looking into R. Lee Ermey's biography and personal details, we can investigate whether he was a smoker or not. R. Lee Ermey was an American actor known for his roles in military and law enforcement characters, such as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in the film Full Metal Jacket (1987). Before embarking on an acting career, Ermey served in the United States Marine Corps, where he rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant and later received an honorary promotion to Gunnery Sergeant. There is no concrete information available about R. Lee Ermey's smoking habits in published interviews or biographical sources. While there might be anecdotal stories or photos that may show him smoking, it would still be inappropriate to make definitive conclusions about his smoking habits based solely on such materials. In conclusion, we cannot infer that R. Lee Ermey never smoked in his life based on the information about his participation in the movie Body Snatchers (1993). However, there is a lack of concrete evidence to definitively prove his smoking habits. It is important to note that without proper sources, any claims made about R. Lee Ermey's personal life, including smoking habits, would be speculative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Peter Reid says the inaugural Indian Super League heralds a time for India to shed its ‘poor boy image’. The 58-year-old former England international midfielder is manager of Mumbai City who kick off the new season on October 12 against Atletico de Kolkata. Organisers hope this is the start of a new dawn in India with the launch of the high-profile ISL and the country hosting the Fifa U17 World Cup in 2017. Peter Reid meets his star player Nicolas Anelka ahead of the beginning of the Indian Super League. The former France international is mobbed by fans on his arrival to play for Mumbai City. The league has taken three years to get off the ground, and those involved hope it will help loosen cricket’s stranglehold on India’s sporting public. Similar to the steps taken by the USA’s NASL in the 1970s, the league will boast some big names, albeit ageing ones, from Europe, with Freddie Ljungberg, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, Alessandro del Piero, Mikael Silvestre and David Trezeguet among them. The league represents a huge investment with money coming from India’s booming businesses and Bollywood stars but the aim is to attract younger generations to participate and sustain the interest across the country. Reid said: ‘I feel this is the right time for football in India to shed its poor boy image. This is what happened in England when open terraces went and seating was forced on the teams. The rate of a ticket is high but, now, everything comes at a price. ‘The key message is that football can make everything attainable. We are working with the community too and encouraging their participation. I’m a big cricket fan and cricket is huge here but we want football to become another major part of their lives.’ World Cup winner Marco Materazzi has come to India as player-manager for Chennaiyin FC. Former Arsenal forward Robert Pires (R) is another superstar to join the inaugural ISL. R‘We went to watch a game the other day and there was real mixture of people in the crowd. All aspects of life and that’s what we want football to be about. It’s a game for the people and we want the people of India to embrace the sport and fall in love with the game,' he added. Reid has welcomed Anelka and Ljungberg to Mumbai over the past few days as excitement mounts for the season’s kick-off and he insists he aims to entertain but win. ‘I have a philosophy and I like to use the wingers. But I have to look at my players and play according to strength. If I have players who pass the ball, then we pass the ball. But in these conditions (heat and humidity), we need to adapt well, not pass the ball excessively. Anelka is looking to resurrect his career after leaving the Premier League under a cloud of controversy. Former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg rests during a training session ahead of the season's start. ‘We want to be able to adapt our style to win. I am not preparing anyone in Mumbai City to face Barcelona. However, what people forget about Barcelona is their pressing game, the way they get the ball back. If we can get that kind of shape at the back, I would be happy. ‘It’s a simple process, when you have the ball, keep it...when you don’t, try and get the ball.’ Talking to the Times of India, Reid added: ‘I am coming here to coach players I don’t know. Obviously I know Nickolas Anelka, I know Freddie Ljunberg, but the Indians, I am learning. ‘It is a new league, it’s exciting. The players are getting to know me.’ India icon Sachin Tendulkar added to the romance of the occasion  by bringing in former East Manchester FC player Duleep Menon to play for his franchise Kerala Blasters, who are coached by David James. Menon, 27, has been drafted in after impressing during a friendly playing for Central Excise against Blasters in Thrissur. Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has started his own franchise, Kerala Blasters, coached by David James. Ex-Liverpool playmaker Luis Garcis shakes hands with former cricket captain and Atletico De Kolkata co-owner Sourav Ganguly. Duleep, from Kochi, studied in England in 2011 and played for semi-pro side East Manchester who play in the Premier Division of the FBT Manchester Football League. ‘I was stunned to see Sachin at the hotel lobby in the morning,’ said Duleep. ‘I couldn’t say a word when he conveyed his best wishes to me and tears trickled down from my eyes. Sachin asked me to calm down. It feels like a dream.’ David James said: ‘He was superb against us in that practice game. Soon after the match I said that we could make use of this guy.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The inaugural Indian Super League (ISL) is set to kick off on October 12, with hopes that it will bring a new era of football to India.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Benjamin Todd Roethlisberger Sr. (; born March 2, 1982), nicknamed Big Ben, is an American football quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Miami University (Ohio), and was drafted by the Steelers in the first round (11th overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft. Roethlisberger earned the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award in 2004 and his first Pro Bowl selection in 2007. On October 26, 2014 against the Indianapolis Colts, Roethlisberger completed 40 of 49 passes for 522 yards and 6 touchdowns as the Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts 51-34. With the win, Roethlisberger became just the fourth quarterback in NFL history to get 100 wins in his first 150 starts. He also became the first NFL quarterback to pass for over 500 yards twice in a career. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Colts. In the next game, a 43-23 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, he had 340 passing yards and six passing touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second consecutive week.  In the Steelers Week 15 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, Roethlisberger completed 27 of 35 passes for 360 yards in a 27-20 victory. The victory made Roethlisberger only the sixth quarterback in NFL history to have defeated at least 31 different teams, joining Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Kerry Collins, Brett Favre, and Peyton Manning; like Brady, Roethlisberger has only played with one team and thus hasn't played against the Steelers. The Steelers lost 41-38 in Roethlisberger's only other matchup against Atlanta in 2006, and he was suspended for the Steelers 15-9 overtime victory against the Falcons in 2010.  During 2014, Roethlisberger passed for career highs in yards with 4,952, completion percentage with 67.1, completions with 408, and attempts with 608. Roethlisberger also matched his career high in passing touchdowns with 32, as well as posting a passer rating of 103.3, the second highest of his career. His 4,952 yards were tied for most on the season with Drew Brees, but Roethlisberger reached the mark with fewer completions.  The Steelers had a 11-5 record and finished first in the AFC North. They then lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs against the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 30-17. He was named to his third career Pro Bowl for the 2014 season. He was ranked 26th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015. anything else interesting in the article?","output":"In this article, it talks about a football player named Big Ben, who is a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. On October 26, 2014, Big Ben did something amazing against the Indianapolis Colts. He threw the football for 522 yards and his team scored 6 touchdowns! That day, he became the first person to throw for over 500 yards twice in his career and also one of the few quarterbacks to win 100 games in his first 150 starts.

Coming off their comeback win over the Chiefs, the undefeated Broncos traveled to Ford Field to face the winless Detroit Lions on Sunday Night Football. After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos grabbed the lead late in the second quarter, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. With 1:07 remaining before halftime, the Lions countered, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Joique Bell. It was initially ruled as a fumble, but after review, it was reversed to a touchdown as a result of Bell breaking the plane of the goal line. However, Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib blocked the extra point attempt by former Broncos (now Lions) placekicker Matt Prater, leaving the score at 7-6. In the closing seconds of the first half, the Broncos responded, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 4th-and-1. Following a questionable fumble by Thomas on the Broncos' opening possession of the second half, Lions' quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion attempt by Bell that would have tied the game. Each team alternated punts through the next five possessions, until Broncos' linebacker Shaquil Barrett forced a fumble off Stafford near midfield. However, the Broncos had to settle for a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus at the 7:55 mark of the fourth quarter. The Lions were attempting to grab their first lead of the game, however, on the eighth play of the drive, Stafford was intercepted by Broncos' safety David Bruton. Five plays later, the Broncos expanded their lead, with Manning throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels just before the two-minute warning to put the game out of reach. That was Daniels' first touchdown as a Bronco. Without any timeouts, the Lions advanced to as far as the Broncos' 15-yard line with 34 seconds remaining, but turned the football over on downs.

PUBLISHED:. 12:23 EST, 25 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:23 EST, 25 March 2013. Economic advisers to the German government more than halved their forecast for 2013 growth today, blaming a sharp fourth-quarter contraction and weak prospects for foreign trade and investment. The advisers, known in Germany as the 'wise men', predicted the economy would almost grind to a halt this year, growing just 0.3 per cent compared to 0.7 per cent in 2012. In October they had forecast Europe's largest economy to expand 0.8 per cent in 2013, but data has since shown that it shrank by 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2012. Economic advisers to the German government, housed in the Reichstag, more than halved their forecast for 2013 growth. Foreign trade, traditionally the main driver of German growth, would subtract 0.3 percentage points from German gross domestic product (GDP) this year, the advisers said. Demand for Germany's goods has weakened as austerity measures and recession take their toll on demand in other members of the euro zone, where Germany sends 40 per cent of its shipments. The advisers said investment was unlikely to make any significant contribution to growth in the first half of 2013. They see capital investment dropping by 3 per cent over the year, a slight improvement compared with 2012, when firms invested 4.8 per cent less in machinery and equipment. Some German companies are making cuts, with Air Berlin, the country's second biggest carrier, saying it would focus on savings this year. Retailer Metro has said it would reduce overall investment in the shortened 2013 year to below the 954 million euros it put into its business in the first nine months of 2012. The advisers said growth would primarily come from domestic demand, with private consumption increasing by 0.7 per cent and government spending rising by an upwardly revised 1.7 per cent. 'Especially household final consumption expenditure should continue to display a robust development, given that the labour market is still remarkably stable,' the advisers said in a statement. Germany's jobless rate is close to its lowest since the country reunited more than two decades ago and the number of Germans out of work fell in February. Air Berlin, the country's second biggest carrier, saying it would focus on savings this year. In addition, inflation is moderate, wages are rising and paltry interest rates are giving consumers little incentive to save. Data due out later this week is expected to bolster the advisers' expectations by showing that the number of unemployed Germans fell by 4,000 in March and consumer sentiment held steady heading into April. The influential Ifo survey last week showed German business morale fell in March, breaking a four-month run of gains and highlighting concerns the reignited debt crisis in the euro zone will test Germany's resilience. Consumer price inflation will ease to 1.7 per cent this year from 2.0 per cent last year and the unemployment rate will edge up to 6.9 per cent from 6.8 per cent, the advisers said, which is still near post-reunification lows. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

Assuming that:  The pupil automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed. A:","output":"To answer this question, we consider the main function of the pupil: to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye. When it is night time, the environment is darker, and there is less light available. In order to see better in the dark, the eye will need to capture as much light as possible. Step 1: Identify the environmental condition - It is night time, which means less light is available. Step 2: Determine the pupil's response to the condition - As there is less light, the pupil needs to get bigger, i.e., to dilate, so that it can let in more light for better vision. Step 3: Compare the night time condition to normal condition - In normal or daylight conditions, the pupil size is smaller because there is enough light available and the eye doesn't need to capture as much light.

Question: whose  family has left for the Appalachian Mountains and is caught in a traffic jam? Movie title: Deep Impact Movie plot: On May 10, 1998, teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman[5] discovers an unusual object near the stars Mizar and Alcor at a star party in Richmond, Virginia with his school's astronomy club. His teacher alerts astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car accident before he can alert the world. One year later, MSNBC journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of Secretary of the Treasury Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to \\"Ellie\\", supposedly a mistress. After interviewing Rittenhouse, she is intercepted by the FBI and brought before President Tom Beck. Lerner realizes that Ellie is not a mistress but an acronym: \\"E.L.E.\\", for \\"Extinction-Level Event\\". Due to Lerner's investigation, President Beck makes an announcement earlier than planned: the comet named Wolf-Biederman (named after Wolf and Biederman, mistakenly assuming Leo Biederman was killed along with Professor Wolf) is headed for Earth. It is 7 miles (11Â km) long, large enough to cause a mass extinction, and possibly wipe out humanity, if it hits the Earth. He also reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing an Orion spacecraft called Messiah in orbit in order to transport a team led by Oren Monash and including veteran astronaut Spurgeon Tanner to the comet, so that its path toward Earth may be diverted using nuclear weapons. After his name is mentioned on TV, Leo speaks to the town about the discovery and how the White House thought he died alongside Wolf. After landing on the comet, the crew members plant nuclear bombs beneath the surface, but are delayed and caught in out-gassing explosions when sunlight hits the comet surface. While fleeing to the space vehicle, Monash is blinded due to direct unfiltered sunlight and suffers severe facial burns, and Gus Partenza is lost, ejected from the surface by an outflow of gas. When the bombs detonate, the ship is damaged from the blast, and the team loses contact with Earth. President Beck...

Unfortunately, Jenny's mother, Robin Lerner, is not selected in the lottery, so they decide to leave for their family's cabin in the Appalachian Mountains to seek refuge together. The plot further unfolds as Jenny's father, who has remarried after the divorce, wants to bring his new family, including his wife and baby daughter, along with them. This family dynamic adds to the tension in the midst of the crisis, as they are all caught in a traffic jam trying to escape before the disastrous comet impact occurs.

These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us.

Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  Michael and Thomas are brothers whose careers have taken them to different cities. Michael lives in Beijing, where the levels of air pollution are fairly high due to the extensive manufacturing industry.

Help as much as you can. Question: I read this background article the other day: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  I am facing a new situation today: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training? Answer:","output":"The Blue group, which did weight training for 3 months, didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training when compared to the Brown group that ran 3 miles a day for three months. This is because running exercises, like the one performed by the Brown group, involve more cardiovascular activity, causing the cardiac muscle to contract faster and the heart to pump more blood.

Question: What does the pituitary gland cause? Context: Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met.

For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases.

Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth.

Context: In the Late Empire and Middle Ages Vergilius was spelled Virgilius. Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration. One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo (maiden in Latin) due to Virgil's excessive, maidenlike modesty. Alternatively, some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga (wand) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages (this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts, however, and was probably not widespread). In Norman schools (following the French practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence Virgil. In the 19th century, some Germantrained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil, as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling.[citation needed] Modern usage permits both, though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8thcentury grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus. Some postRenaissance writers liked to affect the sobriquet The Swan of Mantua.[citation needed] Answer","output":"The alteration of the spelling from Vergilius to Virgilius was not due to his excessive modesty or because of the magical or prophetic powers attributed to him, but was a result of the Norman schools' practice of anglicizing Latin names by dropping their Latin endings."},{"instruction":"Pick the most correct option to answer the following question.

The coach is responsible for developing strategies, tactics, and skill-building programs that will enable the team to perform at their best. They also serve as a motivator and leader, inspiring players to give their all and work together to achieve their goals. When selecting a coach, it's important to consider their experience, coaching philosophy, and ability to communicate effectively with both players and support staff. It's also crucial to find someone who is passionate about the sport and dedicated to helping the team succeed. In recent years, the US men's soccer team has struggled to find the right coach to lead them to victory. In 2017, Bruce Arena resigned following the team's failure to qualify for the World Cup, and his predecessor Jurgen Klinsmann faced similar criticism during his tenure. However, the hiring of Gregg Berhalter as head coach in December 2018 has shown promise for the team.
