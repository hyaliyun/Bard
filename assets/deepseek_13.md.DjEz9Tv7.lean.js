In the original sentence, the man is described as being on a dirt trail. This setting implies an outdoor location, and the presence of a dirt trail suggests a somewhat natural or undeveloped area. Furthermore, the man is described as kneeling to examine a plant, indicating that he is focused on an element of the natural world. The second sentence, \\"Man looking at nature,\\" is somewhat more concise and less specific than the first sentence; however, it still portrays the same core idea. \\"Nature\\" is a broad term that encompasses all elements of the natural world, including plants. Therefore, the man examining a plant can be seen as an action of looking at nature. While the second sentence does not provide the level of detail present in the original sentence, it accurately captures the overall theme of a man observing the natural world around him.

I read this background article the other day: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  I am facing a new situation today: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village made more money from sand mining? A:","output":"To answer the question \\"Which village made more money from sand mining?\\" let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. Background article information:    a. Sand mining has environmental consequences (erosion, impacts on wildlife, etc.)    b. Sand mining is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard. 2. New situation information:    a. Two coastal Canadian towns (Hammond and Soundville) started sand mining.    b. A few months later, Hammond stopped mining operations. Considering these facts, we can infer the following: 1. Both Hammond and Soundville engaged in sand mining, so they both generated revenue from it. 2. Hammond stopped mining operations after a few months, while it is not mentioned that Soundville stopped. Therefore, since Soundville continued its sand mining operations without stopping, it can be concluded that Soundville made more money from sand mining than Hammond. The correct answer is B: Soundville."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

The Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported a general hope that, owing to the imminent increase in traffic due to the transport of harvested crops, the firemen would be able to make daily round trips, thus avoiding layovers, and that the company could arrange for them to return home on passenger trains when this was not feasible.Keyser's reprinted response advised that the ten percent cut was \\"forced upon the company\\", but that he was confident they would be able to provide more full employment, and thus increase wages, due to an abundance of freight to be moved. He said that a system of passes would be arranged to address the issue of idle time caused by delays.

In the worst case  it can make one's mind go back and forget what one ought to say,  or to act. Actors, musicians, dancers, lawyers, even radio show hosts  have suffered from stage fright at one time or another.

Miss Nichols says some people have always been afraid to perform before the audience. Others, she says, develop stage fright after a fearful experience. She offers them ways to control the fear. One way is to smile before going onto the stage. Taking two deep breaths also helps. Deep breathing helps you get control of your body. Miss Nichols persuades her patients to tell themselves that their speech or performance does not have to the perfect. It's all right to make a mistake.

Jack, an unassuming middle-aged man, leads an ordinary life as a bartender at a local pub. One day, while flipping channels on his TV, he stumbles upon a breaking news broadcast about a highly dangerous criminal, Arthur Lundquist, wanted for multiple brutal murders across the state. The broadcast features an edited photograph of Lundquist; it looks familiar, bringing back memories of a past Jack swore to forget. Intrigued and unnerved, Jack starts researching Lundquist's criminal history further, only to discover that they share a mysterious past: they were once close friends during their involvement in a covert military operation. Act II: Ten years ago, Jack and Arthur were elite operatives in a secretive unit known as the jackals. They were trained in an experimental program to create enhanced soldiers, capable of executing high-stakes missions with unparalleled precision. However, the two had a falling out after an operation went wrong, resulting in numerous civilian casualties. Consequently, Arthur deserted the unit, while Jack chose to retire from the military, assuming a new identity to cut ties with his past. Haunted by the revelation, Jack decides to confront Arthur and uncover the truth behind his murderous spree. As he delves deeper into the investigation, he learns of Arthur's misguided quest for vengeance. Arthur blames the government and those involved with the Jackals program for exploiting them as mere weapons and destroying any semblance of humanity they possessed. Contrary to Arthur's belief that their enhanced abilities were the result of top-secret genetic manipulation, Jack discovers that they were secretly administered a mind-altering drug called \\"Xerum.\\" Unbeknownst to them, the drug was responsible for their heightened abilities. However, it came at a high price - the loss of inhibitions, increased aggression, and an insatiable desire for power. Act III: As Jack learns more about Arthur's motives, he becomes increasingly empathetic. He finds himself questioning his own past actions and the morality of the program they were a part of. Realizing that Arthur must be stopped before any more innocent lives are lost, Jack appeals to his former friend's sense of justice and humanity. He suggests that the true enemy is the government and the architects behind the Jackals program, not the innocent civilians. Their emotional confrontation is postponed by the sudden appearance of their former handler, General Ross, accompanied by a new team of Jackals, hell-bent on taking them both down. In a thrilling turn of events, Jack and Arthur join forces to combat their former brethren. Amidst their struggle, they succeed in exposing the truth behind the Jackals program, bringing those responsible to justice. Noticing that Arthur has been fatally wounded during the battle, Jack stays beside him, providing a compassionate presence as his former friend succumbs to his injuries. Witnessing the redemption and humanity that Arthur had been desperately seeking, Jack realizes that they have always had the power to overcome their dark pasts.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Steve Robson. PUBLISHED:. 09:48 EST, 21 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 03:37 EST, 22 March 2013. A drinker caught with a stun gun disguised as a mobile phone claims he stole it from a nightclub and only realised it was a weapon when it started 'crackling', a court heard today. David Thompson, 35, told Stonehaven Sheriff Court in Aberdeen he had swiped the modified mobile in the Adelphi area of the city centre and left immediately. But said when he pushed buttons to try can call his girlfriend the phone started 'crackling' and 'tingling'. Guilty: David Thompson, left, said he did not know the mobile phone was in fact a stun gun, right. Thompson, who appeared from custody at HM Aberdeen, was given a five year minimum jail term for possession of a firearm. He claimed three men approached him saying the stun gun belonged to them and asked to have it back. Police were then called after one of the men allegedly assaulted Thompson during the incident on November 21 last year. He was later charged with being in possession of a stun gun after the device was recovered at Grampian Police headquarters. Thompson admitted the offence when he appeared in court in February. He also admitted assaulting a constable by spitting at him on the same date and acting in a threatening manner towards officers at the police station. Sentencing: David Thompson, left, is facing a minimum of five years in prison for possession of the modified stun gun, right. Defence lawyer Gary Foulis argued that his client had not set out to get his hands on a stun gun which was disguised as a mobile phone. Defence lawyers for Thompson, pictured, had argued his case was 'out of the ordinary' He said that the device was not a barrelled weapon that fired bullets which could cause serious damage. The Firearms Act 2003 offence carries a minimum five year jail sentence unless the court decides there are exceptional circumstances. But Mr Foulis said a five year sentence would be 'disproportionate' given the circumstances of the case. He said: 'This is a scenario that is certainly out of the ordinary.' However, fiscal depute David Bernard argued there were no exceptional circumstances to the case and said Thompson could have handed the stun gun in. Sheriff Christopher Shead sentenced Thompson to five years in prison. Chief Inspector George MacDonald, from Grampian Police, said: 'Thankfully incidents of this type are rare within the city and I believe the sentence sends out a strong message to any individuals who concern themselves with weapons of any description. 'Through excellent joint working we have seen significant reductions in violence in Aberdeen city centre and across the city as a whole. 'However, we will continue to target the small number who choose to involve themselves  in violence, drugs, and anti-social behaviour and, as the public expect of us, lock the perpetrators up.' Police forces across the UK have seen a growing number of stun guns disguised as mobile phones on Britain's streets in recent years. Marketed in the U.S. as self-defence weapons, they can be bought online and delivered to the UK for as little as £9. Police fear as many as 10,000 could be out on the streets. One website MailOnline visited said: 'A cell phone stun gun will cause your attacker pain and leave them temporarily immobilized and disoriented, but cause them no permanent damage.' But such stun guns are classed as firearms under UK law and possession carries a minimum jail sentence of five years and maximum of up to ten years. There is also concern that potentially lethal weapons, some 20 times more powerful than the Taser guns used by police, can easily be brought into the UK. A Mail investigation in January uncovered a German website selling 1million volt stun guns which could be mail delivered into Britain with a free can of pepper spray. They are highly prized by members of the criminal underworld as an alternative to guns and knives. In the last three years the Met police force has seized 498 stun guns in London alone.

TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

Is Arsenal and Deloitte both list the match day revenue generated by the Emirates Stadium as £100.4m, more than any other football stadium in the world. a good answer to this question?","output":"The answer provided does not directly answer the question asked. The question is about the before-tax profit reported by Arsenal for the 2014-15 financial year, while the answer given focuses on the match day revenue generated by the Emirates Stadium during an unspecified period and its comparison to other football stadiums in the world according to Arsenal and Deloitte.  A more appropriate response to the original question could be: For the financial year 2014-15, Arsenal Football Club reported a before-tax profit of £24.7 million. This profit figure was achieved through a combination of revenues from different sources such as broadcasting rights, commercial deals, and matchday income. One of the major contributors to this profit was the matchday revenue generated by the Emirates Stadium, which amounted to £100.4 million during that period. This figure was the highest matchday revenue generated by any football stadium in the world, as reported by both Arsenal and Deloitte. As a result, the club's strong financial performance was not only due to its success on the pitch but also thanks to the revenue-generating capabilities of the Emirates Stadium. To better answer the original question regarding the before-tax profit for Arsenal in the 2014-15 season, it's essential to provide a breakdown of their revenue streams, as well as factors that may have contributed to their profitability. For example: 1. Broadcasting Rights: Arsenal received significant income from the domestic and international broadcasting of their matches, which included the English Premier League, Champions League, and other domestic cup competitions. 2. Commercial Deals: The club's commercial performance was boosted by lucrative sponsorship deals, such as their shirt and stadium sponsorships. Additionally, revenue from merchandise sales and other commercial ventures contributed to the overall income for 2014-15. 3. Matchday Income: As mentioned earlier, Arsenal's matchday revenue from the Emirates Stadium during the 2014-15 season was £100.4 million, the highest of any football stadium in the world. This revenue was generated from ticket sales, hospitality packages, premium seating, and other matchday-related activities. Factors that may have contributed to Arsenal's before-tax profit of £24.7 million in 2014-15 include the club's deep run in the domestic and European competitions, as well as accommodations made by the club to increase attendance through discounted ticket prices and a greater number of tickets available to members. Additionally, the overall growth in revenue from broadcasting and commercial deals contributed to the club's profitability. It is important to mention that the club's wage bill and other operating expenses would have had an impact on the overall profit figure.

Answer the following question: Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians...

Reynolds manages to kill both in a gunfight, but finds himself arrested for murder, convicted and sentenced to a desert prison known as Devil's Canyon. One of the prisoners there is a third Gorman brother, the ruthless Jesse, who intends to gain revenge for Reynolds having killed his kin.

Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840.

Matthew gave William guppies for their birthday, and","output":"William couldn't have been more excited. He had always been fascinated by aquatic life, but had never taken the plunge and started his own aquarium. This gift was the push he needed to delve deeper into his newfound hobby. William beamed with gratitude as he took the bag of guppies from Matthew and carefully placed it on the kitchen counter, knowing that this would be the beginning of a true labor of love. Having only ever owned a goldfish in their younger days, William knew he had a lot to learn about the intricacies of maintaining a thriving fish tank. Eager to get started and provide a proper home for the guppies, he reached out to the local aquatic aficionado, Mrs. Johnson, who was well-known in their town for her exquisite aquatic setups and glistening blue fish tanks. Soon enough, William found himself immersed in the colorful world of fishkeeping. Mrs. Johnson generously offered her wealth of knowledge, guiding him through the process of setting up the perfect environment for the guppies. They began with considering the best equipment, choosing a suitable tank, filter, heater, and lighting. Mrs. Johnson emphasized the importance of purchasing an aquarium that would be large enough to accommodate the guppies and other species William may decide to introduce down the line. Next came the topic of decorations and environment. Mrs. Johnson showed William around her impressive fish room as an example of the diverse range of plants, caves, rocks, and driftwood one could use to mimic the guppies' natural habitat. This was an aspect William found particularly appealing, as he was enjoying the opportunity to stretch his creative muscles. He began to obsess over design ideas, inspired by the lush underwater world he could create for these small, yet entrancing creatures. Once the tank had been beautifully designed and set up, with all the equipment properly installed, William learned that the water needed to be prepared before the guppies could be introduced. Mrs. Johnson explained the concept of cycling, a process to ensure that the bacteria and water chemistry in the tank had established a balance to support the guppies. Baffled by the complexity of this task, William couldn't help but feel grateful for Mrs. Johnson's guidance once more, as she helped him prepare the water with utmost care, making sure the guppies would thrive. During this time, William never stopped researching and learning. He wanted to ensure that he was providing the guppies with the best possible care, which included their diet. He discovered that guppies were omnivores and required a mix of plant and animal matter in their diet for optimal health. He went to great lengths to ensure he was providing them with high-quality food options, seeking out the prized aquarium stores in town to stock up on nutritious and varied options for their meals. Finally, the day arrived when the guppy's habitat reached equilibrium. It was ready for the introduction of the guppies. William eagerly transferred the guppies from their temporary home into the beautifully landscaped aquarium, breathlessly observing as they swam around the lush environment he lovingly created. Through a mix of determination, creativity, and the wise counsel of his mentor, William found himself wholly invested in the wellbeing of these small, vibrant creatures. Little did he know that this was just the beginning of his journey as an aquarist. As the days passed, William's interest blossomed, leading him to explore the vast world of aquatic creatures and the intricacies of providing a suitable home for each species. He began attending local aquarium clubs and trade shows, forming connections and friendships with others who shared his passion. Soon enough, his once empty home was alive with the sound of bubbling water and tanks brimming with a diverse collection of fish, each carefully selected to cohabit with the guppies that sparked his newfound love. William was now a bonafide aquarist, his life changed forever by that first thoughtful gift from Matthew."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the two major river systems fur traders arrived on to get to Manitoba?, using the article: Manitoba ( (listen)) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and is Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres (250,900 sq mi) with a widely varied landscape, stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the late 17th century, fur traders arrived on two major river systems, what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system. A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert's Land. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of Métis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province. Manitoba's capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada. Other census agglomerations in the province are Brandon, Steinbach, Portage la Prairie, and Thompson., what would be the answer ?

The Nelson River in northern Manitoba. 2. The Winnipeg River system in the southeast.

It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  - The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 6,054,191, and the census metropolitan area had a population of 5,583,064. The Greater Toronto Area is defined as the central city of Toronto, and the four regional municipalities that surround it: Durham, Halton, Peel, and York. The regional span of the Greater Toronto Area is sometimes combined with the city of Hamilton, Ontario and its surrounding region, to form the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The Greater Toronto Area is the northern part of the Golden Horseshoe.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.  - Yonge Street (\\"young\\") is a major arterial route connecting the shores of Lake Ontario in Toronto to Lake Simcoe, a gateway to the Upper Great Lakes. Until 1999, the \\"Guinness Book of World Records\\" repeated the popular misconception that it was long, and thus the longest street in the world; this was due to a mistaken conflation of Yonge Street with the rest of Ontario's Highway 11. Yonge Street (including the Bradford-to-Barrie extension) is actually 86 kilometres long. The construction of Yonge Street is designated an Event of National Historic Significance in Canada. Yonge Street was fundamental in the original planning and settlement of western Upper Canada in the 1790s, informing the basis of the concession roads in Ontario today. Once the southernmost leg of Highway 11, linking the capital with northern Ontario, Yonge Street has been referred to as \\"Main Street Ontario\\". Today, no section of Yonge Street is a provincial highway.  - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area.  - The Village of Lambton Mills was a settlement at the crossing of Dundas Street and the Humber River . The settlement was on both sides of the Humber River , in both the former Etobicoke Township and York Township , within today 's City of Toronto , Ontario , Canada . It extended as far west as Royal York Road at Dundas , as far north as the still - existing CPR rail line north of Dundas , as far east as Scarlett Road and as far south as today 's Queen Anne Road . The area on the east side of the river is still known as Lambton , although the current neighbourhood encompasses very little of the original Lambton Mills village .  - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region.  - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters.  - Royal York Road, historically known as Church Street or New Church Street, is a north-south arterial road in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a concession road, 5 concessions (10 km) west of Yonge Street, and runs through many residential neighbourhoods, most notably Mimico and the Kingsway. It is classified as a \\"minor arterial\\" road by the city of Toronto.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved.

To solve the equation 0 = 123*f + 692*f - 22820 for f, you first need to understand that all the terms involving f should stand on one side and the constant terms on the other side of the equation.  Here, all terms involving f are already on the same side. So we can start by combining like terms.  We have 123*f and 692*f as like terms so when we add those together we get: 0 = (123 + 692) * f - 22820 ==> 0 = 815 * f - 22820 (1) The next step is to move -22820 to the other side of the equation by adding 22820 to both sides. This yields: 22820 = 815 * f (2)  After that, you'll want to solve for f, the variable you're investigating. You do this by moving everything else—here, the coefficient 815—over to the other side of the equation. The equation 22820 = 815 * f is equivalent to:  f = 22820 / 815  Solving this using a calculator or doing the long division, you get: f = 28 So, by solving equation (1) then (2), we determined that if 0 = 123*f + 692*f - 22820, then f = 28."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We are trying to find what 'p' is. The original problem is -2*p = 5 + 9, right?  First, let's add up 5 and 9. That equals 14. So now, our problem is -2*p = 14. We want to get 'p' by itself. Since we are currently multiplying 'p' by -2, we can do the opposite, which is dividing, to cancel the -2 out. So, let's divide both sides of the equation by -2. When we divide 14 by -2, we get -7.

Capture the Pokemon Train your Pokemon","output":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Capture and Train Pokémon That Learn Dig Introduction Dig is a powerful Ground-type move famously known among Pokémon trainers for its unique two-turn mechanic: it makes the Pokémon using it burrow underground, avoiding most enemy moves, only to strike back at the opposition on the following turn. The utility of this move makes it a coveted addition to many trainers' teams. This article aims to guide you through identifying Pokémon in the game that can learn Dig, finding the best locations to capture them, and providing tips on training your newfound Pokémon companions. Step 1: Identifying Pokémon That Can Learn Dig First and foremost, it's crucial to know which Pokémon can learn this move. Through research, we have compiled a list of some Pokémon that can learn Dig naturally or by TM (Technical Machine) through various generations of the Pokémon series: 1. Sandshrew/Sandslash (Generation I) 2. Diglett/Dugtrio (Generation I) 3. Nidoran♀/Nidorina/Nidoqueen (Generation I) 4. Nidoran♂/Nidorino/Nidoking (Generation I) 5. Cubone/Marowak (Generation I) 6. Trapinch/Vibrava/Flygon (Generation III) 7. Gible/Gabite/Garchomp (Generation IV) Note that this is not an exhaustive list; there may be more Pokémon that can learn the move in certain games. Be sure to consult your game's specific Pokédex for a complete list of Pokémon that can use Dig in your journey. Step 2: Finding the Best Locations to Capture Dig-Learning Pokémon Now that we know which Pokémon can learn Dig, it's time to find out where they reside in the game. Every region in the world of Pokémon has unique habitats teeming with diverse Pokémon species. To ensure a successful encounter with Dig-learning Pokémon, we recommend visiting the following areas: 1. Sandshrew/Sandslash: Route 4 (between Pallet and Cerulean City) 2. Diglett/Dugtrio: Diglett's Cave (east of Vermilion City) 3. Nidoran♀/Nidorina/Nidoqueen and Nidoran♂/Nidorino/Nidoking: Route 3 (between Pewter and Cerulean City) 4. Cubone/Marowak: Pokémon Tower (Lavender Town) or Rock Tunnel 5. Trapinch/Vibrava/Flygon: Route 111 (Hoenn region), in the Desert area 6. Gible/Gabite/Garchomp: Wayward Cave (Sinnoh region, under Cycling Road) Keep in mind that game developers may alter these locations in future installments or remakes, so always consult in-game resources to confirm habitat locations. Step 3: Capturing the Pokémon Once you have encountered a Dig-learning Pokémon, it is essential to weaken it without accidentally fainting it in battle. Use moves that are not super effective against the target, and be cautious with your Pokémon's levels, as higher-level ones can deal significant damage. Utilizing status-inducing moves such as Sleep, Paralyze, or Confuse can improve your chances of capturing the desired Pokémon. Having a variety of Poké Balls on hand, such as Great Balls and Ultra Balls, will give you a better success rate in adding the Pokémon to your team. Step 4: Training Your Pokémon After successfully capturing your new Pokémon, it's time to train it to reach its full potential. Follow these key principles to optimize your Dig-using Pokémon's performance: 1. Level up: Engage in battles to gain experience points (XP) and increase your Pokémon's level. A higher-level Pokémon will perform better in battles, and some may even evolve to gain additional strength and learn new moves. 2. Prioritize Ground-type moves: Ensure your Pokémon has a balanced moveset. As a Ground-type move, Dig benefits from Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB); therefore, having additional Ground-type moves can help maximize your Pokémon's damage output. 3. Invest in stats: Utilize items and resources such as vitamins, Effort Values (EVs), and Individual Values (IVs) to boost your Pokémon's key stats, making them more formidable in battles. 4. Develop a strategy: Consider your Pokémon's strengths and weaknesses, and build a battle strategy around them. Properly utilizing moves and items can make the difference in challenging battles. Conclusion Capturing, training, and utilizing Pokémon that can learn Dig can yield significant advantages in your journey across the Pokémon world. By following this guide, you'll be better equipped to locate, capture, and groom these powerful creatures to excel in battles. Good luck, and happy hunting!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Harvard Law School is poised to abandon an 80-year-old shield based on the crest of a slaveholding family that helped endow the institution, as campuses across the country debate the use of historic names and symbols that some consider offensive.      On Friday, a law school committee said the shield did not represent Harvard values. It shows three sheaves of wheat, a symbol that is derived from the family crest of an 18th-century slave owner, Isaac Royall Jr., who endowed the first law professorship at Harvard, though the gift did not by itself create the law school. The image of the wheat appears under the word “Veritas,” or “Truth” in Latin, the Harvard motto.      “We believe that if the law school is to have an official symbol, it must more closely represent the values of the law school, which the current shield does not,” the committee wrote. Its recommendation was endorsed by the law school dean, Martha Minow, and is considered likely to be approved by Harvard’s corporation.      But it came with a passionate dissent from Annette Gordon-Reed, a professor of legal history who is known for her scholarship on Thomas Jefferson and his relationship with Sally Hemings, his slave. The work of Ms. Gordon-Reed, who had argued that historians had too readily discounted the oral testimony of Hemings’s descendants, was vindicated in 1998 by DNA evidence showing that a Jefferson fathered a child by Hemings. ||||| This article is over 2 years old      University committee rules shield donated by family that built wealth through slavery does not reflect institution’s values      Harvard law school will remove its official shield following months of protest at the symbol’s ties to an 18th-century slaveholder.

Harvard 'black tape' vandalism brings law school's controversial past to fore Read more            “We believe that if the law school is to have an official symbol, it must more closely represent the values of the law school, which the current shield does not,” the panel, made up of professors, alumni, students and staff, wrote in its recommendation.      The school has sent its decision to the university’s governing body, the Harvard corporation, asking for the emblem to stop being used as its official shield. It was not immediately clear when the corporation would take up the issue.      The shield’s meaning has changed over time, said Bruce Mann, committee chairman and Harvard law professor.      “Too many people think the shield has become an impediment,” he said. “Too many people see the association with slavery.”      The committee’s 10-2 recommendation was backed by Dean Martha Minow.      “I endorse the recommendation to retire the shield because its association with slavery does not represent the values and aspirations of the Harvard law school and because it has become a source of division rather than commonality in our community,” she wrote to students and alumni.      The shield, officially adopted in 1937, depicts three bundles of wheat, an image borrowed from the family crest of Isaac Royall Jr, under the university’s motto “Veritas”.

His father, Isaac Royall Sr, made much of the family wealth on the backs of slaves on Caribbean sugar plantations and Massachusetts farms.      Minow created the committee after some law school students formed a group called Royall Must Fall to denounce the shield.      “We definitely consider this a victory that represents our tireless advocacy,” said AJ Clayborne, a third-year Harvard law student and member of Royall Must Fall, adding that the group was also dedicated to fighting other racial injustices at the school.      Not everyone agreed with the recommendation. One professor on the committee, joined by a student, said keeping the shield was a way to honor the slaves whose sacrifice provided the Royall family with its wealth.      They said the shield should be tied “to a historically sound interpretative narrative about it” and suggested adding the word “Iustitia” (justice in Latin) below the word “Veritas”.      The move to drop the shield came after Harvard University announced it would change the centuries-old title “house master”, used to describe the Ivy League’s residential administrators, to the term “faculty dean”.      There were waves of protests in late 2015 across several US college campuses, including Yale and Princeton, where students rallied against what they saw as institutional racism. Activists claimed the title “house master” was inappropriate and conjured a connection to slavery.      Associated Press contributed to this report ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In response to months of protests, Harvard Law School has decided to change its official shield due to its connections to an 18th-century slaveholder. The shield contained three bundles of wheat, a symbol derived from the family crest of Isaac Royall Jr., who was a slave owner that endowed the first law professorship at Harvard. The shield was adopted in 1937 and features the word \\"Veritas,\\" which is Latin for \\"Truth\\" and serves as the university's motto. A committee at the prestigious university argued that the shield does not represent the values of the law school and has called for the creation of a new shield that better reflects those values."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Losman were unstoppable in the first quarter, connecting for 205 yards and two 83-yard touchdowns. Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win.","output":"What were WR Lee Evans and QB J. P.

A:","output":"The best answer considering the given choices and the fact that the looseness of the soil has a positive impact on a plant's roots growth, development, and expansion would be \\"loose soil.\\" Loose soil provides better aeration and drainage, enabling plant roots to grow and expand more efficiently. This soil structure allows roots to penetrate more deeply and spread out, accessing crucial water and nutrients to support overall plant growth. Moreover, it prevents water-logging and helps maintain a proper balance of water and air in the soil, which is essential for robust plant growth. Out of the other options: - Support: This term is vague and doesn't specifically describe any particular soil type conducive to plant growth. - Soft soil: While soft soil might generally be easier for roots to develop in, it doesn't necessarily guarantee optimal growth. - Clay soil: Clay soil tends to be dense and heavy, limiting root growth and drainage capacity. Improper drainage can lead to root rot and negatively affect plant health. - No soil: Plants generally need soil to grow, as it provides anchorage, water, and nutrients. Some plants can grow in alternative mediums like water or air, but this option isn't applicable to most plants. - Nutrients: Nutrients are necessary for plant growth, but the term doesn't explicitly refer to a suitable soil type. - Alluvial: Alluvial soil is found in river deltas and flood plains. It is rich in nutrients due to regular flooding, which makes it highly fertile. However, it doesn't necessarily mean it's always loose enough for optimal root growth. - Sandy soil: Sandy soil tends to drain water very quickly, which can lead to poor water retention and difficulty supporting plant growth. In conclusion, \\"loose soil\\" is the best answer based on the given information and conditions for optimal plant root growth and development. However, it is essential to note that the specific type of soil best suited for plants may vary depending on the plant species, as they have varying preferences concerning soil composition and moisture levels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? Answer:","output":"Fresh skin cells will be ready for treatment after cleansing the skin with a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This process removes dirt, oil, and the top layer of dead skin cells, revealing the fresh skin cells underneath that can then be treated effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He spoke at the end of a first day of operations in almost two weeks for the country's crisis-hit banks. Earlier, the president praised Cypriots who queued in orderly fashion for cash. Nicos Anastasiades hailed the country's \\"maturity and responsibility\\" on a day that saw many wait to access their cash. Clouds of uncertainty over island Why does Cyprus need capital controls? In pictures: Cypriot banks reopen The government has appointed three former supreme court judges to investigate possible criminal activity in the crisis. The tight capital controls were put in place after a 10bn-euro bailout deal was agreed with the EU and IMF. Withdrawals over 300 euros are banned, and there are limits on moving money. Branches were replenished with cash overnight and police were deployed amid fears of a run on the banks. Some queues did form but the mood was generally calm. Branches began to open at noon local time (10:00 GMT) and closed at 18:00 (16:00 GMT). Some did not open on time, causing tension among customers. The longer queues formed outside branches of Laiki, which is being wound up. Some armed police were deployed in cities and hundreds of staff from the private security firm G4S are guarding bank branches and helping to transport money. One customer in a queue in Nicosia told the BBC's Tim Willcox he was withdrawing the allowed daily amount of 300 euros (383; Â£253) but would take out all of his money if he could. Our correspondent says the predictions of a stampede did not materialise and in some places there were more journalists than depositors. Another customer, jewellery shop owner, Roula Spyrou, told AFP news agency: \\"There's going to be queues so I'm not going to spend so many hours there to get 300 euros.\\" Cyprus is the first eurozone member country to bring in capital controls. Cyprus needs to raise 5.8bn euros (7.4bn; Â£4.9bn) to qualify for a 10bn-euro bailout from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the so-called troika. As part of the bailout plan, depositors with more than 100,000 euros will see some of their savings exchanged for bank shares. An earlier plan to tax small depositors was vetoed by the Cypriot parliament last week. As it became clear that calm was being maintained, President Nicos Anastasiades tweeted his gratitude. \\"I would like to thank the Cypriot people for their maturity and collectedness shown in their interactions with the Cypriot Banks,\\" he wrote. Officials later confirmed that the president would take a 25% pay cut, with cabinet ministers accepting a 20% pay cut. The stock exchange, shut since 16 March, remained closed on Thursday and will not reopen until after Easter. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the ministry of finance insisted the capital control measures were temporary and were needed to \\"safeguard the stability of the system\\". They would be reviewed each day, the ministry said. But Mr Kasoulides, the foreign minister, appeared to contradict this in remarks to reporters on Thursday. \\"A number of restrictions will be lifted and gradually, probably over a period of about a month according to the estimates of the central bank, the restrictions will be fully lifted,\\" Reuters quoted him as saying. The severe new rules have been imposed to prevent a torrent of money leaving the island and credit institutions collapsing. As well as the daily withdrawal limit, Cypriots may not cash cheques. Payments and/or transfers outside Cyprus via debit and or credit cards are allowed up to 5,000 euros per person per month. Transactions of 5,000-200,000 euros will be reviewed by a specially established committee, with applications for those over 200,000 euros needing individual approval. Travellers leaving the country will only be allowed to take 1,000 euros with them. Many economists predict the controls could be in place for months. The unprecedented restrictions represent a profound breach of an important principle of the European Union, says the BBC's economics correspondent Andrew Walker. That principle holds that capital, as well as people and trade, should able be to move freely across internal borders, he says. However, the European Commission said member states could introduce capital controls \\"in certain circumstances and under strict conditions on grounds of public policy or public security\\". But it added that \\"the free movement of capital should be reinstated as soon as possible\\". One employee of the Bank of Cyprus told the BBC that everybody's jobs were at risk. \\"If the Bank of Cyprus collapses, all the small business, the large businesses, everything collapses. They cannot buy anything, import anything, export anything. There is nothing,\\" she said. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about banks in Cyprus reopening after being closed for nearly two weeks due to a financial crisis. The government agreed to a 10 billion euro bailout deal with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF). As a result, they placed capital controls to prevent people from taking out too much money, which would hurt the banks even more. People in Cyprus were able to withdraw up to 300 euros and had limits on moving money. Some people had to wait in long lines, but the overall situation was more calm than expected.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device The club aims to have the rail seats fitted and in use, in a section of one stand, before the end of 2017-18. Shrewsbury's Greenhous Meadow is 10 years old so is not governed by the all-seater stadiums legislation which permits clubs in Leagues One and Two to keep terraces that existed before 1994. Standing has been banned in England's top two divisions since then. That law change followed recommendations made in the Taylor Report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Last November, Hillsborough Support Group secretary Sue Roberts told BBC Sport it would be a \\"backwards step\\" to bring back standing. Earlier this month, West Bromwich Albion said they were willing to use The Hawthorns as part of the pilot scheme for safe standing - though a change in the law would be needed before that could come to fruition. Celtic opened a 2,900-capacity section last year after the Scottish champions were granted a safe-standing licence by Glasgow City Council. Brian Caldwell, Shrewsbury Town's chief executive, says the move at Celtic has improved the atmosphere and he expects the same for his club. \\"More people are encouraged to sing and get behind the team but also it's a safer environment as well,\\" he told BBC Sport. \\"Our safety officer has been up to Celtic to see it in action and was very, very pleased with how safe and secure it was.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device The club, which finished 20th in League One in the 2016-17 season, hopes to raise the £50-75,000 required to finance the project through a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign will be run jointly by the Shrewsbury Town Supporters' Parliament, who first approached the club with the proposal, and the Football Supporters' Federation. They will invite donations from fans and the public in return for 'rewards' from the club. Mike Davis, from the Supporters' Parliament, says it will help Shrewsbury Town compete with other sides in League One. \\"The issue we tend to have is when we come up against the big clubs - the Sheffield Uniteds, the Boltons - who bring huge away crowds, we get drowned out a little bit,\\" he said. \\"So the hope is that bringing our vocal support behind the stand will improve that. \\"Some of our fans already stand but they want an area where they can do that safely and also we want to be able to improve the atmosphere within the ground.\\" The application has been put to the Sports Ground Safety Authority and Shrewsbury say they hope to find out the outcome in a matter of weeks, rather than months. The club's initial aim is to raise sufficient funds to purchase and install around 400 rail seats but if the target is missed, a smaller safe standing area will be created. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Shrewsbury Town Football Club aims to introduce rail seats for safe standing at its Greenhous Meadow stadium by the end of the 2017-18 season. Being just 10 years old, the stadium is not restricted by all-seater regulations that date back to 1994 in Leagues One and Two. The club hopes a crowdfunding campaign will help raise between £50,000 and £75,000 to finance the project, which is being run in conjunction with the Shrewsbury Town Supporters' Parliament and the Football Supporters' Federation.

Hypothesis: Naomi Wolf demanded a large sum of money for her advice. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis that Naomi Wolf demanded a large sum of money for her advice is not explicitly entailed by the premise. The premise states that Al Gore paid Naomi Wolf a significant amount of money for advice he could have presumably received for free. However, there could be several reasons for this payment, and the hypothesis represents only one possibility. There are a few factors that need to be examined to understand why Al Gore paid Naomi Wolf for her advice, even if he could have potentially obtained such advice for free. The following factors can shed light on this issue: 1. Expertise and Reputation: Naomi Wolf is a well-known political consultant, author, and feminist activist. Her expertise and reputation in the field of politics could have been a factor in Al Gore's decision to hire her. He may have felt that her guidance would be valuable and beneficial to his campaign or initiative. 2. Exclusive Access: While it is true that some advice can be obtained for free, it is important to remember that Naomi Wolf's time and expertise are in demand. As a result, she might charge a fee for her services to manage her availability and prioritize clients willing to pay for exclusive access to her advice. 3. Confidentiality and Trust: Paying Naomi Wolf for her advice guarantees a certain level of confidentiality between both parties. This arrangement provides a sense of trust, ensuring that the advice provided remains exclusive and tailored to Al Gore's needs. 4. Perceived Value: Sometimes, the perceived value of advice is higher when there is a cost associated with it. In certain situations, people may assume that paying for advice demonstrates investment and commitment to following or acting upon it. This notion could be another reason why Al Gore chose to pay for Naomi Wolf's insights. While the hypothesis that Naomi Wolf demanded a large sum of money for her advice is one plausible explanation, it does not automatically follow from the premise. Other factors, such as expertise and reputation, exclusive access, confidentiality and trust, and perceived value, should also be taken into account to better understand the rationale behind Al Gore’s decision to pay Naomi Wolf for her advice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Emmylou Harris (born April 2, 1947) is an American singer and songwriter.

It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content.  - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.  - The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Max Wertheimer, one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, defined this phenomenon in 1912. The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision together formed the foundation of Hugo Münsterberg's theory of film and are part of the process of motion perception.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Poco is a Southern California country rock band originally formed by Richie Furay, Jim Messina and Rusty Young. Formed following the demise of Buffalo Springfield in 1968, Poco was part of the first wave of the West Coast country rock genre. The title of their first album, \\"Pickin' Up the Pieces\\", is a reference to the break-up of Buffalo Springfield. Throughout the years Poco has performed in various groupings, and is still active.  - Men in Black II (MIIB) is a 2002 American science fiction action comedy film starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The film also stars Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Tony Shalhoub and Rip Torn. The film is a sequel to the 1997 film \\"Men in Black\\" and was followed by \\"Men in Black 3\\", released in 2012. This series of films is based on the Malibu / Marvel comic book series \\"The Men in Black\\" by Lowell Cunningham. A video game partly based on the film was released in 2002 titled \\"\\".  - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.  - Married... with Children is an American television live-action sitcom that aired on Fox, created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt. Originally broadcast from April 5, 1987 to June 9, 1997, it is the longest-lasting live-action sitcom on Fox, and the first to be broadcast in the network's primetime programming slot.  - Country rock is subgenre of popular music, formed from the fusion of rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock.  - The Byrds were an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) remaining the sole consistent member, until the group disbanded in 1973. Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Rolling Stones for a short period in late 1965, the Byrds are today considered by critics to be one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Initially, they pioneered the musical genre of folk rock, melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music. As the 1960s progressed, the band was also influential in originating psychedelic rock, raga rock, and country rock.  - George Harrison, (25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - David Caffrey is an Irish film director . His most recent film is Grand Theft Parsons starring Johnny Knoxville and Christina Applegate . The film is an account of an urban myth about the death of country rock legend , Gram Parsons .  - Ingram Cecil Connor III (November 5, 1946  September 19, 1973), known professionally as Gram Parsons, was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist. Parsons is best known for his work within the country music genre; he also popularized what he called \\"Cosmic American Music\\", a hybrid of country, rhythm and blues, soul, folk, and rock. Besides recording as a solo artist, he played with the International Submarine Band, The Byrds, and The Flying Burrito Brothers. His relatively short career is described by AllMusic as \\"enormously influential\\" for country and rock, \\"blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.\\"  - Creedence Clearwater Revival, often informally abbreviated to Creedence or CCR, was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed the roots rock, swamp rock, and blues rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they played in a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War. The band performed at 1969's famed Woodstock Festival.  - Pure Prairie League is an American country rock band whose roots go back to 1965 and Waverly, Ohio, with Craig Fuller, Tom McGrail, Jim Caughlan, and John David Call. In 1970 McGrail named the band after a fictional 19th century temperance union featured in the 1939 Errol Flynn cowboy film \\"Dodge City\\". The band had five consecutive Top 40 LPs in the 1970s and added a sixth in the 1980s. The band has had a long run, active from the 1970s through the late 1980s and was revived in the late 1990s for a time, then again in 2004. As of 2016, they are still doing at least 100 shows a year.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - The Flying Burrito Brothers was an American country rock band, best known for their influential 1969 debut album, \\"The Gilded Palace of Sin\\". Although the group is perhaps best known for its connection to band founders Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman, the group underwent many personnel changes and has existed in various incarnations, currently known as \\"The Burrito Brothers\\".

(Associated Press)      Lanford Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright who championed outsiders, the forgotten and overlooked in such plays as \\"The Hot L Baltimore,\\" \\"Burn This,\\" \\"Fifth of July\\" and \\"Talley's Folly,\\" has died. He was 73.      The Steppenwolf Theatre said Thursday that Wilson died Wednesday at a long term acute care facility in New Jersey. The playwright, who had been a resident of New York's Sag Harbor, died on the eve of the Chicago company's first preview production of a new staging of his \\"Hot L Baltimore.\\"      \\"His tremendous spirit is with us in the theater and tonight's show will be in his memory and honor,\\" Tina Landau, the director of the production, said Thursday.      Wilson was one of four founders of The Circle Repertory Company in New York, an incubator of important off-Broadway works. He was nominated for Tony Awards for \\"Angels Fall\\" \\"Talley's Folly\\" and \\"Fifth of July.\\"      He won the Pulitzer for drama in 1980 for \\"Talley's Folly,\\" the second in a trilogy of plays that follows the Talley family of Lebanon, Missouri, over several generations. Wilson himself was born in Lebanon, Mo, and frequently collaborated with director Marshall Mason, whom he met at a cafe in New York's Greenwich Village.      He wrote some 17 full-length plays and more than 30 one-acts, creating gently lyrical works that look back at a lost past. His settings were both rural and urban _ his first full-length play, \\"Balm in Gilead,\\" was a free-wheeling look at New York City lowlife in the early '60s.      \\"Talley's Folly\\" told the story of a middle-age romance, \\"Burn This,\\" focused on a group of grieving friends and \\"The Hot l Baltimore\\" took a look at residents of a seedy residential hotel.      Wilson's other plays include \\"The Mound Builders,\\" \\"The Madness of Lady Bright\\" and \\"The Rimers of Eldritch.\\" He also supplied the librettos for several operas, including \\"Summer and Smoke\\" and \\"This is the Rill Speaking.\\"      \\"Lanford was a singular voice in the American theatre_an important artist, a gentle soul and a good friend,\\" said Steppenwolf co-Founder Terry Kinney. \\"We will miss him sorely.\\" ||||| “Fifth of July,” a comedy that explores the disillusionment of the Vietnam era, came to Broadway in November of 1980. The production, which starred Christopher Reeve as Kenneth Talley Jr., a gay, paraplegic Vietnam veteran, ran for 511 performances at the New Apollo Theater; it also starred Jeff Daniels and Swoosie Kurtz.      Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote: “Mr. Wilson has poured the full bounty of his gifts into this work, and they are the gifts of a major playwright. ‘Fifth of July’ is a densely packed yet buoyant outpouring of empathy, poetry and humor, all shaped into a remarkable vision.”      Mr. Wilson’s other Broadway plays include “Burn This” (1987), “Angels Fall” (1983) and “Redwood Curtain” (1993).      His Off Broadway work included “The Hot l Baltimore,” about the denizens of a down-at-the-heels residential hotel. The play was the basis of a short-lived television sitcom of the same name, broadcast on ABC in 1975.      With Mr. Mason, Tanya Berezin and Rob Thirkield, Mr. Wilson founded the Circle Repertory Company, a highly regarded collective of actors, directors, playwrights and others known for its collaborative approach.      Established in 1969 on the Upper West Side as the Circle Theater Company, it later moved to the Sheridan Square Playhouse in Greenwich Village. The company ceased operations in 1996.      Besides producing work by Mr. Wilson, Circle Rep produced plays by Jules Feiffer, Sam Shepard, Larry Kramer and others. Actors associated with the company include William Hurt, Kathy Bates, Barnard Hughes, Cherry Jones and Cynthia Nixon.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Stylistically, the distinguishing hallmark of Mr. Wilson’s work was his dialogue — authentic, gritty, often overlapping — be it the speech of his native Missouri or adopted New York. To audiences, his approach gave the experience of eavesdropping on real, bustling people in real, bustling time. (As a young playwright honing his craft, he later explained, he would set himself exercises like writing down the overheard speech of five people talking at once.)      Thematically, his work concerned dissolutions large and small: the rupture of societies, families and individual marriages; the loss of life, love, companionship and sanity.      Photo      His characters, drawn true to life if sometimes larger, tended toward the socially marginalized, perhaps no surprise for a man whose identity — Ozark, somewhat rootless, a child of a broken home, gay at a time when it was taboo to be gay — no doubt made him feel pushed to the margins of mainstream culture himself. (Mr. Wilson was noted for being one of the first mainstream playwrights to create central, meaningful gay and lesbian characters.)      Ragtag collections of prostitutes and pimps, drug addicts and sundry urban nighthawks, the people who populate his plays were unusual theatrical subjects in their day, but were no less sympathetic for that. In many respects, as he made clear in interviews, Mr. Wilson saw his work as the counterpart to the New Realism of post-1960 visual art, in which artists created works that were amalgams of images, often fragmentary, observed in the world around them and ripe for the taking.      As he also made clear, the subject matter of many of his plays was drawn from his own life.      Lanford Eugene Wilson was born in Lebanon on April 13, 1937; his parents divorced when he was a young child. He moved with his mother to Springfield, Mo., and, after she remarried a farmer, to Ozark, Mo.

Their reunion — not a happy one, though their relationship fared better in later years — became the basis of “Lemon Sky.”      That play, first performed in 1970 at the Studio Arena Theater in Buffalo, opened Off Broadway that year at the Playhouse Theater on West 48th Street, and was revived in 1985 at the Second Stage Theater. It was later adapted as a television movie, first broadcast in 1988 and starring Kevin Bacon as the youth who attempts to bond with his estranged father.      In San Diego, the young Mr. Wilson worked at a desultory job in an aircraft plant and took classes at what was then San Diego State College. It was there, in a writing class, that he discovered dialogue and determined to become a writer of short stories.      In the late 1950s, Mr. Wilson moved to Chicago, where he worked as a commercial artist in an advertising agency and took extension classes at the University of Chicago. He wrote a sheaf of short stories that were rejected by all the magazines to which he sent them, and made his first tentative stabs at writing plays.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Wilson settled in New York in 1962. There, as the reference work Current Biography wrote in 1979, he “saw and disliked every play on Broadway.”      He found the ersatz environment of Off Off Broadway, with its theater spaces shoehorned into coffeehouses and church basements, far more congenial. His first produced play, a one-act called “So Long at the Fair,” was staged at Caffe Cino, in the Village, in 1963. It concerned a young man, newly arrived in New York, and the young woman who hopes to seduce him.      Reviewing the play, The Village Voice praised the “exactness and inner logic” of the dialogue. Over the years to come, Mr. Wilson’s facility for dialogue proved both a great strength and an occasional weakness: critics sometimes took him to task for neglecting other aspects of dramatic construction, like tight plotting, in favor of the rush of pure spoken language.      In 1965, Mr. Wilson attracted attention with “The Madness of Lady Bright,” also at Caffe Cino. Its protagonist, Leslie Bright, is a middle-aged gay man confronting a wistful past, a lonely present and an uncertain future.      He garnered still wider attention for his first full-length play, “Balm in Gilead,” also staged in 1965, at La MaMa. The play, about low-life characters converging in the New York nightscape, was so successful that Ellen Stewart, La MaMa’s founder, had to stand on the sidewalk each night and beseech an eager fire marshal not to close the theater, packed to capacity.      His first play to come to Broadway was “The Gingham Dog,” about the dissolution of an interracial marriage. It ran for just 19 performances in 1969.      Mr. Wilson was single at the time of his death. Survivors include two half-brothers, John and Jim, and a stepsister, Judy.      In an interview quoted in The Times in 2002, Mr. Wilson expounded on his realist, quasidocumentary approach: “I want people to see — and to read — my plays and to say: ‘This is what it was like living in that place at that time. People haven’t changed a damn bit. We can recognize everyone.’ ” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Lanford Wilson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, passed away at the age of 73.

Definition: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input: By Marcus LiddellBBC News With so many other sights to see in Britain, the fascination with a man-made, manicured shopping centre on the outskirts of Bicester is somewhat baffling to those closer to home. But for Chinese visitors to the UK - more than half of whom shop at Bicester Village, according to the outlet - a walk through its Scandi-inspired high streets is an unmissable part of the trip. Tracey Xiau, a student at Birmingham University, has stopped off on her way to London. It's her second visit to the site, which has savings on high-end brands such as Burberry, Gucci and Armani. Through the help of a translator, she explains \\"it is very famous for Chinese people\\" - especially with Chinese women who like shopping. \\"The discounts are very nice and the product has a good brand, that's why I come here,\\" she adds. The appeal is obvious to a large extent. \\"We can buy discounted items... [it is] cheaper than high street stores,\\" say Mo Zhou and Leon Yue, a well-dressed couple from Beijing who have already snapped up a pair of designer sunglasses. For Yining Lu and Huang Xin, they want to take advantage of being able to claim back the 20% VAT available to non-EU visitors. \\"The tax is higher in China so we need to buy it in Bicester,\\" says Ms Lu, who has been planning her trip for two months. Mr Xin wants to \\"buy, buy, buy, buy\\". Asked whether it was cheaper than in China, she replies: \\"Yes, of course. I want to get tax free.\\" Bicester Village was established in 1995 by American Scott Malkin on the edge of what he then described as \\"a garrison town best known for Friday night fighting and take-out food.\\" Chinese citizens have only recently become regular travellers to the UK and since the mid-2000s, Bicester has taken advantage, working with Chinese tour operators. Today, it is the only outlet in the UK visited en masse by Chinese tourists and it scores highly in almost all of the country's online tourist forums, where it is described as a \\"must-go place for visitors to London\\". You might also be interested in: Five ways China's past has shaped its present China deters jaywalkers with water spray at crossing - BBC News The undying Asian gay icon in red high heels The Village also features on social media channels such as Weibo and WeChat, where posts and comments - mostly of shoppers showing off their purchases - are shared every day. Owner Value Retail is surely reaping the benefits of its marketing plan, though it declined to comment. However, it estimates it had 6.6m visitors last year, a similar figure to Visit Britain's figures for the British Museum. Its high footfall is perhaps helped by the outlet's proximity to the M40, which means coach groups can travel on to London, or Oxford and its surrounding villages, where tourists were spotted peering into people's gardens. But more so perhaps because it capitalised on being in the \\"right place at the right time\\" with the \\"right product for the right people\\", says Kegang Wu, a former adviser on China to the British Chamber of Commerce. \\"Chinese tourists are relatively new, with their new-found money and new-found wealth,\\" he says. \\"The gift-giving culture of the Chinese tradition also means if they buy something they buy expensive stuff, differently to UK tourists who go abroad for a good time.\\" He says the Chinese traditionally like to buy presents or gifts for friends or relatives. And, he adds, they also like a good deal. \\"They're good businesspeople, they like a discount.\\" Bicester Village employs 150 Mandarin speakers on site, while at its railway station - and even 60 miles away in London Marylebone - announcements for Chiltern Railways services are made in English and Mandarin. Leon Yue, from Beijing, speaks no English and was surprised to find Chinese-speaking staff at the site. She tells the translator she is buying presents for her mum after hearing about the outlet through \\"word of mouth\\". \\"When they come here they find it very surprising to see lots of Chinese sales staff in the shops and they have received lots of welcoming, nice words from the staff, so they feel very special experience from coming today,\\" the translator explains on her behalf. \\"The Chinese staff make the shopping experience more convenient.\\" But the outlet has challenges ahead if it is to sustain its success, says Dr Wolfgang Georg Arlt, from the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute. He says travel trends, particularly around shopping, are changing as more of the country's citizens start going abroad and it becomes less of a novelty. There is no need to buy for five others, he says, if they are travelling soon as well. \\"If everybody has a Gucci bag, and you tell them 'Oh, I bought a new Gucci bag'... they're not so impressed.\\" He believes to continue attracting the wealthiest Chinese tourists, the outlet must keep evolving to offer more of \\"an experience\\". \\"These kinds of people will still come to Bicester,\\" he said. \\"But you will have to give them a story to tell to their friends, that they didn't just go for discounts.\\" Additional reporting by BBC Chinese.

News article: The \\"FMMR\\" traders and CNBC's Steve Liesman discuss how the weak May jobs data will affect the markets and the Fed's rate hike timetable.      All that hawkish Fed talk in recent weeks, as well as the market's knee-jerk reaction, seemed kind of silly after Friday's dismal jobs report.      Expectations for a summer rate hike fell into a sinkhole Friday after the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls grew by just 38,000 in May, amounting to the worst monthly jobs growth in five years. A decline in the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent came only because 664,000 Americans fell out of the workforce.      All of that happened amid a growing chorus of Fed members professing in recent weeks that a rate hike was appropriate and imminent. The economy, they contended, was gaining steam, with employment near capacity and inflation comfortably climbing toward the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.      Then just that quickly, expectations changed. Traders who had been pricing in a 58 percent chance of a July rate hike took the likelihood down to 34 percent. Within two hours of the payroll report's release, the market was projecting no rate hike until at least December. ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve may delay an interest rate rise at its June meeting due to concern about the economic fallout of Britain’s impending vote on whether to leave the European Union.      Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Brian Snyder      The geopolitical risk related to the vote will likely delay any U.S. rate increase until at least July, despite apparent consensus among Fed officials that a rate hike is warranted by stronger U.S. economic growth and a tight labor market.      The Fed’s June 14-15 policy meeting will come just a week before the British vote on June 23.      A “leave” vote, dubbed as “Brexit,” may roil financial markets, cause credit spreads to widen, trigger a rush into safe assets, and push up the U.S. dollar.      The dollar’s recent stability is one reason the Fed has become more comfortable with raising rates, so officials may want to let the threat of Brexit pass before moving to tighten financial conditions.      Fed Board Governor Daniel Tarullo on Thursday joined a chorus of those expressing concern about the British vote, telling Bloomberg that Brexit would be a “factor” he would consider at the Fed’s June policy meeting.      Recent polls suggest voters in Britain, Europe’s second-biggest economy and its most influential financial center, were evenly split on whether to stay in the EU or leave.      All three Fed Board governors who spoke recently suggested Brexit will weigh against a June rate hike, including Lael Brainard who on Friday said “prudent risk-management” calls for waiting for more data and greater certainty over the British vote before raising rates.      Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell said last week said the vote could be “a factor in favor of caution about raising rates,” a view fellow governor Daniel Tarullo echoed Thursday.      Fed Chair Janet Yellen will air her latest views in a speech in Philadelphia on Monday.      WARY OF BREXIT      Fed officials will release their latest economic projections at the June meeting, along with a policy statement, followed by a press conference by Yellen.      Meetings across Europe reveal uncertainty over what would follow a vote that British Prime Minister David Cameron calls a “leap in the dark”.      If Britain remains in the EU, it could lead to more infighting in the ruling Conservative party and destabilizing battles with the rest of the EU.      Waiting on the Brexit vote is a “no-brainer,” said Jon Faust, a former Fed staff member and now at Johns Hopkins University. “Why move now as opposed to a few weeks from now?”      The message from regional Fed bank presidents recently has been consistent: The upcoming Brexit vote may tip the scales against a June increase.      And Wall Street appears to be getting the message as well. A poll of primary dealers Friday showed all expect the Fed to wait until after June to raise rates, with Brexit seen as at least a “somewhat significant” factor.      OBSTACLES      This is only the latest obstacle to the Fed’s two-year struggle to normalize U.S. monetary policy in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.      In 2014 the crash in oil prices and a jump in the dollar crushed U.S. exports and drove inflation down.      Last year, a slowdown in China’s economy, alongside malaise in Europe and Japan, sparked global market volatility and concerns about a possible worldwide recession.      The Fed finally raised interest rates for the first time in a decade in December last year. Now the prospect of another rate rise this year appears all but certain, assuming Brexit does not occur.      U.S. inflation appears to be rising as the drag from cheap oil and a strong dollar fades, and a slowdown in first quarter economic growth looks to be temporary, with consumer spending and the housing market showing strength.      A U.S. Labor Department report on Friday though showed job growth braked sharply in May, leading traders to now bet the Fed will defer rate hikes, according to a Reuters poll. [L1N18V1FT]      The probability of a June rate increase is now down to 4.0 percent, according to CME Fed funds futures prices, from about 19 percent before Friday’s jobs data.      Traders trimmed expectations for a July rate hike, giving it just a 36 percent chance, down over 50 percent before the jobs report.      While the impact of a vote to leave the EU is uncertain, one widely expected result is likely to be a jump in the U.S. dollar which would be a further blow to U.S. exporters and another drag on inflation.      JULY OVER JUNE      If the Fed does indeed leave rates unchanged at its June meeting, officials have said they will be ready to move in July.      Minutes of the Fed’s March policy meeting showed officials preparing the ground for higher rates some time in the summer.      After July, the next option would be September, in the middle of a U.S. election campaign in which Fed policy could well be subjects of debate.      The Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington September 16 2015. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque      Four of the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional bank presidents have asked to raise the interest rate charged to commercial banks for short-term loans, a proxy for saying the fed funds target rate should move higher.      If the board defers a rate hike in June, Yellen will face a challenge in explaining why global factors are again trumping domestic economic data, given Fed officials have tried to convince the public that their decisions are “data dependent.”      One approach she could take, economists said, is to flag Fed officials’ agreement in favor of gradual rate rises over the next couple of years, while emphasizing low inflation means there is no urgency, especially ahead of the Brexit vote. “Even if Brexit were seen to be an unlikely outcome, we think this extremely cautious Fed Chair might see relatively little cost to waiting another seven weeks to act,” RBS economists Michelle Girard and Kevin Cummins said in a note. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"This is a news article about how some people called \\"FMMR\\" traders and a man named Steve Liesman from CNBC are talking about some important numbers called \\"jobs data.\\" These numbers tell us about how many people got new jobs and if they're working or not.

They are also worried about a big decision in a faraway place called Britain, where people are going to decide if they want to stay in a big club called the European Union or not. Changing the interest rates might make things hard for people if Britain leaves the club, so the Fed wants to be careful.

Cu toate acestea, UE este în continuare lider mondial în domeniul egalităţii de gen şi cred că ar trebui să împărtăşim cu restul lumii exemplele de bune practici pe care le deţinem deja,în UE. Translate this to English?","output":"Nevertheless, the European Union remains a world leader in the field of gender equality, and I believe that we should share with the rest of the world the examples of good practices that we already possess in the EU. The European Union has long been at the forefront of gender equality efforts and promoting policies that empower women and encourage greater representation in decision-making processes across various sectors. This leadership position has allowed the EU to set an example for the rest of the world when it comes to guaranteeing equal opportunities for both men and women. In order to share these good practices and examples with other countries, several approaches can be taken. Firstly, the European Union can engage in diplomatic outreach and international cooperation initiatives. Through bilateral or multilateral agreements, the EU can share its experiences, knowledge, and resources to help other countries implement similar gender equality policies. Another way to spread these good practices is by promoting research and collaboration with academic institutions, think-tanks, and non-governmental organizations that focus on gender equality issues. By fostering partnerships in research and policy development, the EU can contribute to building a solid evidence base for the efficacy of its gender equality policies, providing other countries with valuable information and models for their own initiatives. An essential aspect of sharing European experiences regarding gender equality is participation in international organizations and forums. By maintaining an active presence in bodies such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Labor Organization, the EU can advocate for gender equality and promote its best practices on a global level. Additionally, the European Union can showcase its successes in mainstream media through advertising campaigns and awareness-raising events that specifically highlight its gender equality achievements. By doing so, it may inspire other countries to adopt similar policies and practices. Lastly, it is crucial to ensure that European citizens and stakeholders are appropriately informed about the importance of gender equality and the EU's policies in the field. This can be achieved by ensuring transparency and accessible information dissemination, as well as engaging the public through educational campaigns, seminars, and workshops. In conclusion, as a world leader in achieving gender equality, the European Union has a wealth of examples and good practices that can potentially inspire and aid other countries in their efforts toward greater equality. By engaging in various forms of diplomacy, research, international cooperation, and public outreach, the EU can effectively demonstrate its commitment to sharing its valuable insights and experiences in the realm of gender equality with the larger global community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person from whom the couple inherited the Brownlow estates? ?  The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.

Question: 2018 is a congressional election year in the United States, and President Donald Trump is urging his supporters to get motivated to vote as both parties prepare for November. \\"The people who voted for us become complacent a little bit, they are happy,\\" Trump told supporters during a recent speech on tax reform in Cincinnati. \\"They sort of take it for granted, they sit back and then they get clobbered because the other people are desperate and they get out, and they have more energy.\\" Trump predicted that Republicans will do better than expected in November when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are at stake and 34 of the 100 Senate seats. \\"I think because of what we've done, because of the tremendous success we've had, I have a feeling that we are going to do incredibly well in '18, and I have to say this, history is not on our side,\\" he said. The president is right. History is not on his side. Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats. The losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year. Trump's approval rating has ticked up in recent weeks, but the average has him just above 40 percent, not a strong position with a midterm looming. \\"You know, you have a very unpopular president. And if Democrats take a broad path, they should win lots and lots of seats,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a center-left advocacy and research organization. Gallup has noted historically that presidents with an approval rating above 50 percent lose an average of 14 House seats in midterms, while those below 40 percent can expect to lose about 36 seats. Democrats need to gain 24 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to regain the majority in both chambers. Question: Why was the student protesting?

Question: With whom did Mr. Matuschek think his wife was having an affair? Movie title: The Shop Around the Corner Movie plot: Matuschek's, a gift store in Budapest, is the workplace of Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and the newly hi Ed Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan). At work they constantly irritate each other, but this daily aggravation is tempered by the fact that each has a secret pen pal with which they trade long soul-searching letters. Romantic correspondence is sent back and forth, and while Alfred and Klara trade barbs at work, they dream of someday meeting their sensitive, caring and unknown pen pal.Christmas is fast approaching, and the store is busy. Alfred had been with the store for some time, and has always been treated well by Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan), but lately his attitude has changed. Alfred is at a loss, and Matuschek avoids any explanation, finally telling Alfred that it would be best if he left. Stunned, Alfred accepts his last paycheck and says goodbye to everyone, including Klara. For once they are civil to each other.A long awaited meeting of the secret pen pals was planned for that night, and Alfred having just lost his job has no desire to go. Finding he can't fight his curiosity, he wanders to the restaurant where they'd agreed to meet and peeks in the window with his fellow employee. Of course, Klara is there waiting for him, with the chosen book and wearing a red carnation they'd agreed to use as a signal. Realizing that he'd been wrong about her all along, and that his irritation with her was actually masking his attraction, he finally enters and goes over to her table, but does not reveal his true reason for being there although he is aware she will be hurt that her pen pal doesn't show up. Alfred, hurt by her rudeness, finally leaves, knowing that she will wait all night for someone who is no longer coming.Meanwhile, back at the store, Mr. Matuschek has a late-night meeting with a private detective. He knows that his wife has been having an affair with one of his employees, and was convinced it was his trusted friend, Alfred. The detective however tells Matuschek it is in fact another employee... The answer is:","output":"Mr. Matuschek initially thought his wife was having an affair with Alfred Kralik (James Stewart).

The USB Battery Charging Specification Revision 1.2 (released in 2010) makes clear that there are safety limits to the rated current at 5 A coming from USB 2.0. On the other hand, several changes are made and limits are increasing including allowing 1.5 A on charging downstream ports for unconfigured devices, allowing high speed communication while having a current up to 1.5 A, and allowing a maximum current of 5 A. Also, revision 1.2 removes support for USB ports type detection via resistive detection mechanisms. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What does the USB Battery Charging Specification Revision 1.2 make clear of?","output":"The USB Battery Charging Specification Revision 1.2 makes clear several important points and updates concerning the charging and powering capabilities of USB ports. Here's a summary of the key aspects: 1. Improved safety limits: The specification sets the safety limit of the rated current at 5 A for USB 2.0. This addresses potential concerns regarding the current levels supplied through USB ports and ensures that they remain within safe operating limits. 2. Increased current allowance for unconfigured devices: Revision 1.2 allows 1.5 A on charging downstream ports (CDP) for unconfigured devices, which was not the case in earlier revisions. This improvement allows USB connectors to provide more power to charge unconfigured devices more quickly. 3. Simultaneous high-speed communication and charging: The update enables devices to engage in high-speed data communication while receiving a current of up to 1.5 A. This enhances the user experience by permitting simultaneous data transfer and charging, improving the overall efficiency of the device. 4. Maximum current of 5 A: Revision 1.2 pushes the maximum current allowed through a USB port to 5 A. As a result, USB-enabled devices are capable of charging at a faster rate and providing higher current delivery, which benefits a wide range of electronics. 5. Removal of resistive detection mechanisms: The specification also removes support for USB port type detection using resistive detection mechanisms. This decision simplifies the charging process and reduces the likelihood of errors due to detection issues. In summary, USB Battery Charging Specification Revision 1.2 clarifies several aspects and makes improvements to the charging capabilities and safety of USB ports. It increases the current allowance for unconfigured devices and supports high-speed communication while allowing a maximum current of 5 A. Additionally, it removes the need for resistive detection mechanisms in USB port type identification, which simplifies the overall charging process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions?, using the article: Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.  The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Answer the following question: Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.  Which scientist read more about deep, fibrous, grass root systems?  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Jian, who studied grassland soil, read more about deep, fibrous, grass root systems. The hints given suggest that grassland soil has a deeper distribution of organic matter due to the deep, fibrous, grass root systems, and this information would be relevant to Jian's research. On the other hand, Yun studied forest soils, where tree leaves falling on the forest floor contribute to the soil organic matter, and the presence of deep fibrous grass root systems would be less relevant to Yun's research."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: If you have ever been rock climbing, you will know that it is not a very easy sport. In fact, you probably felt quite defeated when you first tried to do any serious climbing. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing are both extremely demanding and require practice to get good at. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding sports. There are three basic types of rock climbing. Top roping is the most common type and the climber need to climb with a partner. The second type, which is very similar to top roping, is called lead climbing. In both of the types, the climber can sit off the wall and rest on the rope. The third type is called bouldering. Bouldering is a type of free climbing without any ropes. This is the most demanding of all climbing types. The climber must be able to complete the climbing without taking a rest on the rope. Believe it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique. One of the major rules of rock climbing is to always have three points touching the wall, whether it is both feet and one hand, or one foot and both hands, as it is much easier to have your weight  cases will not do the climbing; they only hold you into the wall so that your legs are actually pushing you upward. Also, the closer you are to the wall, the easier it is to climb. Rock climbing may sound a bit too extreme for the everyday person, but it is really an amazing workout. Once you get into the sport, and learn how to position your body and rest your weight, then you can begin to deal with some difficult problems. The great thing about rock climbing is that it is mentally challenging as well. You are constantly analyzing the way your body moves and how to do certain moves on the wall. For anyone who wants to get into shape, rock climbing is a fun and effective way to exercise muscles.

Jerry Lewis (born Joseph Levitch, March 16, 1926 - August 20, 2017) was an American comedian, actor, singer, humanitarian, film director, film producer and screenwriter. He was known for his slapstick humor in film, television, stage and radio and was nicknamed the \\"King of Comedy\\". Lewis was one-half of the hit popular comedy duo Martin and Lewis with singer Dean Martin from 1946 to 1956. Lewis kept a low political profile for many years, having taken advice reportedly given to him by President John F. Kennedy, who told him \\"Don't get into anything political. Don't do that because they will usurp your energy\\". Nevertheless, he campaigned and performed on behalf of both JFK and Robert F. Kennedy. Lewis was a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. For his 1957 NBC special, Lewis held his ground when southern affiliates objected to his stated friendship with Sammy Davis Jr.  In a 1971 Movie Mirror magazine article, Lewis came out against the Vietnam War, when his son, Gary, returned from service traumatized. He vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons.  Lewis once stated political speeches should not be at the Oscars. \\"I think we are the most dedicated industry in the world. And I think that we have to present ourselves that night as hard-working, caring and important people to the industry. We need to get more self-respect as an industry\\". In a 2004 interview with The Guardian, Lewis was asked what he was least proud of, to which he answered, \\"Politics\\". Not his politics, but the world's politics - the madness, the destruction, the general lack of respect. He lamented citizens' lack of pride in their country, stating, \\"President Bush is my president. I will not say anything negative about the president of the United States. I don't do that. And I don't allow my children to do that. Likewise when I come to England don't you do any jokes about 'Mum' to me. That is the Queen of England, you moron.\\" \\"Do you know how tough a job it is to be the Queen of England?\\"  In a December 2015 interview on EWTN's World Over with Raymond Arroyo, Lewis expressed opposition to the United States letting in Syrian refugees, saying \\"No one has worked harder for the human condition than I have, but they're not part of the human condition if 11 guys in that group of 10,000 are ISIS. How can I take that chance?\\" In the same interview, he criticized President Barack Obama for not being prepared for ISIS, while expressing support for Donald Trump, saying he would make a good president because he was a good \\"showman\\".

During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

As the 74 people on a climate change research ship stuck in the ice in Antarctica readied for New Year's Eve festivities, authorities revealed plans to send in a rescue helicopter. The Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy has not moved in a week since getting stuck in unusually thick ice on Christmas. The people on board say they are holding up fairly well. \\"The group on this ship is incredibly collegiate,\\" said Alok Jha, a science correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, told Anderson Cooper 360. \\"There are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other.\\" Chris Turney, an Australian professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy. That includes yoga and Spanish classes, Jha and Turney said. Turney said it was raining hard Monday, and visibility was deteriorating. The forecast for the next 24 hours called for more of the same. Officials said a helicopter from a nearby Chinese ship will be used in the airlift, but rescuers must wait for conditions to improve. In preparation, crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy have marked a spot on the ice where the helicopter can land, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. The helicopter, which can transport 12 people each trip, will take the ship's 52 passengers -- who include the research team and journalists -- to the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long. An Australian icebreaker, which tried unsuccessfully to reach the research vessel, will send a barge to pick them up. The 22 crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, the maritime agency said. \\"People are sort of seeing the end in sight and just keeping morale up,\\" Turney told CNN. \\"It's New Year's Eve tonight, so there are all sorts of plans.\\" That includes the singing of an original song written by one of the passengers and dancing, Jha said. And there may be good spirits -- both emotional and alcoholic, Jha and Turney said. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers said it wasn't a bad place to be stuck. The scenery is beautiful. Penguins have been walking up to the ship and sniffing around, checking out their new neighbors. Close, but no rescue. The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started on December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turney said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis suspended efforts early Monday to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The ship got within 10 nautical miles but then turned back. The attempt by the Australian icebreaker followed one by the Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which was six nautical miles from the trapped vessel when it couldn't get any closer  because of the ice. It returned to open water and remained in the area to provide support, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, a spokeswoman for the maritime authority.

Let's break down how I got to this translation: 1. \\"Opium has always been grown here\\" translates to \\"Мак всегда выращивали здесь\\". In this part, I used \\"Мак\\", which is the Russian term for opium, and \\"выращивали\\", which is the past tense form of the verb 'to grow'.  2. \\"but never on such a huge scale\\" can be translated as \\"но никогда не в таких масштабах\\". Here, \\"но\\" is the coordinating conjunction 'but', and \\"никогда не\\" is used to denote 'never'. Also, \\"таких масштабах\\" is used to illustrate 'on such a huge scale'.  3. \\"as witnessed in the mid-1990s\\" is translated to \\"как в середине 1990-х годов\\". Here, \\"как\\" implies the conjunction 'as', \\"середине\\" is the term for 'mid', and \\"1990-х годов\\" means '1990s'.

Understanding the context:    - Quinn is a replacement lead singer    - The original lead singer of the choir has fallen sick    - Quinn gets to sing now as the lead 2. Evaluating the answers:    (1). Yes: This answer implies that Quinn is prepared, willing, and able to step in to take on the role of the lead singer. It suggests that Quinn will make the most of this opportunity to showcase their talent. This description seems appropriate given the context that Quinn is replacing the sick lead singer and has the chance to perform as the lead.    (2). No: If we choose this answer, it implies that describing Quinn as \\"ready to take advantage of the opportunity\\" is not accurate or appropriate. Since we know the context is about Quinn stepping in as a replacement due to the original lead singer falling sick, this answer seems to contradict the information provided. Conclusion: Given the context and evaluating the possible answers, I would say that \\"ready to take advantage of the opportunity\\" is a valid way to describe Quinn.

Ne vom confrunta din nou cu aceleași probleme care vor amenința întregul viitor al monedei euro și al Uniunii Europene dacă nu vom dispune de o coordonare mai bună și de o metodă comunitară mai puternică. Translate to English","output":"We will face again the same problems that will threaten the entire future of the euro currency and the European Union if we do not have better coordination and a stronger community approach. The problems that threaten the euro currency and the European Union are multifaceted and complex, spanning across political, economic, and social dimensions. As such, it is crucial to find effective solutions through better coordination and a stronger community approach. One of the major problems facing the euro currency is the ongoing economic divergence between the EU member states. Some countries are experiencing financial instability, resulting in mounting public debts and high levels of unemployment. This, in turn, has led to social unrest and increased pressure on the Eurozone's stability. To address this issue, a more coordinated approach is needed, focusing on the implementation of reforms and fiscal policies that promote growth and reduce disparities among the member states. Another challenge is the growing skepticism among citizens about the benefits of the Eurozone and the European Union. This skepticism has been fueled by the perception that EU institutions lack transparency, accountability, and democratic legitimacy. To regain the trust and support of the citizens, it is essential to enhance the democratic nature of the European Union and reinforce the role of the EU Parliament. The lack of a unified foreign policy is also a key detriment to the European Union's unity and global influence. By working together and presenting a united front, the EU member states can better promote their shared values and interests, such as human rights, peace, and sustainable development. This requires better coordination and a stronger community approach when dealing with external challenges. In terms of security, the European Union faces both internal and external threats, ranging from terrorism to cyber security and energy security. A coordinated approach to the management of these issues is paramount, including the development of a comprehensive EU defense strategy and better collaboration among the member states in the fields of intelligence, policing, and border control. Finally, addressing the challenges posed by the migration crisis and integrating refugees and asylum seekers into the society are crucial for ensuring social cohesion and stability within the European Union. This can only be achieved by improving cooperation and burden-sharing among the member states and developing a common migration policy that is based on principles of solidarity, responsibility, and respect for human rights. In conclusion, better coordination and a stronger community approach are fundamental to the survival and continued growth of the euro currency and the European Union. This requires joint efforts and shared responsibilities among the member states, as well as comprehensive reforms and policies aimed at addressing the rising challenges. By facing these issues together and fostering a sense of unity and common purpose, the European Union can overcome the problems it faces and continue on a path toward prosperity and global influence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Rodeo stunt riders are known to perform various tricks, which may include stunts on horseback, with bulls, or with other types of animals. Some common tricks may include riding while standing, jumping from one horse to another, hanging off the side of a horse, or even performing flips. However, not every rodeo show will necessarily include a performance where a man is riding upside down on the side of a horse, as it depends on the variety and expertise of the particular stunt rider. Therefore, while it is not implausible that such a trick could be performed at a rodeo, it is not possible to tell conclusively whether this specific performance featured a man riding upside down on the side of a horse solely based on the statement that a stunt rider performed tricks at the rodeo.

Options: - ink - noise - use paper - hard copy - queue  The answer is \\"queue\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"queue\\" because when a printer experiences a paper jam, it disrupts the normal printing process resulting in the printer being unable to communicate effectively with the computer system. Consequently, the print jobs submitted by the user (James) are stored in a queue which is managed by the printer's driver. The print queue acts as a temporary storage area for print jobs as they wait for their turn to be executed. Once the paper jam is resolved and the printer returns to its normal functioning state, it is vital to clear the print queue to ensure that the pending print jobs are executed in their correct order and no duplication of unwanted print jobs occurs. If the print queue is not cleared, the printer may continue to try printing the same document repeatedly, resulting in unnecessary wastage of paper and ink. In the given answer options, \\"ink\\" and \\"noise\\" are not directly related to paper jams, while \\"use paper\\" and \\"hard copy\\" are not relevant actions to clear once the paper jam has been fixed. On the other hand, \\"queue\\" is the appropriate term used to describe the list of pending print jobs that need attention after resolving a paper jam issue. Furthermore, clearing the print queue may also help in identifying and rectifying any underlying software-related or system issues that could have contributed to the paper jam in the first place, thereby preventing future occurrences. In summary, the answer is \\"queue\\" because after unjamming the printer, James needs to clear the print queue to ensure that the pending print jobs are executed in the correct order without further complications or disruptions. This action helps in preventing unnecessary wastage of resources, such as ink and paper, and maintains the overall efficiency of the printing process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chris Brown was a relative commercial success with the time; selling over two million copies in the United States--where it was certified two times platinum by the RIAA--and three million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \\"Run It!\\", made Brown the first male act (since Montell Jordan in 1995) to have his debut single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot 100--later remaining for four additionally weeks. Three of the other singles--\\"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\\", \\"Gimme That\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\"--peaked within the top twenty at the same chart.

Brussels is a beautiful city in a country called Belgium. People from all over the world live and visit there, just like in your hometown. But on this day, something really bad happened. Some very mean people did something called a \\"terror attack\\" in Brussels. A terror attack is when people hurt many others, on purpose, to scare everyone. It's not a nice thing to do, and it made a lot of people very, very sad. Many people were hurt during the terror attack in Brussels, and sadly, some of them even lost their lives. When someone loses their life, it means that they can't be with their families and friends anymore. This is a very sad thing. After the terror attack, it's important to know who these people were, so that their families can say goodbye to them and remember them. So, many grown-ups in Brussels worked really hard to find out the names of the people who lost their lives in the attack. This is called \\"identifying\\" the people. Now, most of the people killed in the Brussels attacks have been identified. That means their families know what happened to them and can remember them in their hearts. We also need to remember that even though there are some mean people in the world who do bad things, there are still many, many more good people. Good people want to help each other, spread love, and live happily together. So, let's be the good people who care for each other and make the world a better place to live for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So let's move the 3372 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: -203 * n = -703 - 3372 Now we simplify: -203 * n = -4075 Our goal is to find the value of n, so we need to get rid of the -203 that is multiplied by n.

The FAA said Tuesday there had been some type of security incident on the plane.      US Airways released a statement Tuesday afternoon saying the TSA requested that upon landing in Boston, they wanted to inspect a bag on board. The plane was carrying 62 passengers.      “Passengers are safely inside the terminal and the aircraft was cleared and moved to the terminal,” a US Airways spokesperson said.      State Police spokesperson David Procopio said there was a piece of luggage on the plane that had not been checked in Philadelphia that security wanted to look at.      Procopio said the incident is not related to Monday’s explosions at the Boston Marathon finish line.      Once on the ground in Logan, luggage was taken from the plane and lined up on the runway for inspection. ||||| Authorities evacuated a busy terminal at LaGuardia Airport after receiving reports of a potentially suspicious package in a shopping area, law enforcement officials said.      Officials gave the all-clear, and passengers were allowed back into the terminal about 45 minutes later.      Travelers tweeted photos of hundreds of people outside with their luggage after Central Terminal was evacuated shortly before 11 a.m. Tuesday.      New York City has been in a state of heightened alert since two bombs exploded near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon, killing at least three people and injuring more than 170 others.

The TSA eventually gave an \\"all clear\\" at the airport and released this statement:      Out of an abundance of caution, a checked bag on board US Air #1716 (PHL-BOS) was re-screened at Logan International Airport upon landing after baggage handlers at PHL noted concern. The flight landed safely at BOS and passengers were deplaned and bused to their gate. TSA and the Massachusetts State Police responded. While properly screened by TSA at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the bag was re-screened by local EOD at BOS as a precaution and has been cleared.      Security is on heightened alert after yesterday's bombings at the Boston Marathon.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is an increase in cars that run on fossil fuels, it will have a greater effect on the greenhouse effect. The reason behind this is that burning fossil fuels releases more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), into the atmosphere. As the concentration of these gases increases, they trap more heat radiation from the Earth, preventing it from escaping to space.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of...

Literature, classic literature, is a beautiful, richly furnished room where you might find many an hour of rest and refreshment.

He does so and comes out of the house crying. With that new confidence established between them, they become friends and, later on, lovers. Marco attends a wedding in Toledo and is surprised to find Lydia there too, since she had said that she did not want to go. The wedding turns out to be that of Marcoâs former fiancÃ©e, Angela, who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia; Marco was very much in love with Angela and had a very hard time getting over her (which was the reason for his constant crying over things he could not share with her). Lydia says that she has something important to say, but she prefers to wait until after the bullfight that afternoon; but she is gored and becomes comatose. Marco does not leave her side at the hospital and finally befriends Benigno, who recognizes him from the dance-theatre performance. Marco is told by the doctors that people in a coma never wake up and that, while there are miracle-stories...

Since both -6*r and -12*r have the same variable r, they are like terms and can be combined. -18*r - 72 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable r. To do this, add 72 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the other side. -18*r = 72 Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of r. The coefficient of r is -18. Divide both sides by -18 to solve for r. r = 72 / (-18) Step 4: Simplify the expression.

Now do a next sentence writing task.","output":"Upon revisiting the old bookshop in the South End of Boston in 1991, a sense of nostalgia overcame you as memories of the gritty streets, lively community, and the countless hours spent perusing the dusty shelves filled your mind. The once mostly abandoned and dilapidated buildings, evidence of a neighborhood struggling to survive the socio-economic challenges of the times, had since started evolving into a more vibrant area as a result of various restoration and revitalization projects. The South End's brownstone architecture, which had begun to crumble and decay back in the late '60s and '70s, now stood tall and proud, as preservation efforts slowly breathed new life into the historical charm of the neighborhood. This transformation was evident as you walked through the green spaces and tree-lined streets, reminiscing about the hidden gems you had discovered within the countless literary treasures you had acquired throughout the years. Despite these changes, the bookshop remained tucked in the midst of the evolving South End – a testament to the resilience and love for printed words in a rapidly modernizing world. As you entered the familiar store, the smell of aging paper, worn bindings, and the ink drawn upon them instantly transported you back to your early days of living in the area. The creaking, hardwood floors whispered stories of many visitors, each seeking refuge in the world of literature to improve their lives or escape from their daily struggles. The owners, with their ever-present passion and undying love for books, greeted you with warm smiles, making it seem as if not a day had passed since your frequent visits from over a decade ago. Their dedication to preserving the shop's atmosphere was unmistakable as they passionately discussed rare editions, upcoming writers, and their favorite literary gems found within those very walls. Perusing the shelves, filled to the brim with countless books ranging from classic novels, to rare and valuable first editions, the prices had slightly increased in the ten years since your last visit, reflecting the growth and change experienced within the neighborhood. However, the true value of the books lied not in their ten-cent price tags but in their innate power to foster lifelong learning and their impact on the individuals who picked them up. The shop's small nooks and alcoves were filled with fellow bibliophiles and curious visitors, each searching for a unique experience hidden within the pages of the numerous books on display. You felt a comforting sense of camaraderie, knowing that each person was united by their love and appreciation for the written word, and could share in the excitement sparked by the bookshop's timeless charm. As you finally made your exit from the store, carrying a few more literary treasures to add to your growing collection, you couldn't help but feel grateful for the profound impact these books – and the small, ten-cent bookshop – had on your life during the transformative years you spent in the South End of Boston.

Article:Over three million customers had already switched their electricity supplier by the end of July, according to the latest figures. Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said one in five had signed up to small or medium sized suppliers. In July alone 385,000 customers switched, a 16% increase on July 2016. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK, said: \\"There are now over 50 suppliers to choose from, which is driving innovation, improvements to customer service and providing an incentive to keep prices competitive as suppliers fight to keep and attract customers.\\" Although the largest number of switches were done by customers moving from one large supplier to another, some 34% transferred from a large supplier to a small or mid-tier one. The steady increase in the number of consumers looking for better deals comes as electricity and gas price rises outstrip inflation. British Gas owner Centrica said in August it would hike electricity prices on its standard tariff by 12.5% from September, although it is maintaining a freeze on its gas prices. The five other big suppliers - E.ON, ScottishPower, npower, EDF Energy, and SSE - have come out with similar increases. The price comparison website uSwitch estimates that the average annual cost of dual-fuel standard tariffs from the \\"Big Six\\" will rise between 7% and 10%. However, those taking advantage of switching are still in a minority. uSwitch believes that seven out of ten households are overpaying for gas and electricity on expensive standard tariffs. The reasons for the inertia were revealed in a report last year by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). It said: \\"Those who have low incomes, have low qualifications, are living in rented accommodation or who are above 65 are less likely to be engaged in the domestic retail energy markets.\\" However, it also found that consumers in these groups were the ones most likely to gain from switching energy supplier. Another review into the cost of energy was announced last week. It will be led by Professor Dieter Helm and examine the entire electricity supply chain of generation, transmission, distribution and supply, in light of the Government's ambition to have the lowest energy costs in Europe. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Over three million UK customers changed their electricity supplier by the end of July this year, according to trade association Energy UK.

Because most of the band members, including Crisci, participate in other bands, Old Canes is joined on tour by other available musicians known to the band, including John Momberg (of The Appleseed Cast), Taylor Holenbeck, Sam Goodell, Rusty Scott, Kelly Hangauer (of Fourth Of July), Lucas Oswald (Minus Story) and Jeff Stolz, in what they call a \\"musical collective.\\" Past members include Nathan Richardson (Casket Lottery), Jordan Geiger (Minus Story), Eric Verhar, Tyler French (Minus Story), Gabriel Booth, Kelsey Richardson, and Jon Anderson (Boys Life).  - Lucas Harrison Oswald ( born June 11 , 1988 ) is an American musician , known as a multi-instrumental and vocal contributor to the bands Shearwater , The Appleseed Cast , Minus Story , Hospital Ships , and Old Canes . He composed music for the second and third seasons of Green Porno and one episode of the American television show Boss ( TV series ) .  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instrument' with the subject 'lucas oswald'.

Let's first find out what we get when we combine the two parts with the \\"y\\" in them. You can think of it like you have -45394 apples and then someone gives you 47318 apples. So you now need to do -45394 + 47318. When we do that, we get 1,924 apples. So now our equation looks like this: -65416 = 1924*y Now, we need to find out how many times 1,924 fits into -65,416. It's like having a large number of candies and dividing them into smaller groups equally! So, we're going to divide -65416 by 1924: -65416 ÷ 1924 = -34 So, y is equal to -34. Et voilà!

Is it possible to conclude that \\"One girl sitting down reading and another girl standing in front of her.\\" if \\"Some people are reading to each other.\\"?","output":"From the given statement, \\"Some people are reading to each other,\\" it is not possible to directly conclude that \\"One girl is sitting down reading and another girl is standing in front of her.\\" However, this could be one of the possible scenarios that fit the given statement. The initial statement suggests that there are at least two people involved, and they are engaged in reading to each other. This tells us that they are sharing or exchanging reading materials (books, articles, etc.) and actively participating in the act of reading aloud for each other to hear. However, this information alone does not provide any specific details about the individuals involved, their genders, the position they are in while reading, or their spatial arrangement.  To elaborate, let us consider other potential scenarios that would also fit the given statement: 1. A man and a woman sitting on a park bench reading to each other 2. Two children lying on the floor of their bedroom, sharing a storybook 3. A group of elderly people in a nursing home gathered in a circle, taking turns reading to each other As we can see, these different situations all involve people reading to each other but contain various elements, such as gender, age, location, and positions. Thus, without additional context or information, it is not valid to conclude that \\"One girl is sitting down reading and another girl is standing in front of her.\\" from the initial statement. However, if supplementary information or further clarification were to be provided, one could potentially arrive at the conclusion mentioned. For instance, if we were given more details like \\"Two female friends are reading to each other while at a library, and one likes to stand while focusing on reading,\\" we would have a stronger basis for concluding that \\"One girl is sitting down reading, and another girl is standing in front of her.\\" But with the current information, the conclusion cannot be reasonably drawn."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which... Answer:","output":"In 1906, Gustav Holst composed two notable works: \\"A Somerset Rhapsody\\" and \\"Two Songs Without Words.\\"  \\"A Somerset Rhapsody\\" is an orchestral suite that showcases Holst's engagement with the English folksong revival. Originally intended to be based on eleven folksong themes, the final work uses four themes. The piece is acknowledged for its firm overall structure and the transformation it brought to Holst's orchestral writing. This composition played a crucial role in moving away from the chromaticism that dominated his earlier works. \\"Two Songs Without Words\\" demonstrates Holst's ability to create original music using the folk idiom. Though not mentioned in the provided context, this pair of works illustrates how Holst incorporated folk elements into his compositions, further emphasizing his connection to the English folksong revival taking place during that time. It is worth noting that while another piece, \\"Songs of the West,\\" was also composed in 1906, Holst withdrew it and it remained unpublished. It was only until the 1980s – long after Holst's passing – when an arrangement for the wind band by James Curnow brought the work to light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Cajuns are an ethnic group primarily concentrated in this southern state. They descend from the Acadian migrants who settled in Louisiana in the 18th century after being forcibly expelled from their original homeland – Acadia, present-day eastern Canada – during the Great Expulsion or \\"Le Grand Dérangement.\\" The term \\"Cajun\\" is a derivative of the word \\"Acadian\\" and refers to the French-speaking people who settled in the swampy and coastal regions of South Louisiana. The Acadians were a mixture of French, Irish, Scottish, and Native American peoples who blended together over time to form a distinct culture known for its unique dialect, vibrant music, rich folklore, strong family bonds, and delicious cuisine. Cajun culture is deeply rooted in Louisiana, especially in regions such as Acadiana, which covers 22 parishes in the southern part of the state. Lafayette, the largest city in the Acadiana region, is known as the unofficial capital of Cajun Country. Other cities and towns in this region with significant Cajun populations include Eunice, Breaux Bridge, Houma, Thibodaux, Mamou, and Abbeville. Cajuns make up a large percentage of Louisiana's total population. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2020, the population of Louisiana was approximately 4.65 million people, with estimates suggesting that Cajuns and individuals of Acadian descent account for up to 25% of the state’s population. This percentage is significantly higher than in any other US state, reinforcing Louisiana's strong connection to Cajun culture and heritage. Today, Louisiana embraces its Cajun heritage through various cultural events and festivals such as Festival International de Louisiane, Festivals Acadiens et Créoles, and the Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival. Cajun cuisine, including iconic dishes like gumbo, jambalaya, étouffée, boudin, and crawfish boils, is also hugely popular among locals and visitors alike. In conclusion, Louisiana has the most significant Cajun population in the United States. This community has contributed to the state’s unique cultural landscape, influencing various aspects of life in Louisiana, including language, music, cuisine, and traditions."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Write an article with the title: \\"Yet another new media model\\"","output":"Title: Yet Another New Media Model Introduction In the last decade, we have witnessed a rapid evolution in the media landscape, accompanied by multiple challenges and possible solutions. There is a widespread debate surrounding the viability and sustainability of diverse media models. In this context, it seems we are introduced to yet another new media model every other day. One of the latest promising alternatives is a decentralized, community-driven approach to content creation, distribution, and revenue generation. In this article, we shall explore the multifaceted aspects of this emerging media model and discover how it strives to create a more engaged and connected world. The Problem with Traditional Models The 21st century has seen media giants dominate the landscape, with a few big players controlling the majority of content distribution, shaping public opinion, and news delivery. This concentration of power has sparked concerns about media monopolies and the spread of misinformation or biased narratives. Additionally, the dominance of ad-funded models has created an arms race for attention, negatively impacting content quality and pushing public trust to an all-time low. The Promise of Decentralization At the heart of this new decentralized media model is the notion of power distribution, which offers a fairer, unbiased, and transparent means of content creation and dissemination. By employing decentralized technology like blockchain and empowering individual users, this model aims to shift control from the hands of media corporations to the communities and contributors. Key Features of the Decentralized Media Model 1. Community-driven content creation: This approach encourages users to create and share content, thus fostering creativity and diversity in the media sphere. Individuals are free to contribute their unique perspectives, experiences, and storytelling techniques. This contributes to a richer, more authentic content pool, offering a wide range of perspectives and narratives. 2. Distributed ownership and control: In a decentralized media model, control is distributed among many users who contribute to and validate the content. This decentralized decision-making process ensures a more reliable, unbiased, and democratic selection of articles and ideas. Decision-making power is more likely to be shaped by the merit of an individual's contribution rather than by their affiliations and influence. 3. Direct monetization and incentives: Creators in a decentralized media ecosystem are rewarded directly through various revenue-sharing mechanisms, like micropayments, tokenization, and subscription models. This not only provides a sustainable income but also incentivizes high-quality content generation. 4. Transparent and secure technology: The use of blockchain technology adds a layer of transparency, security, and trust to the entire content creation and distribution process. A public ledger can provide users with real-time information about the credibility and quality of content, allowing them to make informed decisions. 5. Crowdfunding platforms and collaborations: The growth of crowdfunding platforms has contributed to decentralized media models, as they support independent journalists, content creators, and small media organizations seeking funding for their projects. These platforms foster collaborations between like-minded individuals and facilitate collective decision-making. Conclusion The rise of decentralized media models brings with it a new hope for the democratization of information, rekindling the dream of a more participatory, diverse, and equitable media landscape. The decentralized approach seeks to establish a more resilient ecosystem, where creators, consumers, and communities collaborate seamlessly to ensure the integrity and vibrancy of media. While it is still in its early stages, this shift toward decentralization has the potential to disrupt the traditional models that have long held sway over our media consumption patterns, making room for new, innovative, and community-driven models that better serve the needs of a diverse and interconnected world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coral reefs are the planet's most diverse marine ecosystem , known as the rainforests of the oceans.Despite taking up under 0.2% of the ocean floor, they provide food and shelter for almost a third of all sea life.If we lose the ecosystems, we lose not only the biodiversity  , but we also lose the capability of people to obtain income and food from coral reefs. Climatic instability, which leads to rising sea temperatures, causes corals to bleach.Bleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise and this causes the coral tissue to expel their symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae - these are what give the coral their colour.Bleached corals often die if the stress continues.Among...

What is the full name of the person that created the flagrant denial of their consitutional rights?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  On April 10, 1963, Bull Connor obtained an injunction barring the protests and subsequently raised bail bond for those arrested from 200 to 1,500 (2,000 to 10,000 in 2019). Fred Shuttlesworth called the injunction a \\"flagrant denial of our constitutional rights\\" and organizers prepared to defy the order.  The decision to ignore the injunction had been made during the planning stage of the campaign.  King and the SCLC had obeyed court injunctions in their Albany protests and reasoned that obeying them contributed to the Albany campaign's lack of success. In a press release they explained, \\"We are now confronted with recalcitrant forces in the Deep South that will use the courts to perpetuate the unjust and illegal systems of racial separation\\". Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell called King and the SCLC organizers \\"strangers\\" whose only purpose in Birmingham was \\"to stir inter-racial discord\\".  Connor promised, \\"You can rest assured that I will fill the jail full of any persons violating the law as long as I'm at City Hall.\\"The movement organizers found themselves out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. \\"I have never seen Martin so troubled\\", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: \\"The eyes of the world are on Birmingham tonight.

Now, Alex needs to take certain steps to completely go through with the process of disposing of the desk and taking any consequential actions. Considering each answer option: A: Put the parts in a vehicle This is the most immediate task that Alex needs to accomplish next. Since Alex has already dismantled the desk, the next logical step is to load the pieces into a vehicle to transport them to the dump. Without doing this, Alex wouldn’t be able to proceed with other tasks effectively. B: Clean the space where the desk was located Following the transportation of the desk parts in a vehicle, it would also make sense for Alex to clean the space where the desk was previously situated. This would free up space and provide a clean area for any potential replacements or additional rearrangement of furniture. C: Go to the recycling center Taking the parts to the recycling center could be an alternative to going to the dump. However, the question states that Alex intended to throw the desk parts away at the dump. In that context, going to the recycling center is a less likely next step for Alex. D: Call a friend to help dispose of the desk Alex could call a friend to help dispose of the desk. However, since Alex has already dismantled the desk, it is less likely that he now needs help. This option is not the most immediate next step, though it could be a viable option if problems arise during disposal or future tasks.

In addition to obtaining revenue by offering retail services under its own brand , an MNO may also sell access to network services at wholesale rates to mobile virtual network operators . A key defining characteristic of a mobile network operator is that an MNO must own or control access to a radio spectrum license from a regulatory or government entity . A second key defining characteristic of an MNO is that an MNO must own or control the elements of the network infrastructure necessary to provide services to subscribers over the licensed spectrum . A mobile network operator typically also has the necessary provisioning , billing and customer care computer systems and the marketing , customer care and engineering organizations needed to sell , deliver and bill for services , however , an MNO can outsource any of these systems or functions and still be considered a mobile network operator .  - In telecommunication, provisioning involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide (new) services to its users. In National Security/Emergency Preparedness telecommunications services, \\"\\"provisioning\\"\\" equates to \\"\\"initiation\\"\\" and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), originally the International Telegraph Union, is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies.  - The electromagnetic spectrum is the collective term for all known frequencies and their linked wavelengths of the known photons (electromagnetic radiation). The \\"electromagnetic spectrum\\" \\"of an object\\" has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.  - A wireless network is any type of computer network that uses wireless data connections for connecting network nodes  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a data link. The connections between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet.  - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz).

Simon said that he did not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: \\"I didn't get what had happened – how big it was – until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it.\\"In May 1982, Simon & Garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the US and Canada. The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: ['etso (w)a'ratSiz du nasi'metu]; born 23 October 1940), known as Pele ([pe'le]), is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played as a forward. He is widely regarded as the greatest football player of all time. In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS). That same year, Pele was elected Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee. Pele arrived in Sweden sidelined by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room, his colleagues stood together and insisted upon his selection. His first match was against the USSR in the third match of the first round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vava's second goal. He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup. Against France in the semifinal, Brazil was leading 2-1 at halftime, and then Pele scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.  On 29 June 1958, Pele became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5-2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pele's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; \\"When Pele scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding\\". When the match ended, Pele passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.  It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pele began wearing a jersey with number 10. The event was the result of disorganization: the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did not send the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt to Pele who was a substitute on the occasion. The press proclaimed Pele the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind Didi. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, an interesting aspect from this article is the story of Pele's outstanding performance during the 1958 World Cup. One notable quote is: \\"Against France in the semifinal, Brazil was leading 2-1 at halftime, and then Pele scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.\\" This highlights Pele's incredible skill even at a young age, as well as his significant impact on the football world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alana, Mama June's youngest daughter and the star of the show, did not hesitate to poke fun at her mother's newfound appearance. While Mama June may have been hoping for positive feedback from her family, especially her children, Alana's reaction was far from impressed. Regardless of Alana's remarks, Mama June seemed to enjoy her new look, shown confidently in the video preview for the Holladay Special episodes. As the family prepared for the festive season, Mama June's makeover served as just one way to bring extra excitement to the show. Fans of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo anticipated the Holladay Specials to be filled with laughter, fun, and maybe a few surprises as they got a closer look into the lives of the eccentric Shannon family, even though the family's transformations were not met with unanimous appreciation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Details: \\"It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen.\\" Trump again dismissed allegations that Moscow has blackmail-level video of him. He blamed \\"sick people\\" for inventing the story and called it a \\"disgrace\\" that it was leaked. He drew some laughter with this line, referring to a particularly graphic part of the allegations: \\"Does anyone really believe that story? I'm also very much of a germophobe, by the way.\\" \\"I think it was Russia.\\" For the first time, Trump said he believes Russia hacked the US election, reports CNN. But he also said that \\"we have much hacking going on\\" and that Russia isn't the only guilty party. If Vladimir Putin likes him, Trump says \\"that's an asset\\" because the US could team up with Moscow against ISIS. He added that it's likely he won't get along with Putin and if so, he says he'll be harder on him than Hillary Clinton would have been. Later, he asserted that Russia \\"will have far greater respect for our country when I'm leading it.\\" Among the Trump business changes: No new foreign deals while he's president, said Trump's attorney.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: What Polish and naturalized French physicist had a small rocky island near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago named after her? Answer:","output":"Marie Skłodowska Curie, a Polish-born physicist, and chemist, naturalized in France, had a small rocky island named after her situated near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago. Marie Curie, born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, played a crucial role in expanding our knowledge in the fields of physics, chemistry, and radioactivity during her remarkable career.  She was born as Maria Salomea Skłodowska and moved to France in 1891 to pursue higher education at the prestigious Sorbonne University (University of Paris). There, she met and married fellow scientist Pierre Curie. They became one of the most successful scientific collaborations in history.  Her groundbreaking work earned her two Nobel Prizes – in Physics in 1903, which she shared with her husband, Pierre, and with Antoine Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity, and in Chemistry in 1911 for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and as well, the only person to have been awarded Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. In recognition of her remarkable achievements and her lasting impact on science, it is fitting that a small rocky island near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago was named Île Marie-Curie in her honor. The archipelago is located near the coast of East Antarctica and is known for its diverse geological features and research capabilities. Researchers and scientists often visit this place to conduct studies on various geological aspects and Antarctic biology in the context of climate change. Île Marie-Curie, named after the celebrated scientist, serves as a symbol of her invaluable contributions and tireless pursuit of knowledge in the fields of physics and chemistry. Her discoveries have significantly advanced our understanding of the natural world, and she has become a role model for aspiring scientists, particularly women, worldwide. Despite challenges, Marie Curie broke through gender barriers and profoundly shaped the scientific landscape, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to inspire generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Avakians feel convinced that the rising tide of Turkish hostility on the horizon means little to them and will scarcely affect their day to day lives. The Avakians do not pay attention to the warning signs, and set about preparing for a family reunion with the impending visit of two well-to-do sons - landowner Aram, who resides in Turkey, and Assadour, a physician living in Venice. These illusions come crashing down when a Turkish military regiment crops up at the house, annihilates every male member of the family and forces the ladies to trek off into the Syrian desert, where they will be left to rot. With them goes one of the little boys of the family, who was dressed as a girl in order not to be killed.

Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health. Answer:","output":"Question: According to the article, what is the impact of poor air quality on heart health? A) Poor air quality has no effect on heart health B) Exposure to high levels of pollutants can increase the risk of heart attack by up to 5% within days of exposure C) Poor air quality only affects individuals with pre-existing heart conditions D) Air pollution presents a larger risk for heart problems than smoking and high blood pressure Answer: B) Exposure to high levels of pollutants can increase the risk of heart attack by up to 5% within days of exposure"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world.\\" answer the question \\"What does Darwin theorize about different species with regard to variety?\\"","output":"Though the sentence \\"Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world\\" touches upon one of the ideas in Darwin's theory on variation, it does not completely answer the question \\"What does Darwin theorize about different species with regard to variety?\\" To provide a long and detailed answer to the question, we need to delve deeper into Charles Darwin's thoughts and theories. In particular, his most famous work, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" where Darwin presents his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for the variety and diversity of species. Darwin observed that within given populations, no two individuals are exactly alike; there is always some variation among individuals. This observation laid the groundwork for his theory of evolution, as it recognizes the importance of variety in shaping the natural world. Darwin emphasized that the variety among individuals within a species is essential for a species to survive and adapt to changing environmental conditions. According to his theory, the traits that are beneficial for survival and reproduction will become more common in the population over time, while traits that are less beneficial, or even detrimental, will become less common. This process of selection leads to the formation of new species and the extinction of others. Further, Darwin theorized that this variety arises from several sources: 1. Sexual reproduction: Two parents contribute genetic material to the offspring, resulting in a unique combination of genes that produces different traits in individuals. 2. Mutation: Changes in DNA sequences lead to new traits or variations in existing traits, some of which may be beneficial, neutral, or harmful to the organism. 3. Genetic recombination: During the process of reproduction, the genetic material from each parent gets recombined in various ways, which can lead to new combinations of traits in offspring. 4. Gene flow: The movement of individuals and their genes between populations can introduce new genetic variation. Although Darwin did not have a complete understanding of genetics and heredity at his time, it is interesting to note that his theories foreshadowed many modern concepts in biology. In fact, his work paved the way for the modern theory of evolution called the \\"Modern Synthesis,\\" which combines Darwin's natural selection concepts with Mendelian genetics. Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist and biologist, independently came to similar conclusions as Darwin about natural selection, which is why both names are mentioned in the sentence. However, Darwin's contributions are more widely recognized because he articulated his theory more comprehensively in his writings. In conclusion, while the sentence given highlights the importance of variety for understanding the natural world, Darwin's theory of evolution goes beyond examining variations among individuals within the same species. It explains how new species arise from these variations and how the process of natural selection acts on them. To answer the question \\"What does Darwin theorize about different species with regard to variety?\\" fully, one should emphasize the significance of variation among individuals, the sources of this variety, and how natural selection acting on these variations results in the evolution of species and the immense diversity of life forms that we observe today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.wordpress.android. Answer:","output":"Title: Decent App with Some Room for Improvement Review: As an avid blogger and user of various content management platforms, I recently tested out the org.wordpress.android app, giving it an overall rating of 3 stars. While the app offers some useful features and basic functionalities for managing a WordPress blog on the go, I believe there's still room for improvements in certain areas to provide a more seamless and comfortable user experience. Pros: 1. User Interface: The app has a clean and easy-to-navigate user interface, making it straightforward for users to switch between different sections like posts, pages, and media. The color schemes and fonts used in the app blend well with the brand identity of WordPress, providing a touch of familiarity for users already accustomed to WordPress. 2. Basic Functionality: org.wordpress.android allows users to create and edit posts, pages, and comments, as well as manage their media library. The essential formatting options, like bold, italic, and hyperlinking are available, which makes it convenient for users to draft new posts or make quick changes without needing access to a computer. 3. Mobile Insights: The built-in analytics feature is helpful for keeping track of site traffic, visitor demographics, and popular posts. It gives site owners a snapshot of their audience and user engagement right from the app, allowing them to make informed decisions about future content and strategies. Cons: 1. Limited Editing Tools: The app's post and page editing capabilities are quite basic and do not offer the full range of options available in the web version. Advanced users who rely on custom formatting, layouts, and post elements might find it limiting and less efficient to work with compared to desktop editors. 2. Performance and Stability Issues: During my time using the org.wordpress.android app, I encountered a few instances where the app either crashed or froze. Such performance issues can be frustrating, especially when in the middle of crafting a new post or editing essential elements on the go. 3. Integration with Plugins and Themes: The app lacks support for many popular WordPress plugins and custom themes. As a result, users risk losing some key functionalities and design elements on their mobile device, making it less viable for those who have heavily customized their WordPress website. In conclusion, the org.wordpress.android app is a decent option for casual bloggers and users who require basic on-the-go access to their WordPress sites. However, with some enhancements to the post editor, improved app stability, and better integration with plugins and themes, the app has the potential to become a powerful mobile tool for users of various skill levels in the WordPress ecosystem. For now, I rate it a solid 3 stars, recognizing its practical use but also acknowledging the areas in which it could improve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, family planning consultations, and prenatal information.

Chinese literature has alyeady attracted international attention, but experts say translation remains a barrier. \\"Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already.\\"says Michel Hockx, professor of University of London. \\" It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their work outside China and to interact with readerships abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in Chinese language and Chinese culture.\\" Hockx adds: \\"We need more good translators, especially foreign translators, who know good Chinese and can translate the work into their own languages in a way that foreign readers will appreciate and understand.\\" London's independent literary agent Toby Eady, who represents many Chinese writers, including Yu Dan, met Mo about 15 years ago in China. But Eady says:\\"I still think Mo Yan's writing--and, to an extent, all Chinese writing--are not truly understood by Western readers because a part of Chinese literature is lost in translation. The translator has done a good job in translating Mo's work, but the variety of Chinese vocabulary doesn't well translate into English.\\" University of Oxford lecturer in medern Chinese literature Margaret Hillenbrand says:\\"The obvious reason for the growing global presence of Chinese literature is the growing global presence of China itself.

It is said that e-schoolbags are going to be brought into use in Chinese middle schools soon. In fact, the e-schoolbag should perhaps be called an e-textbook. It is a small computer for students. Heavy schoolbags are a problem for them. But the e-schoolbag will change everything. It is much lighter than a usual schoolbag. Also it is as small as a usual book, but it can still hold all the things for study, such as a textbook, an exercise book and so on. They can be made into chips   that are as small as a stamp. The students can read the text page by page on the _ , take notes, or even send e-mails to their teachers. All they have to do is to put the right chip into the e-schoolbag and press a button  . Some say that e-textbooks can be easily broken; some say it is not good to students' eyes. But only time will tell. E-schoolbags are used for   _  . A) cooking food B) making chips C) computer games D) school study The answer to this question is:","output":"D) school study.  The e-schoolbag is an innovative and convenient solution for middle school students in China who struggle with heavy schoolbags. This electronic tool, which can be more appropriately called an e-textbook, is essentially a small computer for students. It is designed to address the issues caused by the weight of traditional schoolbags, thus improving the overall learning experience for students.  E-schoolbags are considerably lighter than usual schoolbags and their compact size is comparable to that of a regular book. This versatile device can accommodate various study materials such as textbooks, exercise books, and so on, which can be transformed into small chips, comparable in size to a postage stamp. By reducing the physical load on students, e-schoolbags enable them to focus more on their education and minimize the stress associated with carrying heavy loads. Students can effortlessly browse through pages of text digitally on the e-schoolbag, take notes, and even send emails to their teachers. All they need to do is insert the appropriate chip into the e-schoolbag and press a button. Despite concerns regarding the durability of e-textbooks and potential effects on students' eyes, their effectiveness as an educational tool remains to be determined through further use and observation.

Article: Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying. Question: What are teeth made out of?","output":"Teeth are not made out of bone; they are composed of various tissues that have different levels of density and hardness. The three main components of teeth are enamel, dentine, and cementum. Each of these components plays a crucial role in the overall structure and function of teeth. 1. Enamel: Enamel is the hardest and most highly mineralized substance in the human body. It forms the outermost layer of the tooth and is primarily responsible for protecting the tooth from wear and tear during biting, chewing, and grinding. Enamel is made primarily of hydroxyapatite, a crystalline calcium phosphate mineral that provides strength and durability. Due to its mineralized nature, enamel is translucent and can appear in various shades of white or off-white. Additionally, enamel does not contain any living cells and cannot regenerate once it is damaged, which is why it is essential to maintain proper oral hygiene to prevent enamel erosion. 2. Dentine: Dentine is the second hardest tissue in the body, and it is located directly beneath the enamel layer. It is slightly softer and more porous than enamel, and it is primarily composed of hydroxyapatite crystals, with small amounts of collagen fibers and water. Dentine makes up the bulk of the tooth's structure and provides support for the enamel layer. It also contains tiny tubules that house odontoblastic processes, which are extensions of odontoblasts (cells responsible for producing dentine). These tubules allow for the transmission of sensory signals (such as pain or pressure) from the surface of the tooth to the pulp, and they contribute to the proprioceptive ability of teeth. 3. Cementum: Cementum is the least dense of the three primary tooth components, and it is a thin layer of calcified tissue that covers the root of the tooth. It is primarily composed of hydroxyapatite, collagen fibers, and water, and it serves to connect the tooth to the periodontal ligament and the surrounding alveolar bone. Cementum is essential for tooth stability and acts as a protective layer for the underlying dentine of the root. In addition to these three components, teeth also comprise the dental pulp, which is found at the center of the tooth. The dental pulp contains blood vessels, nerves, and various connective tissues that provide the tooth with essential nutrients and sensory information. This combination of tissues allows for the healthy functioning and sensation of teeth during everyday activities such as eating, speaking, and maintaining overall oral health."},{"instruction":"As a new year is just around the corner, I, like many of you, am taking stock in my life.

Please answer the following question: Greenwich   is on the River, five miles from the middle of London, and its history is two thousand years old. The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \\"green village\\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things, and bought small pieces of the palace garden with money. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea because their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer   in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were.You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich time. Charles made John Flamsteed try to find   _  .

Q:Question: how tennessee became a state I found the following answer on Google: In addition, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame , an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly in which Tennessee played a crucial role, is based in Nashville. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google about the Rockabilly Hall of Fame does not correctly explain how Tennessee became a state. I will provide you with a detailed and long answer regarding this topic. Tennessee's journey to statehood can be traced back to the mid-1700s when European settlers arrived in the region, which was originally populated by Native American tribes including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek, and Shawnee. With the increasing number of European settlers, mainly of British and Irish descent, the area started developing its own unique culture and economy. Following the American Revolution, North Carolina gained territorial claims over what is now considered Tennessee. However, due to the state's economic problems and the difficulty of governing such a distant and remote territory, North Carolina ceded the land west of the Appalachian Mountains to the United States federal government in 1789. The federal government created the Southwest Territory, which included present-day Tennessee, and appointed William Blount as the territorial governor in March 1790. During this time, the population of the territory grew, and settlers were encouraged to move to the region to help the land become self-governing and function as an organized territory. Differences in governing views and politics also played a role in the push for statehood, as the growing population desired more direct representation. To qualify for statehood, the Southwest Territory needed 60,000 residents, as indicated by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. By 1795, the territory had achieved that number, and efforts began to draft a state constitution. In January 1796, delegates convened in Knoxville to draft the state's first constitution. The U.S. Congress was presented with the petition for statehood following the Tennessee Constitutional Convention. On June 1, 1796, President George Washington signed a bill admitting Tennessee as the 16th state of the United States. Tennessee was the first state created from a federal territory and set a precedent for the admission of future states. In summary, Tennessee became a state through a combination of population growth, settlers' push for political representation, and the successful completion of the state's first constitution. The Rockabilly Hall of Fame is unrelated to this particular aspect of Tennessee's history; it merely highlights the state's role in the development of the rockabilly genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Rick Santorum Wins Alabama and Mississippi, Pledges to ‘Compete Everywhere’ Rick Santorum won both Alabama and Mississippi Tuesday night, sweeping the Super Tuesday of the South and cementing the notion this is truly a two man battle with Mitt Romney. The former Pennsylvania senator seemed to surprise even himself when he walked out on the stage in Lafayette, La., to cheers and said, “We did it again!” Flanked by wife, Karen and three of his children, Santorum immediately hit Romney, who earlier today said Santorum was at the “desperate end” to his campaign. “People are saying you’ve been outspent and you know, everybody’s talking about all the math and all the things in this race is inevitable,” Santorum said. “Well, for someone who thinks this race is inevitable, he spent a whole lot of money against me for a race that was inevitable.” Vastly outspent by Romney in both states, Santorum was still able to take them both. Mississippi and Alabama have a socially conservative electorate, but on the trail in both states Santorum shied away from talking about those topics, telling reporters in Alabama last week he thought the press covered that issue closely enough and he was going to focus on national security and energy, which he did. He told supporters at a hotel Tuesday evening that his is a “grassroots campaign.” “We will compete everywhere, we will compete everywhere,” Santorum said. “The time is now for conservatives to pull together. The time is now to make sure, make sure that we have the best chance to win this election and the best chance to win this election is to nominate a conservative to go up against Barack Obama who can take him on in every issue.” The candidate runs a campaign like none of his current competitors or even like the campaigns he ran previously: There is no bus, no headquarters, and a scaled down staff, all thanks to frugality. But there are also frequent expressions of pride that the campaign and candidate feel they can win with none of the expected trappings of a modern race for the White House. “Who would have ever thought in the age of media that we have in this country today that ordinary folks across this country can defy the odds day in and day out,” Santorum said. Santorum chose to give his speech in neither Mississippi or Alabama and instead went to Louisiana, which votes March 24. He looked directly into the camera and pledged to Louisiana voters he would end the “extreme environmental policies of this administration.” “We wanted to be here in Lafayette,” Santorum said. “We will put this town back to work so you can have a better quality of life.” Near the conclusion of his speech, some networks called Mississippi for Santorum while he was on stage. Dressed in a suit and a light purple tie, he immediately embraced his wife. Karen Santorum seemed just as surprised, kissing her husband as the crowd cheered. Results in the state of the Hawaii were not expected until early Wednesday morning Eastern time, but both Santorum’s daughter Elizabeth and Romney’s son Matt were campaigning in the 50th state for them over the past few days. Santorum was to travel to Puerto Rico tonight, where he will spend two days campaigning. The governor of Puerto Rico has already endorsed Romney, but is a friend of Santorum’s.","output":"This news article is about a man named Rick Santorum who won in Alabama and Mississippi.

While many people in China will remember Confucius on his special day,few people in the United States will give him a passing thought.It's nothing personal.Most Americans don't even remember the birthdays of their own national heroes. But this doesn't mean that Americans don't care about Confucius.In many ways he has become a bridge that foreigners must cross if they want to reach a deeper understanding of China. In the past two decades,the Chinese study programs have gained huge popularity in Western universities.More recently, the Chinese government has set up Confucius Institutes in more than 80 countries.These schools teach both Chinese language and culture.The main courses of Chinese culture usually included Chinese art,history and philosophy.Some social scientists suggest that Westerners should take advantage of the old Chinese wisdom to make up for the drawbacks of Westerners philosophy.Students in the United States,at the same time,are racing to learn Chinese.So they will be ready for life in a world where China is an equal power with the United States.Businessmen who hope to make money in China are reading books about Confucius to understand their Chinese customers. So the old thinker's ideas are still alive and well. Today China attracts the West more than ever, and it will need more teachers to introduce Confucius and Chinese culture to the West. As for the old thinker,he will not soon be forgotten by people in the West,even if his birthday is. The reason why few Americans remember Confucius on his birthday is probably that  _  . A) they don't care about Confucius at all. B) they consider their own national heroes more important. C) he has become a bridge between foreigners and China. D) they don't pay much attention to the birthdays of famous people.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who is one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists? is inside the article: Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \\"Our Song\\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner. Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \\"Mean\\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Blank Space\\", and \\"Bad Blood\\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\" topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US.

Choices:  - feeling of guilt - jail time - being rewarded - fear - going to prison  The rationale to choose \\"jail time\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"When a person is accused of committing a murder, they are facing a range of serious consequences. Among the choices given, the most fitting answer is \\"jail time,\\" and the rationale for this selection is explained below: 1. Feeling of guilt: Although a person accused of murder might experience feelings of guilt, this is not a guaranteed consequence for everyone. Some individuals might not feel guilty at all, while others might feel guilty about different aspects of their lives. Furthermore, feelings of guilt are subjective and not a direct result of being accused of murder. 2. Jail time: This is the most fitting answer, as jail time comprises a significant part of the legal consequences faced by a person accused of committing a murder. If they are found guilty, the person may be sentenced to prison for an extended period, often with the possibility of life imprisonment or even the death penalty in some jurisdictions. With the gravity of their alleged crime, a person accused of murder faces overwhelming potential consequences in terms of legal repercussions and the loss of personal freedom. 3. Being rewarded: This choice is entirely irrelevant and inappropriate, as a person accused of murder would not be rewarded. On the contrary, they face severe consequences for their alleged actions and would have to stand trial to determine their innocence or guilt in the eyes of the law. 4. Fear: While it is realistic for a person accused of murder to experience fear, this is not a direct consequence of being accused. Fear is an emotional response that might vary depending on the individual's personality, past experiences, and other factors. However, fear alone does not sufficiently address the severity of the situation or the potential consequences that the accused individual would have to face. 5. Going to prison: While this choice is similar to \\"jail time\\" in terms of legal consequences, \\"going to prison\\" specifically refers to being found guilty and sentenced to serve time in a correctional facility. Meanwhile, \\"jail time\\" captures the broader concept of being detained and facing legal repercussions immediately after the accusation, which might include shorter periods in jail for preliminary investigations or trials. In summary, \\"jail time\\" is the most appropriate answer because it directly captures the significant legal consequences faced by a person accused of committing murder. Other choices, such as feeling guilt, fear, or going to prison, might occur in certain instances, but they do not adequately encompass the primary consequences someone in this situation would face."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: \\"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.\\" His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of \\"the most recent eight songs that [he'd] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar\\" to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a seven-inch record.  Regarding the record, Smith said: \\"I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately.\\" Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: \\"The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest--Mudhoney and Nirvana--and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.\\"  The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled \\"Kiwi Maddog 20/20\\" (a reference to the low-end fortified wine), had full band instrumentation.  One of Smith's first solo performances was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, Smith was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. She later recorded one of his songs, \\"I Figured You Out\\", which he had discarded for sounding \\"too much like the Eagles\\".  The same year, Smith released a split 7\\" single with Pete Krebs, contributing the track \\"No Confidence Man\\" as the single's B-side.

Time is in the Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park community area on Chicago's South Side, near the Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the University of Chicago campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Time is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.The sculpture is located a few blocks from Taft's studio, the Lorado Taft Midway Studios, now a Chicago Landmark and National Historic Landmark, located at 60th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Other notable sculptures nearby include Henry Moore's National Historic Landmark Nuclear Energy, which is on the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis of the batter rising less can have an effect on the process of baking a bigger cake. If the batter does not rise as much as it is supposed to, the final product may be denser, flatter, and potentially less appealing in both appearance and texture. A direct effect on the process would be the need to adjust the recipe or ingredients to ensure that the cake rises properly. This may involve increasing the amount of rising agents like baking powder or baking soda or improving the mixing technique to better incorporate air into the batter. An indirect effect on the process could be potential changes to the baking time or oven temperature, as a denser batter may require additional time or adjusted temperature to cook evenly. Additionally, it may affect the final presentation, as a cake that has not risen well could be uneven or harder to stack if preparing a multi-layered cake. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the batter rising less can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of baking a bigger cake. Adjustments to the recipe, technique, and baking parameters may be necessary to achieve the desired outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer: Early releases of information by governments, particularly those released for use by the \\"Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War\\" were shown to be incomplete and biased. Question: what caused ww Answer:","output":"World War I, also known as the Great War, was sparked by a number of complex factors and events that unfolded during the early 20th century. The primary causes can be classified into four interrelated categories: political, economic, social, and military. Various nations and alliances were seeking to advance their interests at the expense of others, leading to tensions and a precarious balance of power.  1. Mutual Defense Alliances: By the early 20th century, Europe had seen the formation of several powerful alliances. These alliances involved mutual defense, in which the countries agreed to come to each other's aid in case of an attack. The major alliances of World War I were the Triple Entente (composed of Britain, France, and Russia) and the Triple Alliance (composed of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy). The interconnected alliance system contributed to the escalation of the conflict into a full-blown global war. 2. Imperialism: The desire for overseas territories and resources led to competition and rivalries amongst European powers. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, countries sought to expand their empires to increase their political and economic influence. This competition fueled bitterness and mistrust, particularly between the major powers of Europe. 3. Militarism: The buildup of military forces and resources in Europe during this period fueled an arms race. Germany, Britain, and other countries felt compelled to amass impressive military arsenals in order to keep pace with their rivals. This militaristic culture, along with technological advancements in warfare, resulted in heightened tensions and increased the likelihood of war. 4. Nationalism: Pride in one's nation, or nationalism, was a potent force during this era. Many countries desired to assert their dominance and power on the world stage, while various ethnic groups within empires sought self-determination and independence. The Balkans was a hotbed of nationalist fervor due to its diverse mix of cultures, religions, and ethnicities. This boiling pot of nationalism contributed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary. The immediate cause of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914. The assassination occurred in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, a province annexed by Austria-Hungary despite Serbia and other Slavic countries contesting the annexation. This act of violence set off a chain reaction of events due to the complex web of alliances and rivalries in Europe, as Austria-Hungary, backed by Germany, declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. This declaration of war set in motion the other alliances, eventually leading to a full-scale global conflict that lasted until 1918."},{"instruction":"U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Coal is mined out of the ground - Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin A:","output":"The final step in the process after the turbines spin is the production of electricity. When the spinning turbines interact with an electromagnetic field, they generate electrical energy. This electricity is subsequently converted to an appropriate voltage using transformers and then transmitted through power lines to the consumers, such as residential areas, industrial complexes, and commercial establishments. In summary, the process involves the following steps: 1. Coal is mined out of the ground: Large quantities of coal are extracted from underground or open-pit mines. 2. Coal is pulverized into fine powder: Once the coal has been mined, it is crushed into a fine powder to maximize the surface area exposed to combustion. 3. The coal is mixed with hot air: This step aids in igniting the coal more efficiently. The mixture creates the optimal fuel-to-air ratio for combustion. 4. The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler: The fine coal powder and hot air are forcefully blended together into a boiler chamber or furnace. 5. The coal and hot air burn over a fire: The combustion process takes place as the coal and hot air burn, releasing heat energy. 6. Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler: The thermal energy released from combustion is used to heat water circulating through pipes that run through the boiler walls. 7. The water turns into steam: As the water absorbs the heat, it is converted into high-pressure steam, which contains a significant amount of energy. 8. The steam presses against turbines: The high-pressure steam enters the turbine blades and exerts a strong force, causing them to spin at high speeds. 9. The turbines spin: With the steam's force, the turbines rotate continuously, which drives an associated generator. The final step: The spinning turbines generate electricity. This electrical energy is voltage-adjusted, transmitted through power lines, and finally delivered to consumers for diverse usage such as lighting, heating, cooling, and powering various appliances and devices. The entire process is part of a coal-fired power plant, which functions as a critical energy source in many countries around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Liverpool produced a number of nationally and internationally successful popular singers in the 1950s, including traditional pop stars Frankie Vaughan and Lita Roza, and one of the most successful British rock and roll stars in Billy Fury. Many Lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s, out of which by the early 1960s a flourishing culture of beat groups began to emerge, particularly around Liverpool and Manchester. It has been estimated that there were around 350 bands active in and around Liverpool in this era, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs, among them the Beatles. After their national success from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry & the Pacemakers, the Searchers and Cilla Black. The first act to break through in the UK who were not from Liverpool, or managed by Brian Epstein, were Freddie and the Dreamers, who were based in Manchester, as were Herman's Hermits and the Hollies. Led by the Beatles, beat groups from the region spearheaded the British Invasion of the US, which made a major contribution to the development of rock music. After the decline of beat groups in the late 1960s the centre of rock culture shifted to London and there were relatively few local bands who achieved national prominence until the growth of a disco funk scene and the punk rock revolution in the mid and late 1970s.

Choose from: (a). negative (b). positive","output":"In order to analyze the sentiment of the tweet, we'll need to break down the different elements and expressions in the message and understand the emotions they convey before we can determine if it's negative or positive. Let's look at the tweet more closely: Tweet: @Tinchen82 I feel you! Just thinking about last European tour leg here ... It can suck big times!! First, let's identify key phrases and terms that may have a sentiment attached to them: 1. \\"I feel you!\\" - This expression is used to show empathy, understanding, or agreement. The sentiment here is positive as it conveys a sense of solidarity with the other person. 2. \\"last European tour leg\\" - This part of the tweet is neutral, as it only mentions an event (i.e., the last part of a European tour). There's no sentiment attached to this phrase by itself. 3. \\"It can suck big times!!\\" - This phrase conveys a negative sentiment. \\"Suck\\" is a slang term often used to express that something is undesirable, unpleasant, or unsatisfactory. Now that we have looked at the key phrases and their sentiments let us analyze the overall sentiment of the tweet. The positive sentiment (\\"I feel you!\\") is related to the author agreeing and sympathizing with the recipient of the message (@Tinchen82). However, the emotion behind the tweet seems to be more significantly influenced by the negative sentiment (\\"It can suck big times!!\\"), which is directed towards the experience of the \\"last European tour leg\\" and effectively communicates that the tour leg had some challenging and unpleasant moments. Therefore, considering the emotional weight contained in the tweet, we can now determine the sentiment of the message. In this case, despite the empathy shown by the author, the overall sentiment of the tweet is: (a) negative"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Un o'r rhain ydy Sarah Tyler Davies o Gaernarfon. Bu'n siarad gyda Cymru Fyw i esbonio'n fanwl y diwrnod wnaeth arwain at ei phenderfyniad i gael tatŵ: Dwi wedi dioddef efo problemau i 'nghalon ers i fi gael fy ngeni. Ges i fy ngeni efo congenital heart defect, sef transposition of the greater arteries. Roedd fy nghalon y ffordd arall rownd, ac felly roeddwn i'n un o'r rhain oedd yn cael eu galw'n blue babies. Doedd y galon ddim yn gallu pwmpio digon o waed o gwmpas y corff ac felly roedd babanod yn tueddu i edrych yn las oherwydd y diffyg ocsigen. Pan o'n i tua wyth mis oed ges i open heart surgery wnaeth drwsio'r galon am ychydig, a llawdriniaeth arall pan o'n i tua naw oed a 14 oed. Wnaeth y triniaethau hyn olygu bod fi wedi medru byw bywyd gwbl normal a llawn am fwyafrif fy ieuenctid.

Er bod fi'n gwybod bod fy nghalon ddim yn gwbl 100%, doedd dim rheswm gen i feddwl fod yn rhaid cymryd gofal arbennig. Ond un dydd, chwe blynedd yn ôl, ddigwyddodd rhywbeth wnaeth 'neud i fi ail-asesu fy mywyd yn gyfan gwbl. O'n i 'di dechra' pendwmpian ar y settee efo'r gŵr, ac roedd y ddau ohono' ni wedi syrthio'i gysgu. Ond yn sydyn wnaeth y ci ddechra' aflonyddu a mynd ati i ddeffro'r gŵr. Drwy lwc, wnaeth hwnnw sylweddoli bod rhywbeth o'i le a dechreuodd roi CPR a mouth to mouth tan i'r ambiwlans gyrraedd. Ro'n i wedi dioddef cardiac arrest sydyn ac annisgwyl, ac oni bai am y ci, fyddwn ni siŵr o fod ddim yma heddiw. Yn blwmp ac yn blaen, ro'n i wedi mynd. Dim pỳls, dim curiad.

Wnaeth y doctoriaid esbonio bod fy nghalon ar y noson wedi dechrau curo ar gyflymder o 400 curiad y funud... i'w gymharu gyda thua 140-160 i berson cyffredin. Doedd hi ddim yn bosib i 'nghalon i barhau fel yna am hir ac felly... mi stopiodd. Gymrodd hi amser hir i fi ddygymod â hyn ac roedd dod wyneb yn wyneb â'r ffeithiau am fy mhrofiad wedi newid fy agwedd at fywyd, y ffordd o'n i'n ymddwyn, y ffordd fyddai'n codi'r plant, bob dim.

O ganlyniad, rŵan mae gen i pacemaker, ac ICD, sef defibrillator, sydd yn rhoi sioc i fi os ydy 'nghalon i'n curo'n gyflymach na 210 curiad y funud. Y ddau beiriant yma sy'n cadw 'nghalon i dan reolaeth. Ond rhyw chwe wythnos wedi'r cardiac arrest, wnaeth fy nghorff ddechrau ymosod ar y gwifrau, a thra roeddwn ni yn y gawod, dechreuodd yr ICD rhoi shocksi fi. Roedd o fel bod rhywun wedi mynd â crowbar a tharo fi ar fy mhen... fel rhyw fath o thud. Do'n i methu dallt be' oedd o'i le.... nes i gau fy llygaid, a wnaeth o ddigwydd eto. Dyna pryd nes i sylweddoli taw'r peiriant oedd wedi mynd off. Ar ôl cyrraedd Ysbyty Gwynedd, wnaeth y doctoriaid ddarganfod bod y peiriant wedi administratio rhyw 40-50 o shocks... mewn rhyw 15 munud, a nes i ond teimlo rhyw 15 ohonyn nhw. Gymrodd hi fisoedd i mi ddygymod â'r newid, ac am gyfnod hir, ro'n i'n ofni fyddai'r un peth yn digwydd eto. Ro'n i mewn ofn cyson. Ar ôl misoedd o deimlo fel hyn, nes i benderfynu cael y tatŵ.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: Who organized the Jerome Historical Society? , can you please find it?   Meanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic faulting in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke.Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome's population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales. They organized the Jerome Historical Society in 1953 and opened a museum and gift shop.To encourage tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark status for Jerome; it was granted by the federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park. By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the 21st century include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants.

In the first quarter, Denver was first out of the gate as FB Michael Pittman got a 1-yard TD run.  The Chargers would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 34-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Denver replied with QB Jay Cutler completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  San Diego would immediately respond with RB Darren Sproles returning the kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown, yet the Broncos replied with rookie kicker Matt Prater getting a 52-yard field goal.  The Chargers would strike as their lead as QB Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, yet Denver retaliated with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the third quarter, San Diego started to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, and Kaeding kicked a 21-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Chargers took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles. Fortunately, the Broncos responded with a 12-play, 80-yard drive (which included a controversial officiating call that turned a Cutler fumble into an incomplete pass) that was capped off with Cutler's 4-yard TD pass to rookie WR Eddie Royal, followed by Cutler's successful 2-point conversion pass to Royal.

By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She’s just too nice to say it. A great marriage isn’t built because it’s perfect.

Don't waste your money on Burril's book. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"This product review clearly conveys a negative sentiment. Several factors contribute to the determination of this sentiment. Firstly, the title \\"nothing more than a solely author-biased research project\\" already indicates dissatisfaction, as it suggests that the book is solely based on the author's perspective rather than incorporating a variety of viewpoints or research sources. The use of the word \\"solely\\" emphasizes the idea that the book is overly limited in scope. Secondly, the review itself begins with the statement \\"very poor material,\\" which is a strong expression of negativity and implies that the content is of low quality. The choice of the word \\"poor\\" indicates that the reviewer believes the book is not up to the desired standard compared to other books in the same field or category. The reviewer then reinforces their negative sentiment by contrasting \\"Burril's book\\" with other \\"very good books out there,\\" specifically naming \\"Divorce Poison\\" as an example. By making this comparison, the reviewer establishes a benchmark by which they believe Burril's book falls short. This statement once again highlights a disparity in quality between the book being reviewed and other available options on the subject matter. Furthermore, the direct recommendation against purchasing Burril's book cements the negative sentiment. The statement \\"do not recommend this one\\" is a clear indication that the reviewer does not believe the book is worth spending money on. Additionally, the reviewer advises potential readers to \\"not waste your money\\" on the book, reiterating their belief that it does not offer good value for the price or fails to provide useful information that justifies its cost. Overall, the product review unquestionably portrays a negative sentiment. The reviewer expresses disappointment in the book's perceived limitations, low quality, and lack of value compared to other works on the topic. The strong language used throughout the review solidifies the conclusion that the reviewer's opinion is firmly negative and does not offer any positive attributes to redeem the book."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles in the house. Miles awakens her in the middle of the night, and she finds a swarm of flies in the house.

Here is an article: Reserve Bank of India chief, Raghuram Rajan, has made a name in global economic policy circles for his broadsides against advanced economies’ central banks and the spillover effect of their extreme stimulus policies on emerging markets. The gist of his complaint: smaller economies like his get unfairly buffeted by sharp shifts of capital flows triggered by the expansion and contraction of unconventional monetary policies adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and others. Now, Mr. Rajan seems more relaxed about the state of global monetary policy, at least for the moment, arguing that as the improving U.S. economy heads in a different direction from struggling Europe and Japan, that will tend to smooth out global gyrations, and give India and others more flexibility to pursue their own monetary policies. “The differentiation in policy is good,” he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. When he first took office a year ago, Mr. Rajan faced an immediate crisis, as the prospect of Fed “tapering”—winding down its bond-buying stimulus program—triggered a sharp outflow of capital from India and other emerging markets. That forced the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates to stanch the bleeding, even as economic growth slowed. In April, Mr. Rajan gave a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., insisting on some kind of global coordination mechanism to help protect emerging economies from the actions of the world’s main central banks. “The current non-system in international monetary policy is, in my view, a substantial risk,” he said. “A first step to prescribing the right medicine is to recognize the cause of the sickness. Extreme monetary easing, in my view, is more cause than medicine.” But now, as the European Central Bank seems to be heading toward just such extreme monetary easing, Mr. Rajan is more relaxed. In fact, he thinks it’s a good thing, for Europe, and for the global economy. “As strong economies like the U.S. and the U.K. start going back to more normal monetary settings, weaker economies will depreciate their currencies, and will get some boost to growth from exports,” Mr. Rajan said in the Journal interview. “That’s really the advantage when policies get differentiated.” And that doesn’t just help Europe. It helps policy makers in India as well. Many developing countries use dollars and euros to trade on global markets. As a result, their central banks may have to follow Fed and ECB monetary moves. That’s because, when the Fed raises rates, for example, they have little choice but follow, or face a sharp capital outflow as investors suddenly see higher returns in higher-rate economies. But with policies in major advanced economies on diverging paths, countries like India could get more sway in their interest-rate decisions. Indeed, many economists now see that India has gained more freedom to chart its own course, less chained to the Fed, thanks in part to Mr. Rajan’s successful steering of last year’s minicrisis. Even as the Fed continues to wind down its bond-buying and heads toward likely rate increases next year, the RBI seems to have freedom to keep rates on hold, or even to cut. At Merrill Lynch, analysts said in a recent note that RBI and Fed monetary policy are no longer “synchronous.” UBS economists see the RBI cutting rates by two percentage points in less than two years, even if the U.S. raises rates. Still, Mr. Rajan remains critical of the process of setting global monetary policy. As he has said in the past, and as he repeats often, developing economies are just bystanders, and the breather he sees for India due to current global economic circumstances is just a lucky coincidence. “India doesn’t have a big role in this game,” Mr. Rajan said. “We experience the consequences but we’re really not players there.” Follow @WSJecon for economic news and analysis Follow @WSJCentralBanks for central banking news and analysis Get WSJ economic analysis delivered to your inbox: Sign up for the WSJ's Grand Central, a daily report on global central banking Sign up for the Real Time Economics daily summary Write a title for it.","output":"RBI Chief Raghuram Rajan Gains Confidence in Global Monetary Policy Amid Diverging Paths of Major Economies"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The best family vacation that I ever had was going on a road trip to Myrtle Beach. The trip was for 2 weeks during the March break from school. This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2 So to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C When it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f Another time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine  and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it. We would keep going until one of us begged for mercy because we had to give our faces a rest.7 So while I can remember us having a great time on the beach, laughing a lot trying to put the tent up in the rain, what I remember the most of that trip and what always makes me smile the most is remembering the pain that our faces would be in after the trip.g Question: What does the author mean by saying \\"we were at each other's throats\\"?A - We were fighting with each other./ - We used up our skills.A - We were quite out of breath.= - We were about to fall asleep.= A:","output":"The author means by saying \\"we were at each other's throats\\" that they were fighting with each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the Greek-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire, regardless of the dialect they spoke. Especially in Crete, a prolonged revolt in 1866–1869 had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between Russia and the Ottomans in 1877, Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor, and too concerned of British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, Thessaly and small parts of Epirus were ceded to Greece as part of the Treaty of Berlin, while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member that designed the cover of the 1983 album? ?  In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning... The answer is:","output":"Waters. The last name of the band member that designed the cover of the 1983 album is Waters, as mentioned in the passage, \\"Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself.\\" Roger Waters was the member of Pink Floyd who took on the responsibility of designing the album cover for \\"The Final Cut\\" released in 1983."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...  Paragraph: David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would case B show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case A?

Context: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.  - Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).  - The common dolphin is the name given to two species ( and possibly a third ) of dolphin making up the genus Delphinus . Prior to the mid- 1990s , most taxonomists only recognised one species in this genus , the common dolphin Delphinus delphis . Modern cetologists usually recognise two species -- the short - beaked common dolphin , which retains the systematic name Delphinus delphis , and the long - beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis . The common dolphin is not the dolphin of popular imagination despite its name ; that distinction belongs to the bottlenose dolphin due to its widespread use in marine parks and its appearance in the television series Flipper . However , this dolphin was the most frequently represented in the art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome .  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \\"whale\\" rather than \\"dolphin\\", such as the killer whale and the pilot whales. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea.  - River dolphins are a widely distributed group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.  - Iniidae is a family of river dolphins containing one living and four extinct genera.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.  - Cetacea are a widely distributed and diverse clade of aquatic mammals that today consists of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetaceans are carnivorous and finned. Most species live in the sea, some in rivers. The name is derived from the Latin \\"cetus\\" \\"whale\\" and Greek \\"ketos\\" \\"huge fish\\".  - Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates.

The premise and the hypothesis describe two completely different scenarios involving different individuals tackling different activities. In the given premise, we are told about a \\"bearded man playing guitar leaning against a white wall\\". An image is painted of a man engaged in the act of making music, with the added detail that he has a beard and is leaning against a wall. On the contrary, the hypothesis describes a \\"clean shaven man taking a bath\\". Not only is the scenario different, but also the characteristics of the man described in the hypothesis do not match with that of the man portrayed in the premise. Where the first is engaged in an act of leisure and creativity (playing the guitar), the second is engaged in an act of personal care (taking a bath).  Additionally, the descriptions of the men are contrasted by stating that one man has a beard and the other is clean-shaven. This difference in physical appearance further emphasizes the conceptual distance between the premise and the hypothesis.  In conclusion, the premise does not provide any information that would help us to determine if the hypothesis is true or false.

The input format is \\"premise (1)alternative_1(2)alternative_2\\", and the output should either be \\"1\\" or \\"2\\" based on your judgment. Task: The premise is \\"Keluarga itu ingin mengenal tetangga baru mereka.\\" (The family wants to get to know their new neighbors.)

(2) alternative_2: \\"Keluarga itu melambai ke tetangganya dari halaman mereka.\\" (The family waves to their neighbors from their yard.) Solution: To decide which alternative is more plausibly the cause or effect of the situation described in the premise, we compare the two alternatives: - Alternative 1 involves the family inviting their neighbors for dinner, which is a more effective way of getting to know them. - Alternative 2 involves the family waving to their neighbors from their yard, which is a friendly gesture but might not lead to getting to know them as well as having dinner together. Based on the guidelines, we would choose alternative 1 because it is more likely to be the cause or effect related to the premise of getting to know the new neighbors.

It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music.  In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", as well as \\"sweet [and] slightly alien\\". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals.In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy.

Write the answer: Who refuses Mr St John Rivers’ offer of marriage?","output":"Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Charlotte Bronte's novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" refuses Mr. St. John Rivers' offer of marriage. The reasons behind Jane's refusal and the significance of this rejection are essential aspects of the story, shedding light on Jane's personal journey and growth throughout the novel. Mr. St. John Rivers is Jane's cousin, who she meets later in the novel after fleeing Thornfield Hall - the estate where she works as a governess for Mr. Edward Rochester, whom Jane falls in love with. However, Jane's love story with Mr. Rochester faces several obstacles, forcing her to leave Thornfield.  While living with her newfound relatives, particularly with Mr. St. John Rivers and his sisters Mary and Diana, Jane grows to appreciate their kind and caring nature. Mr. St. John Rivers, an ambitious, focused, and religious man, proposes to Jane, but not out of romantic love. He views Jane as a suitable partner for his missionary goals in India, believing that her morals and practical nature make her an ideal life partner in terms of their shared faith and good works. Moreover, marrying Jane would provide her with financial security, as she has recently inherited a substantial sum of money from her late uncle. Despite the sensible and noble reasons presented by Mr. St. John Rivers, Jane refuses his marriage proposal. Jane's decision can be attributed to several factors: 1. Authentic Love: Jane values genuine emotional connection and yearns for true love, as she had experienced with Mr. Rochester. She senses that Mr. St. John Rivers does not truly love her, and instead, fulfilling his aspirations serves as his primary motivation in his proposal. 2. Independence: Throughout the novel, Jane exemplifies an independent and strong-willed woman who not only seeks love but also desires to maintain her dignity and autonomy. Mr. St. John Rivers' controlling nature clashes with her aspirations for self-determination. 3. Personal Growth: Refusing the proposal demonstrates Jane's growth throughout the story. Despite societal expectations and the pragmatic benefits of marrying Mr. St. John Rivers, Jane chooses to prioritize her emotional needs and self-respect. 4. Incompatible Personalities: Jane recognizes the vast differences between her own passionate and empathetic nature and Mr. St. John Rivers' cold, driven personality. She realizes they would not make a happy and fulfilling couple in the long run. After respectfully refusing Mr. St. John Rivers’ proposal, Jane returns to Thornfield Hall, only to find it burnt down. She learns about the tragic events that occurred during her absence, ultimately reconnecting with Mr. Rochester. Despite his newly acquired disabilities from the fire, Jane no longer faces obstacles in her love for Mr. Rochester, and the two marry, finding happiness and companionship with each other. In the end, Jane's refusal of Mr. St. John Rivers' proposal reiterates the importance of emotional honesty, self-awareness, and personal fulfillment embedded in the themes of Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Question: This article: In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity.... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music., what is it ?

(AP) — An Oregon man impersonated a sheriff's deputy while taking an SUV for a test drive and pulled over a motorcyclist, authorities said.      Anthony McGuire, 39, of Salem was arrested Saturday after the motorcyclist and two employees from the car lot sensed something was off and called real deputies, Sgt. Chris Baldridge of the Marion County Sheriff's Office said Monday.      Baldridge said McGuire visited Good Fellows Auto Sales three days in a row and told workers he was a sheriff's deputy. Each day, he wanted to test drive a black Chevrolet Tahoe.      On the third day, two suspicious employees decided to join the customer for the drive.      Just down the street from the lot, McGuire suddenly lowered the window and yelled at a motorcyclist to pull over. The motorcyclist obeyed and McGuire told him he was being stopped for speeding.      Baldridge said McGuire had no badge or identification, and his manner led everyone else to conclude he might be a fake. The employees from Good Fellows Auto Sales, who could not be reached for comment, told investigators that the motorcyclist had gone around the SUV because McGuire was driving very slowly.      \\"They said the motorcyclist really wasn't doing anything wrong,\\" Baldridge said. \\"He was acting for his own safety to get around the slow-moving vehicle.\\"      Baldridge said McGuire confessed to impersonating a deputy and was taken to the county jail. He was charged with criminal impersonation, a misdemeanor.      Baldridge said McGuire did not explain his actions.      Investigators think McGuire might have pulled over other drivers. Anyone who might have been a victim has been asked to call the sheriff's office.      McGuire was released from county jail Monday afternoon. It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer, and a court date has not been set.      Public records show he was arrested in December 2011 for unauthorized use of a vehicle.

This notable achievement places NYC's park system just behind that of Minneapolis in terms of excellence and quality. The ParkScore ranking evaluates urban park systems based on a comprehensive formula that takes into account several key factors essential for a thriving and accessible green space network. These factors include: 1. Median Park Size: One criterion used to rate green areas is the median size of the parks within the city. Larger parks typically offer a wider range of amenities and recreational opportunities for residents, contributing to a higher ParkScore. 2. Park Acres as Percent of City Area: This factor measures the proportion of a city's total area that is dedicated to parks and green spaces. Cities with a higher percentage of parkland are commended in the ParkScore ranking for providing sufficient open spaces for their residents to enjoy. 3. Percentage of City Residents within a Half-mile of a Park: The accessibility of parks is an essential factor in an efficient green space network, and the ParkScore ranking evaluates the proximity of parks and green spaces to the residents. A higher percentage of residents within a half-mile of a park means that more people have easy access to the city's park system without needing to travel long distances. 4. Spending on Park Services per Resident: The park system's quality is also determined by the budget allocated to maintaining and developing parks and recreational facilities. Cities with a higher investment per resident on park services boast better-maintained green spaces, attracting more visitors and ensuring their long-term sustainability. 5. Number of Playgrounds per 10,000 Residents: A city's park system is also assessed based on the number of playgrounds available for children. A higher ratio of playgrounds per resident indicates a dedication to creating an inclusive and family-friendly environment within the green spaces. According to the 2013 ParkScore ranking, New York City's impressive achievements in each of these key areas have earned its park system a well-deserved second-place rating among the 50 most populous cities in the United States. This distinction highlights the city's commitment to developing and maintaining a top-quality network of green spaces for residents and visitors alike to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perceiving the opportunity, he wasted no time sizing it up, and with a swift turn and a powerful strike, he sent the ball sailing past the Everton goalkeeper and into the back of the net. The sheer power and precision of the shot left the goalkeeper rooted to the spot, helpless to stop Willian's match-winning strike. Immediately, the crowd at Stamford Bridge erupted into celebrations, the deafening roar of jubilation echoing throughout the stadium.

How you answer that question predicts what style of music you like, report University of Cambridge psychologists in the journal PLoS ONE. In fact, people's cognitive styles \\"can be a better predictor of what music they like than their personality\\"—such as how neurotic or conscientious they are—the study's lead author, a trained jazz saxophonist, tells Popular Science. To study this, the researchers had more than 4,000 volunteers complete the Empathy Quotient and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised and listen to and rate 50 music excerpts from a library of 26 sub-genres that aimed to mitigate cultural or personal ties to certain songs. They then calculated each person’s scores across five \\"MUSIC\\" dimensions—mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, and contemporary—and found that cognitive style influences the very genres of music people like (empathizers drift toward \\"mellow\\" and \\"unpretentious\\" music like soft rock and blue grass, while systemizers prefer \\"intense\\" music like punk rock and heavy metal). Even within genres they found differences.

The way you identify yourself could be a key predictor of your taste in music, according to a study by University of Cambridge psychologists published in the journal PLoS ONE. Surprisingly, people's cognitive styles seem to carry more weight in determining their musical preferences than their personalities, like how neurotic or conscientious they are. In the study, more than 4,000 volunteers completed the Empathy Quotient and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised before listening to and rating 50 music excerpts chosen from a library of 26 sub-genres. The aim was to minimize cultural or personal biases towards certain songs. With their responses, the researchers calculated scores of the participants across five \\"MUSIC\\" dimensions: mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, and contemporary. The findings revealed that cognitive style significantly influences a person's preferred music genre. Empathizers, who typically focus on the emotions of those around them, tend to gravitate towards \\"mellow\\" and \\"unpretentious\\" music like soft rock and bluegrass. On the other hand, systemizers, who are more interested in patterns and rules of the world, prefer \\"intense\\" music like punk rock and heavy metal. Not only did cognitive styles influence genre preferences, but they also determined tastes within genres themselves. High-scoring empathizers favored music with low energy or great emotional depth, whereas systemizers inclined towards high-energy or positive music.

The slave trade was engaged in by European state and non-state actors such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal and private companies, as well as various African states and non-state actors. With rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities, Great Britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain established the West Africa Squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves. It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye, and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852.

In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. It considered a challenge to a Texas law that imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinics. But the court's eight justices so far appear divided on the hot button issue. It is the court's first major abortion case in decades and the first big case since its most conservative justice, Antonin Scalia, died in February. His death leaves the court evenly split between liberals and conservatives, with all eyes on Justice Anthony Kennedy who holds a swing vote on the highly charged issue. Hundreds of activists - both in support and in opposition to abortion - camped outside the court on Wednesday. The crowd was overwhelmingly in favour of abortion access for women. Mostly younger women enthusiastically gathered together, holding signs and wearing hats emblazoned with the logo of pro-choice groups. They called the Texas abortion regulation in question a \\"sham law\\". \\"It's too important to miss,\\" said Gena Johnson, 36, who came from Chicago for the hearing. \\"My mom fought for Roe v Wade in the 1970s, and now here we areâ€¦ still fighting about abortion, it's ridiculous. I'm here for my daughter so we don't have to do this every couple of years.\\" Caroline Goldfarb, 19, a student at Harvard, said people don't understand that abortion is \\"one of the safest medical procedures.\\" \\"It's not fair, and it's not safe, to force women to have children when they can't afford them, or they know it's not right.\\" But Amanda Quigley, 22, who came to the Supreme Court with her mother, said she hopes the law is upheld, and that it has reasonable requirements for women's health. \\"I'm here because I believe in the dignity of all human life, from womb to tomb,\\" said Jean Morrow, 27, from Virginia. \\"I understand there are a lot of people who are pro-choice, but I believe the tide is turning to a pro-life mindset.\\" Wednesday's case focuses on a part of the law that has yet to go into effect requiring abortion clinics in Texas to have hospital-grade facilities - a requirement that would require costly upgrades at many providers' offices. It also focuses on a mandate within the law already gone into effect that requires doctors to have the ability to admit patients to hospitals within 30 miles (50km) of their clinic. Opponents to the law say it would leave just 10 abortion clinics in Texas, making it harder for women there to obtain the procedure. But the law's proponents argue it is necessary to protect women's health. Justices at the court must decide whether such restrictions on clinics hampers a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Hear both sides speak What is Planned Parenthood? But after 90 minutes of arguments, they failed to show a unified front on the issue. In their questions, liberal judges voiced hostility towards the law while the conservatives appeared more sympathetic. Justice Kennedy did not give a clear indication of which way he stood, however he did suggest sending the case back to the lower court to allow more evidence to be gathered on the law's impact. A ruling is not expected until the end of June, although experts say this is likely to end in deadlock with a 4-4 split in the case. Without a majority verdict, the Texas law would be implemented but the court will not set a nationwide legal precedent. Abortion is a highly disputed issue in the US, and is a hot topic in the presidential election, with all of the Republican candidates backing bans on the procedure. The Supreme Court legalised abortion more than 40 years ago in a landmark ruling, but some states have since endeavoured to pass laws placing restrictions on a woman's ability to terminate a pregnancy.","output":"Part #1: Reading the article and understanding the overall message. Usage: This is an article about the recent Supreme Court case in Texas regarding restrictive abortion laws and practices. It discusses the debate between pro-life and pro-choice advocates, the divided opinions of the justices, and the potential impacts of the Texas law on abortion access nationwide, particularly in the context of the upcoming presidential election. Part #2: Definition of the key points in the article. Usage: The key points in the article could be the Texas law that imposes strict regulations on abortion, the death of Justice Scalia leading to a split court, the potential impact of Justice Kennedy's decision, the disagreement between pro-life and pro-choice advocates who attended the case's hearing, and the potential implementation of the Texas law. Part #3: Summarization of the article into a single sentence. Usage: The Supreme Court reviews a contentious Texas abortion law amidst a divided court and strong public sentiments, potentially impacting nation-wide abortion regulations and the presidential election. This meets the criteria because it includes the primary elements in the article, outlining the court's review, the divisive nature of the case, and the broader implications.  Part #4: Precision of words and being concise.  Usage: Part of summarising an article is appropriately condensing information. For instance, rather than saying \\"the Supreme Court is looking over a law in Texas that would put strict regulations on abortion procedures and clinics,\\" it was shortened to \\"The Supreme Court reviews a contentious Texas abortion law.\\" The core meaning is still preserved, but the wording is made more concise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rhodes Lynx football represents the college associated with what religious denomination? Answer:","output":"Rhodes Lynx football represents Rhodes College, which is closely associated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) religious denomination. Established in 1848, Rhodes College (originally named the Masonic University of Tennessee and then Southwestern Presbyterian University) was founded by freemasons and members of the Presbyterian Church with the aim of providing higher education grounded in the liberal arts. The Presbyterian Church (USA), or PC (USA), is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States. It is the result of a merger in 1983 between two Presbyterian denominations: the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) and the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS). The denomination traces its roots back to the Reformed tradition established by John Calvin in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. Rhodes College, as an institution affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), holds a covenant relationship with the denomination. While the college embraces its Presbyterian heritage and connection, it values and welcomes students, faculty, and staff from diverse religious backgrounds, fostering an environment that supports interfaith dialogue, understanding, and spiritual growth. Throughout its history, Rhodes College has sought to balance its religious affiliation with a commitment to academic excellence, intellectual freedom, and the development of personal values. The campus chaplain, as well as the campus ministries, play a pivotal role in fostering spiritual life on campus and supporting the college's commitment to community service, social justice, and peace. Some of the notable features of the relationship between Rhodes College and the Presbyterian Church (USA) include: 1. A commitment to liberal arts education grounded in an understanding of the Christian faith and the Reformed theological tradition. 2. The study and teaching of religion as a crucial part of the liberal arts curriculum. 3. Encouragement of critical thinking and open inquiry as essential components of faith development. 4. Focus on the importance of ethical decision-making, social responsibility, and service to others as part of a well-rounded education. 5. Support for interfaith dialogue and understanding through campus ministries and academic programs. In summary, the Rhodes Lynx football team represents Rhodes College, an institution of higher learning that holds a close association with the Presbyterian Church (USA) religious denomination. This affiliation enriches the college's commitment to academic excellence, moral and spiritual development, and a sense of responsibility towards the broader community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more wildlife dies happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis you mentioned can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of damage caused by acid rain. If more wildlife dies due to acid rain and its consequences, the damage caused by acid rain will increase and possibly intensify. This increased damage can affect the ecosystem in a few ways: 1. Loss of biodiversity: As more wildlife dies, the biodiversity of the affected ecosystem will decrease. This loss of biodiversity can weaken the ecosystem, making it less resilient and more vulnerable to future disturbances. A lack of biodiversity also decreases an ecosystem's ability to provide essential ecosystem services like nutrient cycling and air and water purification. 2. Disruption of food chains: If more wildlife dies, especially species at the lower levels of the food chain, it will disrupt the balance of predator-prey relationships that maintain the stability of the ecosystem. This disruption can lead to further declines in species populations and loss of balance in the ecosystem. 3. Reduced ability for natural recovery: With more wildlife dying, the ecosystem's ability to naturally recover from the damage done by acid rain might be reduced. Certain plant and animal species play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem health and recovering from disturbances. If these species are lost due to the damage caused by acid rain, the ecosystem may not be able to recover. 4. Secondary effects on human communities: The increased damage to the ecosystem due to the death of more wildlife can also have secondary effects on human communities that depend on the ecosystem for resources like food, drinking water, and other ecosystem services. It can lead to loss of economic opportunities (e.g., fishing and tourism) and reduced access to clean water sources for local communities. 5. Feedback mechanisms and amplification: As the perturbation increases and more wildlife die, there may be feedback mechanisms that further amplify the consequences of acid rain. For example, the loss of vegetation can lead to increased soil erosion, causing more aluminum to be released into water systems and intensifying the acidification process. This can create a cyclical pattern of increased damage to the ecosystem caused by acid rain compounded by the death of wildlife. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis you have mentioned can have both direct and indirect effects on the damage caused by acid rain. The increased death of wildlife can further exacerbate the consequences of acid rain, leading to even more damage to ecosystems and the services they provide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Problem-Solving Strategies for the Effects of Heat Transfer 1. Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a temperature change followed by a phase change). Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that the temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Context_1 : \\"I'll Kiss It Away\\" is a song by German recording artist Sarah Connor. A dedication to Connor's daughter Summer, her second child with American pop singer Marc Terenzi, it was written by Connor along with frequent collaborators, Rob Tyger and Kay Denar, for her sixth studio album, \\"Sexy as Hell\\" (2008), with production helmed by the latter. Musically, \\"I'll Kiss It Away\\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad with contemporary R&B influences that combines classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar with a modern-sounding 808 drum beat. The song samples US \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 top ten hit Tattoo by R&B singer Jordin Sparks. Context_2 : Electribe is the name given to a group of electronic musical instruments by Korg. From its beginnings with the Electribe R to the ESX-1, this series includes both analogue modeling synthesizers and sampling drum machines that can be programmed the same as a drum machine. The analogue modeling synth and sampling drum machine both share a \\"drum-pattern\\" section and a \\"synth-pattern\\" section, whereby the user can not only program drum patterns, but also synth and basslines. These hybrid machines could be considered 'grooveboxes'. Context_3 : Sarah Connor Live in Concert – A Night to Remember: Pop Meets Classic is the first live DVD released by German pop star Sarah Connor. It was recorded live on January 24, 2003 at Altes Kesselhaus in Düsseldorf, Germany. Context_4 : Journey is the third and final studio album by British experimental rock band Kingdom Come. After the band featured drastically different styles on their first two albums, and after several line-up changes, band leader Arthur Brown worked the band towards a new direction for \\"Journey\\". The album was the first album in history to use a drum machine responsible for all the percussive sounds on the album. The drum machine in question was the Bentley Rhythm Ace, manufactured by Ace Tone. Although the band had commented the album was entirely based on the drum machine, the band attempted to, in rock and electronic terms, create an album that was the closest they could get \\"to a string quartet\\". The album features other experimental techniques, including using a triangle to guide guitar playing and excessive use of Mellotron and synthesizers from new member Victor Peranio, who replaced Michael \\"Goodge\\" Harris early on production. Context_5 : The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, often referred to as the 808, is a drum machine introduced by the Roland Corporation in 1980 and discontinued in 1983. It was one of the earliest programmable drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns. Context_6 : \\"Living to Love You\\" is a song by German singer–songwriter Sarah Connor from her fourth studio album, \\"Naughty but Nice\\" (2005). Written and produced by Sarah Connor, Rob Tyger and Kay Denar, it was released as the album's lead single on 8 November 2004. The song samples Céline Dion's 1997 hit single \\"My Heart Will Go On\\". Context_7 : The Boss Doctor Rhythm DR-110 Graphic is a drum machine produced by the Boss product division of the Japanese Roland Corporation in 1983. It featured advances in technology compared to previous Roland drum machines: it had an LCD graphic display, showing a step-programming grid for the various drum voices. The DR-110 allowed the drum sounds to be played manually from rubber pads (as well as programmed). Like all Roland's previous drum machines, the DR-110's synthesized drum \\"voices\\" (synthesizer sounds) used analog synthesizer circuits. Tempo was continuously variable between 45 and 300 beats per minute (BPM). The DR-110 used a 4-bit Hitachi microprocessor and 1KB of μPD444C RAM memory. Context_8 : Jon Ragel, better known by his stage name Boy Eats Drum Machine, is an American solo artist who was originally based in Portland, Oregon, but who moved to Santa Cruz in 2014. He has been described as \\"a DJ, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, who uses his Boy Eats Drum Machine project to showcase his love of all things percussive.\\" Context_9 : The Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer is a drum machine introduced by the Roland Corporation in 1983. It was the first Roland drum machine to use samples (for its cymbal and hi-hat sounds) alongside analog sounds. Designed by Tadao Kikumoto, who also designed the Roland TB-303 synthesizer, the 909 features a 16-step step sequencer and drum sounds that aimed for realism and cost-effectiveness. It is fully programmable, and like its predecessor, the TR-808, it can store entire songs with multiple sections, as opposed to simply storing patterns. It was the first MIDI-equipped drum machine. Around 10,000 units were produced. Context_10 : Sarah Connor is a studio album by German recording artist Sarah Connor. It was released by Epic Records and Sony Music on March 9, 2004 in the United States, marking her North American debut. It compiles selected songs from her first three studio albums \\"Green Eyed Soul\\" (2001), \\"Unbelievable\\" (2002) and \\"Key to My Soul\\" (2003). Comprising nearly all of her singles released up to then, \\"Sarah Connor\\" includes the number-one hits \\"From Sarah with Love\\" and \\"Music is the Key\\", both produced by frequent collaborators Rob Tyger and Kay Denar, as well as production by Bülent Aris, Mekong Age, and American musicians Jerry Duplessis, and Wyclef Jean. fact_1 :  Musically, \\"I'll Kiss It Away\\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad with contemporary R&B influences that combines classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar with a modern-sounding 808 drum beat. fact_2 : The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, often referred to as the 808, is a drum machine introduced by the Roland Corporation in 1980 and discontinued in 1983.

During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts  Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day  or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events.

Context: I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. Question: How long were they sitting at the breakfast table?

I don't remember my father ever getting into a swimming pool. But he did love the water. Any kind of boat ride seemed to give him pleasure. And he loved to fish; sometimes he took me along.  But I never really liked being on the water, the way my father did. I liked being in the water, moving through it, having it all around me. I was not a strong swimmer, or one who learned to swim early, for I had my fears. But I loved being in the swimming pool close to my father's office and spending those summer days with my father, who would come by on a break. I needed him to see what I could do. My father would stand there in his suit, the only person not in swimsuit.  After swimming, I would go inside his office and sit on the wooden chair in front of his big desk, where he let me play with anything I found in his top desk drawer.

After seeing several patients, Travis, a troubled psychiatrist, is contacted at home by a patient, Rachel.  Travis invites her into his apartment, though he acknowledges this is unorthodox.  As they talk, Rachel sees Travis take several pills, which he explains are to help him deal with the mounting stresses in his life.  After they kiss, Rachel offers to help him, and Travis laughs derisively.  Hurt, Rachel leaves his apartment and goes to the top of the apartment building, where she phones him.  When he realises she means to commit suicide, he races upstairs, only to see her leap to her death.  After one of his patients taunts him over this rumor, Travis reacts violently and is put on leave, though he angrily quits instead.

The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all.  The habitats of which planet's animals are in more danger? A:","output":"The habitats of the animals on planet Mandron are in more danger as compared to those on planet Liptar due to the extensive use of fossil fuels by the people of Mandron. There are several reasons why using fossil fuels poses a threat to the habitats and well-being of animals on planet Mandron, whereas the more sustainable use of water as a power source on Liptar greatly reduces the negative impact on their environment. 1. Air pollution: The burning of fossil fuels releases a significant amount of air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. These pollutants can have various adverse effects on animal habitats, including contributing to respiratory diseases, acid rain, and smog. Acid rain, for instance, can acidify water bodies, damage plants and trees, and ultimately harm the ecosystems that animals depend on. 2. Climate change: The excessive use of fossil fuels leads to the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide. This contributes to global warming, resulting in climate change. Climate change can lead to the loss or alteration of habitats for many species, making it difficult for them to survive and reproduce. This, in turn, can result in shifts in ecosystem composition and the extinction of some species. 3. Water pollution: The extraction, processing, and transportation of fossil fuels can cause significant water pollution, affecting the quality of water in streams, rivers, and oceans. Spills and leaks from oil pipelines, for example, release toxic substances into the water, damaging aquatic life and the ecosystems that support them. Moreover, some power plants using fossil fuels require vast amounts of water for cooling, which can lead to thermal pollution and harm aquatic life in nearby water sources. 4. Habitat destruction: The extraction and transportation of fossil fuels often require large-scale infrastructure and land clearance, causing direct habitat destruction. This can include the construction of mines, pipelines, power plants, and roads, which leads to the loss of ecosystems and habitats that animals rely on for their survival. In contrast, the people of Liptar have adopted the use of water as a source of power, which tends to have fewer environmental consequences. Harnessing water power, such as using hydroelectric dams or other water-based technologies, results in fewer emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, mitigating the negative impacts associated with fossil fuel use. However, it must be noted that water-based energy sources are not entirely without environmental consequences. For instance, building large hydroelectric dams can result in the displacement of animal and plant species, depending on the specific location and scale of the project. Additionally, harnessing tidal power may have unintended effects on marine ecosystems. Despite these potential challenges, the overall environmental impact is still significantly smaller than that of fossil fuel use. In conclusion, the habitats of animals on planet Mandron face a greater danger due to the extensive use of fossil fuels, which contribute to air and water pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction. In contrast, the utilization of water as a power source on planet Liptar helps in mitigating these negative environmental impacts, thus offering a more sustainable solution for energy generation and providing a safer habitat for their animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: BEIJING, July 21-More and more parents in Shanghai have found that their children are forgetting how to use Shanghai dialect to express themselves, according to a report in the city's Jiefang Daily on July 11, and some have begun forcing them to speak it at home. Language experts say that the promotion of Putonghua, and the large number of non-Shanghainese setting down in the city have meant that the local dialect has lost its previous high social status, according to the report. They have urged that the dialect be protected alongside Putonghua (also known as Mandarin), the nation's common tongue that has been systematically promoted since new China was founded in 1949. In their opinion, dialects carry and preserve local culture . They say that a dialect is not only a linguistic tool. But is also like a person's \\"birthmark\\" and part of their local identity and feeling of belonging. They recommended that TV and radio stations set up channels and programs using dialects , and that schools offer selective courses in which the dialects are taught. The experts also suggested that dialect be protected while maintaining high standards of Putonghua and a multicultural environment in the city.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dr. Edwards arrives at a secluded island laboratory to examine Mr. Porter. Although Porter carries a deadly flesh-eating virus, he is asymptomatic and shows no signs of necrosis. Along with fellow researchers Camila and Bridget, Dr. Edwards spends two months examining Porter in isolation. Porter continually asks to see his wife, but he is continually denied. Marcus prepares to marry wealthy heiress Kate Arias in the Dominican Republic. Mark's best friend Dobs, his brother Josh, and Josh's girlfriend Penny charter a boat and take Mark to a supposedly unpopulated island for a low key bachelor party. Sympathetic researcher Camila creates a rapport with Porter. Frustrated with his confinement, Porter intentionally infects one of the researchers as he begins revolting against his continued isolation. Porter warns Camila that he is dangerous. Bridget becomes infected. Josh and Penny go snorkeling and find dead sea animals littering the ocean floor. When they return to camp, Josh and Penny discover strange rashes on their skin. While Josh performs oral sex on her, Penny begins spitting up large amounts of blood and her flesh starts melting. Josh radios for help and a voice claiming to be Dr. Edwards provides him with instructions. Realizing that they need help but are stranded, Mark and Dobs search the island and find a bunker. Inside, the two friends discover research related to the virus. They also find mutated men who attempt to kill them. Mark and Dobs are able to escape the human danger, but Dobs becomes infected. The bunker turns out to be connected to Dr. Edwards' laboratory. Josh reunites with Mark and Dobs and they find the researchers.

He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right.  and a hint : The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight.  Please answer this question : Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","output":"Given two elements in the same row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal.  As you move from left to right across a row (period) in the periodic table, the number of electrons and protons increases. At the left side of the table, you have metals, which have fewer electrons in their outer energy level. As you move to the right, you encounter metalloids, and then, further to the right, you find nonmetals with more electrons in their outer energy level.  In the example provided, lithium (Li) is a metal with 3 electrons, while neon (Ne) is a nonmetal with 10 electrons. Both are in the same row (period 2), but the nonmetal (neon) has more electrons than the metal (lithium).

When I picked it up, I was disappointed that it wasn't, but still optimistic, since I love Kellerman's books. This book is a disappointment. I was well over 100 pages in, and still was not \\"into\\" the story. The main character, Jeremy, did not draw me in like Alex did in the other books. I didn't feel a connection with Jeremy, and didn't find myself rooting for him, like I do for Alex and Milo. The story is very slow moving, no driving suspense like the Deleware books. I finished the book because I was \\"curious\\" about how it would end, not because I had a driving need like I do with really good mysteries. I hope Kellerman sticks with the Deleware series, it's a much better read in my opinion. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the book for various reasons. Firstly, they had initially expected an Alex Deleware book, but upon realizing that it was not, they still decided to give it a chance due to their love for Kellerman's books.  However, the reviewer found several issues with the book, including the main character, Jeremy, who they claimed did not resonate with them as much as Alex from the Deleware series did. The reviewer also felt that the story was slow-moving and lacked the driving suspense present in the Deleware books. Their motivation to finish the book stemmed from sheer curiosity instead of the gripping intensity one would expect from a good mystery novel. In conclusion, the reviewer expresses a preference for Kellerman's Deleware series and hopes that the author would focus on that series instead of exploring other characters and storylines like this one. This review portrays the book as a disappointment when compared to the author's other works, making it a negative product review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

[A]. different meanings [B]. the same meaning","output":"[A]. different meanings The verb \\"cover\\" in English can have several meanings, and in the sentences provided, it is used in two different ways.  In the first sentence, \\"Cover your head!\\", the context suggests a physical use of the word. It advises or instructs someone to put something over their head to protect it in some way. This could be from the rain, sun or any other potential harm. The term \\"cover\\" here is used in the sense of shielding or safeguarding. It implies placing an object over another to prevent it from exposure. This is its literal, physical meaning. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"The President covered the fact that he bugged the offices in the White House.\\", \\"cover\\" is used metaphorically. It means to hide, obscure, or keep something secret. In this context, the president is not physically covering something but rather concealing the truth or information about his actions. This is related to its figurative or idiomatic usage where \\"covering something up\\" generally implies deception or secrecy.

It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).

To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire – both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of Maggie.

Given those answer options, answer the question: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

Did you know credit card companies are allowed to visit many high schools and colleges? You may want to warn your teen.","output":"After presenting them with all the data and dangers, enforce the importance of responsibility. Ensure they understand that credit cards are not free money, but borrowed funds that must be paid back, often with high interest charges. Make them realize that misuse can lead to serious financial trouble affecting their future. Let them know that credit cards can be beneficial if used wisely, for things like building a good credit history. Encourage open conversations about financial matters, so they feel comfortable discussing their questions or concerns with you. Step-by-step justification: 1. The previous parts of the paragraph focus on the dangers and pitfalls of using credit cards. So, logically, the next part needs to instill a sense of responsibility in teens regarding credit card usage. Hence, starting the paragraph-end with the importance of responsibility. 2. As the paragraph focuses on teaching teens, the next step is to clarify common misconceptions like \\"credit cards are free money\\". This would help in making them aware of the reality of credit cards. 3. Highlighting the consequences of misuse such as substantial financial trouble, is a crucial step in educating teens about the risks involved. 4. Following that, it's important to note that credit cards are not entirely negative. They have benefits like building a good credit history, but these benefits can be achieved only through wise usage. 5. Concluding with an establishment of open conversation about finances could help teens with any future queries or worries they may have about credit cards, giving them a safe platform."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Conservatives held the seat, after former MP Stephen Phillips quit, citing \\"irreconcilable policy differences\\" with the government. Dr Johnson won 17,570 votes to beat UKIP's Victoria Ayling, who had 4,426. Labour slipped from second place in 2015 to fourth - described by one veteran Labour MP as \\"humiliating\\". Consultant paediatrician Dr Johnson said her election would boost Theresa May's support on Brexit. She said: \\"I look forward to strengthening the government's majority in Parliament so Theresa May, our prime minister, can get on with the job of triggering Article 50, leaving the European Union and building a country and economy that works for everyone.\\" The result in full: Caroline Johnson: (Conservatives) - 17,570 Victoria Ayling: (UKIP) - 4,426 Ross Pepper: (Liberal Democrats) - 3,606 Jim Clarke: (Labour) - 3,363 Marianne Overton: (Lincolnshire Independent) - 2,892 Sarah Stock: (Independent) - 462 The Iconic Arty-Pole: (Monster Raving Loony Party) - 200 Paul Coyne: (Independent) - 186 Mark Suffield: (Independent) - 74 David Bishop: (Bus Pass Elvis Party) - 55 The seat has returned Conservative MPs since it was formed in 1997 and Mr Phillips, who resigned in November, had a majority of more than 24,000 votes in 2015. Although he backed leaving the EU, he had since been critical of the government's approach to Brexit. Dr Johnson won with a 13,144 majority after securing 53.51% of the votes, while UKIP came in second with 13.48%. Liberal Democrat candidate Ross Pepper won 3,606 votes to clinch third, narrowly ahead of Labour's Jim Clarke who was fourth with 3,363 votes. There were few words from the victor in Sleaford and North Hykeham. Dr Caroline Johnson was whisked out of the hall without a word to reporters, after a short speech in which she looked forward to helping the prime minister \\"get on with the job\\" of leaving the EU. It was not the first time a brand new Conservative MP had left a by-election in a hurry. With the party's message on Brexit being closely managed, it may have been a conscious choice to let more senior MPs do the talking. And it is likely there will be quiet comfort for Theresa May at this result. In June, voters in this rural Lincolnshire seat decisively backed Brexit - the verdict here would be keenly watched for any messages about the government's EU withdrawal strategy so far. There were rumblings during the by-election campaign from UKIP that voters may want to send a message to Mrs May for, in their view, \\"backsliding on Brexit\\". But it didn't happen. UKIP came a distant second - a result their new leader Paul Nuttall celebrated as a \\"small step on a long road\\", despite the party's vote share falling compared with last year's general election. But the most acute soul searching may be for Labour, beaten into fourth place by the Liberal Democrats. BBC political editor for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Tim Iredale, who filmed Dr Johnson after the result, tweeted that she had been \\"rushed away from count after refusing to speak to the media\\". The Lincolnshire seat is in an area which voted heavily to leave the EU. UKIP's former leader Nigel Farage and his successor Paul Nuttall had been on the campaign trail, supporting Ms Ayling - a former Conservative who stood for the Tories in Great Grimsby in 2010. Ms Ayling said coming in second was a \\"great result\\" for UKIP as it showed \\"more people are trusting us to deliver\\". Mr Nuttall said the result was a \\"really good way to get my leadership off the ground\\". He added: \\"If someone would have offered me second place at the beginning of the campaign, considering we were in the middle of a leadership election and the party resembled a bit of a shambles over the summer, I would have bitten their hand off.\\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his party's \\"strong result\\" showed they were \\"back as an electoral force\\" in areas that had voted to leave, as well as remain, in the EU. He went on: \\"With Labour yet again nowhere, and after losing their deposit in Richmond, the Liberal Democrats are the real opposition to the Conservative Brexit government.\\" Labour MP Jess Phillips said the party's stance on Brexit was confusing and it was hard for leader Jeremy Corbyn, given his political background, to address voters' concerns on immigration in areas like Lincolnshire. \\"When people are putting a cross in a box, clarity is everything,\\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. \\"Labour needs to have a very clear position and for everybody to be saying the same thing and at the moment that is not the case.\\" And David Winnick, the veteran Labour MP for Walsall North, said: \\"If we were to continue in this way then the indications are 2020 will be an electoral disaster.\\" He also told BBC 2's Daily Politics: \\"To be beaten into fourth place by the Liberal Democrats was humiliating ... My fear is that we're not in touch with ordinary people anywhere, to the extent that it's necessary to make a real impact in the country.\\" Former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne said Labour's showing was evidence of its \\"disintegration\\", tweeting that this was \\"not good for democracy\\". The turnout for the by-election was 37.1% according to North Kesteven District Council, down from 70.2% at the general election last year. Following their victory, the Conservatives have a majority of 10 in the House of Commons but, given that the four Sinn Fein MPs do not take their seats, their working majority is effectively 14.

Most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life, ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog. The Tim Burton Batmans had it, as did (in an even more grotesque manner) Sin City. With Dick Tracy producer/director/star Warren Beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework. Like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures- only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker Bonnie and Clyde- Dick Tracy is filled, joyfully, with archetypes and bright, primary colors, where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities. Villains like The Stooge, Shoulders, Lips, The Brow, Mumbles, the Blank, Pruneface, Spud. Chester Gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles, and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass. The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously. If, at the time, movies like Batman and (underrated) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic-book outline, Dick Tracy is more 'old-school'. It's a story of cops and crooks, or rather A cop, detective Tracy as he tries to bust Big Boy (Al Pacino, in what is arguably his BIGGEST performance to date, and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style), but with no such luck. There's also a little kid, called simply the Kid (Charlie Korsmo, who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would've been imagined), and Tracy's love interest in Tess. And then there's the nightclub 'dame' (Madonna, who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance, but maybe that suits the role fine, and she sings excellently when called upon), who wont testify unless Tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her. Then there's convoluted dealings with taking Tracy down, and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice. Meantime, as if doing an impersonation of a Howard Hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions, Dick Tracy adds on the wink-and-nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes. It's a wonder to look at this world, which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers (i.e. Sin City, which can be justifiably compared to Beatty's film). We're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line, or whatever there is of it, in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old. I'm almost reminded of the Cotton Club during these sequences, as story, music, detail, and a few BIG punches and gun-shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said, which, actually, isn't more than it needs to.

It states that \\"as the Universe expands, galaxies move further and further apart,\\" which is right. However, it then asks if the decreasing distances between galaxies imply that the Universe is expanding or contracting. If the distances between galaxies are decreasing, it would mean that the galaxies are getting closer, not further apart. This would imply that the Universe may be contracting. However, it's crucial to note that current observations and scientific consensus indicate that the Universe is indeed expanding, not contracting. Steps: 1. Understand the query: The user has given a statement and asked a question based on the statement. First, I clarify that there seems to be a misunderstanding somewhere as the statement and the question contradict each other. 2. Analyze the conditions: If the Universe is expanding, galaxies would move further apart. If they're getting closer or their distances are decreasing, it suggests the Universe might be contracting.  3. Consult relevant information: Based on the observed data and prevailing consensus in the field of cosmology, the Universe is observed to be expanding, not contracting. 4. Conclude based on analysis and data: Based on the user's query and the information we have, if the distances between galaxies are decreasing, it could indicate a contracting Universe. However, as per the current scientific consensus, this isn't what's happening. The Universe is expanding, and galaxies are moving further apart.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Bohra  for the following movie plot:  After a decade of research, the scientist Dr. Vaseegaran creates a sophisticated android robot with the help of his assistants, Siva and Ravi, to commission it into the Indian Army. He introduces the robot, named Chitti, at a robotics conference in Chennai. Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's medical student girlfriend, cheat in her examination, then saves her from being assaulted by a group of thugs. Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a terrorist organisation, but has so far been unsuccessful. Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions. Chitti uses Sana's textbooks to successfully help Sana's sister Latha give birth to a child. Bohra congratulates Vaseegaran on the achievement and allows Chitti to pass the AIRD evaluation. Chitti develops romantic feelings for Sana after she congratulates Chitti by kissing it. When Vaseegaran and Sana realise this, Sana explains to Chitti that they are only friends.

The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which county experienced more rainy days?  Hint: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Prothrombin time. Yes or no? Answer: PT measures factors I (fibrinogen) , II (prothrombin) , V , VII , and X . Question: what is the normal inr range Answer:","output":"The normal INR (International Normalized Ratio) range is typically considered to be between 0.8 and 1.2 for people who are not on anticoagulant therapy. This range is based on the comparison of an individual's Prothrombin Time (PT) results to a standardized reference value, aiming to achieve consistency in test results across different laboratories. The INR is a crucial metric employed to evaluate and monitor the efficacy of blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin, prescribed to patients with a predisposition to clot formation. Prothrombin Time (PT) is a crucial blood test that assesses the ability of blood to coagulate, specifically evaluating the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. This assessment is particularly important in determining the adequacy of various clotting factors, including factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, and X. A deviation from the normal INR range could indicate an increased risk of bleeding or excessive clot formation, necessitating adjustment in anticoagulant therapy or further investigation. For patients on anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin, the targeted INR range varies depending on the underlying medical condition. For instance, the recommended INR range for individuals with atrial fibrillation or venous thrombosis is usually between 2.0 and 3.0, while those with mechanical heart valves may require a higher INR range of 2.5 to 3.5, or even up to 4.0 in certain cases. It is important for clinicians to frequently monitor the INR values of patients on anticoagulant therapy to ensure optimum therapeutic benefits and minimize the risk of complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What are Flower Houses? Movie title: Flowers of Shanghai Movie plot: In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status.

Options: a ) 54 sec , b ) 65 sec , c ) 25 sec , d ) 45 sec , e ) 27 sec Student:","output":"Step 1: Convert the speed of the train from kmph to meters per second To convert kmph to meters per second, we can use the formula: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in meters per second is: 36 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 10 m/s Step 2: Calculate the total length the train needs to cover The train needs to cover both its own length and the length of the bridge: 100 m (train) + 170 m (bridge) = 270 m (total length) Step 3: Calculate the time taken to cross the bridge To find the time taken, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed So, the time taken for the train to cover the total length is: 270 m / 10 m/s = 27 seconds Therefore, the train will take 27 seconds to cross the bridge. So, the correct option is: e) 27 sec"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What did Antarctica and Australia do during the Eocene period?\\" is in \\"During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling.

News article: Elan Gale later revealed on Twitter that this fight was a hoax. Click here for more.      Thanksgiving - a time for sharing the love?      Not so for these two flyers who engaged in a bitter war of words at 30,000-feet — before it ended with a slap and near police prosecution at the airport.      LA TV producer Elan Gale enthralled his Twitter followers Thursday when he used the micro-blogging site to take-down an apparently nasty woman on board his flight to Phoenix.      Gale sends a nasty note to the woman causing a disturbance on the flight. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter)      The entire exchange was recorded in real-time by Buzzfeed.      Gale, who claims to be a producer on ABC's The Bachelor, first tweeted at 11 a.m. after being told his plane would be taking off late.      But he went into overdrive after finally boarding the craft — and on hearing a woman several rows behind consistently complaining about the delay.      The war of words escalates. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter)      Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has Thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously. Praying for her — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013      \\"She's telling the flight attendants that it is Thanksgiving. She wants them to know she wants to have dinner with her family,\\" he added.      Gale launches into a profanity-laced response to one of Diane’s nasty replies. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter)      \\"The male flight attendant said 'I understand ma'am. I'm looking forward to seeing my family too.' She responded 'This isn't about you,'\\" Gale continued to tweet.      She had to sit down because we took off. She has been muttering \\"about DAMN time\\" and I can hear her breathing from 5 rows back — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013      After several more posts, and by now up in the air, Gale decided to send the woman a glass of red wine along with a note.      The 30-year-old Gale got his start as a producer on the reality shows ‘Cookin’ with Coolio’ and ‘Coolio’s Rules.’ (theyearofelan via Tiwtter)      \\"Dear Lady in 7A, It has come to my attention that today is your 'Thanksgiving!' It must be hard to not be with your family. Please accept this glass of wine. It is a gift from me to you,\\" he wrote.      \\"Hopefully if you drink it, you won't be able to use your mouth to talk. Love Elan,\\" he added.      The male flight attendant refused to deliver the \\"gift,\\" so Gale handed it over himself.      Gale shows off the note that he received from his sparring partner. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter)      \\"Oh my God I did it. I walked as if I was going to the bathroom and I leaned over and put them on her tray table and walked away Oh my God,\\" he posted online.      The woman, clearly incensed, struck back with her own message.      \\"Dear 'Elan,' The wine wasn't funny. The vodka wasn't funny. You're an awful person with no compassion. I'm sorry for your family that they should have to deal with you. — Diane,\\" she replied.      Elan Gale, a producer on ABC's 'The Bachelor' got into a fight with a fellow passenger on a flight on Thanksgiving Day and detailed the argument on Twitter. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter)      \\"This means war,\\" Gale posted, before revealing \\"Diane\\" was \\"in her late 40s or early 50s\\" and was \\"wearing mom jeans and a studded belt.\\"      Another note was passed over to her, which read: \\"Dear Diane, Thank you for your lovely note. The person who lacks compassion is you.\\"      It added: \\"We all want to get home, particularly the nice men and women who fly your lazy ass around and serve you drinks (you're welcome!)      Gale received a slap in the face at the gate from the woman identified only as Diane - but declined to press charges. (theyearofelan via Tiwtter)      And he ended: \\"Next time you're in a bad mood, stay home. I hate you very much. Eat my d***. Love Elan.\\"      Diane fired back with another message, threatening to contact the cops on landing.      Gale just couldn't let it go, however, and replied: \\"Dear Diane. When you speak to the authorities, please make sure they arrest you for cannibalism because you just ate my d***! Love Elan.\\"      Back on firm ground at Phoenix, she walked up and slapped Gale straight in the face.      A gate agent detained Diane and asked Gale if he wanted her to be arrested.      Gale said he didn't — but revealed he was \\"overjoyed\\" to learn she'd missed her connecting flight to Sacramento.      He then had one last message, which read: \\"Diane, allow me to introduce myself. I am TheYearOfElan. Look me up online. read every tweet.      \\"Read every response. And maybe next time you'll be nice to people who are just trying to help. PS Eat my d***. Love Elan.\\" ||||| As some of you know, I had a bit of an altercation today with a woman named Diane on an airplane.      I had a great time antagonizing her, reading your responses, and just generally trying to have fun with an irritating person. But I did have a point and I just want to put it out there.      I know I can come across as abrasive. I know I can seem harsh. But what I’ve never done is be unkind to a person in a service position.      My first job was in a video store. I rewinded tapes and put them back on the shelves. I was a caterer. I put ravioli into divided plates and cut bagels in half for hours at a time. The difference between someone being nice and someone being mean was the difference in how I felt when I went home that night.      I don’t care what’s going on with you: Don’t be rude to people who are doing their job.      Don’t do it.      Don’t dismiss them. Don’t act like they are less than you. Don’t abuse them just because you’re the customer and “The Customer Is Always Right.”      If you’re the customer, you’re only right if you’re kind, polite and positively thankful. If you’re not, you’re a jerk, and that’s the bottom line.      A lot of people have been really nice to me and called me a hero today. It’s really fun to hear but it’s not true.      Our troops are heroes. Fire fighters and policemen are heroes. Doctors and teachers are heroes. Flight attendants and pilots and waiters and baristas… These are the people that make things work in this crazy world.      What I did today was just point out something we all know: Be nice. It’s Thanksgiving. Be nice.      Be nice everyday, but if you see a man or a woman working on a holiday you better respect that they would like to be with their family too.      So have some compassion and have some appreciation.      Most people do. Most people are great. And then there are a bunch of Diane’s in the world.      And it’s OUR job to tell every Diane to shut up.      It’s OUR duty to put the Diane’s of the world in their place.      We need to REMIND them about the way of things.      We outnumber them.      So, I’m really glad we had fun today, but I really hope you guys join me, look a jerk in the eye, and tell them to eat a piece of your body, because really, that’s what the holidays are all about. ||||| Let me just say this: What started off as an annoyance became a pleasure because of you people. Seriously. More than anything. I love you ||||| ABC's \\"Bachelor\\" and \\"Bachelorette\\" producer Elan Gale was on a flight yesterday live-tweeting his feud with a fellow passenger.      According to Gale's tweets, which were picked up by Buzzfeed's Rachel Zarrell, a female passenger was complaining that she might not make it home for Thanksgiving dinner.      She seemed to be oblivious to others on the flight, who also needed to get home to their families for Thanksgiving.      The battle began before the flight boarded. Gale tweeted about the woman at 11:05 a.m.      Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has Thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously.

She walked right up to me and slapped me immediately in the face — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013      Diane may have ended up missing her connecting flight because she smacked him, while Gale was able to board his.      The gate agent for the next flight actually grabbed her and held her back. He asked me if I wanted to have the airport police come over — elan gale (@theyearofelan) November 28, 2013      The final note he handed her read:      \\"Look me up online. Read every tweet.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing.

This article: With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \\"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\\"; Descendents \\"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \\"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\\" contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands?, what is it ?","output":"The full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands, as mentioned in the article, is Christine Di Bella."},{"instruction":"Sasha said they would send information over but forgot to send it.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.  - Strange Celebrity was a Christian rock band, formed in Nashville, Tennessee, composing of four members: Luke Brown (lead vocals, guitar), Rick Wilson (drums), Quinton Gibson (guitar), and Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar). The band is now defunct, as Luke Brown has pursued a solo career.  - Timothy \\"Tim\\" Gaines (born Timothy Hagelganz; December 15, 1962) is an American bass guitarist. He is most known for being the bassist of the Christian metal band Stryper.  - Tracy Ferrie is the current touring bass player for the classic rock band Boston and was the former bass player of Christian metal band Stryper . Beginning in 1996 , Tracy played bass for Michael Sweet 's solo band and was also a member of the bands Electrik , Sally Steele , Seraiah , Whitecross , Guardian , Rebecca St. James , Plumb , Sonicflood and Strange Celebrity . He is from Elkhart , Indiana and a national roller skating champion . Tracy is a Berklee College of Music alumni and a prominent session bass player . He participated on stage in the Boston Strong Benefit along with Aerosmith , J. Geils , Jimmy Buffet , Carol King and James Taylor . As a member of Stryper , Tracy was joined By Tom Scholz and Gary Phil to play \`\` Peace of Mind '' for the Station nightclub fire benefit for the families and victims of the tragic fire in Rhode Island . Some of his recording credits are with Stryper , Plumb , April McLean , Strange Celebrity , Whitecross , Jeff Deyo , Boe Braswell , Kristy Starling , Danielle Bollinger , Paul Alan , and Kimberly Locke . Tracy is the Assistant Minister at Grace Church of East Dennis on Cape Cod. During mid- 2012 , Ferrie toured with Boston , replacing Kimberley Dahme .  - Whitecross is a Christian metal band that formed in 1985 in Waukegan, IL releasing their first recording in 1987. Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to Ratt, are laced with fast, technical guitar work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Scott retained the use of the name \\"Whitecross\\" while Carroll went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change.  - Stryper is an American Christian heavy metal band from Orange County, California. The group's lineup consists of Michael Sweet (lead vocals, guitar), Oz Fox (guitar), Tim Gaines (bass guitar), and Robert Sweet (drums). In 2004, Gaines left the band and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar) but rejoined in 2009.  - Michael Harrison Sweet (born July 4, 1963) is a singer from Whittier, California; he is the co-founder, writer, lead guitarist, lead singer and front man of the Christian metal band Stryper. He was also singer and guitarist for Boston from 2007 to 2011.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.

Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title \\"the Royal Opera\\". He became a British citizen in 1972. In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra's music director laureate, a position he held until his death.

Importance Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection. Objectives To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Patients Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use. Interventions Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was change in hemoglobing A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, −0.7% to −1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (−1.9%) and placebo (−0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, –0.4% to –1.6%; P = .01 for 2.5 mg, <.001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, −2.1 kg to −6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (−6.4 kg) vs placebo (−1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, –0.9 to –5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

Dolphin and Union caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus x pearyi) are a population of barren-ground caribou that migrate seasonally between Victoria Island and the mainland in the Canadian Arctic. They are named after their unique migratory route through the Dolphin and Union Strait. Reports on the situation of both caribou types are essential for understanding their population dynamics, conservation status, and potential threats they may face, such as habitat loss, climate change, and human activities. Informed decisions on their conservation can then be made, helping to preserve these unique Arctic animals for future generations and maintain the health of their ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
