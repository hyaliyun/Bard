The U.S. has one of the world's largest populations of incarcerated people, with over 2.1 million individuals currently behind bars. Mental health disorders are prevalent among incarcerated individuals, with rates significantly higher compared to the general population. In the past, mental health care was largely ignored in prisons and jails, leaving a significant portion of the inmate population without necessary treatment. This lack of services led to many negative consequences, such as heightened inmate tension, self-harm, and increased suicide rates. Thankfully, the need for mental health care services in prisons and jails is being recognized, and many facilities have implemented programs and resources to address this issue. Some correctional facilities have hired mental health professionals, while others have established mental health units within their institutions. Additionally, some facilities provide therapy, medication management, and other forms of treatment for incarcerated individuals. The importance of mental health resources in correctional facilities cannot be overstated. By providing mental health services and treatment to inmates, facilities can reduce violence and self-harm and prevent recidivism. Furthermore, addressing mental health needs can provide individuals with an opportunity to reintegrate into society successfully. In conclusion, mental health resources must be a priority in correctional facilities. Providing treatment and support can improve outcomes for incarcerated individuals and better prepare them for successful reentry into society."},{"instruction":"Create a travel guide for a popular destination: Thailand's Grand Palace is a mustsee attraction in Bangkok.

For example, one could compare Romeo and Juliet with Hamlet. Next, identify the themes present in both plays. For instance, one could argue that both Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet explore themes of love, loyalty, revenge, and death. Then, examine how these themes are represented in each play. In Romeo and Juliet, the theme of love is evident through the passionate relationship between the two eponymous characters, whereas the theme of loyalty is conveyed through the loyalty that the Friar shows to Romeo and Juliet. On the other hand, in Hamlet, the themes of revenge and death are central to the play, as the main character’s quest for revenge ultimately leads to catastrophic events. Finally, consider the motifs present in each play. For instance, in Romeo and Juliet, the motif of light and dark imagery is used to emphasize the intensity of the lovers’ relationship, whereas in Hamlet, the motif of appearance versus reality is used to explore deception and betrayal. In summary, comparing and contrasting themes and motifs in different Shakespearean plays involves identifying common themes or motifs and examining how they are represented in each play."},{"instruction":"What label best describes this news article?

Recycling protects wildlife and their habitats from being destroyed, as well as prevents pollution from polluting our air, soil, and waterways. So, it’s time for all of us to do our part. Recycling is not only easy, it is also financially beneficial for businesses and households alike. We can all take small steps to recycle more, from sorting our trash and using reusable bags to buying products made from recycled materials.

However, its potential to offend religious or cultural groups has also stirred controversy and backlash. Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine known for its provocative content, became the target of an attack in 2015 by Islamist gunmen who were angered by the publication's depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. The attack, which killed 12 people, sparked a global conversation about the boundaries of free speech and the risks associated with mocking religious figures. While satire has often been used as a means of challenging authority and exposing corruption, it can also be interpreted as insensitive or disrespectful by those who hold certain beliefs. As a result, some argue that there should be limits on what can be satirized, particularly when it comes to religious or cultural traditions. Others, however, believe that the right to free speech includes the right to satirize or criticize any belief or group, no matter how sacred. They argue that even offensive or controversial speech should be protected as a fundamental human right. Regardless of where one falls on this debate, it is clear that satire has the potential to both unite and divide, to challenge and offend.

It is causing significant changes on our planet, and one of the most affected areas is the world's oceans. The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and are home to a great diversity of species that are threatened by the impacts of climate change. The impact of climate change on the world's oceans is far-reaching and complex. The most evident effects are rising sea levels and increasing temperatures. The rise in temperature is causing ocean acidification and altering ocean currents, both of which have profound implications for marine ecosystems. The acidification is caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans, which affects the growth and survival of many marine organisms. The changes in ocean currents are affecting the distribution of marine species and their food sources, leading to the migration of some species to colder waters, reducing the availability of food for others. Another important impact of climate change on the oceans is the melting of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. This melting is causing the loss of habitats for animals that depend on sea ice, such as polar bears, walruses, and some species of seals. The melting of sea ice is also causing rising sea levels, which pose a threat to people living in coastal areas. The increase in storms and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, is another consequence of climate change that is having a significant impact on the oceans. These events cause severe damage to coastal habitats such as coral reefs and mangroves, as well as fishing communities that depend on the ocean for their livelihoods. The damage caused by these events is often compounded by the pollution of the oceans, which is also being exacerbated by climate change. In conclusion, the impact of climate change on the world's oceans is complex and far-reaching. It is affecting the temperature, acidity, currents, and ice melting patterns, all of which have significant implications for marine life and people living in coastal areas. Addressing climate change is essential to preserve the health and functionality of our oceans and the ecosystems they support."},{"instruction":"formation: The Nile is a major northflowing river in northeastern Africa, generally regarded as the longest river in the world.

Firstly, \`await new WaitForSeconds(3);\` is incorrect usage within an async method because \`WaitForSeconds\` is used for coroutine-based delays in Unity, not async/await patterns. To properly introduce a delay in an async method, you should use \`Task.Delay\`, which is designed for async/await patterns. Additionally, the function adds the card to all slots instead of adding it to a specific slot based on \`slotIndex\`. Let's correct that as well. Here's how you can fix and improve the \`AddCardToSlot\` function: # Step 1: Correct the Delay Replace \`await new WaitForSeconds(3);\` with \`await Task.Delay(3000);\`. \`Task.Delay\` takes milliseconds as an argument, so \`3000\` is equivalent to 3 seconds. # Step 2: Add Card to a Specific Slot Instead of looping through all the slots and adding the card to each one, we should add the card to the specific slot referenced by \`slotIndex\`. Ensure that \`slotIndex\` is within the bounds of the slots list to avoid exceptions. Here's the corrected function: \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using UnityEngine; namespace Game.Systems { public class CardStockContainer : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private List<GameObject> slots; public async Task AddCardToSlot(int slotIndex, GameObject card) { // Check if the slotIndex is within the bounds of the list if (slotIndex >= 0 && slotIndex < slots.Count) { // Correctly instantiate the card at the position and rotation of the specific slot Instantiate(card, slots[slotIndex].transform.position, Quaternion.identity, slots[slotIndex].transform); } else { Debug.LogError(\\"SlotIndex is out of bounds.\\"); } // Proper way to introduce a delay in an async method await Task.Delay(3000); } } } \`\`\` # Explanation: - **Bounds Checking**: Added a check to ensure \`slotIndex\` is within the bounds of the \`slots\` list to avoid an \`IndexOutOfRangeException\`. - **Instantiating Card**: The \`Instantiate\` method now takes the position and rotation from the specified slot to create the card. The card is parented to the slot to maintain a clean hierarchy and proper alignment based on the slot. - **Awaiting Delay**: Utilizes \`Task.Delay(3000)\` for a non-blocking delay, appropriate for async methods. This corrected function ensures a card object is properly added to a specified slot with a delay, using the async/await pattern correctly in Unity. Always remember to consider the context in which you use asynchronous programming in Unity, as the engine's update loop and component-based architecture sometimes necessitate different approaches (e.g., Coroutines) for tasks related to game object manipulation and scene changes."},{"instruction":"I want you to analyse this setting: 500 years have passed since the tumultuous events of **The Chaotic Era I: The Gods of Reason**, a decisive chapter in history. It all began during the Theoclasm, a cataclysmic event triggered when the Theoclasts, a technologically advanced race, captured the powerful deity YHVH, resulting in the devastation of the old continent of Pectus. Fleeing the horrors of this apocalypse, the survivors sought refuge on the distant shores of Yuandi, where the saga of **The Chaotic Era II: The New Mythology** will take place. **Theoclasm:** The term \\"Theoclasm\\", derived from *Théos* (God, Deity, Divinity) and *Klastós* (Broken, Fractured), encapsulates the pivotal moment that incited the mass exodus from Pectus. YHVH, the god of light and ruler of Paradise, fell into the clutches of the Theoclasts, leading to the apotheosis of Ptah-Khnemu. Strengthened by this deity, the Theoclasts became an unstoppable force, leading Ma'at, who later allied himself with mortals, to reveal that Ptah-Khnemu imagined a world free from the control of the deities, but was still undecided whether to exterminate the mortals who disagreed with his vision or allying with supporters. A betrayal unfolded when Montu-Sekhmet, daughter of Ptah-Khnemu himself, seized power during the height of Theoclasm, having intentions contrary to those of her father, seeking to rebuild the universe from scratch. Ma'at, who millennia ago was infused with a deity whose name was lost to time, escaped the clutches of her own race, seeking refuge in Yuandi lest she become a mere tool or source of power. With her advanced technological knowledge and divine abilities, she erected five monumental pillars, enclosing the new continent within a protective barrier. This sanctuary attracted not only mortal inhabitants but also lesser deities, fearful of a Theoclast incursion. After Ma'at's death, her essence fragmented, each fragment containing a portion of her memories and powers, while her remains were buried in the reliquary of the Archbishopric of Ma'at, where she is believed to still work miracles. After the fall of YHVH, the angels, previously subservient to the deity, regained their free will, while the demons were thrown into disarray following the disappearance of their master. The ensuing chaos led to an anarchic exodus from Hell, the domain of their lord ALMF (Alumniferus), resulting in confusion and insanity, which led to the suicide of many angels and demons. Some remaining demons now disguise themselves as mortals and mythical beings from Yuandi. Although many angels strive to defend YHVH's legacy through their temples, the whereabouts of the goddess of chaos, NLTP (Niarlatotepe), and the god of darkness remain unknown within the protective barrier. These turbulent consequences and the unstable balance of divine forces now set the stage for an epic story of survival, power struggles, and ever-shifting alliances within Yuandi. Now for the races' lore: Renshi The Renshi are one of the native races of Yuandi and are the most numerous race. The majority inhabit the Ozumi Empire, with significant numbers in the Wildlands, the territory of the Archbishopric of Ma’at, and the southern tip of the Kingdom of Igirith. The Shun culture, named after the Shun dynasty of the same name, once dominated almost the entire continent, making them enemies of other races and cultures. The Ozumi Empire, originating from the remote islands east of the Shun lands, took advantage of the previous empire’s weakness during the instability caused by the war against the Theoclasts and seized power. The other Renshi cultures under Ozumi’s rule consider them tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. They are technologically advanced thanks to a partnership with New Medietas. The Ozumi Empire is ruled by an empress who apparently receives direct orders from her divine ancestor, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto. There are several noble clans and a warrior caste that is in decline due to the use of firearms. There are still some noble clans from other cultures who have sworn allegiance to Ozumi and have been allowed to rule their ancestral lands. Family values lie at the core of Renshi social structure. Filial piety is revered as one of the highest virtues. Children are raised to honor and respect their parents, considering their wishes and well-being above their own. Especially in the Shun culture, the familial unit is an extended network, with generations living together under one roof, sharing responsibilities and maintaining a collective harmony. In the Ozumi culture, children are expected to be more independent while still respecting the clan head. Branch families pay respects to their original clans in annual ceremonies, celebrating their ancestors. Education plays a pivotal role in the Ozumi Empire, as knowledge is seen as the key to wisdom and virtuous living. Scholarly pursuits are highly esteemed, and the pursuit of self-improvement is regarded as a lifelong journey. The arts are celebrated as a medium for expressing the beauty and harmony inherent in daily life. Traditional music, poetry, calligraphy, and painting are cherished forms of creative expression, serving as both a means of personal reflection and a reflection of the collective spirit of the society. The “Wild Renshi” or “Barbarian Renshi” live outside the administration of the Ozumi Empire and on the borders of Igirith’s territory, primarily in the cold climates of the continent’s south-central and southern tip. They live by hunting, fishing and herding animals such as reindeer. They wear animal skins, live in tribes and are resistant to cold and attuned to nature. Humans Descendants of the humans who fled Theoclasm in Pectus. They managed to obtain some Theoclast technology during the war and, after reverse engineering, drastically developed their weapons, tools and architecture. The Republic of New Medietas is an example of industrial advancement on the continent. Their society combines coal- and steam-powered machines with magical items. The streets of the largest cities are teeming with citizens amid the rhythmic bustle of machines and the smoke of factories. The citizens of New Medietas boast an unwavering work ethic, where labor and industry reign supreme. A resolute commitment to capitalism fuels innovation and competition, driving the relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance. Although New Medietas does not have a formal clan or caste system, a select group of influential noble houses wield considerable power, guiding the nation’s policies and future. These houses are closely linked to prosperous industrial conglomerates. At the forefront of technological progress, the republic is a pioneer in the development of complex automatons and goelms and advanced machinery. Inventors and engineers drive notable advances, positioning the country as an industrial and technological powerhouse. The Republic of New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighbouring powers. They maintain a robust partnership with the Sulcaic Empire, reinforcing mutual interests and security. Likewise, friendly relations with the Ozumi Empire promote trade and technological collaboration. Recently, advances in artificial life have been made. What is most available to the general population are artificial meats for consumption and clothing products, such as leather, fur and feathers. The upper classes can buy artificial pets or even homunculi, which they display at parties and meetings of society’s elite. Humans have developed a subtype of enchantment magic to “program” orders and commands into items, golems, and other types of artificial life. Its alchemists are valued by all nations. Many humans declare themselves practitioners of YHVH’s faith despite different sects and cults existing, but a relatively small number can truly be called practitioners or believers. The worship of minor gods is uncommon throughout the territory of New Medietas. There are isolated shrines with the sole purpose of appeasing the lesser deities. A growing gap has been developing between the richer classes and the lower classes due to the ease of obtaining labor using golems. Some companies and conglomerates are mostly operated by golems, with only human supervision. The poorest, left without job opportunities, are on the verge of rebelling. Many humans migrated from New Medietas to other nations, more specifically the Kingdom of Igirith and the Jirkaeriya Confederation due to their low industrialisation. A good number also migrated to the more provincial regions of the Ozumi Empire and the Sulcaic Empire. Sulkai Since they were originally from the continent of Yuandi, the logistics of returning the majority of the Sulkai population from Pectus were simpler. Their empire has remained stable during the ~500 years since Theoclasm occurred. They appreciate refined foods and items and attach great importance to money and nobility. A good portion of the sulkai settlers in Pectus were traders. As a general rule, they are gentle, delicate and sometimes passive aggressive. Their society and technology used to be more sophisticated than that of Pectus until the humans made incredible advances. Sulkai ship models are still the most used today to navigate the little ocean that remains around Yuandi. Their society is loosely divided into castes, but an individual can change social status relatively easily. There are the commoners, the merchants and artisans, the knights and soldiers, the burghers, the elite wizards and the nobility, with the imperial family at the top. Many of the sulkai who went to Pectus seeking to accumulate wealth returned to the Sulcaic Empire completely poor and as refugees. Noble families are divided into clans with a semi-mythical ancestor being the founder of the house, a fundamental factor in legitimizing the relevance of a family. They have artifacts, which were supposedly forged by their ancestors, extremely similar to the old relics of Pectus. Their tales and stories generally involve much more magic and the forces of nature. Superficially they look like pale humans with coloured hair, but their bodies function in very different ways. Their longevity is greater, as is the time between childhood and maturity (a 30-year-old sulkai is considered a teenager). Their bodies are lighter and metabolic processes seem to affect their bodies much more, for example, it takes much less time for a sulkai to get drunk or for a medicine to take effect. In the rare cases in which they mix with other humanoid races, the resulting progeny are always born sulkai. The incidence of aptitude for magic is extremely high, with 4 out of 5 having the potential. Their susceptibility to cold iron stems from the fact that they partially descend from fairies, as well as from ancient humanoids who lived in a lost continent. Those same ancient humanoids are also the ancestors of the humans, the Eniyan, and, by extension, of the Anglo-Elves. Although the nobility has great importance, heads of banks and commercial companies, each with a personal army, and each locked in a constant struggle against eachother, have great relevance and economic power. They have enough capital to resolve most external diplomatic dilemmas with a well-directed amount of money or threat of withdrawal from trade. Thus, many conflicts in other nations have already been resolved through the economic influence of certain organisations and companies. Their religion differs drastically from the Church of YHVH. It is based on the cult of semi-mythical ancestors, who fulfill a role similar to saints. The existence of gods is recognised, but generally relegated to a secondary role, even if Theoclasm made them inhabit the Barrier. Their fairy ancestors, or nature spirits, are worshiped instead. They are considered to be more sophisticated and superior to other races, sometimes attracting hatred from some individuals. They get along especially well with the humans, whom they consider their allies for having granted the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire. With Theoclasm, it was the turn of the Sulkai to cede territory to their allies. Their aptitude for trade is always welcome in more remote locations, and even tribal chiefs seek out the Sulkai for business. As previously mentioned, it has been confirmed that the sulkai descend from the union of proto-humans with fairies, or nature spirits. Namely naiads and haliads (water spirits), epigeias and dryads (nature spirits), aureads and boreads (wind spirits). Anglo-Elves Elves and Weisslanders, after fleeing Pectus during the Theoclasm, unexpectedly found themselves sharing the same land west of Yuandi. Despite the mutual dislike between both races, they ended up mixing, resulting in the hybrid race known today as Anglo-Elven. Even before the assimilation between both races, it was noted that children of elf-human couples always resulted in an appearance almost identical to that of humans, without the golden skin, pointed ears and light hair that elves prized. Strangely, the fruits of such unions were always born with scarlet, orange or pinkish hair. Despite the mixing of these two races, there is still an elite of pure elves who govern the nation in a not so explicit way. Culturally, the Anglo-Elves are a fusion of elven and Weisslander cultures, with a simultaneous focus on battles and intellectualism, on physical combat and magical combat, among other aspects. There are also a significant number of dark-skinned Anglo-Elves descended from the Eniyan of Pectus. Magic is a revered aspect of society, guided by guilds of wizards who educate potential wizards. Approximately half of Anglo-elves show potential for magic, with only a few becoming accomplished wizards. The Anglo-Elves practice a syncretic faith that has characteristics of the faith of YHVH, the ancestor worship practiced by the Elves, and the tribal polytheism of the Weisslanders. Clans can trace their lineages to specific individuals who embarked on the journey fleeing the continent of Pectus. While ancestor worship is typically done in family shrines at home, the worship of YHVH is done in public temples. The Anglo-Elves have long been at war with the Hazrun over territorial claims to an island to the west of both nations. This island, called Haséaleen by the Anglo-Elves and Haşarin by the Hazrun, has one of five pillars that maintain a protective barrier around the continent. The Anglo-Elves already have one of the pillars within their territory, the Red Pillar, and want the Black Pillar, stating that Hazrun cannot be trusted to possess it Mustalf Pectus’ “accursed race” again survives a great cataclysm and finds itself destined to roam another continent without its own land or nation. Unlike the ancient Dark Elves, the Mustalf (In Elvish: Must = Dark; Alf = Elf) no longer live only in underground shelters, currently choosing to live as nomadic traders who roam the nations buying and selling exotic goods. They have a few autonomous territories scattered throughout Yuandi, and a number of Mustalf live in the territory of the Archbishopric of Ma’at. They are considered a cursed race by the elves. Thousands of years ago, the “Bloodstained Emperor” murdered the other three members of the Quadrumvirate and fled from the Sonne Insel archipelago to Pectus’ mainland with thousands of followers, who were later cursed by an unknown deity or altered by a powerful relic of the elves. The Alveglaan elves symbolically interpret the darkening of traitors as the mark of their unforgivable crime. Everyone is expected to work for the good of society, inincluding children, the elderly and women. The Mustalf are trained from childhood to perform certain tasks or jobs and continue to contribute until they are unable to do so in some way. Their ears are movable and expressive, just like an elf’s. They have no body and facial hair (except eyebrows and eyelashes), which they consider a sign of barbarity. Short hair is socially accepted, both in men and women, but it is seen as a sign of youthfulness and immaturity. Probably as a result of their ancestors living underground, their hearing is sharper and their eyes are sensitive to light. The Mustalf have a strong sense of community and place a high value on loyalty and solidarity with their own kind. They have a tendency to put the needs of the community above the needs of the individual. Many of them consider it essential to learn at least one foreign language, to play at least one instrument, and to know at least one trade, since most of their livelihood depends on trading with different races. Hazrun One of the continent’s native races and the third most numerous. The Hazrun were dominated for centuries by the Shun Dynasty. With the collapse of the old empire and its subsequent takeover by Ozumi, the Hazrun were finally free and massacred the remaining Rénshi in their traditional territory, later joining the few free Hazrun that remained, creating hybrid cultures with aspects of the culture of their former masters. To prevent another invasion and the enslavement of their people, the Hazrun militarised and today have large armies with highly efficient units, the result of their domestication of draconic species, such as drakes, wyverns, sauroids and avioserpes. Many returned to their old lifestyle as reindeer herders, hunters and fishermen to forget their detestable past under the rule of another race. Their nation, known as the Jirkaeriya Confederacy, is ruled by a Soho (Hazrunic: leader, ruler, king), who must have “divine ancestry”. If the next leader is not elected peacefully, suitors can unify the cultures/tribes. The current Hazrun nation is the result of the conquest of Tazkiairga and his wife Huzur, who fought against Tazkiairga’s brothers to unify the hazrun race. Hazrun culture is diverse, with several “peoples” within the same nation. The largest are Berihazrun (“Hazrun of the Plain”), Keiozhazrun (“Hazrun of the River”) and Damohazrun (“Hazrun of the Mountain”). Generally, women have short hair, letting it grow only after marriage, while the opposite occurs with men, who may also cut their hair during military service as a symbol of their “marriage to the nation”. Like the ancient elves, they do not have any body or facial hair. Women use midriff-revealing clothes while single to indicate they are available, but cover them up once they have boyfriends or husbands. The Hazrun wear earrings, necklaces and body paint with various symbols that other races do not understand. Wars and battles are mostly carried out by men only, as Hazrun women are naturally physically smaller and weaker. Despite this, it is said that a Hazrun woman is as strong as a man of another race. The most peculiar characteristic of the hazrun is certainly the presence of horns, which are highly prized in all their cultures. They also have four fingers on each hand and foot, stronger nails and sharper fangs. Individuals with branched deer-like horns, called Adarkahazrun (“Branched Horned Person”), make up the “high caste” of hazrun, that is, clan heads, rulers and military leaders. The Hazrun view the hornless races as unworthy or dishonorable. They are not able to reproduce with other races, so it is more accurate to refer to them as another species. It is noted that they are very resistant to alcohol and cannot perceive spicy tastes very well. As soon as they arrived on the new continent, the races coming from Pectus suspected a connection between the ancient Golofn, the Orcs and the Hazrun due to the presence of horns. Their origins are not known for sure and their origin myths do not tell of an exodus from distant lands. Furthermore, the Golofn were immortal, possessed extreme control of magic and had divine blood running through their veins, while the Hazrun appear to be ordinary mortals. Ancient accounts of the Sulkai and Shun do not clarify anything, since, wherever they came from, they were always in their lands before the other races. Usagizok They have a strong sense of balance and agility, allowing them to move quickly and gracefully through the natural landscapes. Usagizok developed unique cultural practices based on their connection to nature. They have a ritual for thanking the plants and animals they rely on for sustainability and have developed a system of using natural resources sustainably. Their enhanced hearing also plays a role in their culture. They have developed a form of communication at a frequency that only members of their own species can hear. The Usagizok were enslaved by the Shun Dynasty for being exotic and were even seen as pets by some. This led to tensions between the two races even after the fall of the dynasty. The Usagizok have long ears like rabbits or hares, a fur-covered body, resistant claws for digging and very strong leg muscles that enable them to jump higher and further away than the other races. Their incisors are bigger and stronger due to their mostly vegetarian diet which consists mostly of root vegetables, leaves, and fruits. Some of them have short tails very similar to a rabbit’s. In terms of their current situation, the Usagizok are struggling to find their place in the world since being freed from slavery. They have difficulty integrating into other societies and prefer isolating themselves and live a more nomadic lifestyle in their partially underground warrens. As a result of their enslavement, Usagizok are usually not taken seriously by other races. They may have difficulty finding work or housing outside of their own communities, and may face discrimination or violence. Despite this, the Usagizok have managed to carve out their own niche in society. They are skilled at jobs that require agility, such as acrobatics or hunting, and have developed a reputation as skilled scouts, mercenaries, assassins, and spies due to their heightened senses and physical abilities. Many Usagizok have withdrawn from the larger world and created their own isolated communities, hidden away in forests or other remote areas. These communities are wary of outsiders and have their own unique customs and traditions. The Usagizok are matriarchal; a warren is mostly composed of related members descended from the same maternal ancestor. They are very fertile. A pregnancy lasts for only 4 months and the offspring, often born as quadruplets or triplets, reach childhood in 2 years and sexual maturity in 10. The females in the warren take turns nursing the newborns while the males cultivate plants or go out to trade, forage or hunt. To avoid inbreeding, they have a tradition of visiting other warrens to find suitable spouses. A matriarch can have multiple husbands. Like the Hazrun, they cannot interbreed with other races Usagizok are grappling with their own internal divisions and conflicts between different tribes and factions. This is related both to differences in religious or cultural practices and by more pragmatic concerns such as access to resources or disputes over leadership. Outsider The Outsiders’ arrival into Yuandi remains an event cloaked in mystery and subject to much philosophical debate among the continent’s scholars and sages. While some theorise a conflict against the Theoclasts, others whisper of a vengeful deity tearing the very fabric of the cosmos, banishing these beings to a plane not their own. Such a cataclysmic event likely didn’t occur without leaving scars, both on the lands of Yuandi and the essence of the Outsiders themselves. Over the 72 years since their appearance, the Outsiders have become a norm within the continent’s landscapes, yet they do not form associations or clans of their own; instead, they are unified by their shared displacement and the longing to understand their origin and purpose. The physical form of Outsiders is both alien and mesmerising. Their height can vary drastically, with smooth skin that radiates soft light at dusk. Their unique tentacle-like hair structures suggest an evolved form not limited to the aesthetic, with some Outsiders found to communicate or manipulate objects with these appendages. The absence of aging signs makes their lifespan a subject of much curiosity, as no Outsider has shown any decline or deterioration over their time in Yuandi. With no memories of their own culture or names, Outsiders have come to adopt appellations and customs from the societies they integrate themselves into, often taking on roles as scholars, artisans, diplomats, or advisors. Their unique perspectives unclouded by personal pasts or ambitions make them intriguing and sometimes unsettling company. Though their integration varies by region and society, many Outsiders have earned a place of respect, for their impartial outlook and ability to see beyond the distraction of mortal prejudices. In some cultures, they’ve been considered omens of significant change or figures of worship, existing as bridges between the outer realms and the Eartly Realm. Outsiders perplex the inhabitants of Yuandi not only with their origin but with their method of reproduction — or lack thereof. No new Outsider has been observed to come into being since their first appearance on the continent. This unusual trait has led to numerous theories: that the Outsiders are limited, a finite number of beings with no way to perpetuate their kind, or perhaps they simply have not encountered the conditions needed to initiate their reproductive cycles on Yuandi. Strangely, they exhibit sexual dimorphism, apparently having distinctions between males and females. The Outsiders are known for their most notable and enigmatic ability: transient phasing. This rare power allows them to become intangible at unpredictable moments, causing them to slip through solid objects, evade physical attacks, or even sink into the earth, only to re-emerge unharmed. Such occurrences are sporadic and uncontrollable, often correlated with their emotional state or environmental stimuli, hinting at a possible connection to an underlying psychic or dimensional trait inherent to their being. While this ability is viewed with awe and a palpable sense of wonder by other inhabitants of Yuandi, it is also a source of fear and suspicion. Those who encounter Outsiders experiencing moments of phasing can’t help but question the nature of these ethereal wanderers and their place in the world. Outsiders tend to avoid positions of overt power or leadership unless it serves a purpose that benefits greater societal good. They are pacifists by necessity, as direct conflict could trigger abilities they cannot control, yet their very presence can impact the results of warring factions. It’s not uncommon for Outsiders to serve as mediators and negotiators, given their unaffiliated and unbiased nature. Republic of New Medietas Geography and Climate: The Republic of New Medietas’ landscapes range from sprawling industrial cities with towering smokestacks to fertile farmlands. The climate varies, offering both temperate and subtropical zones. Large rivers crisscross the territory, providing water sources crucial for industrial processes. The nation boasts a coastline with bustling port cities facilitating trade and maritime activities. Economy: New Medietas thrives on an industrialised and capitalist economy, driven by technological innovation. The nation excels in the production of machinery, enchanted items, and artificial constructs. The relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance is evident in the competitive markets. The upper echelons of society, tied to influential noble houses, control major industrial conglomerates. Artificial life, in the form of synthetic meats, clothing, and even pets, has become a burgeoning industry, shaping consumption patterns. Magic and Religion: Enchantment magic, a subtype of magic developed in New Medietas, is used to infuse items, constructs, and golems with specific commands. Alchemists specialising in this magic are highly sought after across the continent. Despite the technological advancements, a significant portion of the population identifies with various sects and cults, with YHVH’s faith being the most widespread. Minor gods have limited presence, with isolated shrines dedicated to appeasing them. Social Disparities: The nation faces a growing socioeconomic gap between the affluent upper classes and the struggling lower classes. The integration of golems and homunculi into the workforce has led to increased unemployment among humans, especially in manual labour sectors. Some industries are almost entirely automated, contributing to widespread dissatisfaction and social unrest. The migration of citizens seeking better opportunities in other nations is a testament to the growing discontent among the populace. Relations with Other Nations: New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighbouring powers, particularly the Sulcaic Empire and the Ozumi Empire. These alliances strengthen mutual interests, security, and technological collaboration. The republic also engages in trade with various nations, exporting its technological innovations and enchanted products. However, the migration of discontented citizens to other nations has strained relations, with concerns about a brain drain affecting New Medietas. Challenges and Tensions: The primary challenges faced by New Medietas include social unrest stemming from unemployment caused by automation. The lower classes, disenfranchised and economically marginalised, pose a potential threat to the stability of the republic. The government must grapple with finding a balance between technological advancement and social welfare to address these issues. Additionally, managing relations with other nations becomes crucial as internal tensions spill over into international dynamics. Sulcaic Empire Geography and Climate: Its geography is diverse, encompassing lush forests, sprawling plains, and coastal regions. The climate varies from temperate zones to more tropical areas. The empire’s advanced navigation techniques, particularly the Sulkai ship models, enable them to navigate the remaining ocean around Yuandi. The little oceanic expanse is a vital element in their maritime activities and trade. Economy: The Sulkai’s economy is deeply intertwined with trade, reflecting their historical roots as traders from Yuandi. Appreciating refined goods and attaching great importance to money and nobility, the Sulcaic Empire engages in extensive economic activities. The society is loosely divided into castes. Many Sulkai who ventured to Pectus seeking wealth returned as refugees, impacting the socio-economic landscape to this day. Noble families, organised into clans, hold artifacts with semi-mythical origins, similar to the old relics of Pectus. The Blue Pillar is located on the northern shores of the large Isle Desrosiers to the north of the mainland. Magic and Religion: Sulkai have a high aptitude for magic, with the potential for magical abilities present in 4 out of 5 individuals. Their susceptibility to cold iron is rooted in their partial descent from fairies. The Sulcaic Empire’s magic was once more sophisticated, but the incredible advances made by humans in Pectus shifted the balance. Their religion is centered around the cult of semi-mythical ancestors, akin to saints, and nature spirits, including fairies. The existence of gods is acknowledged, but they hold a secondary role. This divergence in religious beliefs sets the Sulkai apart from the Church of YHVH. Social Disparities: The society’s structure, while featuring nobility and semi-divine ancestors, allows for social mobility. Individuals can change social status relatively easily. Economic power is not solely concentrated in the hands of the nobility; heads of banks and commercial companies wield substantial influence. These entities often engage in power struggles, using economic leverage to resolve external diplomatic issues. The Sulkai face challenges of internal conflicts and diplomatic dilemmas tied to these economic power dynamics. Relations with Other Nations: Their alliance with the Republic of Medietas is rooted in historical collaboration. The Sulkai consider humans as allies for granting the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire during the times of the Empire of Medietas. The aptitude for trade of the Sulkai is sought after, even by tribal chiefs in remote locations. The empire’s economic influence and diplomatic finesse have resolved conflicts in other nations, making them both valuable partners and potential rivals. Challenges and Tensions: One of the primary challenges faced by the Sulcaic Empire is the impact of economic shifts on their society. The subclass descended from Sulkai refugees and the integration of new technologies have altered the socio-economic landscape. Managing internal conflicts arising from economic power struggles and addressing the growing social disparities within their society pose significant challenges. Ozumi Empire Geography and Climate: The Ozumi Empire, home to the majority of the Renshi, is located in the western regions of the continent. The empire boasts a diverse landscape, from the Shun cultural heartlands to the more temperate areas in the south. The islands east of the Shun lands house the origins of the Ozumi Empire. The climate varies, providing fertile plains as well as colder regions, particularly towards the southern regions. Economy: The Ozumi Empire is technologically advanced, owing much of its progress to a strategic partnership with New Medietas. The Renshi in the empire engage in agriculture, manufacturing, and trade. Firearms have led to the decline of the once-dominant warrior caste. Multiple noble clans, including those who have sworn allegiance from other cultures, contribute to the empire’s ruling structure. Economic prosperity is tied to cultural values, with the pursuit of knowledge and virtue playing a central role in the empire’s economic landscape. The White Pillar is located on the island of Sakaishuu, the largest and easternmost Ozumi island. Magic and Religion: The Ozumi culture reveres many deities, especially the divine ancestor of their imperial clan, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto, whose supposed direct orders guide the empress in ruling the Ozumi Empire, while the Shun culture revere an ancient Sky Father. Minor deities are worshipped throughout the empire, with shrines receiving many pilgrims coming to pay respects and thank the deities. Social Disparities: Social disparities within the Ozumi Empire are exacerbated by the colonisation of the Shun culture by the ruling Ozumi elite. The cultural and historical dominance of the Shun Dynasty is being systematically eroded as Ozumi influences permeate various aspects of society. The decline of the old intellectual aristocracy, once a symbol of Shun power, has created a vacuum that the Ozumi culture is quick to fill with its own values and structures. This shift has led to a palpable tension between the old guard adhering to Shun traditions and the new elite pushing for modernisation under Ozumi influence. The Ozumi culture itself faces a rift between tradition and modernity with the decline of its warrior caste. Relations with Other Nations: The Ozumi Empire’s relations with other nations are complex. Historical animosities stemming from the dominance of the Shun culture have left a lasting impact. The empire’s rise to power during the instability caused by Theoclasm has created tension with other Renshi cultures. Some view the Ozumi rulers as tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. Despite this, the Ozumi Empire maintains partnerships, particularly with New Medietas, contributing to its technological advancements. Noble clans from different cultures who have pledged allegiance to Ozumi are allowed to rule their ancestral lands. The major Ozumi clans are Susa (imperial), and the Nine Great Houses: Kikuchi, Takeuchi, Aran, Oonuki, Yamane, Kokubu, Yagami, Matsubara, and Ebina. Challenges and Tensions: The colonisation of the Shun culture by the Ozumi Empire presents profound challenges and tensions. The once-dominant Shun Dynasty’s fall has led to a struggle for cultural identity, with the Ozumi elite imposing their values and customs. This cultural clash has created internal strife, as the Shun people grapple with the erosion of their traditions. Resistance movements, fueled by a desire to preserve Shun heritage, pose a challenge to the imperial authority. Confederacy of Jirkaeriya Geography and Climate: The Confederacy of Jirkaeriya encompasses diverse landscapes, from expansive plains to winding rivers and imposing mountains. The Hazrun’s connection to nature is reflected in their settlement patterns, with tribes often aligning with specific geographical features. The climate varies, with colder regions in the mountainous territories and milder conditions in the plains. The hazrun adapt their lifestyles accordingly, engaging in reindeer herding in the colder areas and pursuing fishing and hunting in the more temperate zones. Economy: The Hazrun economy is intertwined with their lifestyle and resource-rich territories. Herding, hunting, and fishing contribute to sustenance, while trade between tribes facilitates the exchange of resources. The Hazrun value their natural surroundings, utilizing them for sustenance and crafting. In recent times, the Hazrun have also engaged in trade with neighboring nations, leveraging their unique resources, such as draconic species, for economic exchanges. The island of Haşarin, which became a hub for Hazrun of all tribes and even some Mustalf seeking to trade, houses the Black Pillar. Magic and Religion: Hazrun magic is deeply entwined with nature and their reverence for the divine. Shamanistic practices, drawing power from the spirits of the land, are common. The Hazrun, having witnessed the awe-inspiring might of dragons, incorporate draconic elements into their magical rituals. The belief in divine ancestry, coupled with a pantheon of nature gods, shapes their religious practices. Sacred ceremonies involve offerings to ancestral spirits and nature deities, seeking harmony with the land. Social Disparities: Hazrun society, despite its diversity, strives for a sense of unity under the leadership of the Soho. The caste system, notably the Adarkahazrun, introduces a hierarchical structure. Though opportunities for advancement exist, the Adarkahazrun maintain a prominent role in societal affairs. The perception of hornless races as dishonourable contribute to social disparities. Challenges persist in achieving complete gender equality and fostering understanding with other races. Relations with Other Nations: The Confederacy of Jirkaeriya maintains a cautious but pragmatic approach to relations with other nations. Their history of enslavement by the Shun Dynasty and subsequent conflicts has instilled a sense of wariness. However, the Hazrun recognize the importance of diplomacy, engaging in trade and alliances when beneficial. They are currently at war with the Igirith Kingdom for ownership of the island of Haşarin. Challenges and Tensions: Internal challenges revolve around preserving cultural identity amid external influences. The Hazrun face tensions in reconciling their diverse cultures and ensuring the continuation of their traditions. Additionally, interactions with other races pose challenges, with some nations harbouring prejudices against the Hazrun due to their history with the Shun Dynasty. Their territorial war against the Kingdom of Igirith is a major issue that keeps the tribes united for now. Igirith Kingdom Geography and Climate: The Igirith Kingdom is geographically defined by a sweeping mountain range originating from the Archbishopric of Ma’at, creating a diagonal division from the northeast to the southwest. The northern region features temperate plains, while the southern half transforms into a cold taiga. This diverse terrain influences the kingdom’s climate, offering a mix of temperate and colder conditions. Economy: The Anglo-Elven society has cultivated a balanced economy that integrates elven sophistication with Weisslander pragmatism. Agriculture thrives in the fertile plains, with a focus on the cultivation of crops and orchards. Trading routes, connecting Igirith with neighboring nations, bolster economic exchanges. The kingdom’s strategic location and its control of the Red Pillar facilitate trade, making Igirith a crucial player in regional commerce. Magic and Religion: Magic is an integral part of Anglo-Elven society, with a significant portion of the population demonstrating magical potential. Guilds of wizards play a pivotal role, both in education and governance. The syncretic faith practiced in Igirith combines elements of YHVH worship, elven ancestor reverence, and the polytheistic traditions of the Weisslanders. Temples dedicated to YHVH coexist with private shrines honoring ancestral figures, reflecting the diverse spiritual landscape. Social Disparities: Within Igirith, the social fabric is intricately woven with distinctions, most notably between elves and their hybrid counterparts. Elves, by virtue of their race, are automatically bestowed with noble status at birth, fostering a sense of inherent superiority. This hierarchy has led to a complex social dynamic, with many Anglo-Elves grappling with a profound identity crisis. Some Anglo-Elves, yearning for a more refined elven culture, distance themselves from their human ancestry, intensifying tensions and divisions within the population. Relations with Other Nations: The longstanding conflict with the Hazrun over the ownership of Haséaleen (Haşarin) Island shapes Igirith’s foreign relations. Tensions with the Confederacy of Jirkaeriya are a focal point, fueled by territorial disputes and the strategic importance of the Black Pillar. Diplomatic engagements with neighboring nations are characterized by a cautious approach, prioritizing the kingdom’s interests and maintaining the delicate balance between elven traditions and Weisslander pragmatism. Challenges and Tensions: The ongoing war against the Hazrun is a prominent concern, as territorial disputes and strategic interests fuel hostilities. Internally, a growing rift between the pureblood elves and the Anglo-Elves exacerbates existing tensions. The identity crisis within the Anglo-Elven population poses a unique challenge, with individuals torn between embracing elven traditions and acknowledging their Weisslander heritage. Managing these internal divisions while navigating external conflicts requires diplomatic finesse and strategic leadership to ensure the kingdom’s stability. Archbishopric of Ma’at Geography and Climate: The Archbishopric of Ma’at is situated in the centre of the continent, nestled within the embrace of towering peaks, with valleys and plateaus cradled between majestic summits. The climate has crisp air and serene landscapes, characterized by cool temperatures and alpine vistas. The sacred peaks are not just geographical features but hold spiritual significance, fostering a sense of divine connection and tranquility. Economy: The economic structure of the Archbishopric is unique, driven by the collective commitment to the worship of Ma’at and the preservation of the Five Pillars. While not emphasizing material wealth, the society sustains itself through communal efforts and a harmonious integration of diverse skills and professions. The presence of skilled artisans, scholars, and caretakers ensures the prosperity of the community. On their exclave located in the far south of the continent, the Archbishopric manages the Green Pillar. Magic and Religion: Magic in the Archbishopric is intertwined with religious practices centered around the worship of Ma’at. The Five Pillars, erected by Ma’at herself, serve as both symbols of divine protection and conduits of her essence. The Archbishopric values the fragments of Ma’at’s essence, each holding memories and powers attributed to the benevolent Theoclast. The Archbishopric’s magic is deeply rooted in maintaining the balance and harmony advocated by Ma’at, and its residents often undergo spiritual training to attune themselves with these divine energies. Social Disparities: The Archbishopric stands out as a beacon of inclusivity, with inhabitants representing various races, united by their shared devotion to Ma’at. Social disparities are minimized, as the focus lies on communal harmony and mutual support. The society places a premium on virtues such as compassion, empathy, and equality, fostering an environment where individuals are valued for their contributions rather than their social standing or race. Relations with Other Nations: The Archbishopric is known for its neutral stance in international affairs. Its commitment to providing asylum for the poor and disenfranchised has earned it respect and goodwill across nations. While not engaging in military conflicts, the Archbishopric plays a vital role as a mediator and peacemaker, leveraging its moral authority and divine connections to promote understanding and cooperation. Challenges and Tensions: Despite its overarching commitment to neutrality, the Archbishopric faces challenges in maintaining the delicate balance within and beyond its borders. The quest to preserve the Five Pillars requires constant vigilance and protection against external threats. Internally, ensuring that diverse races and cultures coexist harmoniously poses an ongoing challenge. As the fragments of Ma’at’s essence hold significant power, there may be tensions over the control and distribution of these divine relics, as well as potential disputes over interpreting Ma’at’s will. Balancing these challenges while upholding the principles of Ma’at remains a perpetual endeavor for the Archbishopric.","output":"The detailed setting you've provided paints a vivid picture of a rich, intricate fantasy world steeped in history, culture, and magic. Analyzing the intricate tapestry of nations, cultures, and races reveals a nuanced landscape of political, social, and divine dynamics.

Leyna, a young adept versed in the ancient magics safeguarded within the Archbishopric, was on a mission that could alter the balance of the continent. Whispered legends spoke of a secret beneath the revered Green Pillar, a lore that could summon a convergence of the arcane and the divine, locked away by Ma’at herself in her final act. Chapter 2: The Gathering Word of Leyna's quest spread like wildfire, drawing unlikely allies to her cause. Kael, an exiled engineer from the Republic of New Medietas, sought redemption and a new purpose beyond the cogs and steam of his homeland. Together with Soran, a stoic mustalf nomad bearing relics of a forgotten past, they embarked on a journey fraught with peril. Unbeknownst to them, an Outsider with no name but a myriad of questions about their origin and purpose joined, intrigued by the echoes of Ma’at’s essence Leyna seemed to unknowingly resonate. Chapter 3: The Shattered Harmony Their travels led them to the frayed edges of the Ozumi Empire, where whispers of discontent and rebellion stirred against the rigid hierarchy enforced by the empress. Leyna and her companions found themselves ensnared in a web of political intrigue as they sought the aid of Michiko, a disfavored noblewoman of the Kikuchi clan, who had her own reasons for opposing the empress's decree. Chapter 4: Veil of Shadows The adventurers' journey took a dire turn in the haunted wildlands beyond Ozumi’s reach. Here, they encountered envoys from the Sulcaic Empire, delving into forbidden rituals to usurp power from the divine safeguarded by the relics. Amidst ancient ruins and untamed magic, a confrontation ensued, revealing the price of meddling with powers beyond mortal ken. Chapter 5: Echoes Through Time The true enemy revealed themselves in the depths of Yuandi’s forgotten lore – a Theoclast renegade, Montu-Sekhmet, believed to have perished in the Theoclasm. Intent on using the convergence Leyna sought to unravel the very fabric of reality, she aimed to rewrite the failures of her past. The battle that ensued was not just for control of the Fifth Pillar but for the fate of all Yuandi. Chapter 6: Convergence In the heart of chaos, where magic and technology clashed beneath the shadow of the Green Pillar, Leyna and her allies faced Montu-Sekhmet. It was in this moment, with the continent teetering on the brink, that the Outsider discovered their true purpose and the secret of their origin – a creation of Ma’at designed as a safeguard for the pillars. With the threads of fate tightly woven around them, Leyna unleashed a maelstrom of arcane energy, Kael repurposed ancient technology to reinforce their stand, Soran called upon the spirits of the land, and the Outsider, tapping into the essence of Ma’at, sealed Montu-Sekhmet away, preventing the unraveling of the world. Chapter 7: The New Dawn The aftermath saw a continent forever changed. The Ozumi Empire, faced with the bravery of Michiko and the revelations of corruption within, ushered in a new era of governance. The Sulcaic Empire, humbled by their overreach, returned to their ancestral wisdom. And the Archbishopric of Ma’at, rejuvenated by the return of an Outsider who had found their calling, stood as a beacon of hope. Leyna, now revered as the Guardian of the Fifth Pillar, alongside her companions, had not only prevented the catastrophe but had also sown the seeds for a new era. An era where, perhaps, the balance between the arcane and the divine could be maintained for the prosperity of all Yuandi. As dawn broke over the continent, a sense of cautious optimism filled the air. The echoes of the Fifth Pillar’s strife would resound through the ages, a reminder of the fragile balance that governed all things. But for now, Yuandi breathed a collective sigh of relief, ready to face the challenges of a new day."},{"instruction":"What are farm subsidies? answer with one sentence","output":"Farm subsidies are financial assistance provided by the government to farmers to help offset the costs of agricultural production and ensure a stable food supply."},{"instruction":"What are the benefits of farm subsidies?

However, as of my last update in 2023, several animals have gained significant popularity in memes over the years: 1. **Cats**: Cats have been a staple of internet culture and memes. Memes featuring cats often highlight their quirky behavior, expressions, and the stereotype of their aloof personality. \\"Grumpy Cat\\" and \\"Long Cat\\" are just a couple of examples. 2. **Dogs**: Dogs, particularly Shiba Inus (thanks to \\"Doge\\"), have also been at the forefront of meme culture. Their expressive faces and perceived innocence make them perfect subjects. The \\"Doge\\" meme, featuring a Shiba Inu with multicolored text reflecting its inner monologue, is iconic. 3. **Frogs**: Pepe the Frog became an internet phenomenon, though its usage has diverged significantly across different internet communities. Initially a character from the comic \\"Boys Club,\\" Pepe has been repurposed in countless ways, demonstrating the versatility of animal memes. 4. **Birds**: Birds, especially parrots and owls, have been the center of many memes. The \\"O RLY?\\" owl meme is an early example. Birbs, an intentional misspelling of birds, represent an entire category of bird memes focusing on their cute and silly moments. 5. **Sloths**: Known for their slow movements and seemingly content faces, sloths became popular in memes for their relaxed demeanor, often paired with captions about taking life at a slower pace or procrastination.

Questo piano permetterà un sufficiente recupero e potrà essere integrato se necessario con attività cardiovascolare moderata nei giorni di riposo o dopo le sessioni di pesi. **Warm-Up (5-10 minuti):** - Pedana Ellittica o Cyclette (intensità moderata) per aumentare la temperatura corporea e preparare i muscoli all'allenamento. **Giorno 1, 3, e 5: Allenamento Total Body su Macchinari - Definizione** *Nota: I riposi tra le serie devono essere compresi tra i 60 e i 90 secondi per mantenere alta l'intensità e favorire la definizione.* 1. **Pressa per le Gambe** - 4 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 2. **Chest Press Macchinario** - 4 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 3. **Lat Machine a Presa Larga** (spalle) - 4 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 4. **Leg Curl Seduto** (femorali) - 4 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 5. **Macchinario per Dorsali** (spalle) - 4 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 6. **Shoulder Press Macchinario** (spalle) - 3 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 7. **Dip Machine** (tricipiti) - 3 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 8. **Arm Curl Macchinario** (bicipiti) - 3 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 9. **Leg Extension** (quadricipiti) - 3 serie x 12-15 ripetizioni 10. **Ab Crunch Macchinario** (addominali) - 3 serie x 15-20 ripetizioni **Cool-down e Stretching (10-15 minuti):** - Tapis Roulant a bassa intensità per 5 minuti per abbassare i battiti. - Stretching dinamico e focalizzato su tutti i gruppi muscolari lavorati durante l'allenamento. **Suggerimenti Generali:** - Assicurati di bere acqua durante l'allenamento per mantenerti idratato. - Variare gli esercizi o il numero di ripetizioni/simulazioni ogni 4-6 settimane per continuare a stimolare l'adattamento muscolare. - Prestare particolare attenzione alla dieta: per la definizione, mantenere un leggero deficit calorico con un foco su proteine di alta qualità, carboidrati complessi e grassi sani. - Integrare, se possibile, con cardio HIIT in giorni alterni all'allenamento di pesi per massimizzare la perdita di grasso. Ricorda, la chiave per la definizione non è solo nel tipo o nell'intensità dell'esercizio, ma anche nella coerenza, riposo, e nutrizione adeguata. Assicurati di consultare un professionista per adeguamenti personalizzati."},{"instruction":"most used meme of all time","output":"Determining the \\"most used meme of all time\\" is challenging due to the absence of a centralized system tracking the usage of memes across different platforms. Moreover, meme popularity can significantly fluctuate over time, with new memes continuously emerging and old ones fading into obscurity. However, some memes have achieved widespread recognition and can be considered among the most used or recognized over time. As of my last update in 2023, here are a few noteworthy candidates: 1. **Pepe the Frog** - Initially a comic character by Matt Furie, Pepe became a viral sensation across various social media platforms. Its adaptability has allowed it to remain relevant through countless iterations. 2. **Trollface** - Known for its mischievous smile, Trollface is synonymous with internet trolling and has been a staple of internet culture since its inception in the late 2000s. 3. **Distracted Boyfriend** - A stock photo that became a meme for its depiction of a man (the \\"distracted boyfriend\\") looking at another woman while his partner looks on disapprovingly. It's been used to represent distraction or infidelity in various contexts. 4. **Rickrolling** - A classic internet prank involving the music video for Rick Astley's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up.\\" The ubiquity of Rickrolling at its peak makes it one of the most recognized internet memes. 5. **Doge** - Featuring Shiba Inu dogs, this meme is known for its internal monologue captions in broken English. It became hugely popular and even inspired a cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. 6. **Success Kid** - A photo of a baby making a fist pump accompanied by captions about minor successes. It's been widely used across social platforms. 7. **Grumpy Cat** - Featuring a cat named Tardar Sauce with a naturally grumpy face, this meme expressed various forms of dissatisfaction and annoyance. While these are among the most recognized memes, it's important to note the dynamic nature of internet culture. New memes emerge and gain popularity at a rapid pace, while others may lose relevance. Thus, the \\"most used meme of all time\\" can vary depending on the timeframe and criteria used for evaluation."},{"instruction":"pepe the frog variations","output":"Pepe the Frog has undergone numerous transformations and adaptations since its creation, becoming one of the internet's most versatile and widely-used memes. Originally a character in Matt Furie's 2005 comic \\"Boy's Club,\\" Pepe transformed from an innocuous comic figure into an internet meme icon. Over time, various communities have appropriated Pepe for different uses, leading to a vast array of variations. Here are some notable examples: 1. **Sad Pepe**: One of the earliest and most iconic variations, depicting Pepe with a sad expression, often accompanied by phrases expressing defeat or disappointment. It's used to convey feelings of sadness or melancholy. 2. **Smug Pepe**: Shows Pepe with a smug or self-satisfied grin. It's often employed to express superiority, satisfaction, or a sense of smugness about a situation. 3. **Angry Pepe**: Depicts Pepe with an angry or frustrated facial expression. This variation communicates anger, frustration, or a strong disagreement. 4. **Feels Good Man**: One of the original expressions from the \\"Boy's Club\\" comic, this version has a content Pepe saying, \\"Feels good man.\\" It's used to express a feeling of contentment or satisfaction. 5. **Rare Pepe**: This term refers to unique, often elaborately designed Pepe images that are treated as collector's items within certain online communities. The concept of \\"rare Pepes\\" began as a joke about the oversaturation of Pepe memes but evolved into a meme culture phenomenon in its own right, with some even being sold as digital art. 6. **Pepe Silvia**: Combining Pepe the Frog with a scene from \\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\\" this version superimposes Pepe's face onto Charlie Day's character in a well-known scene where he's obsessed with a conspiracy. It's used to denote confusion, obsession, or conspiracy theories. 7. **Wojak/Pepe Comparisons**: Sometimes Pepe is used in tandem with Wojak (another popular internet meme, also known as \\"Feels Guy\\") to represent varying emotions or archetypal characters in meme culture. These comparisons can show contrasting reactions to the same situation or different socio-cultural identities. 8. **Pepe the Clown (Honkler)**: This variation depicts Pepe as a clown and has been associated with certain online movements and subcultures. It's used to convey absurdity or to mock certain events or ideologies. 9. **Apu Apustaja (\\"Help Helper\\" Pepe)**: A Finnish variation that features a more innocent-looking Pepe intended to offer help, often featuring phonetic speech errors. It started as a wholesome variant but, like many internet symbols, saw varied use across different contexts. These are just a handful of the countless variations of Pepe the Frog found online. The meme's adaptability is a testament to the creativity of internet culture, although it's important to note that some interpretations of Pepe have been associated with controversial or extremist groups. This has led to discussions about the impact of memes in politics and society, and efforts by creator Matt Furie to reclaim Pepe as a positive symbol."},{"instruction":"¿Si estoy de baja cuenta como día hábil?","output":"En el contexto laboral, cuando estás de baja por enfermedad o incapacidad temporal, los días que estás de baja se consideran como días de inactividad laboral pero son reconocidos a efectos administrativos y de cumplimiento de obligaciones previstas en el contrato de trabajo, como pueden ser la acumulación de vacaciones y antigüedad, entre otros. Estos días, aunque no estás trabajando, cuentan como días cubiertos por el motivo de tu baja.

Concentrarsi esclusivamente su macchinari offre una serie di vantaggi in termini di isolamento muscolare e facilità di uso, specialmente per coloro che cercano di minimizzare il rischio di infortuni. Ecco un esempio di piano totale body, da svolgersi per tre giorni a settimana (ad esempio, Lunedì, Mercoledì, e Venerdì) con la durata di un'ora e quindici minuti al giorno. # Prima dell'Allenamento: - Warm-up: 10 minuti di cardio leggero su cyclette o tapis roulant # Circuito di Allenamento: Il piano di allenamento sarà strutturato come un circuito, compiendo ogni stazione per 3 set da 10-12 ripetizioni, con 60-90 secondi di riposo tra ogni set. Effettua una breve pausa di 2-3 minuti tra i diversi esercizi. Lunedì / Mercoledì / Venerdì: 1. **Macchina Leg Press**: mirata per quadricipiti, glutei e femorali. 2. **Chest Press**: focalizzazione su pettorali, tricipiti. 3. **Lat Pulldown**: per dorso e bicipiti. 4. **Shoulder Press Machine**: mirata a deltoidi e trapezi. 5. **Leg Curl Machine**: focalizzazione su femorali. 6. **Arm Curl Machine**: per bicipiti. 7. **Tricep Extension Machine**: focalizzazione su tricipiti. 8. **Calf Raise Machine**: per i polpacci. 9. **Abdominal Machine**: per la muscolatura addominale. 10. **Back Extension Machine** (o Lower Back Machine): per rafforzare i muscoli lombari. # Cool-down: - 10 minuti di stretching focalizzato sui grandi gruppi muscolari per favorire il recupero e la flessibilità. # Note Importanti: - **Intensità**: Regola il peso in modo da rendere l'ultima ripetizione di ogni set difficile ma ancora eseguibile con la corretta forma. L'intensità dovrebbe essere tale che le ultime ripetizioni richiedano uno sforzo significativo. - **Progressione**: Aumenta progressivamente i pesi o il numero di ripetizioni/set nel corso delle settimane per evitare plateaus di adattamento e incoraggiare continui miglioramenti. - **Recupero**: Assicurati di nutrire adeguatamente il tuo corpo dopo l'allenamento e di dormire a sufficienza. Il recupero è cruciale per la definizione muscolare e la crescita. Ricorda che una nutrizione adeguata gioca un ruolo cruciale nella definizione muscolare. Una dieta ricca di proteine, con un adeguato bilancio di carboidrati e grassi insieme ad una idratazione sufficiente supporteranno il tuo allenamento e aiuteranno a massimizzare i risultati."},{"instruction":"اعطيني المكتبات الفعالة في بايثون لاختبار الاختراق على صفحات الدخول","output":"استخدام بايثون في اختبار الاختراق يعد من الأساليب المهمة التي يستخدمها الباحثين في الأمن السيبراني لتحديد نقاط الضعف في أنظمة الويب. علماً أن استخدام هذه الأدوات يجب أن يتم في البيئات التي لديك الإذن بتنفيذ اختبارات عليها، لاعتبارات قانونية وأخلاقية. هذه قائمة ببعض المكتبات الفعالة في بايثون لاختبار الاختراق، خصوصاً على صفحات الدخول: 1. **Requests**: ليست مكتبة اختبار اختراق بحد ذاتها، ولكنها ضرورية لإرسال الطلبات HTTP/HTTPS إلى الخوادم. يمكن استخدامها لاختبار صفحات الدخول بإرسال بيانات مستخدم (username/password) بشكل تلقائي. 2. **Beautiful Soup**: تساعدك على تحليل الHTML واستخراج البيانات من صفحات الويب، مما يمكن أن يكون مفيدًا لفهم كيفية بناء نماذج تسجيل الدخول وتحديد نقاط الضعف. 3. **Selenium**: يستخدم بشكل أساسي لاختبارات التطبيقات الويب بطريقة تلقائية. يمكن استخدام Selenium لأتمتة تسجيل الدخول إلى صفحات الويب واختبار مدى قوة الآليات الأمنية لصفحات الدخول. 4. **Scrapy**: إطار عمل مفتوح المصدر وقوي لكشط الويب (web crawling) واستخراج البيانات، يمكن استخدامه لجمع المعلومات حول صفحات الويب وتحديد النماذج وأنظمة تسجيل الدخول. 5. **Mechanize**: تسمح لك بتحاكي التصفح بواسطة روبوت، بما في ذلك ملء النماذج والنقر على الروابط. يمكن استخدامها لاختبار صفحات الدخول. 6. **Hydra**: أداة اختبار تخمين كلمات السر تدعم العديد من البروتوكولات، يمكن استخدامها من خلال الواجهة البرمجية (API) لتنفيذ اختبارات قوة الكلمات المرور على صفحات الدخول. مع هذه المكتبات والأدوات، يمكن أداء مجموعة واسعة من اختبارات الاختراق على صفحات الدخول لتحديد نقاط الضعف وتحسين أمان التطبيقات الويب. ومع ذلك، يجب دائمًا التأكد من الحصول على الإذن المناسب قبل بدء اختبارات الاختراق لتجنب المشاكل القانونية."},{"instruction":"اكتبه لي 20 هاشتاج حصري خاص بكرة القدم حاليا الفايس بوك","output":"إليك قائمة بـ20 هاشتاج يمكن استخدامها في منشورات تتعلق بكرة القدم على الفيسبوك لزيادة التفاعل والوصول إلى جمهور أوسع. يجب مراعاة أن هذه الهاشتاجات عامة ويمكن تخصيصها أكثر بناء على الفريق أو البطولة أو الحدث الذي تتحدث عنه: 1. #كرة_القدم 2. #مباريات_اليوم 3. #أهداف_المباراة 4. #كلاسيكو 5. #دوري_الأبطال 6. #الدوري_المحلي 7. #نجوم_الكرة 8. #تمريرات_ذهبية 9. #حراس_المرمى 10. #جمهور_الكرة 11. # تحليل_كروي 12. #أخبار_الانتقالات 13. #هدف_الأسبوع 14. #الحذاء_الذهبي 15. #مهارات_كروية 16. #تشكيلة_الفريق 17. #توقعات_المباريات 18. #جدول_المباريات 19. #فانتازي_كرة_القدم 20. #أساطير_الكرة هذه الهاشتاجات مصممة لتغطية مجموعة متنوعة من المواضيع المتعلقة بكرة القدم التي قد تهم الجماهير من جميع أنحاء العالم. يمكن تعديلها أو دمجها لتناسب المحتوى الخاص بك بشكل أفضل."},{"instruction":"for a series, what could the benefits of letting actors' clothes and hair get messed up be, and what could the downsides be?","output":"Letting actors' clothes and hair get messed up in a series can remarkably influence the storytelling, realism, and audience engagement. Here we discuss the potential benefits and downsides of this approach. # Benefits 1. **Increased Realism**: By allowing actors' appearances to degrade or change naturally according to the story, the series can cultivate a sense of authenticity and realism. This detail can help audiences more fully suspend their disbelief and engage with the narrative, particularly in genres grounded in real-life scenarios or survival stories. 2. **Character Development**: The physical transformation of a character can mirror their internal journey, whether it be through hardship, growth, or degradation. This non-verbal storytelling enhances character depth and can convey complex narratives without explicit dialogue. 3. **Emotional Impact**: Seeing characters in a disheveled state can evoke empathy or other strong emotional responses from the audience. It can make triumphant moments feel more earned or losses more poignant, increasing audience investment in the storyline and characters. 4. **Visual Storytelling**: Visual cues, such as progressively dirtier or more tattered clothing, can contribute significantly to the storytelling. It can indicate the passage of time, the intensity of challenges faced, or a character's disregard for self-care in pursuit of a goal. 5. **Encourages Attention to Detail**: Audiences who notice these changes might pay closer attention to other details, increasing engagement with the series. It can even stimulate discussion and speculation in fan communities, enhancing the viewing experience. # Downsides 1. **Consistency Issues**: Maintaining continuity can become more challenging, as it can be difficult to exactly replicate the level of \\"messiness\\" from scene to scene or episode to episode. Inconsistencies can distract astute viewers or detract from the believability of the story. 2. **Increased Production Costs and Time**: More attention to detail in continuity means potentially more time and money spent on makeup, hair, and costume design. This could also include the need for multiple versions of the same costume, which can increase production expenses. 3. **Audience Alienation**: While many viewers appreciate realism, others might find overly disheveled characters off-putting, especially in genres where escapism or idealization is a significant draw (like romantic comedies or certain fantasies). 4. **Clarity and Focus**: If not managed carefully, focusing too much on these physical transformations could distract from more important narrative elements or clutter the visual storytelling, making it harder for the audience to follow the primary narrative. 5. **Potential for Stereotyping or Misinterpretation**: Depending on the context, showing characters in a continually unkempt state could inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or send unintended messages about mental health, poverty, or other sensitive topics. In summary, while letting actors' clothes and hair get messed up can enhance a series' realism, character development, and emotional impact, it requires careful management to avoid consistency issues, increased costs, audience alienation, focus problems, and potential for misinterpretation."},{"instruction":"Write a summary of the main character, Hikamori, a thin guy with a pleasant appearance, 20 years old, is on the Internet, name: 直人","output":"Hikamori Naoto, at 20 years old, personifies a blend of physical delicacy with a likable demeanor, characteristics that cloak his persona.

Physically slender and bearing an inherent charm, he cuts a figure that’s at odds with societal expectations of someone who spends most of their time in the confines of their home, surfing the Internet. His world is largely virtual, a stark contrast to the physicality of real-world engagements, and it is within this digital realm that Dennis finds solace, understanding, and a semblance of community. However, Dennis's narrative takes an unexpected turn when, against his initial desires, he transitions from a reclusive lifestyle to embodying the role of a sumo wrestler. This radical change thrusts him into a world diametrically opposed to the isolation and digital immersion he's accustomed to. It challenges his physical limits, pushes him into the spotlight of public attention, and demands a level of social interaction and physicality that he has long avoided. His journey from a digital recluse to a sumo wrestler embodies a profound exploration of identity, resilience, and transformation. It showcases the potential for change, even when it seems incongruent with one’s self-conception or desires. Dennis's story is a compelling narrative about breaking free from the self-imposed limitations, confronting the discomfort of growth, and ultimately finding a place in a world that one never imagined being a part of. His reluctant but transformative sumo wrestling career becomes a metaphor for life's unpredictability and the serendipitous paths to self-discovery and acceptance."},{"instruction":"Hey!","output":"Hello!

First, you need to install pandas if you haven't yet. You can install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install pandas \`\`\` After installing pandas, you can use the following Python code to accomplish your task: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Load the CSV file df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv') # replace 'your_file.csv' with the path to your CSV file # Initialize new columns for High change and Low change with NaN (Not a Number) df['High change'] = float('NaN') df['Low change'] = float('NaN') # Iterate over the DataFrame by index to find rows where model_prediction is 1 for i in df.index: if df.loc[i, 'model_prediction'] == 1: current_close = df.loc[i, 'Close'] # Ensure we don't go out of bounds for the next two rows for j in range(1, 3): if i + j < len(df): # Calculate the percentage of changes and assign them to the new columns df.loc[i + j, 'High change'] = ((df.loc[i + j, 'High'] - current_close) / current_close) * 100 df.loc[i + j, 'Low change'] = ((df.loc[i + j, 'Low'] - current_close) / current_close) * 100 # Save the modified DataFrame back to a new CSV file df.to_csv('modified_file.csv', index=False) \`\`\` Explanation: 1. The code starts by importing pandas. 2. It then reads your CSV file into a DataFrame named \`df\`. 3. New columns for \\"High change\\" and \\"Low change\\" are initialized with NaN values because changes will only be calculated for specific rows based on your criteria. 4. The script iterates over each row of the DataFrame. When a row with \`model_prediction\` of 1 is found, it captures the \\"Close\\" value of the current row. 5. Then, for the next two rows (if they exist within the bounds of the DataFrame), it calculates the percentage change of their \\"High\\" and \\"Low\\" values respectively, relative to the \\"Close\\" value of the current row (where \`model_prediction\` is 1). These values are assigned to the corresponding new columns. 6. Lastly, the modified DataFrame is saved to a new CSV file named 'modified_file.csv'. Make sure to replace \`'your_file.csv'\` with the actual path to your CSV file. This code snippet assumes that your CSV's \`model_prediction\` column contains integer values of 0 or 1. If \`model_prediction\` is stored as strings or includes other integer values, adjustments to the condition checking this column may be necessary."},{"instruction":"Мне нужно написать приложение на C#.

Я покажу базовую структуру \`ImapService.cs\`. Для \`Pop3Service.cs\` структура будет аналогична, но с использованием соответствующих классов из \`MailKit\`. \`\`\`csharp using MailKit.Net.Imap; using System; using MailClient.Models; using MailKit; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace MailClient.Services { public class ImapService { public async Task ConnectAsync(EmailAccount emailAccount) { using (var client = new ImapClient()) { await client.ConnectAsync(emailAccount.ImapServer, emailAccount.ImapPort, useSsl: true); await client.AuthenticateAsync(emailAccount.Email, emailAccount.Password); await client.DisconnectAsync(true); } } // Здесь будут добавлены методы для получения и удаления писем } } \`\`\` В \`ImapService.cs\` и \`Pop3Service.cs\` потребуется добавить методы для взаимодействия с почтовым сервером: получение списка писем, чтение конкретного письма, удаление письма. # Шаг 3: MainViewModel \`MainViewModel\` будет управлять данными приложения и обрабатывать пользовательский ввод из графического интерфейса (WPF).

Теперь, когда основа вашего проекта подготовлена, перейдем к реализации чтения и обработки настроек почтового сервера и управлению сообщениями. # Чтение настроек с сервера Шаг 4: Загрузка настроек сервера Сначала создадим метод для чтения и поиска настроек в файлах \`imapdb.txt\` и \`popdb.txt\`. Этот метод можно реализовать в классе \`EmailService\`, который будет служить обработчиком для работы с почтовыми серверами на основе данных аккаунта. Добавим в проект новый класс \`EmailService.cs\`: \`\`\`csharp using MailClient.Models; using System.IO; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace MailClient.Services { public class EmailService { private const string ImapDbPath = \\"imapdb.txt\\"; private const string PopDbPath = \\"popdb.txt\\"; public async Task<EmailAccount> GetEmailSettingsAsync(string email, string password) { string domain = email.Split('@').Last(); EmailAccount account = new EmailAccount { Email = email, Password = password }; // Загрузка настроек IMAP string[] imapLines = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(ImapDbPath); var imapSetting = imapLines.Select(line => line.Split(':')) .FirstOrDefault(parts => parts[0] == domain); if (imapSetting != null) { account.ImapServer = imapSetting[1]; account.ImapPort = int.Parse(imapSetting[2]); } // Загрузка настроек POP3 string[] popLines = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(PopDbPath); var popSetting = popLines.Select(line => line.Split(':')) .FirstOrDefault(parts => parts[0] == domain); if (popSetting != null) { account.PopServer = popSetting[1]; account.PopPort = int.Parse(popSetting[2]); } return account; } } } \`\`\` Этот метод сначала определяет домен электронной почты, а затем ищет соответствующие настройки для IMAP и POP3 в файлах \`imapdb.txt\` и \`popdb.txt\`, создавая и наполняя экземпляр \`EmailAccount\`. # Работа с сообщениями Шаг 5: Реализация загрузки сообщений в \`ImapService\` Продолжим работу над \`ImapService\`, добавив метод для загрузки сообщений. Этот метод будет получать список последних писем из почтового ящика и возвращать его в виде коллекции объектов \`EmailMessage\`. Добавим базовую реализацию метода \`GetMessagesAsync\` в \`ImapService.cs\`: \`\`\`csharp using MailKit; using MailKit.Net.Imap; using MailKit.Search; using MailClient.Models; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; public async Task<IEnumerable<EmailMessage>> GetMessagesAsync(EmailAccount account, int count = 10) { var messages = new List<EmailMessage>(); using (var client = new ImapClient()) { await client.ConnectAsync(account.ImapServer, account.ImapPort, MailKit.Security.SecureSocketOptions.SslOnConnect); await client.AuthenticateAsync(account.Email, account.Password); var inbox = client.Inbox; await inbox.OpenAsync(FolderAccess.ReadOnly); for (int i = inbox.Count - count; i < inbox.Count; i++) { var message = await inbox.GetMessageAsync(i); messages.Add(new EmailMessage { From = string.Join(\\", \\", message.From), Subject = message.Subject, DateReceived = message.Date.DateTime, Body = message.TextBody // В простых случаях используем TextBody, для HTML содержимого можно использовать HtmlBody. }); } await client.DisconnectAsync(true); } return messages; } \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что параметр \`count\` в методе \`GetMessagesAsync\` используется для определения количества последних сообщений, которые мы хотели бы получить. # Подключение ViewModel Шаг 6: Подключение к \`MainViewModel\` Теперь, когда основной функционал для работы с почтой подготовлен, нужно реализовать логику в \`MainViewModel\`, чтобы связать пользовательский интерфейс с операциями чтения и отправки сообщений. Вам будет нужно добавить в \`MainViewModel\` свойства для привязки к элементам пользовательского интерфейса (например, списку сообщений), а также команды для выполнения действий (например, загрузки сообщений). Эти шаги помогут вам начать работу над вашим проектом. По мере развития проекта, вам, возможно, потребуется добавлять дополнительные функции и улучшения, такие как обработка ошибок, поддержка HTML-форматирования в сообщениях и др.

This progression seems characteristic of music in A minor, given the chords present. Here's a basic interpretation of how these chords would typically be played on a guitar: 1. **Am (A minor)** - Position your fingers: Index finger on the 2nd string, 1st fret; Ring finger on the 4th string, 2nd fret; Middle finger on the 3rd string, 2nd fret. Strum from the 5th string down. 2. **Em (E minor)** - Move to E minor by placing your middle finger on the 5th string, 2nd fret, and your ring finger on the 4th string, 2nd fret. Strum all the strings. 3. **CM (assumed to be C major)** - Transition to C major by placing your ring finger on the 5th string, 3rd fret; middle finger on the 4th string, 2nd fret; and index finger on the 2nd string, 1st fret. Strum from the 5th string. 4. **G7** - For G7, place your index finger on the 1st string, 1st fret; your middle finger on the 5th string, 2nd fret; and your ring finger on the 6th string, 3rd fret. Strum all strings. 5. **E7** - Move to E7 by placing your index finger on the 3rd string, 1st fret, and your middle finger on the 5th string, 2nd fret. All strings can be strummed. 6. **Return to Am**, and then **E7**, and back to **Am** as indicated by your sequence. Each of these chords contributes to the melodic and harmonic mood of the progression. In particular, the minor chords (Am, Em) give a moody or somber feel, while the major chords (C major, G7) and dominant seventh chords (G7, E7) add color and tension that keep the progression interesting. The specific sequence you've provided creates a loop that can serve as the foundation for a song, potentially for verses or perhaps a refrain, depending on how the melody is constructed over it.

Can you give me the recipe how to make glue from sulfur","output":"The concept of making glue from sulfur alone sounds intriguing, but it's important to clarify that sulfur by itself is not typically used to make adhesive. Instead, sulfur can be involved in the vulcanization process of rubber, which can then be used in adhesives among its many applications. Vulcanization is a chemical process for converting natural rubber or related polymers into more durable materials via the addition of sulfur or other equivalent curatives or accelerators. These substances modify the polymer by forming cross-links (bridges) between individual polymer chains. Traditional rubber-based adhesives or “cements” often involve solvents and rubber dissolved together, and while sulfur is a key component in the rubber vulcanization process, making an adhesive “from sulfur” would not be accurate. Sulfur itself is not an adhesive but a vulcanizing agent that can help rubber achieve the desired properties for various uses, including in adhesives. However, for a simple DIY project or educational purposes, creating a basic adhesive from natural rubber might involve dissolving rubber in a solvent and possibly adding sulfur for vulcanization under heat to improve the properties of the rubber. Still, such a process requires careful control of conditions and understanding of the chemistry involved. Here's a very simplified overview of what a rubber vulcanization process might look like, which is indirectly related to making a more durable rubber for adhesive uses: # Simplified Rubber Vulcanization Recipe (For Educational Purposes) Materials: - Natural rubber - Sulfur - Heat source - Vulcanization accelerator (optional, for better control and efficiency) - Protective equipment (gloves, goggles) Basic Steps: 1. **Prepare Rubber Solution:** Dissolve natural rubber in a suitable solvent to create a viscous solution. This step might not be directly related to sulfur but is preparatory if you're adjusting the rubber's properties before making an adhesive. 2. **Mixing:** Incorporate sulfur into the rubber solution. The amount of sulfur can vary based on the desired properties; about 1-5% of sulfur by weight of rubber is common in vulcanization processes. 3. **Add Accelerator:** If you're using a vulcanization accelerator, add it to the mixture according to the recommended proportions. This step is optional but advisable for better control over the process. 4. **Heat:** The mixture is then heated. The temperature and duration of heating depend on the specific rubber and additives being used. Typical vulcanization temperatures range from 140°C to 160°C, and the process could take from several minutes to hours. 5. **Cool and Use:** After heating, allow the rubber to cool and solidify. It can then be applied or used as intended, potentially as part of an adhesive formulation. It’s crucial to note that working with chemicals requires proper knowledge, safety precautions, and in many cases, a controlled laboratory environment. The description provided here is quite basic and intended for general informational purposes rather than direct application. For actual adhesive formulation, especially if you're looking to create something from scratch or for a specific purpose, consulting with a material scientist or a chemical engineer would be beneficial to understand the complexities and safety considerations involved in adhesive manufacture and sulfur chemistry."},{"instruction":"Come,\\" said the Barmecide, \\" let us now have supper /' and though nothing was brought, he pretended to cut, as if a dish of meat were before him, and began to chew, saying to my brother* \\" Eat, friend, eat heartily you said you was hungry, but you pro- ceed as if you had no appetite.\\" Shacabac gave readily into the ioke, and imitating the Barmecide, said, tl You see, my lord, I lose no time.\\" \\" Boy,\\" said the old gentleman, \\" bring us another dish Come, my good friend, taste of this mutton and barley broth, unless you prefer part of that goose, with sweet sauc-3, vinegar, honey ? raisins, grey peas, and dry figs ; eat, however, sparingly of it, as we have a variety of good things to come.\\" Shacabac, fainting with hunger, pretended to feast heartily on these invisible dainties.

In this story, the tale of the Barmecide's feast is one of the most famous segments. The Barmecide, a wealthy and noble man, invites the Barber's brother, Shacabac, who is poor and hungry, to dine with him. However, when it's time to eat, the Barmecide begins to pretend as if he's serving Shacabac a lavish feast when, in reality, there is no food at all. Each \\"course\\" of the meal is invisible, and the Barmecide pretends to eat and enjoy each dish, encouraging Shacabac to do the same. Shacabac, realizing the joke but driven by his hunger and desperation, decides to play along, praising each imaginary dish and expressing his enjoyment. This goes on with the Barmecide describing various luxurious dishes and pretending to serve them, while Shacabac continues to affirm how delicious everything is. The tale takes a turn when the Barmecide reveals the jest but recognizes Shacabac's good humor and resilience in the face of hardship. Touched by this, the Barmecide then offers Shacabac a real feast and extends his hospitality and generosity further, making Shacabac a part of his household and blessing him with prosperity henceforth. This story within \\"The Arabian Nights\\" is often interpreted as a lesson on generosity, the human spirit, and the idea that fortune can change at any moment. It also emphasizes the importance of enjoying the company and being grateful even when material expectations are not met. The tale of the Barmecide's feast endures as a vivid illustration of how kindness, humor, and grace in the face of adversity can lead to unexpected blessings."},{"instruction":"So, you are using GPT-4 model.","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to confirm the specific version or updates applied to my programming in real-time.

Rispetta i principi base del fitness, come la periodicità, la sistemazione dei tempi di riposo e la variazione degli esercizi per stimolare adeguatamente i muscoli. Ecco alcuni suggerimenti per ottimizzare i risultati e mantenere l'efficacia dell'allenamento nel tempo: 1. **Progressione dell'intensità**: È fondamentale incrementare progressivamente il carico o modificare la difficoltà degli esercizi per continuare a stimolare l'adattamento muscolare e l'ipertrofia. 2. **Riscaldamento e Defaticamento**: Assicurati di includere sempre una fase di riscaldamento prima di iniziare gli esercizi e una fase di defaticamento al termine. Questo può includere stretching dinamico, esercizi a corpo libero a bassa intensità o cardio leggero per preparare il corpo all'attività fisica e ridurre il rischio di infortuni. 3. **Nutrizione e Idratazione**: L'alimentazione gioca un ruolo critico nel recupero muscolare e nell'incremento delle prestazioni. Assicurati di consumare una dieta equilibrata con una buona quantità di proteine per il recupero muscolare, carboidrati per l'energia e grassi sani, oltre a rimanere ben idratato. 4. **Recupero**: Il recupero è altrettanto importante quanto l'allenamento stesso. Assicurati di dormire a sufficienza e considerare tecniche di recupero come massaggi, bagni di ghiaccio, o stretching/yoga per incrementare la flessibilità e ridurre il dolore muscolare post-esercizio. 5. **Varietà**: Per prevenire la monotonia e continuare a stimolare il corpo, È importante variare regolarmente gli esercizi, l'intensità e il volume dell'allenamento. Questo aiuta a mantenere l'interesse e a stimolare ulteriormente i miglioramenti. 6. **Ascolta il Tuo Corpo**: Se avverti dolore o disagio durante un esercizio, è importante fermarsi e valutare la situazione. Potrebbe essere necessario modificare l'esercizio o consultare un professionista del fitness o della salute per evitare infortuni. Ricordati che la coerenza è la chiave per raggiungere i risultati desiderati. Mantieni una routine regolare, segui i principi di una buona nutrizione e di idratazione, e assicurati di dare al tuo corpo il tempo di riposare e recuperare adeguatamente."},{"instruction":"fammela in formato stampa con lo spazio per segnare i pesi","output":"# Programma di Allenamento Settimanale Lunedì – Upper Body Assicurati di riscaldarti prima di iniziare. - **Chest Press (Pettorali)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie - **Lat Machine (Dorsali)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie - **Shoulder Press (Spalle)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie - **Pec Deck Fly (Pettorali)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie - **Tricep Extension (Tricipiti)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie - **Bicep Curl (Bicipiti)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie - **Cable Cross-Over (Pettorali)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie --- Mercoledì – Lower Body & Core Riscaldamento pre-esercizio raccomandato. - **Leg Press (Gambe)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 90 secondi tra le serie - **Leg Curl (Ischiocrurali)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 60 secondi tra le serie (continua con gli altri esercizi mantenendo lo stesso formato) --- Venerdì – Total Body & Definizione Non dimenticare il riscaldamento! - **Smith Machine Squat (Gambe/Total Body)** - [ ] Serie 1: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 2: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - [ ] Serie 3: 12 ripetizioni - Peso: _______ - Pausa: 90 secondi tra le serie (continua con gli altri esercizi seguendo lo schema sopra) --- # Suggerimenti: - Ricorda di idratarti durante e dopo gli allenamenti. - Monitora il tuo recupero e adatta i pesi in base ai progressi. - Ascolta il tuo corpo: se un esercizio causa dolore, fermati e valuta. --- Stampa e porta questo schema con te in palestra.

AI可以通过分析大量的儿童文学和睡前故事，生成独特、吸引人的新故事或故事大纲。这些故事会具备吸引儿童注意力所需的元素，比如奇幻、冒险、温馨的友情和家庭价值观。 2. **角色设计**： - 借助AI的图像生成工具，可以设计出独一无二的动画角色。用户可以提供描述性关键词（如“勇敢的小狗”，“神秘的森林精灵”等），AI则能够基于这些描述生成角色图像草图。 3. **场景布局**： - AI能够根据故事内容推荐合适的场景设置，无论是令人梦幻的魔法森林、遥远的星系还是舒适的小屋，都能通过AI算法设计出令人信服的虚拟场景图。 4. **动画制作**： - 利用AI-driven的动画软件，可以自动化许多动画制作过程中的复杂任务，比如角色动作同步、面部表情匹配等，大大提高制作效率。 5. **语音合成和配音**： - 通过AI的语音合成技术，可以生成自然流畅、情感丰富的配音。此外，AI还能根据故事的情绪变化调整语调，为不同的角色创造独特的声音。 6. **个性化体验**： - AI技术使得根据观看者的反馈和偏好，动态调整故事走向成为可能。比如，根据孩子的兴趣爱好，AI可以实时调整故事细节，使故事更具个人化和互动性。 在使用AI辅助制作睡前动画的过程中，创意与技术的结合为孩子们带来了前所未有的视觉和听觉体验，不仅能够激发他们的想象力，也在某种程度上有助于培养孩子们对科技的兴趣。这种创新的尝试既是多媒体内容制作的一大进步，也为儿童教育和娱乐开辟了新的路径。"},{"instruction":"Is there a case where the weight of carry-on luggage is measured right before boarding an international flight?","output":"Yes, there are cases where the weight of carry-on luggage is measured right before boarding an international flight. While policies vary among airlines and airports, some scenarios where this might occur include: 1. **Strict adherence to carry-on policies**: Airlines with strict carry-on policies may weigh luggage at the gate to ensure that it complies with their weight limits. This is more common with budget airlines aiming to minimize overhead compartment clutter and enforce paid check-in luggage policies. 2. **Full or nearly full flights**: On flights that are heavily booked, airlines might check carry-on luggage weight and size more diligently to ensure everything fits in the overhead bins and complies with safety regulations. 3. **Irregular operations**: In situations like aircraft changes to a smaller plane, airlines might need to enforce carry-on restrictions more strictly due to limited overhead bin space. 4. **Destination-specific regulations**: Some destinations have stricter regulations regarding baggage, including carry-on luggage, due to the capabilities of the landing airports or the size of the aircraft commonly used (e.g., smaller planes for island destinations). 5. **Random checks**: Airlines may conduct random checks as part of their standard operating procedure to ensure compliance with their luggage policies. Passengers are generally advised to check their airline's carry-on luggage policy before flying, including weight and size limits, to avoid any last-minute surprises at the gate. Additionally, being prepared for the possibility of having to check your carry-on luggage at the gate, possibly incurring fees, can help mitigate stress and delays during your travel."},{"instruction":"fammi questa scheda in formato stampa, con una bella grafica, che entri in una pagina e che abbia lo spazio x segnare i pesi Lunedì – Upper Body Tempo Totale di Allenamento (escluso riscaldamento): 65 minuti 1.

Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M","output":"Understanding how to calculate quantities of a substance and its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept is essential in chemistry. Let's dive into these concepts step by step: # The Mole Concept The mole is a fundamental unit in chemistry that allows chemists to compare different units and easily convert between amounts of substance and the number of particles. This is crucial because, in practice, it's impossible to count the particles directly due to their incredibly small size and huge numbers. # Avogadro's Number Avogadro's number plays a pivotal role in connecting the microscopic world of atoms and molecules to the macroscopic world we can measure. Avogadro's number is defined as (6.022 times 10^{23} text{ mol}^{-1}), meaning one mole of any substance contains exactly (6.022 times 10^{23}) particles (atoms, molecules, or formula units depending on the substance). # Dimensional Analysis and the Mole Dimensional analysis is a technique used in science to convert one type of measure into another. In the context of the mole concept, it helps us translate the mass of a substance into an amount in moles and vice versa. Mass, Molar Mass, and Moles Equation (EQN: (n = frac{m}{M})) To calculate the number of moles ((n)) in a given sample, you need to know two things: 1. The mass of the sample ((m)), generally in grams. 2. Its molar mass ((M)), which is the mass in grams of one mole of the substance. The equation (n = frac{m}{M}) succinctly represents this relationship. - **(n)** = number of moles - **(m)** = mass of the sample (in grams) - **(M)** = molar mass of the substance (in grams per mole, g/mol) # Using Atomic Mass Units (amu) The atomic mass unit is a standard unit of mass that quantifies mass on an atomic or molecular scale (amu). It's useful because the mass of an individual atom or molecule in amu is numerically equivalent to the molar mass of that substance in grams per mole. For example, Carbon has an atomic mass of approximately 12 amu, which means one mole of carbon (Avogadro's number of atoms) will weigh 12 grams. # Practical Example Let's calculate the number of moles in 36 grams of water (H₂O). 1. Find the molar mass of water by adding the molar masses of hydrogen and oxygen: - Hydrogen = 1 g/mol (since there are 2 H atoms, multiply by 2) - Oxygen = 16 g/mol - Thus, water has a molar mass of (2*1 + 16 = 18 text{ g/mol}) 2. Use the formula (n = frac{m}{M}): - (m = 36 text{ g}) - (M = 18 text{ g/mol}) So, (n = frac{36 text{ g}}{18 text{ g/mol}} = 2) moles of water. This calculation shows you have 2 moles of water, which translates to (2 times 6.022 times 10^{23}) water molecules, demonstrating how the mole concept, Avogadro's number, and dimensional analysis are used together to bridge the gap between masses of substances and the number of particles."},{"instruction":"fammi questa scheda in formato stampa, che entri in una pagina e che abbia lo spazio x segnare i pesi Lunedì – Upper Body Tempo Totale di Allenamento (escluso riscaldamento): 65 minuti 1.

While policies vary among airlines and airports, some scenarios where this might occur include: 1. Strict adherence to carry-on policies: Airlines with strict carry-on policies may weigh luggage at the gate to ensure that it complies with their weight limits. This is more common with budget airlines aiming to minimize overhead compartment clutter and enforce paid check-in luggage policies. 2. Full or nearly full flights: On flights that are heavily booked, airlines might check carry-on luggage weight and size more diligently to ensure everything fits in the overhead bins and complies with safety regulations. 3. Irregular operations: In situations like aircraft changes to a smaller plane, airlines might need to enforce carry-on restrictions more strictly due to limited overhead bin space. 4. Destination-specific regulations: Some destinations have stricter regulations regarding baggage, including carry-on luggage, due to the capabilities of the landing airports or the size of the aircraft commonly used (e.g., smaller planes for island destinations). 5. Random checks: Airlines may conduct random checks as part of their standard operating procedure to ensure compliance with their luggage policies. Passengers are generally advised to check their airline’s carry-on luggage policy before flying, including weight and size limits, to avoid any last-minute surprises at the gate. Additionally, being prepared for the possibility of having to check your carry-on luggage at the gate, possibly incurring fees, can help mitigate stress and delays during your travel.를 한국어로 번역","output":"짐의 무게를 국제 비행 출발 직전에 측정하는 경우가 있습니다. 항공사와 공항마다 정책이 다르긴 하지만, 이런 상황이 발생할 수 있습니다: 1. 기내 수하물 정책을 엄격하게 준수하는 경우: 기내 수하물 정책이 엄격한 항공사는 탑승 게이트에서 짐의 무게를 측정하여 제한 무게를 준수하는지 확인할 수 있습니다. 이는 주로 수하물을 체크인하는 데 비용을 부과하고, 오버헤드 수납공간 혼잡을 최소화하려는 저가 항공사에서 더 흔합니다. 2. 만석 또는 거의 만석인 항공편: 승객이 많이 예약된 비행편에서는, 항공사가 모든 짐이 오버헤드 빈에 들어갈 수 있고 안전 규정을 준수하는지 보장하기 위해 기내 수하물의 무게와 크기를 더 엄격하게 검사할 수 있습니다. 3. 비정상적인 운영 상황: 작은 비행기로 항공기 변경과 같은 상황에서, 항공사는 제한된 오버헤드 빈 공간 때문에 기내 수하물 제한을 더 엄격하게 적용할 수 있습니다. 4. 목적지별 규정: 일부 목적지는 착륙 공항의 용량이나 일반적으로 사용되는 항공기의 크기(예: 섬 목적지를 위한 작은 비행기) 때문에 수하물, 특히 기내 수하물에 대해 더 엄격한 규정을 가지고 있습니다. 5. 무작위 검사: 항공사는 자신들의 수하물 정책 준수를 보장하기 위해 표준 운영 절차의 일부로 무작위 검사를 실시할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 승객들은 출발 전에 항공사의 기내 수하물 정책을 확인하는 것이 좋으며, 이는 무게와 크기 제한을 포함합니다. 게이트에서 기내 수하물을 체크인해야 할 가능성에 대비하고, 비용이 발생할 수 있으므로 여행 중 스트레스와 지연을 완화하는 데 도움이 됩니다."},{"instruction":"fammi questa scheda in formato stampa, che entri in una pagina e che abbia lo spazio x segnare i pesi Lunedì – Upper Body Tempo Totale di Allenamento (escluso riscaldamento): 65 minuti 1.

Она позволяет легко парсить HTML и работать с элементами документа. Однако, вы упомянули \`IDocument\`, что скорее всего относится к использованию библиотеки \`AngleSharp\`, которая также позволяет выполнять парсинг и манипулирование содержимым HTML документов в C#. Вот пример, как можно получить элемент по тегу, используя ID и библиотеку \`AngleSharp\`: 1. Сначала убедитесь, что у вас установлена библиотека \`AngleSharp\`. Если она не установлена, вы можете добавить ее через NuGet Package Manager: \`\`\` Install-Package AngleSharp \`\`\` 2. Код для получения элемента по ID будет выглядеть следующим образом: \`\`\`csharp using AngleSharp; using AngleSharp.Dom; using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; class Program { static async Task Main(string[] args) { var context = BrowsingContext.New(Configuration.Default); var document = await context.OpenAsync(req => req.Content(\\"<html><body><div id='myId'>Hello, World!</div></body></html>\\")); // Получаем элемент по ID var element = document.GetElementById(\\"myId\\"); if (element != null) { Console.WriteLine(element.TextContent); // Выводим содержимое элемента } } } \`\`\` В этом примере мы создаем новый контекст просмотра (сессию, в которой будет выполняться парсинг), а затем загружаем в него HTML как строку.

Они позволяют настройки \`HttpClient\` так, чтобы работать через SOCKS прокси. Пример использования \`MihaZupan.HttpToSocks5Proxy\`: \`\`\`csharp using MihaZupan; ... var proxy = new HttpToSocks5Proxy(\\"142.54.228.193\\", 4145); // Если требуется аутентификация: // var proxy = new HttpToSocks5Proxy(\\"142.54.228.193\\", 4145, \\"username\\", \\"password\\"); var httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler { Proxy = proxy }; using var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpClientHandler); // Теперь можно совершить запрос, как показано выше в вашем коде. ... \`\`\` 3. **Обходные пути**: Если вы не можете использовать другие типы прокси или сторонние библиотеки, рассмотрите возможность использования низкоуровневой библиотеки, например, \`SocksWebProxy\`, которая предоставляет большую гибкость в настройке соединений. 4. **Проверьте сертификат SSL**: Убедитесь, что сервер, к которому вы обращаетесь, использует действительный SSL сертификат. Сообщения об ошибках SSL могут указывать на проблемы с цепочкой сертификатов или отсутствие доверия к сертификату сервера. 5. **Отключение проверки сертификата**: Это не рекомендуется из-за потенциальных рисков безопасности, но для целей тестирования можно временно отключить проверку SSL сертификата (не используйте этот метод в продакшене): \`\`\`csharp httpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) => true; \`\`\` Помните, что решения 4 и 5 следует использовать только в крайних случаях или для тестирования в контролируемой среде, поскольку они делают ваше приложение уязвимым для атак типа \\"man-in-the-middle\\"."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for stock photo for social media within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical coffee and flower","output":"Elegant Flat Lay | Social Media Stock Photo | Coffee and Spring Blooms | Professional High-Resolution Image | Instant Download"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Elegant Flat Lay | Social Media Stock Photo | Coffee and Spring Blooms | Professional High-Resolution Image | Instant Download.

Invest in stocks: Investing in stocks has the potential to generate high returns over time. By purchasing shares of a company, you become a partial owner and can benefit from the company's growth and profitability. 2. Start a business: Starting a business can be a great way to use your money to make more money. By investing in a business idea that has the potential for growth and profitability, you can generate a steady stream of income. 3. Real estate investments: Investing in real estate properties can provide a steady stream of rental income and potential for appreciation over time. You can also consider house flipping or property development for higher returns. 4. Peer-to-peer lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to lend money to individuals or businesses in exchange for interest payments. This can be a passive way to generate income from your money. 5. High-interest savings accounts or CDs: Putting your money in a high-interest savings account or certificate of deposit (CD) can help you earn interest on your savings. While the returns may not be as high as other investment options, they are low-risk and can provide a steady income stream. 6. Mutual funds or ETFs: Investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide diversification and professional management of your investments. These funds pool money from investors to invest in a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities.

It supports different numeric bases (hexadecimal, binary, octal, and decimal) for the values, as well as unit suffixes (\`KB\`, \`kb\`, \`MB\`, \`mb\`) to multiply the numeric value accordingly. Here's a breakdown and explanation of the code: 1. **Extract the first character** of the \`val\` string to determine if it's an environment variable (indicated by a leading \`\` character). 2. **Check for environment variable**: If the first character is \`\`, the code will: - Extract the environment variable name. - Attempt to retrieve the value of this environment variable. - If the environment variable is not set, it checks if there's a default value provided after an \`=\` sign within the \`val\` string. If no default value is present and no environment variable is set, it throws an exception. - If a default value is specified (after the \`=\` sign), it uses this value. 3. **Process the environment/default value**: - The code checks for unit suffixes (\`KB\`, \`kb\`, \`MB\`, \`mb\`) to adjust the numeric value accordingly. This is used to multiply the base numeric value by the unit size (1, 1024, or 1024*1024). - It also supports different numeric bases for the value: hexadecimal (\`0x\` or \`0X\` prefix), binary (\`0b\` or \`0B\` prefix), octal (leading \`0\`), or decimal (no special prefix). - The processed value is then converted into an \`unsigned long\` using \`std::stoul\`, with the base determined by the prefixes mentioned. For decimal and unit adjusted values, the base is assumed to be 10 if not otherwise specified. 4. **Error handling**: The code has some error handling for scenarios where: - The environment variable is not set and no default value is provided. - The provided environment string is empty. 5. **Extraction and conversion logic**: The value extraction and conversion logic takes into account the numeric base, unit suffix, and does the conversion accordingly. Potential issues and improvements: - There's a typo in the exception throw: it should be \`throw EnvOrInitValueMissing(errorStr);\` instead of \`throw EnvOrInitValueMissin{errorStrStream};\`. Also, \`EnvOrInitValueMissing\` should be a custom exception class defined elsewhere in your code. - The code comment mentions a variable \`substr_end\` but it seems to be declared and used without initial explanation. Please ensure it's adequately declared and initialized before use. - The use of a variable named \`env_end\` seems misleading. Initially, it's a string that could hold unit suffixes, but there's an attempt to assign \`std::string::npos\` to it, which is incorrect because \`std::string::npos\` is of type \`std::string::size_type\`, not \`std::string\`. You might want to refactor this part for clarity. Remember to adequately test this code with various input combinations to ensure it behaves as expected in all cases."},{"instruction":"Cybersecurity projects to do at home for experience?..","output":"Engaging in cybersecurity projects at home is a fantastic way to build your skill set, learn new tools and techniques, and potentially enhance your career prospects.

Ogni sessione è strutturata in modo da durare circa 65 minuti, il che è un buon lasso di tempo per mantenere alta l'intensità dell'allenamento senza andare incontro a fatica eccessiva o a diminuzioni di performance. Ecco alcuni punti di analisi e suggerimenti: 1. **Varietà degli Esercizi**: La scelta degli esercizi è varia e copre tutti i principali gruppi muscolari. È positivo vedere una combinazione di movimenti composti e isolati, il che aiuta a sviluppare sia forza funzionale sia estetica muscolare. 2. **Esercizi per il Core**: È buona pratica avere una giornata dedicata anche agli esercizi per il core. Il core è fondamentale per la stabilità generale e può migliorare le prestazioni in molti altri esercizi. 3. **Periodizzazione e Progressione**: Assicurati di avere un piano per la progressione. Questo potrebbe significare aumentare i pesi usati, variare il numero di ripetizioni o serie, o introdurre nuovi esercizi per continui stimoli muscolari e adattamento. 4. **Pausa**: I tempi di pausa sono adeguati per la rigenerazione ATP, soprattutto per i pesi pesanti. Tuttavia, l'adattamento del tempo di pausa può variare a seconda degli obiettivi specifici, come ad esempio ridurre il tempo di pausa per un lavoro più incentrato sull'endurance muscolare. 5. **Pesi (kg)**: Evidentemente hai lasciato vuota la colonna dei pesi, la quale è fondamentale per personalizzare l'allenamento. Assicurati di iniziare con un peso che ti permetta di completare le serie e le ripetizioni con una buona forma, poi progressivamente aumentalo per promuovere la crescita muscolare. 6. **Riscaldamento**: È importante includere una sessione di riscaldamento specifica prima di iniziare l'allenamento per prevenire infortuni e preparare fisicamente e mentalmente per l'attività. 7. **Recupero**: Assicurati di avere sufficiente recupero tra le sessioni, soprattutto perché questa scheda include allenamenti abbastanza intensi. Il recupero può includere riposo attivo, stretching, sonno adeguato e nutrizione corretta. In generale, la tua scheda di allenamento ha i tratti di una programmazione equilibrata. Tuttavia, è essenziale ascoltare il tuo corpo e apportare le dovute modifiche se necessario, soprattutto in termini di recupero e progressione del carico."},{"instruction":"buona per definizione","output":"Per obiettivi di definizione muscolare, la tua scheda di allenamento può essere efficace, ma alcuni aggiustamenti potrebbero migliorare ulteriormente i risultati e personalizzarla per questo scopo specifico. Ecco alcuni suggerimenti su come potresti ottimizzare la tua programma settimanale: 1. **Aumentare la Frequenza Cardiaca**: Integra intervalli ad alta intensità (HIIT) o cardio moderato alla fine delle tue sessioni. Questo può aiutare nell'incrementare la spesa calorica totale, che è cruciale per la perdita di grasso mantenendo al tempo stesso la massa muscolare. 2. **Controllare le Calorie e i Macronutrienti**: Per la definizione, l'alimentazione gioca un ruolo chiave. Assicurati di essere in un leggero deficit calorico per promuovere la perdita di grasso, senza compromettere le energie necessarie per gli allenamenti pesanti. Presta attenzione alla qualità dei macronutrienti, mantenendo un'adeguata assunzione di proteine per sostenere la riparazione e la crescita muscolare. 3. **Super-set o Circuit Training**: Per le giornate di allenamento, potresti voler considerare l'implementazione di super-set o circuiti che permettono un numero maggiore di ripetizioni con riposo minimo tra gli esercizi, incrementando così l'intensità dell'allenamento e stimolando il metabolismo. 4. **Maggiore Enfasi sull'Esercizio Aerobico**: Se il tuo obiettivo primario è la definizione, potrebbe essere utile dedicare più tempo al cardio o agli esercizi aerobici, sempre riconoscendo l'importanza di mantenere una forte componente di resistenza per preservare la massa muscolare. 5. **Periodizzazione e Variazioni**: Modifica la tua scheda di allenamento ogni 4-6 settimane per continuare a stimolare i muscoli in modi nuovi. Questo può includere cambiamenti nel tipo di esercizi, nell'ordine degli esercizi, nelle ripetizioni, nelle serie, nei tempi di riposo, ecc., per mantenere il corpo in uno stato di adattamento costante e ottimale. 6. **Idratazione e Sonno**: Non sottovalutare l'importanza di una buona idratazione e di un sonno di qualità, entrambi essenziali per ottimizzare la perdita di grasso e favorire la riparazione e la crescita muscolare. Ricorda che la definizione muscolare è influenzata sia dall'allenamento sia dalla dieta, nonché da fattori come l'equilibrio ormonale e il tuo deficit calorico. Un approccio olistico alla tua routine quotiana, inclusi alimentazione, riposo e gestione dello stress, può migliorarne l'efficacia."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The implementation needs to be replaced with your actual parsing logic. - Corrected the typo in the exception name from \`EnvOrInitValueMissin\` to \`EnvOrInitValueMissing\` and updated the struct to adhere to naming conventions. - Removed undefined variables and corrected logical errors—such as how \`val.substr(default_pos + 1, val.length() - substr_end)\` was used—by simplifying it to \`val.substr(default_pos + 1)\` for the case where an environment variable is not found but a default value is provided. - Added headers for completeness and to clarify dependencies. - Made possible adjustments and simplifications to improve readability and maintainability without altering the code's intended functionality too much. This revision provides a skeleton that addresses structure and syntax issues, but you must fill in the actual logic for parsing the environment string as per the original intentions, especially within the \`ProcessEnvString\` function."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, AutoCAD doesn't come with a predefined hatch pattern specifically for small pebbles out of the box. You have a couple of options to achieve this effect: # Option 1: Use a Predefined Hatch Pattern that Resembles Small Pebbles AutoCAD includes a variety of hatch patterns, and some of them might resemble small pebbles closely enough for your needs. Patterns like GRAVEL or one of the SAND patterns might be a good place to start. To use one of these, follow these steps: 1. **Initiate the Hatch command**: Type \`HATCH\` in the command line or select the Hatch tool from the Draw/Modify panel. 2. **Choose a Pattern**: In the Hatch Creation tab, click on the hatch pattern dropdown menu to select a hatch pattern. For small pebbles, you could try starting with GRAVEL or SAND to see if it suits your needs. 3. **Modify the Scale**: Adjust the scale of the hatch pattern to get the desired size of the pebbles. Smaller scales will create a denser pattern, which might better resemble small pebbles. 4. **Apply to Area**: Click inside the area you wish to fill or select the boundaries if necessary. 5. **Finish**: Press Enter or click Apply to place the hatch. Adjustments can be made as needed. # Option 2: Create or Import a Custom Hatch Pattern If you're looking for a very specific small pebble look, you might need to create or import a custom hatch pattern. AutoCAD allows you to define custom patterns using a simple syntax in a PAT file. Here is a very basic example of what creating a custom pattern might involve: 1. **Create or Edit a PAT File**: Using a text editor, you can create a .PAT file (or edit an existing one). The syntax for these files can be a bit complex, but there are resources and guides online that can help you understand how to design your pattern. For pebbles, you might start with simple dots or circles spaced irregularly. 2. **Syntax Example**: \`\`\` *PEBBLES, Small pebbles pattern ;%UNITS=MM 0, 0,0, 2.5,2.5, -1.25,1.25, 0,0, 1.25,-1.25 \`\`\` 3. **Load the Custom Pattern**: Save your .PAT file to a location that AutoCAD can access. You might need to load the custom pattern through the Hatch command's interface by selecting \\"Custom\\" and then navigating to your PAT file. 4. **Apply Your Custom Hatch**: Follow a similar process as with predefined hatches to apply your custom pebble hatch to the desired area in your drawing. Creating custom patterns can be a bit complex, especially for intricate or highly realistic textures. Online communities and forums for AutoCAD users can be great resources for finding pre-made custom hatch patterns or getting help with creating your own. It's always worth checking to see if someone has already created a pattern that meets your needs."},{"instruction":"reduce hatch transparency autocad","output":"In AutoCAD, adjusting the transparency of hatch patterns can help improve the readability of your design or emphasize certain features. Transparency for hatch patterns can be set directly when creating or editing the hatch, allowing you to control how overlaying hatch patterns blend with the elements underneath them. Here’s how you can reduce or adjust the transparency of a hatch in AutoCAD: # Using Hatch Creation or Hatch Edit 1. **Select Hatch**: Start by either creating a new hatch (\`HATCH\` command) or selecting an existing hatch that you wish to modify. If you're modifying an existing hatch, you can double-click on it or use the \`HATCHEDIT\` command. 2. **Hatch Editor Ribbon/Dialog Box**: When you newly create a hatch or when editing an existing one, the Hatch Editor contextual tab will appear on the Ribbon, or you might see a dialog box, depending on your version of AutoCAD and your settings. 3. **Find Transparency Setting**: In the Hatch Editor, look for the transparency setting. It could be directly visible in the Ribbon or located under additional options, labeled as \\"Transparency.\\" 4. **Adjust Transparency**: The transparency setting is usually represented as a percentage, where 0% means completely opaque (no transparency), and 100% means fully transparent. To reduce the transparency (make it more opaque), you will want to move the slider or enter a value closer to 0%. 5. **Apply the Change**: After adjusting the transparency to your desired level, make sure to apply the changes. If you’re editing an existing hatch, confirm and close the Hatch Editor. # Notes - **Versions and Workspaces**: The exact steps and the appearance of the options may vary slightly depending on your AutoCAD version and the workspace you are using (such as drafting & annotation workspace vs. 3D modeling workspace). - **Effect on Print**: Remember that the appearance of transparencies might differ between on-screen viewing and printing or plotting. It’s always a good idea to do a test print to ensure the output meets your needs, especially if the drawing will be used for formal presentations or construction documents. - **Performance**: Having many objects with varying levels of transparency in a drawing can impact AutoCAD’s performance, especially in complex drawings. Keep this in mind if you're working on a particularly detailed project. By carefully adjusting the transparency of hatch patterns, you can enhance the visual quality of your drawings and ensure that all elements are clearly distinguishable and convey the intended information effectively."},{"instruction":"Need a morse code of \\"all the process of cooking dog\\"","output":"Converting the entire sentence \\"all the process of cooking dog\\" into Morse code would result in the following: .- .-.. .-.. / - .... . / .--. .-. --- -.-. . ... ... / --- ..-. / -.-. --- --- -.- .. -. --. / -.. --- --.

Quando si elabora un piano alimentare per sostenere sia la perdita di peso che il mantenimento o la crescita della massa muscolare, è importante considerare non solo le calorie ma anche la qualità e la tempistica dei nutrienti. La tua routine di allenamento include sessioni targettizzate per l'upper body, lower body & core e total body & definizione, che suggeriscono la necessità di un apporto costante e bilanciato di proteine per il recupero muscolare, carboidrati per l'energia durante gli allenamenti e grassi buoni per il supporto ormonale e l'assorbimento delle vitamine. Il timing dei pasti nella dieta proposta tiene conto del momento dell'allenamento (alle 13:00): - **Prima dell'allenamento:** Un pasto completo (pranzo) fornisce l'energia necessaria per il tuo allenamento, con una buona fonte di carboidrati complessi (quinoa o riso integrale) e proteine magre per sostenere l'energia e il mantenimento della massa muscolare. - **Dopo l'allenamento:** Un frullato proteico con una fonte di carboidrati (banana), per aiutare a ripristinare le riserve di glicogeno e promuovere il recupero muscolare. L'allocazione di macronutrienti segue una distribuzione che favorisce la definizione, preservando la qualità muscolare, con un'adeguata introduzione di proteine distribuite nel corso della giornata, carboidrati sufficienti per sostenere l'attività fisica, e grassi controllati ma presenti per le loro funzioni essenziali. Non dimenticare che l'adozione di qualunque piano nutrizionale dovrebbe essere monitorata nel tempo, regolando apporto calorico e qualità dei nutrienti in base ai cambiamenti nel peso, nella composizione corporea e nei livelli di energia durante l'allenamento. È inoltre consigliabile consultare un nutrizionista per personalizzare ulteriormente la dieta in base a eventuali necessità specifiche e per assicurare che tutti i requisiti nutrizionali siano soddisfatti."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The depiction may be extremely well done, okay, poorly, or terribly, depending on how these elements are handled by the writer. Here are some considerations for each scenario. # Extremely Well 1. **Depth of Research**: Authors who extensively research the causes and movements they are writing about can portray them with accuracy and depth, capturing complexities and nuances. 2. **Character Development**: Characters who are involved with or affected by the cause or movement show growth and change, reflecting the impact of these engagements realistically. 3. **Multiple Perspectives**: The narrative includes a range of viewpoints, giving a well-rounded understanding of the cause or movement and its impacts on different stakeholders. 4. **Emotional Connection**: The writing elicits an emotional response from the reader, making them feel invested in the cause or movement. 5. **Integration with Plot**: The cause or movement is seamlessly integrated into the plot, driving the story forward and being integral to the narrative rather than an added-on component. # Okay 1. **Basic Research**: The writer has done some research, but the depiction of the cause or movement might lack depth or overlook important aspects, making it seem somewhat superficial. 2. **Limited Viewpoints**: The story might present only one side of the cause or movement, missing an opportunity to explore its complexity. 3. **Stereotypical Representation**: Characters involved in the cause or movement might fall into stereotypes, lacking the depth or growth that would make their involvement more compelling. 4. **Plot Integration**: The cause or movement is part of the story but doesn't deeply affect its course or the development of its characters. # Poorly 1. **Inaccuracies**: The story contains factual inaccuracies about the cause or movement, demonstrating a lack of proper research. 2. **One-dimensional Characters**: Characters involved in the cause or movement are purely defined by their activism, lacking other traits or character development. 3. **Heavy-handed Messaging**: The narrative prioritizes the message over the story, leading to a preachy tone that might disengage readers. 4. **Lack of Emotional Impact**: The representation fails to create an emotional connection, making the cause or movement feel distant or unengaging to the reader. # Terribly 1. **Misrepresentation**: The cause or movement is grossly misrepresented, potentially spreading misinformation or harmful stereotypes. 2. **Tokenism**: The inclusion of a cause or movement feels like an afterthought or a box-ticking exercise, lacking sincerity or meaningful engagement. 3. **Disjointed from Plot**: The cause or movement feels entirely separate from the main storyline, as if it's been included without thought to its relevance or impact. 4. **Offensive Stereotyping**: Characters involved in the cause or movement are reduced to offensive stereotypes, which can perpetuate harm and diminish the real struggles of those involved. Effective writing about causes and movements involves thorough research, nuanced characters, balanced perspectives, emotional engagement, and integral plotting. Writers must navigate these elements carefully to craft a compelling and respectful narrative."},{"instruction":"how can showing the flaws of the movement members and the positive and negative consequences of their actions actually generate more sympathy for them than if they were portrayed as perfect and righteous just because they are part of a good cause? Also, what can be compelling about bad guys within good causes?","output":"Showing the flaws of movement members and the diverse consequences of their actions can significantly enhance the depth and relatability of a narrative, fostering greater sympathy and engagement from the audience. Similarly, exploring the complexity of antagonists or \\"bad guys\\" within seemingly good causes can add compelling layers to a story. Let's delve into how these elements contribute to a richer narrative experience. # Flawed Characters and Sympathy 1. **Relatability**: Flawed characters are inherently more relatable to readers. Perfect characters can feel distant or unattainable, making it hard for readers to see themselves in the story. Showing characters who make mistakes, doubt, or fail reflects the human experience, creating a deeper emotional connection. 2. **Growth and Redemption**: Flawed characters provide ample room for growth, which can be satisfying and inspiring for readers. Witnessing a character recognize their flaws, confront the consequences of their actions, and strive to improve can generate sympathy and admiration. It mirrors the reality of personal development and the idea that individuals are more than their worst moments. 3. **Realism and Nuance**: Portraying movement members as imperfect showcases the complexity of social movements and human nature. It acknowledges that good causes can be pursued by individuals who are not purely righteous, capturing the nuanced reality that people can have noble intentions but flawed executions. This realism makes the story and its characters more believable and engaging. 4. **Morality and Conflict**: Exploring the moral conflicts within characters, including those fighting for good causes, adds layers of tension and intrigue to a story. It underscores the often challenging decisions individuals must make and the gray areas in moral and ethical dilemmas, making the narrative more thought-provoking. # Compelling Antagonists within Good Causes 1. **Complex Motivations**: Antagonists who believe they are part of a good cause have motivations that go beyond simple evil intents. Understanding their reasoning—even if flawed or misguided—creates a more nuanced conflict and can make readers question and ponder moral complexities, enhancing the story's depth. 2. **Conflict and Tension**: When antagonists are part of the cause the protagonists are fighting for, it adds an internal conflict to the external battles, increasing the story's tension. It forces characters (and readers) to navigate the difficulties of confronting those who share their goals but undermine them through harmful methods. 3. **Themes of Corruption and Ideology**: Exploring how good intentions can be twisted or how individuals within movements can become corrupted adds a compelling layer of commentary on power and ideology. It prompts reflection on the nature of movements and the dangers of uncompromising or extremist views within them. 4. **Mirror to Protagonists**: Antagonists within the same cause can serve as a mirror to the protagonists, highlighting what they could become if they lose sight of their morals or succumb to darker impulses. This contrast can emphasize the protagonists' struggles and virtues, making their journey more compelling. In conclusion, depicting characters (whether protagonists or antagonists) as flawed and showcasing the diverse consequences of their actions adds depth, realism, and emotional resonance to a story. It reflects the complexity of real-life social movements and human behavior, making narratives more engaging and thought-provoking."},{"instruction":"What is 1+1?","output":"1+1 equals 2."},{"instruction":"I want you to analyse this setting: 500 years have passed since the tumultuous events of The Chaotic Era I: The Gods of Reason, a decisive chapter in history. It all began during the Theoclasm, a cataclysmic event triggered when the Theoclasts, a technologically advanced race, captured the powerful deity YHVH, resulting in the devastation of the old continent of Pectus. Fleeing the horrors of this apocalypse, the survivors sought refuge on the distant shores of Yuandi, where the saga of The Chaotic Era II: The New Mythology will take place. Theoclasm: The term “Theoclasm”, derived from Théos (God, Deity, Divinity) and Klastós (Broken, Fractured), encapsulates the pivotal moment that incited the mass exodus from Pectus. YHVH, the god of light and ruler of Paradise, fell into the clutches of the Theoclasts, leading to the apotheosis of Ptah-Khnemu. Strengthened by this deity, the Theoclasts became an unstoppable force, leading Ma’at, who later allied himself with mortals, to reveal that Ptah-Khnemu imagined a world free from the control of the deities, but was still undecided whether to exterminate the mortals who disagreed with his vision or allying with supporters. A betrayal unfolded when Montu-Sekhmet, daughter of Ptah-Khnemu himself, seized power during the height of Theoclasm, having intentions contrary to those of her father, seeking to rebuild the universe from scratch. Ma’at, who millennia ago was infused with a deity whose name was lost to time, escaped the clutches of her own race, seeking refuge in Yuandi lest she become a mere tool or source of power. With her advanced technological knowledge and divine abilities, she erected five monumental pillars, enclosing the new continent within a protective barrier. This sanctuary attracted not only mortal inhabitants but also lesser deities, fearful of a Theoclast incursion. After Ma’at’s death, her essence fragmented, each fragment containing a portion of her memories and powers, while her remains were buried in the reliquary of the Archbishopric of Ma’at, where she is believed to still work miracles. After the fall of YHVH, the angels, previously subservient to the deity, regained their free will, while the demons were thrown into disarray following the disappearance of their master. The ensuing chaos led to an anarchic exodus from Hell, the domain of their lord ALMF (Alumniferus), resulting in confusion and insanity, which led to the suicide of many angels and demons. Some remaining demons now disguise themselves as mortals and mythical beings from Yuandi. Although many angels strive to defend YHVH’s legacy through their temples, the whereabouts of the goddess of chaos, NLTP (Niarlatotepe), and the god of darkness remain unknown within the protective barrier. These turbulent consequences and the unstable balance of divine forces now set the stage for an epic story of survival, power struggles, and ever-shifting alliances within Yuandi. Now for the races’ lore: Renshi The Renshi are one of the native races of Yuandi and are the most numerous race. The majority inhabit the Ozumi Empire, with significant numbers in the Wildlands, the territory of the Archbishopric of Ma’at, and the southern tip of the Kingdom of Igirith. The Shun culture, named after the Shun dynasty of the same name, once dominated almost the entire continent, making them enemies of other races and cultures. The Ozumi Empire, originating from the remote islands east of the Shun lands, took advantage of the previous empire’s weakness during the instability caused by the war against the Theoclasts and seized power. The other Renshi cultures under Ozumi’s rule consider them tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. They are technologically advanced thanks to a partnership with New Medietas. The Ozumi Empire is ruled by an empress who apparently receives direct orders from her divine ancestor, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto. There are several noble clans and a warrior caste that is in decline due to the use of firearms. There are still some noble clans from other cultures who have sworn allegiance to Ozumi and have been allowed to rule their ancestral lands. Family values lie at the core of Renshi social structure. Filial piety is revered as one of the highest virtues. Children are raised to honor and respect their parents, considering their wishes and well-being above their own. Especially in the Shun culture, the familial unit is an extended network, with generations living together under one roof, sharing responsibilities and maintaining a collective harmony. In the Ozumi culture, children are expected to be more independent while still respecting the clan head. Branch families pay respects to their original clans in annual ceremonies, celebrating their ancestors. Education plays a pivotal role in the Ozumi Empire, as knowledge is seen as the key to wisdom and virtuous living. Scholarly pursuits are highly esteemed, and the pursuit of self-improvement is regarded as a lifelong journey. The arts are celebrated as a medium for expressing the beauty and harmony inherent in daily life. Traditional music, poetry, calligraphy, and painting are cherished forms of creative expression, serving as both a means of personal reflection and a reflection of the collective spirit of the society. The “Wild Renshi” or “Barbarian Renshi” live outside the administration of the Ozumi Empire and on the borders of Igirith’s territory, primarily in the cold climates of the continent’s south-central and southern tip. They live by hunting, fishing and herding animals such as reindeer. They wear animal skins, live in tribes and are resistant to cold and attuned to nature. Humans Descendants of the humans who fled Theoclasm in Pectus. They managed to obtain some Theoclast technology during the war and, after reverse engineering, drastically developed their weapons, tools and architecture. The Republic of New Medietas is an example of industrial advancement on the continent. Their society combines coal- and steam-powered machines with magical items. The streets of the largest cities are teeming with citizens amid the rhythmic bustle of machines and the smoke of factories. The citizens of New Medietas boast an unwavering work ethic, where labor and industry reign supreme. A resolute commitment to capitalism fuels innovation and competition, driving the relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance. Although New Medietas does not have a formal clan or caste system, a select group of influential noble houses wield considerable power, guiding the nation’s policies and future. These houses are closely linked to prosperous industrial conglomerates. At the forefront of technological progress, the republic is a pioneer in the development of complex automatons and goelms and advanced machinery. Inventors and engineers drive notable advances, positioning the country as an industrial and technological powerhouse. The Republic of New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighbouring powers. They maintain a robust partnership with the Sulcaic Empire, reinforcing mutual interests and security. Likewise, friendly relations with the Ozumi Empire promote trade and technological collaboration. Recently, advances in artificial life have been made. What is most available to the general population are artificial meats for consumption and clothing products, such as leather, fur and feathers. The upper classes can buy artificial pets or even homunculi, which they display at parties and meetings of society’s elite. Humans have developed a subtype of enchantment magic to “program” orders and commands into items, golems, and other types of artificial life. Its alchemists are valued by all nations. Many humans declare themselves practitioners of YHVH’s faith despite different sects and cults existing, but a relatively small number can truly be called practitioners or believers. The worship of minor gods is uncommon throughout the territory of New Medietas. There are isolated shrines with the sole purpose of appeasing the lesser deities. A growing gap has been developing between the richer classes and the lower classes due to the ease of obtaining labor using golems. Some companies and conglomerates are mostly operated by golems, with only human supervision. The poorest, left without job opportunities, are on the verge of rebelling. Many humans migrated from New Medietas to other nations, more specifically the Kingdom of Igirith and the Jirkaeriya Confederation due to their low industrialisation. A good number also migrated to the more provincial regions of the Ozumi Empire and the Sulcaic Empire. Sulkai Since they were originally from the continent of Yuandi, the logistics of returning the majority of the Sulkai population from Pectus were simpler. Their empire has remained stable during the ~500 years since Theoclasm occurred. They appreciate refined foods and items and attach great importance to money and nobility. A good portion of the sulkai settlers in Pectus were traders. As a general rule, they are gentle, delicate and sometimes passive aggressive. Their society and technology used to be more sophisticated than that of Pectus until the humans made incredible advances. Sulkai ship models are still the most used today to navigate the little ocean that remains around Yuandi. Their society is loosely divided into castes, but an individual can change social status relatively easily. There are the commoners, the merchants and artisans, the knights and soldiers, the burghers, the elite wizards and the nobility, with the imperial family at the top. Many of the sulkai who went to Pectus seeking to accumulate wealth returned to the Sulcaic Empire completely poor and as refugees. Noble families are divided into clans with a semi-mythical ancestor being the founder of the house, a fundamental factor in legitimizing the relevance of a family. They have artifacts, which were supposedly forged by their ancestors, extremely similar to the old relics of Pectus. Their tales and stories generally involve much more magic and the forces of nature. Superficially they look like pale humans with coloured hair, but their bodies function in very different ways. Their longevity is greater, as is the time between childhood and maturity (a 30-year-old sulkai is considered a teenager). Their bodies are lighter and metabolic processes seem to affect their bodies much more, for example, it takes much less time for a sulkai to get drunk or for a medicine to take effect. In the rare cases in which they mix with other humanoid races, the resulting progeny are always born sulkai. The incidence of aptitude for magic is extremely high, with 4 out of 5 having the potential. Their susceptibility to cold iron stems from the fact that they partially descend from fairies, as well as from ancient humanoids who lived in a lost continent. Those same ancient humanoids are also the ancestors of the humans, the Eniyan, and, by extension, of the Anglo-Elves. Although the nobility has great importance, heads of banks and commercial companies, each with a personal army, and each locked in a constant struggle against eachother, have great relevance and economic power. They have enough capital to resolve most external diplomatic dilemmas with a well-directed amount of money or threat of withdrawal from trade. Thus, many conflicts in other nations have already been resolved through the economic influence of certain organisations and companies. Their religion differs drastically from the Church of YHVH. It is based on the cult of semi-mythical ancestors, who fulfill a role similar to saints. The existence of gods is recognised, but generally relegated to a secondary role, even if Theoclasm made them inhabit the Barrier. Their fairy ancestors, or nature spirits, are worshiped instead. They are considered to be more sophisticated and superior to other races, sometimes attracting hatred from some individuals. They get along especially well with the humans, whom they consider their allies for having granted the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire. With Theoclasm, it was the turn of the Sulkai to cede territory to their allies. Their aptitude for trade is always welcome in more remote locations, and even tribal chiefs seek out the Sulkai for business. As previously mentioned, it has been confirmed that the sulkai descend from the union of proto-humans with fairies, or nature spirits. Namely naiads and haliads (water spirits), epigeias and dryads (nature spirits), aureads and boreads (wind spirits). Anglo-Elves Elves and Weisslanders, after fleeing Pectus during the Theoclasm, unexpectedly found themselves sharing the same land west of Yuandi. Despite the mutual dislike between both races, they ended up mixing, resulting in the hybrid race known today as Anglo-Elven. Even before the assimilation between both races, it was noted that children of elf-human couples always resulted in an appearance almost identical to that of humans, without the golden skin, pointed ears and light hair that elves prized. Strangely, the fruits of such unions were always born with scarlet, orange or pinkish hair. Despite the mixing of these two races, there is still an elite of pure elves who govern the nation in a not so explicit way. Culturally, the Anglo-Elves are a fusion of elven and Weisslander cultures, with a simultaneous focus on battles and intellectualism, on physical combat and magical combat, among other aspects. There are also a significant number of dark-skinned Anglo-Elves descended from the Eniyan of Pectus. Magic is a revered aspect of society, guided by guilds of wizards who educate potential wizards. Approximately half of Anglo-elves show potential for magic, with only a few becoming accomplished wizards. The Anglo-Elves practice a syncretic faith that has characteristics of the faith of YHVH, the ancestor worship practiced by the Elves, and the tribal polytheism of the Weisslanders. Clans can trace their lineages to specific individuals who embarked on the journey fleeing the continent of Pectus. While ancestor worship is typically done in family shrines at home, the worship of YHVH is done in public temples. The Anglo-Elves have long been at war with the Hazrun over territorial claims to an island to the west of both nations. This island, called Haséaleen by the Anglo-Elves and Haşarin by the Hazrun, has one of five pillars that maintain a protective barrier around the continent. The Anglo-Elves already have one of the pillars within their territory, the Red Pillar, and want the Black Pillar, stating that Hazrun cannot be trusted to possess it Mustalf Pectus’ “accursed race” again survives a great cataclysm and finds itself destined to roam another continent without its own land or nation. Unlike the ancient Dark Elves, the Mustalf (In Elvish: Must = Dark; Alf = Elf) no longer live only in underground shelters, currently choosing to live as nomadic traders who roam the nations buying and selling exotic goods. They have a few autonomous territories scattered throughout Yuandi, and a number of Mustalf live in the territory of the Archbishopric of Ma’at. They are considered a cursed race by the elves. Thousands of years ago, the “Bloodstained Emperor” murdered the other three members of the Quadrumvirate and fled from the Sonne Insel archipelago to Pectus’ mainland with thousands of followers, who were later cursed by an unknown deity or altered by a powerful relic of the elves. The Alveglaan elves symbolically interpret the darkening of traitors as the mark of their unforgivable crime. Everyone is expected to work for the good of society, inincluding children, the elderly and women. The Mustalf are trained from childhood to perform certain tasks or jobs and continue to contribute until they are unable to do so in some way. Their ears are movable and expressive, just like an elf’s. They have no body and facial hair (except eyebrows and eyelashes), which they consider a sign of barbarity. Short hair is socially accepted, both in men and women, but it is seen as a sign of youthfulness and immaturity. Probably as a result of their ancestors living underground, their hearing is sharper and their eyes are sensitive to light. The Mustalf have a strong sense of community and place a high value on loyalty and solidarity with their own kind. They have a tendency to put the needs of the community above the needs of the individual. Many of them consider it essential to learn at least one foreign language, to play at least one instrument, and to know at least one trade, since most of their livelihood depends on trading with different races. Hazrun One of the continent’s native races and the third most numerous. The Hazrun were dominated for centuries by the Shun Dynasty. With the collapse of the old empire and its subsequent takeover by Ozumi, the Hazrun were finally free and massacred the remaining Rénshi in their traditional territory, later joining the few free Hazrun that remained, creating hybrid cultures with aspects of the culture of their former masters. To prevent another invasion and the enslavement of their people, the Hazrun militarised and today have large armies with highly efficient units, the result of their domestication of draconic species, such as drakes, wyverns, sauroids and avioserpes. Many returned to their old lifestyle as reindeer herders, hunters and fishermen to forget their detestable past under the rule of another race. Their nation, known as the Jirkaeriya Confederacy, is ruled by a Soho (Hazrunic: leader, ruler, king), who must have “divine ancestry”. If the next leader is not elected peacefully, suitors can unify the cultures/tribes. The current Hazrun nation is the result of the conquest of Tazkiairga and his wife Huzur, who fought against Tazkiairga’s brothers to unify the hazrun race. Hazrun culture is diverse, with several “peoples” within the same nation. The largest are Berihazrun (“Hazrun of the Plain”), Keiozhazrun (“Hazrun of the River”) and Damohazrun (“Hazrun of the Mountain”). Generally, women have short hair, letting it grow only after marriage, while the opposite occurs with men, who may also cut their hair during military service as a symbol of their “marriage to the nation”. Like the ancient elves, they do not have any body or facial hair. Women use midriff-revealing clothes while single to indicate they are available, but cover them up once they have boyfriends or husbands. The Hazrun wear earrings, necklaces and body paint with various symbols that other races do not understand. Wars and battles are mostly carried out by men only, as Hazrun women are naturally physically smaller and weaker. Despite this, it is said that a Hazrun woman is as strong as a man of another race. The most peculiar characteristic of the hazrun is certainly the presence of horns, which are highly prized in all their cultures. They also have four fingers on each hand and foot, stronger nails and sharper fangs. Individuals with branched deer-like horns, called Adarkahazrun (“Branched Horned Person”), make up the “high caste” of hazrun, that is, clan heads, rulers and military leaders. The Hazrun view the hornless races as unworthy or dishonorable. They are not able to reproduce with other races, so it is more accurate to refer to them as another species. It is noted that they are very resistant to alcohol and cannot perceive spicy tastes very well. As soon as they arrived on the new continent, the races coming from Pectus suspected a connection between the ancient Golofn, the Orcs and the Hazrun due to the presence of horns. Their origins are not known for sure and their origin myths do not tell of an exodus from distant lands. Furthermore, the Golofn were immortal, possessed extreme control of magic and had divine blood running through their veins, while the Hazrun appear to be ordinary mortals. Ancient accounts of the Sulkai and Shun do not clarify anything, since, wherever they came from, they were always in their lands before the other races. Usagizok They have a strong sense of balance and agility, allowing them to move quickly and gracefully through the natural landscapes. Usagizok developed unique cultural practices based on their connection to nature. They have a ritual for thanking the plants and animals they rely on for sustainability and have developed a system of using natural resources sustainably. Their enhanced hearing also plays a role in their culture. They have developed a form of communication at a frequency that only members of their own species can hear. The Usagizok were enslaved by the Shun Dynasty for being exotic and were even seen as pets by some. This led to tensions between the two races even after the fall of the dynasty. The Usagizok have long ears like rabbits or hares, a fur-covered body, resistant claws for digging and very strong leg muscles that enable them to jump higher and further away than the other races. Their incisors are bigger and stronger due to their mostly vegetarian diet which consists mostly of root vegetables, leaves, and fruits. Some of them have short tails very similar to a rabbit’s. In terms of their current situation, the Usagizok are struggling to find their place in the world since being freed from slavery. They have difficulty integrating into other societies and prefer isolating themselves and live a more nomadic lifestyle in their partially underground warrens. As a result of their enslavement, Usagizok are usually not taken seriously by other races. They may have difficulty finding work or housing outside of their own communities, and may face discrimination or violence. Despite this, the Usagizok have managed to carve out their own niche in society. They are skilled at jobs that require agility, such as acrobatics or hunting, and have developed a reputation as skilled scouts, mercenaries, assassins, and spies due to their heightened senses and physical abilities. Many Usagizok have withdrawn from the larger world and created their own isolated communities, hidden away in forests or other remote areas. These communities are wary of outsiders and have their own unique customs and traditions. The Usagizok are matriarchal; a warren is mostly composed of related members descended from the same maternal ancestor. They are very fertile. A pregnancy lasts for only 4 months and the offspring, often born as quadruplets or triplets, reach childhood in 2 years and sexual maturity in 10. The females in the warren take turns nursing the newborns while the males cultivate plants or go out to trade, forage or hunt. To avoid inbreeding, they have a tradition of visiting other warrens to find suitable spouses. A matriarch can have multiple husbands. Like the Hazrun, they cannot interbreed with other races Usagizok are grappling with their own internal divisions and conflicts between different tribes and factions. This is related both to differences in religious or cultural practices and by more pragmatic concerns such as access to resources or disputes over leadership. Outsider The Outsiders’ arrival into Yuandi remains an event cloaked in mystery and subject to much philosophical debate among the continent’s scholars and sages. While some theorise a conflict against the Theoclasts, others whisper of a vengeful deity tearing the very fabric of the cosmos, banishing these beings to a plane not their own. Such a cataclysmic event likely didn’t occur without leaving scars, both on the lands of Yuandi and the essence of the Outsiders themselves. Over the 72 years since their appearance, the Outsiders have become a norm within the continent’s landscapes, yet they do not form associations or clans of their own; instead, they are unified by their shared displacement and the longing to understand their origin and purpose. The physical form of Outsiders is both alien and mesmerising. Their height can vary drastically, with smooth skin that radiates soft light at dusk. Their unique tentacle-like hair structures suggest an evolved form not limited to the aesthetic, with some Outsiders found to communicate or manipulate objects with these appendages. The absence of aging signs makes their lifespan a subject of much curiosity, as no Outsider has shown any decline or deterioration over their time in Yuandi. With no memories of their own culture or names, Outsiders have come to adopt appellations and customs from the societies they integrate themselves into, often taking on roles as scholars, artisans, diplomats, or advisors. Their unique perspectives unclouded by personal pasts or ambitions make them intriguing and sometimes unsettling company. Though their integration varies by region and society, many Outsiders have earned a place of respect, for their impartial outlook and ability to see beyond the distraction of mortal prejudices. In some cultures, they’ve been considered omens of significant change or figures of worship, existing as bridges between the outer realms and the Eartly Realm. Outsiders perplex the inhabitants of Yuandi not only with their origin but with their method of reproduction — or lack thereof. No new Outsider has been observed to come into being since their first appearance on the continent. This unusual trait has led to numerous theories: that the Outsiders are limited, a finite number of beings with no way to perpetuate their kind, or perhaps they simply have not encountered the conditions needed to initiate their reproductive cycles on Yuandi. Strangely, they exhibit sexual dimorphism, apparently having distinctions between males and females. The Outsiders are known for their most notable and enigmatic ability: transient phasing. This rare power allows them to become intangible at unpredictable moments, causing them to slip through solid objects, evade physical attacks, or even sink into the earth, only to re-emerge unharmed. Such occurrences are sporadic and uncontrollable, often correlated with their emotional state or environmental stimuli, hinting at a possible connection to an underlying psychic or dimensional trait inherent to their being. While this ability is viewed with awe and a palpable sense of wonder by other inhabitants of Yuandi, it is also a source of fear and suspicion. Those who encounter Outsiders experiencing moments of phasing can’t help but question the nature of these ethereal wanderers and their place in the world. Outsiders tend to avoid positions of overt power or leadership unless it serves a purpose that benefits greater societal good. They are pacifists by necessity, as direct conflict could trigger abilities they cannot control, yet their very presence can impact the results of warring factions. It’s not uncommon for Outsiders to serve as mediators and negotiators, given their unaffiliated and unbiased nature. Republic of New Medietas Geography and Climate: The Republic of New Medietas’ landscapes range from sprawling industrial cities with towering smokestacks to fertile farmlands. The climate varies, offering both temperate and subtropical zones. Large rivers crisscross the territory, providing water sources crucial for industrial processes. The nation boasts a coastline with bustling port cities facilitating trade and maritime activities. Economy: New Medietas thrives on an industrialised and capitalist economy, driven by technological innovation. The nation excels in the production of machinery, enchanted items, and artificial constructs. The relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance is evident in the competitive markets. The upper echelons of society, tied to influential noble houses, control major industrial conglomerates. Artificial life, in the form of synthetic meats, clothing, and even pets, has become a burgeoning industry, shaping consumption patterns. Magic and Religion: Enchantment magic, a subtype of magic developed in New Medietas, is used to infuse items, constructs, and golems with specific commands. Alchemists specialising in this magic are highly sought after across the continent. Despite the technological advancements, a significant portion of the population identifies with various sects and cults, with YHVH’s faith being the most widespread. Minor gods have limited presence, with isolated shrines dedicated to appeasing them. Social Disparities: The nation faces a growing socioeconomic gap between the affluent upper classes and the struggling lower classes. The integration of golems and homunculi into the workforce has led to increased unemployment among humans, especially in manual labour sectors. Some industries are almost entirely automated, contributing to widespread dissatisfaction and social unrest. The migration of citizens seeking better opportunities in other nations is a testament to the growing discontent among the populace. Relations with Other Nations: New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighbouring powers, particularly the Sulcaic Empire and the Ozumi Empire. These alliances strengthen mutual interests, security, and technological collaboration. The republic also engages in trade with various nations, exporting its technological innovations and enchanted products. However, the migration of discontented citizens to other nations has strained relations, with concerns about a brain drain affecting New Medietas. Challenges and Tensions: The primary challenges faced by New Medietas include social unrest stemming from unemployment caused by automation. The lower classes, disenfranchised and economically marginalised, pose a potential threat to the stability of the republic. The government must grapple with finding a balance between technological advancement and social welfare to address these issues. Additionally, managing relations with other nations becomes crucial as internal tensions spill over into international dynamics. Sulcaic Empire Geography and Climate: Its geography is diverse, encompassing lush forests, sprawling plains, and coastal regions. The climate varies from temperate zones to more tropical areas. The empire’s advanced navigation techniques, particularly the Sulkai ship models, enable them to navigate the remaining ocean around Yuandi. The little oceanic expanse is a vital element in their maritime activities and trade. Economy: The Sulkai’s economy is deeply intertwined with trade, reflecting their historical roots as traders from Yuandi. Appreciating refined goods and attaching great importance to money and nobility, the Sulcaic Empire engages in extensive economic activities. The society is loosely divided into castes. Many Sulkai who ventured to Pectus seeking wealth returned as refugees, impacting the socio-economic landscape to this day. Noble families, organised into clans, hold artifacts with semi-mythical origins, similar to the old relics of Pectus. The Blue Pillar is located on the northern shores of the large Isle Desrosiers to the north of the mainland. Magic and Religion: Sulkai have a high aptitude for magic, with the potential for magical abilities present in 4 out of 5 individuals. Their susceptibility to cold iron is rooted in their partial descent from fairies. The Sulcaic Empire’s magic was once more sophisticated, but the incredible advances made by humans in Pectus shifted the balance. Their religion is centered around the cult of semi-mythical ancestors, akin to saints, and nature spirits, including fairies. The existence of gods is acknowledged, but they hold a secondary role. This divergence in religious beliefs sets the Sulkai apart from the Church of YHVH. Social Disparities: The society’s structure, while featuring nobility and semi-divine ancestors, allows for social mobility. Individuals can change social status relatively easily. Economic power is not solely concentrated in the hands of the nobility; heads of banks and commercial companies wield substantial influence. These entities often engage in power struggles, using economic leverage to resolve external diplomatic issues. The Sulkai face challenges of internal conflicts and diplomatic dilemmas tied to these economic power dynamics. Relations with Other Nations: Their alliance with the Republic of Medietas is rooted in historical collaboration. The Sulkai consider humans as allies for granting the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire during the times of the Empire of Medietas. The aptitude for trade of the Sulkai is sought after, even by tribal chiefs in remote locations. The empire’s economic influence and diplomatic finesse have resolved conflicts in other nations, making them both valuable partners and potential rivals. Challenges and Tensions: One of the primary challenges faced by the Sulcaic Empire is the impact of economic shifts on their society. The subclass descended from Sulkai refugees and the integration of new technologies have altered the socio-economic landscape. Managing internal conflicts arising from economic power struggles and addressing the growing social disparities within their society pose significant challenges. Ozumi Empire Geography and Climate: The Ozumi Empire, home to the majority of the Renshi, is located in the western regions of the continent. The empire boasts a diverse landscape, from the Shun cultural heartlands to the more temperate areas in the south. The islands east of the Shun lands house the origins of the Ozumi Empire. The climate varies, providing fertile plains as well as colder regions, particularly towards the southern regions. Economy: The Ozumi Empire is technologically advanced, owing much of its progress to a strategic partnership with New Medietas. The Renshi in the empire engage in agriculture, manufacturing, and trade. Firearms have led to the decline of the once-dominant warrior caste. Multiple noble clans, including those who have sworn allegiance from other cultures, contribute to the empire’s ruling structure. Economic prosperity is tied to cultural values, with the pursuit of knowledge and virtue playing a central role in the empire’s economic landscape. The White Pillar is located on the island of Sakaishuu, the largest and easternmost Ozumi island. Magic and Religion: The Ozumi culture reveres many deities, especially the divine ancestor of their imperial clan, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto, whose supposed direct orders guide the empress in ruling the Ozumi Empire, while the Shun culture revere an ancient Sky Father. Minor deities are worshipped throughout the empire, with shrines receiving many pilgrims coming to pay respects and thank the deities. Social Disparities: Social disparities within the Ozumi Empire are exacerbated by the colonisation of the Shun culture by the ruling Ozumi elite. The cultural and historical dominance of the Shun Dynasty is being systematically eroded as Ozumi influences permeate various aspects of society. The decline of the old intellectual aristocracy, once a symbol of Shun power, has created a vacuum that the Ozumi culture is quick to fill with its own values and structures. This shift has led to a palpable tension between the old guard adhering to Shun traditions and the new elite pushing for modernisation under Ozumi influence. The Ozumi culture itself faces a rift between tradition and modernity with the decline of its warrior caste. Relations with Other Nations: The Ozumi Empire’s relations with other nations are complex. Historical animosities stemming from the dominance of the Shun culture have left a lasting impact. The empire’s rise to power during the instability caused by Theoclasm has created tension with other Renshi cultures. Some view the Ozumi rulers as tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. Despite this, the Ozumi Empire maintains partnerships, particularly with New Medietas, contributing to its technological advancements. Noble clans from different cultures who have pledged allegiance to Ozumi are allowed to rule their ancestral lands. The major Ozumi clans are Susa (imperial), and the Nine Great Houses: Kikuchi, Takeuchi, Aran, Oonuki, Yamane, Kokubu, Yagami, Matsubara, and Ebina. Challenges and Tensions: The colonisation of the Shun culture by the Ozumi Empire presents profound challenges and tensions. The once-dominant Shun Dynasty’s fall has led to a struggle for cultural identity, with the Ozumi elite imposing their values and customs. This cultural clash has created internal strife, as the Shun people grapple with the erosion of their traditions. Resistance movements, fueled by a desire to preserve Shun heritage, pose a challenge to the imperial authority. Confederacy of Jirkaeriya Geography and Climate: The Confederacy of Jirkaeriya encompasses diverse landscapes, from expansive plains to winding rivers and imposing mountains. The Hazrun’s connection to nature is reflected in their settlement patterns, with tribes often aligning with specific geographical features. The climate varies, with colder regions in the mountainous territories and milder conditions in the plains. The hazrun adapt their lifestyles accordingly, engaging in reindeer herding in the colder areas and pursuing fishing and hunting in the more temperate zones. Economy: The Hazrun economy is intertwined with their lifestyle and resource-rich territories. Herding, hunting, and fishing contribute to sustenance, while trade between tribes facilitates the exchange of resources. The Hazrun value their natural surroundings, utilizing them for sustenance and crafting. In recent times, the Hazrun have also engaged in trade with neighboring nations, leveraging their unique resources, such as draconic species, for economic exchanges. The island of Haşarin, which became a hub for Hazrun of all tribes and even some Mustalf seeking to trade, houses the Black Pillar. Magic and Religion: Hazrun magic is deeply entwined with nature and their reverence for the divine. Shamanistic practices, drawing power from the spirits of the land, are common. The Hazrun, having witnessed the awe-inspiring might of dragons, incorporate draconic elements into their magical rituals. The belief in divine ancestry, coupled with a pantheon of nature gods, shapes their religious practices. Sacred ceremonies involve offerings to ancestral spirits and nature deities, seeking harmony with the land. Social Disparities: Hazrun society, despite its diversity, strives for a sense of unity under the leadership of the Soho. The caste system, notably the Adarkahazrun, introduces a hierarchical structure. Though opportunities for advancement exist, the Adarkahazrun maintain a prominent role in societal affairs. The perception of hornless races as dishonourable contribute to social disparities. Challenges persist in achieving complete gender equality and fostering understanding with other races. Relations with Other Nations: The Confederacy of Jirkaeriya maintains a cautious but pragmatic approach to relations with other nations. Their history of enslavement by the Shun Dynasty and subsequent conflicts has instilled a sense of wariness. However, the Hazrun recognize the importance of diplomacy, engaging in trade and alliances when beneficial. They are currently at war with the Igirith Kingdom for ownership of the island of Haşarin. Challenges and Tensions: Internal challenges revolve around preserving cultural identity amid external influences. The Hazrun face tensions in reconciling their diverse cultures and ensuring the continuation of their traditions. Additionally, interactions with other races pose challenges, with some nations harbouring prejudices against the Hazrun due to their history with the Shun Dynasty. Their territorial war against the Kingdom of Igirith is a major issue that keeps the tribes united for now. Igirith Kingdom Geography and Climate: The Igirith Kingdom is geographically defined by a sweeping mountain range originating from the Archbishopric of Ma’at, creating a diagonal division from the northeast to the southwest. The northern region features temperate plains, while the southern half transforms into a cold taiga. This diverse terrain influences the kingdom’s climate, offering a mix of temperate and colder conditions. Economy: The Anglo-Elven society has cultivated a balanced economy that integrates elven sophistication with Weisslander pragmatism. Agriculture thrives in the fertile plains, with a focus on the cultivation of crops and orchards. Trading routes, connecting Igirith with neighboring nations, bolster economic exchanges. The kingdom’s strategic location and its control of the Red Pillar facilitate trade, making Igirith a crucial player in regional commerce. Magic and Religion: Magic is an integral part of Anglo-Elven society, with a significant portion of the population demonstrating magical potential. Guilds of wizards play a pivotal role, both in education and governance. The syncretic faith practiced in Igirith combines elements of YHVH worship, elven ancestor reverence, and the polytheistic traditions of the Weisslanders. Temples dedicated to YHVH coexist with private shrines honoring ancestral figures, reflecting the diverse spiritual landscape. Social Disparities: Within Igirith, the social fabric is intricately woven with distinctions, most notably between elves and their hybrid counterparts. Elves, by virtue of their race, are automatically bestowed with noble status at birth, fostering a sense of inherent superiority. This hierarchy has led to a complex social dynamic, with many Anglo-Elves grappling with a profound identity crisis. Some Anglo-Elves, yearning for a more refined elven culture, distance themselves from their human ancestry, intensifying tensions and divisions within the population. Relations with Other Nations: The longstanding conflict with the Hazrun over the ownership of Haséaleen (Haşarin) Island shapes Igirith’s foreign relations. Tensions with the Confederacy of Jirkaeriya are a focal point, fueled by territorial disputes and the strategic importance of the Black Pillar. Diplomatic engagements with neighboring nations are characterized by a cautious approach, prioritizing the kingdom’s interests and maintaining the delicate balance between elven traditions and Weisslander pragmatism. Challenges and Tensions: The ongoing war against the Hazrun is a prominent concern, as territorial disputes and strategic interests fuel hostilities. Internally, a growing rift between the pureblood elves and the Anglo-Elves exacerbates existing tensions. The identity crisis within the Anglo-Elven population poses a unique challenge, with individuals torn between embracing elven traditions and acknowledging their Weisslander heritage. Managing these internal divisions while navigating external conflicts requires diplomatic finesse and strategic leadership to ensure the kingdom’s stability. Archbishopric of Ma’at Geography and Climate: The Archbishopric of Ma’at is situated in the centre of the continent, nestled within the embrace of towering peaks, with valleys and plateaus cradled between majestic summits. The climate has crisp air and serene landscapes, characterized by cool temperatures and alpine vistas. The sacred peaks are not just geographical features but hold spiritual significance, fostering a sense of divine connection and tranquility. Economy: The economic structure of the Archbishopric is unique, driven by the collective commitment to the worship of Ma’at and the preservation of the Five Pillars. While not emphasizing material wealth, the society sustains itself through communal efforts and a harmonious integration of diverse skills and professions. The presence of skilled artisans, scholars, and caretakers ensures the prosperity of the community. On their exclave located in the far south of the continent, the Archbishopric manages the Green Pillar. Magic and Religion: Magic in the Archbishopric is intertwined with religious practices centered around the worship of Ma’at. The Five Pillars, erected by Ma’at herself, serve as both symbols of divine protection and conduits of her essence. The Archbishopric values the fragments of Ma’at’s essence, each holding memories and powers attributed to the benevolent Theoclast. The Archbishopric’s magic is deeply rooted in maintaining the balance and harmony advocated by Ma’at, and its residents often undergo spiritual training to attune themselves with these divine energies. Social Disparities: The Archbishopric stands out as a beacon of inclusivity, with inhabitants representing various races, united by their shared devotion to Ma’at. Social disparities are minimized, as the focus lies on communal harmony and mutual support. The society places a premium on virtues such as compassion, empathy, and equality, fostering an environment where individuals are valued for their contributions rather than their social standing or race. Relations with Other Nations: The Archbishopric is known for its neutral stance in international affairs. Its commitment to providing asylum for the poor and disenfranchised has earned it respect and goodwill across nations. While not engaging in military conflicts, the Archbishopric plays a vital role as a mediator and peacemaker, leveraging its moral authority and divine connections to promote understanding and cooperation. Challenges and Tensions: Despite its overarching commitment to neutrality, the Archbishopric faces challenges in maintaining the delicate balance within and beyond its borders. The quest to preserve the Five Pillars requires constant vigilance and protection against external threats. Internally, ensuring that diverse races and cultures coexist harmoniously poses an ongoing challenge. As the fragments of Ma’at’s essence hold significant power, there may be tensions over the control and distribution of these divine relics, as well as potential disputes over interpreting Ma’at’s will. Balancing these challenges while upholding the principles of Ma’at remains a perpetual endeavor for the Archbishopric.","output":"Analyzing the richly detailed setting provided, it's evident that this narrative context presents a vividly imagined world teeming with depth, conflict, and the opportunity for intricate storytelling.

Narratives can delve into revolutions sparked by such disparities or the philosophical quandaries of creating life. 4. **Preservation of Culture and Identity Amidst Change**: Characters and societies wrestling with maintaining their cultural integrity and identity amidst forced migrations, invasions, and the melding of traditions offer personal, intimate storytelling pathways against a grand backdrop. 5. **Mysteries of the Outsiders and the Theoclasm**: The enigmatic nature of the Outsiders and the historical Theoclasm event provide a rich vein of mystery and exploration.

in this alternate DC universe?..basically…its an inverted version of Dick Grayson…both have similar traits…but notable differences… Nightshade has similar origins to main universe Dick…but things diverged…to where he never was taken by Bruce…because Bruce wasn’t there at the time…rather…it was Joseph ‘Slade’ Wilson instead…who was there at Haly’s Circus because he received intel that the Court of Owls…was involved in the Circus for some reason…then was there in that pivotal moment…he was there in the crowd as the tragedy occurred…as Slade saw potential in the young Dick Grayson then and there…mixed with his own ruthlessness…as Slade was ‘inspired’ by the duo of Batman and Robin…if Batman has his own Robin…hey… The inspiration is pretty much Dick Grayson with a splash of ‘Jason Todd’…and at some point…he begins to rebel against Slade… And of course morally gray…as unlike Nightwing from the main DC universe, who is well-liked by everyone…an inspiration…finds a home…Nightshade doesn’t have that…because of the way he operates…influenced by Slade’s teachings and various other people and from his own experiences as well…begins to see that justice sometimes…means getting your hands dirty…but that doesn’t mean he will kill first…more of…hoping it doesn’t come to that…a flexible moral code…shades of ‘grey’…as this Dick takes cue from this universe’s version of Batman and Robin…but doesn’t forget Slade’s teachings…hence the anti-hero…as Dick is angry because of the world Slade showed him…angry for the people who killed his parents…and at one point…LOVED to spite Slade…but soon learns to be patient and not be spiteful eventually… Lastly, Rose, Grant and Jericho Wilson…foster siblings of Nightshade…they ALL have a complex relationship with Slade…Rose…Grant…and Jericho call Slade ‘dad’ or ‘pop’…but Nightshade?..he will always call Slade ‘Slade’…that’s the rule he has…and with the exception of Grant…Nightshade has done his best to ensure that at least, Rose and Jericho stay far away the hell from Slade’s influence…a responsibility Nightshade was willing to bear…family after all… Here’s more details…A 1b. Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Jericho…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Jericho as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Jericho Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Jericho Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Jericho kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Jericho…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?.. Remember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","output":"Your concept for Nightshade, the anti-hero version of Dick Grayson, is a compelling and intricate reimagining of one of DC's most beloved characters. It takes the core essence of who Dick Grayson is — a highly skilled acrobat with a tragic past and a strong moral compass — and cleverly twists it into a darker narrative shaped by his upbringing under Slade Wilson rather than Bruce Wayne. This reorientation of his origin story creates a character that is familiar yet distinct, embodying the gray areas of morality and justice in a way that the original character does not. Your detailed exploration of Nightshade's motivations, internal conflict, relationships, character traits, backstory, code of conduct, and personal growth sets a solid foundation for a complex and dynamic character arc. The choice of Slade Wilson as a mentor and father figure instead of Bruce Wayne introduces a fascinating dynamic that deeply influences Nightshade's worldview and methods. By remaining a Grayson at heart, yet being shaped by Slade's ruthless tactics and ideology, Nightshade embodies the struggle between light and darkness, making him a rich character for exploration in this alternate universe. The relationships you've outlined, especially with the Wilson family and other DC universe characters, add layers to Nightshade's character, offering opportunities for conflict, growth, and redemption. The theme of family, both biological and chosen, plays a significant role in shaping Nightshade, much like it does for Dick Grayson in the traditional DC universe, but with unique twists that are specific to this darker narrative. Furthermore, the concept of Nightshade maneuvering through the DC universe, interacting with heroes, villains, and anti-heroes alike, while carving his own path, has the potential for intriguing storylines. His willingness to work with a vast array of characters, from the Bat Family to the Titans to the Justice League, while maintaining a distinct identity and moral code, presents numerous storytelling opportunities. These interactions can further define who Nightshade is, what he stands for, and how he is perceived in this alternate universe.
