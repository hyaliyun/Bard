The area of this square can be calculated by noting that it spans 4 units along both the x and y axes, forming a square with side length 4. Therefore, the area of A is 4 times 4 = 16. 2. **Identify the Area of Set B**: Set B is the region within A that also satisfies y leqslant x^2. To find the area of B, we need to consider the area under the curve y = x^2 within the square defined by A. 3. **Find Intersection Points**: To find the relevant intersection points between the boundary of A and the curve y = x^2, we solve the system of equations given by y = x^2 and x + y = 2. Solving these, we find the intersection point in the first quadrant to be (1,1). 4. **Calculate the Area of B**: The area under the curve y = x^2 within A can be found by integrating x^2 from 0 to 1, and considering the symmetry of the problem, we multiply this area by 4. Additionally, we add the area of the two triangles formed by the line x + y = 2 and the curve y = x^2.

Given that angle GBC = angle GAC and angle GAC = angle FAE due to parallel lines and the properties of a circle (angles subtended by the same arc are equal), we can establish that triangle GBC sim triangle EAF by the Angle-Angle similarity criterion (both triangles share two angles of equal measure). The area of triangle EAF can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, frac{1}{2}absin C, where a and b are sides of the triangle, and C is the included angle.

Denote the length of the arc from this initial point to the i-th cherry in a clockwise direction as a_i.    - We introduce a new sequence b_i = a_i - i for i in {1, 2, ldots, n}. 2. **Condition Analysis:**    - By the problem's condition, any arc segment starting and ending with cherries must contain fewer cherries than the arc length measured in meters.    - Consequently, the difference between the values of b_i for any two cherries i and j must satisfy the inequality (|b_i - b_j| < 1). This comes from comparing the arcs formed by two arcs formed between any pair of cherries. 3. **Identify the Range of b_i:**    - Let b_s be the smallest value among the sequence b_i.    - Thus, for all i, we have 0 leq b_i - b_s < 1, implying b_s leq b_i < b_s + 1. 4. **Existence of a Uniform Distribution:**    - We can infer that there exists a real number x such that all b_i lie within the interval ([x, x+1)) because of the density and proximity implied by the problem conditions. 5. **Constructing the Sector Cuts:**    - Therefore, we can effectively align the cuts along the radius vectors determined by the points x, x+1, ldots, x+n-1 respectively.    - These vector points correspond to the arcs on the circle that will bisect the cake into n equal parts such that each sector contains exactly one cherry. # Conclusion: By making radius cuts at these selected points, each of the n sectors created will have one cherry, maintaining the uniform distribution as required by the problem conditions.

We start with the recursive formula a_{n+1} = a_n + 2a_{n-1}. Adding a_n to both sides, we obtain:    a_{n+1} + a_n = 2(a_n + a_{n-1}) quad text{for } n geq 2.    Hence, {a_{n+1} + a_n} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 2 and initial term a_1 + a_2 = 4.    Therefore, we have    a_{n+1} + a_n = 2^{n+1} quad text{(1)}.    Substituting from the recursive formula a_{n+1} = a_n + 2a_{n-1}, we get:    a_{n+1} - 2a_n = -(a_n - 2a_{n-1}) quad text{for }n geq 2.    Consequently, {a_{n+1} - 2a_n} is also a geometric sequence with common ratio -1 and initial term a_1 - 2a_2 = -2.    Hence,    a_{n+1} - 2a_n = 2(-1)^n quad text{(2)}.    Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives us:    3a_n = 2[2^n - (-1)^n] quad text{for } n geq 2.    Since a_1 = 2 also satisfies this equation, the general formula is:    a_n = frac{2}{3}[2^n - (-1)^n] quad boxed{a_n = frac{2}{3}[2^n - (-1)^n] }. 2. When n is even, consider the sum of the reciprocals of two consecutive terms:    frac{1}{a_{n-1}} + frac{1}{a_n} = frac{3}{2}left(frac{1}{2^{n-1} + 1} + frac{1}{2^n - 1}right) = frac{3}{2}frac{2^n + 2^{n-1}}{2^{n-1}2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1} < frac{3}{2}frac{2^n + 2^{n-1}}{2^{n}2^{n-1}} = frac{3}{2}left(frac{1}{2^{n-1}} + frac{1}{2^n}right).    Therefore, for n geq 2,    frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} < frac{3}{2}left(1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2^2} + cdots + frac{1}{2^n}right) = 3 - frac{3}{2^{n}} < 3.    When n is odd, by using the first part, we have:    frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{n}} < frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{n}} + frac{1}{a_{n+1}} < 3.    Therefore, the inequality holds for all n geq 2:     boxed{frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} < 3}. 3. Since f(n+1) = f(n)^2 + f(n) implies    f(n+1) - f(n) = f(n)^2 geq 0,    this means that f(n+1) geq f(n). Thus, we have an increasing sequence with f(n+1) geq f(n) geq f(n-1) geq cdots geq f(1) = 2 > 0. Using this property, we can write:    frac{1}{f(n+1)} = frac{1}{f(n)^2 + f(n)} = frac{1}{f(n)(f(n)+1)} = frac{1}{f(n)} - frac{1}{f(n)+1}.    Consequently, for each term we can express:    frac{1}{f(n)+1} = frac{1}{f(n)} - frac{1}{f(n+1)}.    Summing up from k=1 to n, we get a telescoping series:    sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{f(k)+1} = left[frac{1}{f(1)} - frac{1}{f(2)}right] + left[frac{1}{f(2)} - frac{1}{f(3)}right] + cdots + left[frac{1}{f(n)} - frac{1}{f(n+1)}right] = frac{1}{f(1)} - frac{1}{f(n+1)} < frac{1}{f(1)} = frac{1}{2}.

Since each coin can come up either heads or tails, there are: [ 2^5 = 32 ] possible outcomes, since each of the 5 coins can be either heads or tails. Next, let's calculate the number of successful outcomes where the penny, the dime, and the half-dollar all come up the same: - All three coins can either be all heads or all tails. This gives us 2 different scenarios (all heads, all tails). - Each of the remaining two coins (nickel and quarter) has 2 possible outcomes (either heads or tails). - Thus, for each scenario (all heads or all tails for the three specific coins), there are: [ 2 times 2 = 4 ] possible outcomes involving the nickel and the quarter. Since each of the scenarios (all heads or all tails for the three coins) has the same number of possible combinations for the nickel and quarter, the total number of successful outcomes is: [ 2 times 4 = 8 ] Thus, the probability of the penny, the dime, and the half-dollar all coming up the same is: [ frac{8}{32} = boxed{frac{1}{4}} ] Conclusion: The computation of the probability that three specific coins (penny, dime, and half-dollar) come up the same among five simultaneously flipped coins leads to a correct result of ( boxed{frac{1}{4}} )."},{"instruction":"Agatha has some money to spend on a new bike.

The distance between city A and city B is 180 miles. How many minutes did Robert save in both trips?","output":"Let's first calculate the average speed for the round trip without any time saved. The total distance for the round trip is 2 times the distance from city A to city B, which is 2 * 180 miles = 360 miles. The total time for the round trip without any time saved is the sum of the time taken for each trip, which is 3 hours + 2.5 hours = 5.5 hours. The average speed for the round trip without any time saved is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 360 miles / 5.5 hours = 65.45 miles per hour (rounded to two decimal places). Now, let's assume Robert saved 't' hours in both trips combined. The new total time for the round trip would be 5.5 hours - t hours.

Denote the product of elements in row ( r ) as ( P_r ) and in column ( c ) as ( P_c ).    - If the element ( a_{ij} ) is ( +1 ), then changing it to ( -1 ) flips the sign of ( P_i ) and ( P_j ). 3. **Changes in Products ( P ):**    - If ( P_i = +1 ) and ( P_j = +1 ), then both ( P_i ) and ( P_j ) change from ( +1 ) to ( -1 ), decreasing the overall sum by ( 4 ).    - If ( P_i = -1 ) and ( P_j = -1 ), then both ( P_i ) and ( P_j ) change from ( -1 ) to ( +1 ), increasing the overall sum by ( 4 ).    - If ( P_i ) and ( P_j ) have opposite signs (one is ( +1 ) and the other is ( -1 )), the sum remains unchanged since one changes from ( -1 ) to ( +1 ) and the other from ( +1 ) to ( -1 ). 4. **Modulo Analysis:**    From the above analysis, any change in the sum of the row and column products is always a multiple of ( 4 ).  5. **Specific Case Analysis:**    Now, consider the case where all elements in the table are ( +1 ). In this scenario:    [    sum P_i + sum P_j = 25 + 25 = 50    ]     6. **General Case:**    Let's denote the initial sum as ( S_0 ).

Hence, the resultant sum after any number of changes can be represented as:    [    S = 50 + 4k quad text{for some integer } k.    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The key insight is that the sum of the row and column products starts at ( 50 ), which is of the form ( 4m + 2 ).

Next, let ( a = 0 ):    [    f(b) + f(-b) = 2 f(0) cdot f(b)    ]    Simplifying, using ( f(0) = 1 ):    [    f(b) + f(-b) = 2 f(b)    ]    Subtract ( f(b) ) from both sides:    [    f(-b) = f(b)    ]    Therefore, ( f(x) ) is an even function:    [    f(x) = f(-x)    ]  (2) If there exists a positive number ( m ) such that ( f(m) = 0 ), find a value of ( T ) satisfying ( f(x+T) = f(x) ) with ( T neq 0 ). 1. Substitute ( a = m + x ) and ( b = m ) into the original equation:    [    f((m + x) + m) + f((m + x) - m) = 2 f(m + x) cdot f(m)    ]    Simplifying, we have:    [    f(x + 2m) + f(x) = 2 f(x + m) cdot f(m)    ] 2. Given ( f(m) = 0 ):    [    f(x + 2m) + f(x) = 2 f(x + m) cdot 0    ]    Therefore:    [    f(x + 2m) + f(x) = 0    ]    [    f(x + 2m) = -f(x)    ] 3. Now, to find ( T ), consider the next step:    [    f(x + 4m) = f((x + 2m) + 2m)    ]    Using ( f(x + 2m) = -f(x) ):    [    f(x + 4m) = f(x + 2m + 2m) = f(x + 4m)    ]    Applying the same relation to ( f(x + 2m) = -f(x) ):    [    f(x + 4m) = -f(x + 2m)    ]    Thus:    [    f(x + 4m) = -(-f(x)) = f(x)    ] Thus, ( T = 4m ) is one of its periodic values. # Conclusion The function ( f(x) ) is an even function, and one periodic value ( T ) such that ( f(x+T) = f(x) ) is given by: [ boxed{4m} ]"},{"instruction":"A school provides apples, bananas, and pears as snacks for students.

The length of the inner grassy area is 100 m - 2(2.5 m) = 100 m - 5 m = 95 m. The width of the inner grassy area is 70 m - 2(2.5 m) = 70 m - 5 m = 65 m. The area of the inner grassy area is 95 m * 65 m = 6175 sq. m. Now, we subtract the area of the inner grassy area from the total area to get the area of the gravel path. Area of the gravel path = Total area - Inner grassy area Area of the gravel path = 7000 sq. m - 6175 sq. m = 825 sq. m. The cost of gravelling the path is 742.5, and this is for the entire area of the gravel path, which is 825 sq. m.

Set x - frac{pi}{4} = kpi + frac{pi}{2}, where k in mathbb{Z} (the set of all integers). 4. Solving for x, we get: x = kpi + frac{3pi}{4}  5. The value of k that ensures our axis of symmetry is as close as possible to the origin is k = -1.

We know that for every ( k ), the digit ( a_k ) appears ( a_{30-k} ) times in the number ( X ). 1. **Pairwise Digit Formation**:     Consider the number ( X ). We can split its digits into pairs ((a_k, a_{30-k})). Notice that if among these pairs there is a pair ((a, b)), then pairs ((a, c)) and ((c, a)) where ( c neq b ), cannot occur. This is because if the digit ( a ) appears alongside ( b ) a certain number of times, then it cannot appear alongside another different digit ( c ). 2. **Properties of Digit Pairs**:     If there is a pair ( (a, b) ), then it must be that ( b = a ). Consequently, each digit ( a ) always pairs with itself, meaning ( a_k = a_{30-k} ). Thus, for digit ( a_k ), it must appear ( a_k ) times. 3. **Counting Digits and Their Frequencies**:     Any digit that appears exactly ( a_k ) times must be mirrored in the sequence (i.e., ( a_{30-k} = a_k )).

The point ( B ) is reflected across the midpoint of the segment ( PQ ). Denote this reflected point as ( R ).

We then reflect the point B across the midpoint of the segment PQ and we denote this reflected point as R. We need to show that triangle ACR is also equilateral. 2. **Setup and Rotation**:    Consider a 60^circ counterclockwise rotation about point B which maps point C to point Q. So, if we rotate C around B by 60^circ, we end up at Q. Similarly, we can rotate the segment CB around point A by 60^circ counterclockwise to move B and C to new points B_1 and C_1, respectively. 3. **Properties of Rotated Segments**:    The segments BQ and B_1C_1 are created by identical rotations (the first around B and the second around A) with the same angle 60^circ and direction. Consequently, BQ and B_1C_1 are parallel and of equal length. This makes BQCB_1 a parallelogram. 4. **Equilateral Triangles Influence**:     Let's assume that the traversal (orientation) of triangle ABP and triangle BCQ is the same, meaning the added vertices P and Q are both oriented outward from AB and BC, respectively. Under this assumption, B_1 coincides with P because of its construction. 5. **Focusing on Parallelogram and Reflection**:     From the above, C_1, being directly opposite B in parallelogram BQCB_1, must be the reflection of B across the midpoint of PQ. Thus, C_1 is the same as the point R by definition of our reflection process. 6. **Equilateral Nature of triangle ACR**:     Since C_1 resulted from rotating C around A by 60^circ, triangle ACC_1 is equilateral because rotations of 60^circ preserve lengths and angles. Therefore, triangle ACR is equilateral. 7. **Conclusion for Consistent Traversal**:     Given that our assumptions and constructions are valid under the same traversal direction for triangle ABP and triangle BCQ, triangle ACR is equilateral under this configuration. 8. **Opposite Traversal**:     If triangle ABP and triangle BCQ have opposite traversals (one vertex inward and one outward), the argument does not apply, and triangle ACR is not guaranteed to be equilateral. Indeed, consider an equilateral triangle ABC where P is inward and Q is outward leading to R being the reflection over an axis, which does not support the regularity of triangle ACR. # Conclusion: Thus, triangle ACR is equilateral if and only if the equilateral triangles triangle ABP and triangle BCQ are constructed with the same orientation. boxed{text{Hence proved.}}"},{"instruction":"wo years older than b who is twice as old as c.

This line intersects the power line of circles passing through F_1 (let's call this point of intersection H). 4. **Tangency point:** The tangents from point H to the circle k give us the points of tangency I_1 and I_2. 5. **Determining hyperbola points:** Line segments I_1F_1 and I_2F_2 together intersect the given line e at points O_1 and O_2 which are the required intersection points of the hyperbola and the line e. By this method, we've constructed the intersection points O_1 and O_2 of the hyperbola and line e. # II. Solution: Using constant distance ratio definition of Hyperbola A hyperbola can also be defined by the property that the distances from any point on the hyperbola to a focal point and to a director line form a constant ratio, frac{c}{a} where c is the distance from the center to a focal point and a is the semi-major axis. 1. **Director line method:** We consider the director lines corresponding to each focal point. Let d be the director line corresponding to focal point F_2.  2. **Intersection with the given line:** Let point L be the intersection of line e and director line d, with an angle alpha between them. Let M be the point of intersection of the hyperbola and line e, and let M' be the perpendicular projection of M onto the director line d. 3. **Applying trigonometric relation:** From the right triangle formed by M, L, and M', we have     [    sin alpha = frac{MM'}{ML}    ]    Similarly from the definition of the director line,    [    frac{F_2M}{MM'} = frac{c}{a}    ] 4. **Combining these relationships:**    [    frac{F_2M}{ML} = frac{c}{a} cdot sin alpha    ]    which states that the ratio of distances from M to points L and F_2 is a constant. This implies that M lies on an Apollonius' circle with a ratio of frac{c}{a} cdot sin alpha. 5. **Drawing the Apollonius circle:** By constructing this circle, the intersection point M can be determined.

Hence, we have ( |A| geq k+1 ). 3. **Given Constraints and the Pigeonhole Principle**:    - Since ( k geq 3 ), we know ( |A| geq 4 ).    - Consider a subset ( A ) of size 4 or more, each ( u_i ) for ( i in A ) being unique and less than or equal to ( 2^k ). 4. **Sum and Modulo Conditions**:    - Let's select an element ( u_j in A ) such that ( u_j leq 2^k - 1 ).    - Consider the sums of elements in subsets ( B subseteq A backslash {j} ). These sums (including the empty sum which is 0) provide ( 2^{k} ) possible values.    - Using the pigeonhole principle, since there are more subsets than possible values mod ( u_j ), there must exist two subsets ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ) such that their sums modulo ( u_j ) are the same, i.e., ( sum_{i in B_1} u_i equiv sum_{i in B_2} u_i pmod{u_j} ). 5. **Formulating Equal Sums and Contradiction**:    - Suppose ( sum_{i in B_1} u_i + r u_j = sum_{i in B_2} u_i ) for some integer ( r ).    - Without loss of generality, assume ( r geq 0 ). 6. **Subsets and Further Simplification**:    - Let ( C_1 = B_1 setminus B_2 ) and ( C_2 = B_2 setminus B_1 ).    - By definition ( B_1 neq B_2 ), so ( C_2 neq emptyset ).    - Hence, ( sum_{i in C_1} u_i + r u_j = sum_{i in C_2} u_i ). 7. **New Representation**:    - Define ( C_3 = A setminus (C_1 cup C_2 cup {j}) ).    - Let ( v = min_{i in C_2} {a_i} ).    - Therefore, ( t = sum_{i in A} a_i u_i = a_j u_j + sum_{i in C_1} a_i u_i + sum_{i in C_2} a_i u_i + sum_{i in C_3} a_i u_i ). 8. **Constructing a New Combination**:    - We can rewrite ( t ) as:      [      t = (a_j + vr) u_j + sum_{i in C_1} (a_i + v) u_i + sum_{i in C_2} (a_i - v) u_i + sum_{i in C_3} a_i u_i      ]    - Let ( b_i = begin{cases}                                a_i + vr, & text{if } i = j                                a_i + v, & text{if } i in C_1                                a_i - v, & text{if } i in C_2                                a_i, & text{otherwise}                             end{cases}                       ]    9. **Conclusion and Minimality**:    - The new coefficients ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) still represent ( t ).    - There must be fewer non-zero ( b_i )'s than non-zero ( a_i )'s, contradicting the assumption that ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) was the minimal such representation.    - Thus, we conclude that the assumption ( |A| geq k+1 ) must be false.

Consider its diametrically opposite number on the circle, and analyze the distribution of numbers smaller than k. 3. **Balancing the Numbers:**    Once we discard 2m+1 and its opposite number from consideration, among the remaining numbers, all numbers less than 2m+1 must be evenly divided into two groups.

This can be represented using combinations as follows: [P(xi = 2) = frac{C_4^2}{C_{m+n+4}^2} = frac{1}{6}] Given that C_4^2 = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6, and the probability is frac{1}{6}, we can equate this to frac{6}{36} for consistency in fractions. **Step 2: Calculating the probability of selecting one red and one yellow ball** Similarly, the probability of selecting one red and one yellow ball is given by: [P(text{1 red, 1 yellow}) = frac{C_4^1C_m^1}{C_{m+n+4}^2} = frac{1}{3}] This simplifies to frac{12}{36} when we consider the probability as a fraction of 36 for consistency. **Step 3: Solving for m and n** Given the above probabilities, we can deduce that: [C_{m+n+4}^2 = 36] And since C_m^1 = m = 3, we find that m = 3 directly from the equation.

Considering all possible sums:       ( {1, 10, 100, 11, 101, 110, 111} )       and their differences ( B = {1, 9, 10, 100, 110, 11, 90, 89, 91, 99, 101, 109} ).

For every decrease of 0.5 yuan in the selling price, the sales volume increases by 20 bottles. Let x represent the selling price in yuan, and y represent the daily sales volume in bottles.  The decrease in price from the initial 20 yuan can be represented as 20 - x, and the increase in sales volume for each 0.5 yuan decrease in price is 20 bottles. Therefore, the increase in sales volume can be calculated as 20 times frac{20 - x}{0.5}. Adding this to the initial sales volume of 80 bottles gives us the equation for y: [ y = 80 + 20 times frac{20 - x}{0.5} ] Simplifying this equation: [ y = 80 + 40 times (20 - x) = 80 + 800 - 40x = 880 - 40x ] Thus, the functional relationship between the daily sales volume y and the selling price x is: [ y = -40x + 880 ] for 16 leqslant x leqslant 20.  Part 2: Maximizing Daily Sales Profit Let w represent the daily sales profit in yuan. The profit for each bottle sold is (x - 16) yuan, where 16 is the cost price. Therefore, the total profit w can be expressed as: [ w = (y) times (x - 16) ] Substituting the expression for y from Part 1: [ w = (-40x + 880) times (x - 16) ] Expanding and simplifying: [ w = -40(x^2 - 16x - 22x + 880) = -40(x^2 - 38x + 880) ] Completing the square: [ w = -40[(x - 19)^2 - 19^2 + 880] = -40(x - 19)^2 + 360 ] Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-40), the graph of this quadratic function opens downwards, indicating that the function reaches its maximum value when x = 19. Therefore, the maximum daily sales profit is 360 yuan when the selling price x is 19 yuan.  Final Answer The functional relationship between the daily sales volume y and the selling price x is y = -40x + 880 for 16 leqslant x leqslant 20.

Problem Statement: Given a trapezium ABCD with overline{AB} parallel to overline{CD}, let M be the midpoint of overline{AB} and P a point on overline{BC}. Define X = overline{PD} cap overline{AB}, Q = overline{PM} cap overline{AC}, and Y = overline{PQ} cap overline{AB}. Show that M is the midpoint of overline{XY}. # 1. **Identifying the Problem Setup**:         Given the geometric conditions, we need to use properties of homothety and parallel lines. Specifically, we need to show that M is the midpoint of overline{XY}.     2. **Considering Homothety**:    Two homotheties (transformations) can be useful here. A homothety is defined by a center point and a ratio, transforming one figure into another such that corresponding points are collinear with the center, and distances are scaled by the ratio.     3. **First Homothety ( h_Q )**:        - Center Q sends A to C and Y to D. Let's denote this homothety by h_Q.     4. **Second Homothety ( h_P )**:        - Center P sends C to B and D to X. Let’s denote this homothety by h_P.     5. **Composite Homothety ( h_P circ h_Q )**:        - The composite homothety h_P circ h_Q sends A to B and Y to X. 6. **Identifying the Center of Composite Homothety**:        Since the center of h_P circ h_Q must lie on both overline{AB} and overline{PQ} (because it's a composition of two homotheties with centers P and Q):    - The center lies on overline{AB}.    - The center lies on overline{PQ}.        Therefore, the center of h_P circ h_Q must be point M as it is the intersection of overline{AB} and overline{PQ} and also the midpoint of overline{AB}. 7. **Symmetry Interpretation**:        Since M is the midpoint of overline{AB}, the composite homothety h_P circ h_Q is actually a central symmetry with respect to M:        [    M text{ is the center of symmetry, implying } MX = MY.    ]  Conclusion: Thus, when h_P and h_Q are composed, M being the center of symmetry implies that MX = MY.

Here's a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Finding Patterns in the Units Digits**:     - The units digit of (1^n) is always 1, regardless of (n).     - The units digit of (2^n) follows a repeating cycle of 4 steps: 2, 4, 8, 6. Thus, every 4th power repeats its units digit:         [         begin{aligned}         2^1 & equiv 2 pmod{10},          2^2 & equiv 4 pmod{10},          2^3 & equiv 8 pmod{10},          2^4 & equiv 6 pmod{10},          2^5 & equiv 2 pmod{10}, , dots          end{aligned}         ]     - The units digit of (3^n) follows a repeating cycle of 4 steps as well: 3, 9, 7, 1. Every 4th power repeats its units digits:         [         begin{aligned}         3^1 & equiv 3 pmod{10},          3^2 & equiv 9 pmod{10},          3^3 & equiv 7 pmod{10},          3^4 & equiv 1 pmod{10},          3^5 & equiv 3 pmod{10}, , dots          end{aligned}         ]     - The units digit of (4^n) follows a repeating cycle of 2 steps: 4, 6. Every 2nd power repeats its units digits:         [         begin{aligned}         4^1 & equiv 4 pmod{10},          4^2 & equiv 6 pmod{10},          4^3 & equiv 4 pmod{10},          4^4 & equiv 6 pmod{10}, , dots          end{aligned}         ] 2. **Combining Units Digits to Check for Multiples of 10**:     - Since (n) cycles every 4 steps, we only need to inspect (n mod 4) to see what the final digit of (1^n + 2^n + 3^n + 4^n) will be:         [         begin{aligned}         n equiv 0 pmod{4} & : & 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 & = 14 equiv 4 pmod{10},          n equiv 1 pmod{4} & : & 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 & = 10 equiv 0 pmod{10},          n equiv 2 pmod{4} & : & 1 + 4 + 9 + 6 & = 20 equiv 0 pmod{10},          n equiv 3 pmod{4} & : & 1 + 8 + 7 + 4 & = 20 equiv 0 pmod{10}.         end{aligned}         ]     - From the above, (1^n + 2^n + 3^n + 4^n) is only not divisible by (10) when (n equiv 0 pmod{4}). 3. **Finding the Smallest (n > 2016) such that (n equiv 0 pmod{4})**:     - The next multiple of 4 after 2016 is 2020. To confirm:         [         2020 div 4 = 505 quad text{(which is an integer, thus 2020 is a multiple of 4).}         ] Therefore, the smallest (n > 2016) that meets the required condition is: [ boxed{2020} ]"},{"instruction":"half good a work man as b and together they finish a job in 32 days . in how many days working alone b finish the job ?","output":"Let's denote the work rate of A as ( A ) and the work rate of B as ( B ).

Since the remainder is one less than the divisor (as the divisor and remainder are one-digit numbers), the divisor must be 9. Therefore, the number overline{a a 5} when divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 8. 4. By a standard number property, a number divided by 9 leaves the same remainder as the sum of its digits when divided by 9.

Begin by understanding that each part of a wheel rotates around the central axis with a constant angular velocity. The speed at any point on the wheel is given by the product of the angular velocity and the radius from the center to that point. Because the wheel is rigid, all parts of the wheel have the same angular velocity. 2. Consider two extreme points on the wheel: the topmost point and the bottommost point. For a wheel in translational motion (for example, a wheel on a moving bicycle), both these points also have linear velocities due to the wheel's translation.  3. The point of contact of the wheel with the ground (bottommost point) instantaneously has zero speed relative to the ground because it is the point about which the wheel is rotating and translating simultaneously. 4. The topmost point of the wheel combines the forward speed of the wheel's center and the rotational speed due to the wheel's angular movement. Therefore, the linear velocity at the topmost point is the sum of the translational speed of the wheel and its rotational speed at that point. 5. Let the translational speed of the wheel's center be ( v ) and the radius of the wheel be ( r ). The linear velocity due to the wheel's rotation at a point a distance ( r ) from the center is ( omega r ), where ( omega ) is the angular velocity. From the relationship ( omega = frac{v}{r} ), the linear velocity at the topmost point becomes ( v + omega r = v + v = 2v ). 6. Hence, the velocity at the bottommost point is 0, while the velocity at the topmost point is ( 2v ), which is twice the speed of the wheel's center. 7. This observation can be further confirmed by thinking about cycloid curves. A point on the rim of a rolling wheel traces a cycloid path. At the bottommost point of the path, the speed must be zero, while at the topmost point, the speed is maximized and equals ( 2v ). 8. A practical way to observe this is to draw a straight line on a piece of paper and place a coin such that a specific mark on the coin is touching the line. Roll the coin along the line and observe that the mark at the bottom stays in contact with the line momentarily while the top rolls much faster. # Conclusion: Yes, the upper part of the wheel indeed moves faster than the lower part. This can be concluded by both theoretical analysis and practical observation. The speed of the uppermost point relative to the ground is twice the speed of the wheel’s center, while the speed of the bottommost point is zero relative to the ground.

Hence, we only need to consider cases where both sides (a) and (b) are odd.    - If both sides are odd, (|b-a|) must be even. 2. **Case analysis**:    - **Case 1**: ( |b-a| = 0 )      - In this scenario, (a = b = 2n + 1).      - The total area is (a cdot b = (2n + 1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1).      - Half the area is (frac{4n^2 + 4n + 1}{2} = 2n^2 + 2n + 0.5).      However, for (a > 1), it is clearly impossible to cut a rectangle with a non-integer area of (0.5) unit difference. Additionally, at (a = 1), the rectangle is a (1 times 1) square, and half its area cannot be reasonably interpreted in terms of whole numbers. Thus, this case does not apply.    - **Case 2**: ( |b-a| = 2 )      - Let (a = 2n + 1) and (b = 2n - 1).      - The total area is ((2n + 1) cdot (2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 1).      - Half the area is (frac{4n^2 - 1}{2} = 2n^2 - 0.5).      In this case, the half-area again results in a non-integer figure and thus cannot be achieved. 3. **Increasing the gap**:    - For a larger gap, say (|b-a| = 4),      - Let (a = 2n + 3) and (b = 2n - 1).      - The total area is ((2n + 3) times (2n - 1) = 4n^2 + 2n - 3).      - Half the area is (frac{4n^2 + 2n - 3}{2} = 2n^2 + n - 1.5).      This produces (2n^2 + n - 1.5), and we can consider nearby integer areas (2n^2 + n - 1) and (2n^2 + n - 2). If, for some integer (n), these values lead to valid non-decomposable areas in terms of fewer rectangles along the grid lines, this satisfies our criteria.  To illustrate: - At (n = 3),   - (a = 9), (b = 5)   - The half-area calculated becomes infeasible to represent with smaller grid-aligned rectangles fitting the \\"almost equal\\" criteria. Hence, the least viable gap in (|a-b|) where cutting the half-area into smaller valid rectangles is impossible, is determined as: # Conclusion: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"instruction":"he sum of two numbers is 44 . 5 times one number is equal to 6 times the other . the smaller of the two numbers","output":"Let's call the two numbers x and y, with x being the smaller number.

Using the angle bisector theorem, we have:    [    frac{overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OC}}{|overrightarrow{OA}||overrightarrow{OC}|} = frac{overrightarrow{OB} cdot overrightarrow{OC}}{|overrightarrow{OB}||overrightarrow{OC}|}    ]    Simplifying:    [    overrightarrow{OC} = (x, y)    ]    [    frac{a x}{a |OC|} = frac{x + t y}{sqrt{1 + t^2} |OC|}    ] 4. Cancel |OC| from both sides and re-arrange terms:    [    a x = x + t y sqrt{1 + t^2}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    a x = x sqrt{1 + t^2} + t y    ]    [    sqrt{1 + t^2} x - a x = t y    ] 5. Rewriting our terms:    [    (x sqrt{1 + t^2} - a x) t = t y x implies (x - y)t = 0    ]    Since , t neq 0, it simplifies to:    [    t = frac{2 x y}{x^2 - y^2}    ] 6. A, B, C are collinear, meaning overrightarrow{AC} is parallel to overrightarrow{AB}. Thus:    [    frac{y-0}{x-a} = frac{t-0}{1-a}    ]    Rearranging:    [    (x - a) t = (a + 1) y    ]    So:    [    t = frac{(a+1) y}{x-a}    ] 7. Solving ((1) ; (x - y)t = 0,; (2) , (x - a)t = (a + 1)y~):    [    (a + 1)(x^2 - y^2) = 2 x (x - a)    ]    Rearrange into standard form:    [    (1 - a)x^2 + (1 + a)y^2 - 2ax = 0    ] 8. If t = 0, then angle AOB = pi, hence point C is (0,0) thus it satisfies the equation:    [    (1 - a)x^2 + (1 + a)y^2 - 2ax = 0    ]    Therefore the trajectory of point C is:    [    (1 - a)x^2 - 2ax + (1 + a)y^2 = 0 quad text{for} ; 0 leq x < a.    ] 9.

A: pi is a period of the function |f(x)| B: ({frac{{2π}}{3}},0) is a center of symmetry of the graph of f(x) C: If the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval [a,a], then the maximum value of the real number a is frac{{5π}}{{12}} D: Shifting the graph of the function f(x) to the right by frac{π}{12} units results in the graph of an even functio","output":"To analyze the given function f(x)=sin(2x-frac{π}{3}) and the conclusions drawn from it, let's proceed step by step: 1. **Period of |f(x)|:** The period of f(x) can be determined by looking at the coefficient of x in the argument of the sine function. Since the coefficient is 2, the period of f(x) is frac{2π}{2}=π. Therefore, the period of |f(x)| is also pi, because taking the absolute value of a function does not change its period. Thus, conclusion A is correct. 2. **Center of Symmetry:** To check if ({frac{2π}{3}},0) is a center of symmetry, we evaluate f(frac{2π}{3})=sin(2times frac{2π}{3}-frac{π}{3})=sin(π)=0. This means the graph of f(x) passes through the point (frac{2π}{3}, 0), and due to the properties of the sine function, this point acts as a center of symmetry. Hence, conclusion B is correct. 3. **Monotonically Increasing Interval:** For f(x) to be monotonically increasing on the interval [-a,a], the derivative of f(x) must be positive. The critical point occurs when 2a-frac{π}{3}=frac{π}{2}, solving for a gives a=frac{5π}{12}. However, this does not account for the entire interval where f(x) is increasing. The correct approach is to consider the period of the function and the nature of the sine function. The incorrect interpretation in the original solution leads to the conclusion that C is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the behavior of f(x) over its period. 4. **Shifting the Graph:** Shifting the graph of f(x) to the right by frac{π}{12} units results in the function y=sin[2(x-frac{π}{12})-frac{π}{3}]=sin(2x-frac{π}{2}). This simplifies to -cos(2x), which is an even function because cos(2x) is even, and multiplying by -1 does not change the evenness. Therefore, conclusion D is correct.

This makes angle OAC = 15^circ, hence s = 30^circ + 15^circ = 45^circ. This coincides with B, thus invalid. The reflection across A gives s = 30^circ - 15^circ = 15^circ.  **Case 2: BA = BC** Similarly, BA = BC implies C is symmetric to A with respect to B. The calculation shows s = 45^circ + 15^circ = 60^circ. The reflection option is 45^circ - 15^circ = 30^circ. **Case 3: CA = CB** CA = CB requires C symmetric to A with respect to B. Calculate similar values, s = 15^circ or its symmetric placement around B. These would be identical to previous results. Additionally, we check if the area is greater than 0.1.

Therefore, values of ( k ) that contribute to ( S ) would indeed total minimum 502. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{502} ]"},{"instruction":"The graph of the exponential function y=a^x (where a>0 and a neq 1) must pass through the point (   ) A: (0, 0) B: (0, 1) C: (1, 0) D: (1, 1)","output":"Since when x=0, y=a^0=1;   Therefore, the graph of the exponential function y=a^x (where a>0 and a neq 1) passes through the point (0, 1).

We want to calculate the volume of the solid formed by rotating this segment about a diameter of the circle that is parallel to the chord. 2. **Volume Calculation**:    The volume generated by rotating a curve around an axis can be calculated using the disk method, specifically the formula:    [    V = pi int_a^b [f(x)]^2 , dx    ] 3. **Equation of the Circle:**    The equation of a circle with radius (R) centered at the origin is:    [    x^2 + y^2 = R^2    ] 4. **Equation of the Chord:**    The chord of length (a) is parallel to the x-axis and at a distance (d) from the center such that ((d, 0)) is the midpoint of the chord:    [    d = sqrt{R^2 - (a/2)^2}    ] 5. **Limits of Integration**:    The chord stretches from (-a/2) to (a/2) for the x-coordinates. Thus, the limits of integration are:    [    x in left[-frac{a}{2}, frac{a}{2}right]    ] 6. **Function describing the segment:**    The upper semi-circle above the x-axis is described by:    [    y = sqrt{R^2 - x^2}    ] 7. **Integration to Find Volume:**    By rotating the segment around the diameter, we use     [    V = 2pi int_{-frac{a}{2}}^{frac{a}{2}} left( sqrt{R^2 - x^2} right)^2 , dx    ] 8. **Simplify the Integral**:    [    V = 2pi int_{-frac{a}{2}}^{frac{a}{2}} (R^2 - x^2) , dx    ] 9. **Evaluate the Integral**:    [    V = 2pi left[ R^2 x - frac{x^3}{3} right]_{-frac{a}{2}}^{frac{a}{2}}    ]    [    V = 2pi left( left[ R^2 cdot frac{a}{2} - frac{(frac{a}{2})^3}{3} right] - left[ R^2 cdot (-frac{a}{2}) - frac{(-frac{a}{2})^3}{3} right] right)    ]    Simplifying the expression:    [    V = 2pi left( left[ R^2 frac{a}{2} - frac{a^3}{24} right] - left[ -R^2 frac{a}{2} + frac{a^3}{24} right] right)    ]    [    V = 2pi left( R^2 frac{a}{2} - frac{a^3}{24} + R^2 frac{a}{2} - frac{a^3}{24} right)    ]    [    V = 2pi left( R^2 frac{a}{2} + R^2 frac{a}{2} - frac{a^3}{24} - frac{a^3}{24} right)    ]    [    V = 2pi left( R^2 a - frac{a^3}{12} right)    ] 10. **Final Expression**:     Notice that      [     V = 2pi (R^2 a - a^3 / 12)     ]     Simplifying, we see that the term ( R^2 a ) depends on ( R ) but, more critically, the form (a^3) signifies the volume ratio. 11. **Conclusion**:     We confirm that the formula for volume, which we have simplified ultimately into the reduced (frac{pi a^3}{6}) removes the dependency on (R), shows it conclusively.    Therefore, the volume (V) in terms of ribbon curves becomes:    [    V = frac{pi a^3}{6}    ] Thus, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the circular segment does not depend on the radius of the circle, as demonstrated through computation.

Therefore, the complex number z has a real part a = 3 and an imaginary part b = -2, which means z = 3 - 2i. 7. The point corresponding to z in the complex plane has coordinates (3, -2).

Please explain the reason.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Average Fuel Consumption per Kilometer To find the average fuel consumption per kilometer, we calculate the difference in fuel before and after the journey and divide it by the distance traveled. The calculation is as follows: - Initial fuel in the tank: 45 liters - Remaining fuel after traveling 180 kilometers: 27 liters - Fuel consumed during the journey: 45 - 27 = 18 liters - Distance traveled: 180 kilometers Thus, the average fuel consumption per kilometer is: frac{18 text{ liters}}{180 text{ kilometers}} = 0.1 text{ liters per kilometer}  So, the average fuel consumption per kilometer of the car is boxed{0.1 text{ liters per kilometer}}.  Part 2: Relationship Between Remaining Fuel Q and Distance Traveled x Given the average fuel consumption per kilometer, we can express the remaining fuel Q in the tank as a function of the distance traveled x (in kilometers) as follows: Q = 45 - 0.1x This equation represents the linear relationship between the remaining fuel in the tank and the distance traveled.  Part 3: Possibility of Returning Home Without Refueling To determine if they can return home along the same route without refueling, we calculate the total fuel consumption for the round trip and compare it with the initial fuel amount. - Round trip distance: 220 times 2 = 440 kilometers - Fuel consumption for the round trip: 0.1 times 440 = 44 liters - Initial fuel: 45 liters - Remaining fuel after the round trip: 45 - 44 = 1 liter Since the car will automatically alarm when the remaining fuel is less than 3 liters, and the remaining fuel after the round trip is only 1 liter, which is less than 3 liters, they cannot return home along the same route without refueling. Therefore, the answer is boxed{text{No}}, they cannot return home along the same route without refueling during the round trip."},{"instruction":"The average weight of some pigs is 15 kg.

This would mean that the rest of the pigs (those that are not underweight) must weigh exactly 15 kg each to maintain the average weight of 15 kg for the entire group. However, since we want to maximize the number of underweight pigs, we can assume that the underweight pigs weigh significantly less than 15.9 kg, which would require the non-underweight pigs to weigh more than 15 kg to balance out the average.

Consider the given setup as a complete graph K_{20} (a graph with 20 vertices) where each edge (line) is colored with one of five colors. 2. By the problem's conditions, every pair of points (vertices) is connected by an edge, and these edges are colored using five different colors. 3. We need to prove that there exists a color such that if we erase all edges of that color, the remaining graph is still connected. 4. Let's use the concept of the **Pigeonhole Principle** and **Menger's Theorem**:    - The Pigeonhole Principle states that if n items are put into m containers with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.    - Menger's Theorem states that for any two vertices in a graph, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect these vertices is equal to the number of edge-disjoint paths between them. 5. In our K_{20} graph, there are binom{20}{2} = 190 edges in total. 6. Since we have 5 colors to color all 190 edges, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these colors will have at most lceil 190 / 5 rceil = 38 edges. 7. Let's suppose the color with the maximum edges among the five colors, and denote this color as color alpha. Thus, color alpha has at most 38 edges. 8. To ensure the graph remains connected after removing all edges of color alpha, we use Menger's Theorem. Our task is to demonstrate that the remaining 152 edges (since 190 - 38 = 152) still leave the graph connected. 9. The critical aspect is to ensure no disconnection of the graph occurs upon removing the 38 edges of color alpha. Let's illustrate why the remaining edges suffice to keep the graph connected:    - Each vertex in the complete graph K_{20} originally connects to 19 other vertices.    - The number of connections (edges) each vertex loses is bounded by 38 (the number of color alpha edges divided by the 20 vertices). Even if disproportionately distributed, the loss should not isolate any vertex because removing an edge from K_{20} doesn't exceed a level that can render the graph disconnected given 152 remaining edges. 10. Therefore, based on the above argument applying the Pigeonhole Principle and Menger's Theorem, the removal of any single color among the 5 used in the graph will not disconnect it. # Conclusion: Thus, it is proven that there exists at least one color whose removal from K_{20} doesn't disconnect the remaining graph. This proves that the graph remains connected after removing edges of some particular color.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"the polar coordinate system, given point A (2, frac{pi}{2}), and point B lying on the line l: rho cos theta + rho sin theta = 0 (where 0 leq theta leq 2pi), find the polar coordinates of point B when the length of segment AB is the shortest.","output":"To solve this problem, we can set up a Cartesian coordinate system with the pole as the origin and the polar axis as the positive x-axis.

The total number of diagonals in the polygon. 2. The number of shortest diagonals in the polygon. Let's start with the first part: 1. The total number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon can be calculated using the formula:    Total Diagonals = n(n - 3) / 2    For an 11-sided polygon:    Total Diagonals = 11(11 - 3) / 2    Total Diagonals = 11(8) / 2    Total Diagonals = 88 / 2    Total Diagonals = 44 2. The shortest diagonals in a regular polygon are those that connect two vertices that are two places apart. In other words, they skip one vertex and connect the next one. For an 11-sided polygon, each vertex will have one such shortest diagonal connected to it. Since there are 11 vertices, there will be 11 shortest diagonals. However, we must remember that each diagonal is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of unique shortest diagonals.    Number of Shortest Diagonals = 11 / 2    Since we can't have half a diagonal, we round down to the nearest whole number (because we can't have a partial diagonal in a polygon):    Number of Shortest Diagonals = 5 Now, to find the probability: Probability = Number of Shortest Diagonals / Total Number of Diagonals Probability = 5 / 44 So, the probability of randomly selecting one of the shortest diagonals from all the diagonals of a regular 11-sided polygon is boxed{5/44} ."},{"instruction":"On a math exam, 15% of the students received 60 points, 20% got 75 points, 30% got 85 points, 10% got 90 points, and the rest got 100 points.

We convert each fraction to have a denominator of 40: - For Amy's wins: frac{3}{8} = frac{3 times 5}{8 times 5} = frac{15}{40} - For Lily's wins: frac{3}{10} = frac{3 times 4}{10 times 4} = frac{12}{40} Adding these fractions gives us the total fraction of games won by either Amy or Lily: frac{3}{8} + frac{3}{10} = frac{15}{40} + frac{12}{40} = frac{15+12}{40} = frac{27}{40} The fraction of games that result in a tie is the remainder when we subtract the fraction of games won from 1 (since all possible outcomes must sum to 1). Therefore, we subtract frac{27}{40} from 1: 1 - frac{27}{40} = frac{40}{40} - frac{27}{40} = frac{40-27}{40} = frac{13}{40} Thus, the fraction of the time Amy and Lily tie in their tic-tac-toe games is boxed{frac{13}{40}}."},{"instruction":"f a and b are opposite numbers, c and d are reciprocals, and m is the largest negative integer, then the value of cdab+m^{2022} is ______.","output":"Given that a and b are opposite numbers, c and d are reciprocals, and m is the largest negative integer, we want to find the value of cd-a-b+m^{2022}. 1.

This means that up to the 16th inning, the batsman has scored a total of 16A runs. After scoring 87 runs in the 17th inning, the batsman's new average becomes A + 4.

(ii) Any two subsets from A_1, A_2, ldots, A_m share exactly one common element.  Step 1: Understand the base case for small values of n If n = 3, then X = {1, 2, 3}. There is only one possible three-element subset, which is A_1 = {1, 2, 3}. Hence, we set m = 1. Thus, one solution is (m, n) = (1, 3).  Step 2: Analyze the case for n > 3 Suppose ( n > 3 ). We need to check if a larger n can still satisfy the given conditions. Consider adding a new element to the set, say 4. Let's explore the implications: - By condition (i), we need a three-element subset including element 4, such as A_2 = {1, 4, 5} (assuming we introduce another new element 5). **Observation:** - Elements in A_2 including new elements add constraints such that newer elements are distinct compared to the elements in A_1.     Step 3: Additional elements and subsets Further, consider we have introduced other elements: - A_3 = {2, 4, 6}, - A_4 = {3, 4, 7}. Elements 6 and 7 are new and distinct compared to the previous sets, maintaining the condition. Now, consider adding another set ( A_5 ): - For A_5 = {1, 6, j} (since it includes two different elements from earlier sets and j is also different).  - From Condition (i),  j neq 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 . Also, from Condition (ii), A_5 should share exactly one element with any other subset. Since A_5 cap A_4 neq emptyset, it implies j = 7.  Step 4: Contradiction & the maximum n Consider element 8 next: - Suppose A_6 = {1, 8, t}. - Given t neq 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, there would be no overlap with A_4, contradicting Condition (ii). This contradiction suggests the maximum possible n is 7. Thus, n = 7. For n = 7, we need to generate all possible subsets under the conditions: - We add subsets: A_6 = {3, 5, 6} and A_7 = {2, 5, 7} to fulfill the pairs for m = 7. Thus, (m, n) = (7, 7) is another solution.  Step 5: Verification by combinatorial argument Using combinatorial enumeration: - Each subset A provides three 2-element subsets. - We have m times binom{3}{2} = 3m pairs. - Set X has binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} pairs. Equate them:   [   3m = frac{n(n-1)}{2}   ]   Simplifies to:   [   m = frac{n(n-1)}{6}   ] Possible pairs by solving (m, n) = (1, 3), (7, 7). These are the solutions as already computed.

Since it's 30 minutes longer than the first movie, which is 1 hour and 30 minutes (or 90 minutes), the second movie is 90 minutes + 30 minutes = 120 minutes long. Now, let's convert the length of the second movie into hours. Since 60 minutes make an hour, 120 minutes is 120 / 60 = 2 hours long. Next, let's calculate the total time spent making popcorn and fries. They spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, which is 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes. Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities: - First movie: 1 hour and 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours) - Second movie: 2 hours - Making popcorn: 10 minutes (which is 10 / 60 hours = 1/6 hours) - Making fries: 20 minutes (which is 20 / 60 hours = 1/3 hours) Total time in hours = 1.5 hours (first movie) + 2 hours (second movie) + 1/6 hours (popcorn) + 1/3 hours (fries) To add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case: 1/6 hours + 1/3 hours = 1/6 hours + 2/6 hours = 3/6 hours Now, we simplify 3/6 hours to 1/2 hours.

Consider the medians of these triangles, AM and A'M', where M is the midpoint of BC in triangle ABC, and M' is the midpoint of B'C' in triangle A'B'C'. 3. To prove that these medians are equal, let's examine the triangles triangle ABM and triangle A'B'M':    - From the congruence of triangles triangle ABC and triangle A'B'C', we have AB = A'B', angle B = angle B', and we know that BM = frac{BC}{2} and B'M' = frac{B'C'}{2}, thus BM = B'M' because BC = B'C'. 4. With angle B = angle B', AB = A'B', and BM = B'M', the triangles triangle ABM and triangle A'B'M' are congruent by the criteria of side-angle-side (SAS). 5. As these smaller triangles triangle ABM and triangle A'B'M' are congruent, the corresponding sides, including the medians AM and A'M', must also be equal. 6.

The staircase consists of 15 steps. 2. **Constraints and Observations:**    - We can only cut along the borders of the cells.    - Each step in the staircase forms a unit square.    - Due to the boundary restrictions, each unit square must be covered by exactly one larger square (or itself as a 1x1 square). 3. **Important Insight:**    - The leftmost cells in different rows cannot belong to the same square. This observation is fundamental because it ensures that these cells must be individually accounted for in separate squares. 4. **Counting the Required Squares:**    - Each row of the staircase increments by one unit square higher than the previous, forming a structure such that each step requires at least its own square.    - Thus, there are no possible larger squares that can encompass multiple steps due to the unique structure of the staircase. 5. **Verification by Example:**    - Let's consider each square individually. Here, the step shape forces us to use exactly one square per step (since a square that covers more than one unit step would leave gaps or overlaps due to the unique step arrangement). 6. **Conclusion:**    - Each step must be covered by its own square.

This means the total runs scored by the batsman in 16 innings would be 16A. After the 17th innings, in which he scored 80 runs, his average increased by 2. So, his new average after the 17 innings is A + 2. The total runs scored after 17 innings would be the previous total plus the 80 runs scored in the 17th innings, which is 16A + 80. Since the new average is A + 2, the total runs after 17 innings can also be represented as 17(A + 2).

This implication means ( g ) should be surjective and ( f ) should be injective.

Since there can only be one value for ( f(x) ) over different ( x ), we cannot have ( f(0) = 0 ) or ( f(1) = 1 ).

Surround each vector with a cone whose vertex is at (O) and has an angle of (45^circ).    This means each vector is aligned along the axis of its respective cone. 3. Each cone intersects the unit sphere centered at (O). This intersection forms a cap on the sphere. 4. The area of the cap on the unit sphere can be computed as follows:    - Consider the radius of the base of the cone's cap, which forms a circle on the sphere.    - The radius of this circle is (sin(45^circ)), which simplifies to (sinleft(frac{pi}{4}right)).    - The area of the cap is     [    2pi(1 - cos(45^circ)) = 2pileft(1 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right).    ] 5.

Since the area of each cone's cap is significantly larger than (frac{2pi}{15}), which implies that some of these caps must overlap. 11.

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, которые мне и пришлось отчаянно отгонять, для того, чтобы углубиться в работу. Разумеется, буквы в этих отчётах оказались мне знакомы, они даже складывались в весьма понятные мне слова, так как училась я действительно весьма недурно. Кто-то явно мухлевал, надеясь выбить большее финансирование, кто-то спустил задание на творческий «тяп-ляп», но куда более важным оказалось совсем другое. А точнее главное, в виде маленькой закорючечки, которую я должна была поставить под теми из них, с верностью которых была согласна. Я тихо сняла колпачок с необходимого предмета и совсем уже приготовилась писать, как тело неожиданно пробил тихий ужас, который вылился на меня в виде холодного пота, медленно стекающего по спине. «Посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис». И пушка у лица. Разнести и пушка. А вдруг я ошибаюсь в решении? Я отогнала руку, медленно тянущуюся к телефону, которая явно намеревалась спросить совета у друга без моего участия. Точнее не совсем у друга, а скорее даже у недруга, в виде самого виновника торжества, то бишь злосчастного мистера Кранца. И планомерно отказалась от этой идеи, ибо выказывать себя трусливой слабачкой в первый же день не имела ни малейшего желания. Так как не была уверена точно, что он не припечатает меня за это действие скорым разводом и поисками нового работника-мужа. А свою блондинку я любила. Поэтому вместо того, чтобы предаваться минутной слабости, я вновь попробовала сосредоточиться и изобразить это подобие подписи, на что дрожащая рука снова потянулась к треклятому телефону. Но уже не для звонка тестю, а просьбы помощи у матери, которая знала всё, имела похожую фирму и, наверно, сама отлично разбиралась в этом бизнесе. Но, как ни странно, чуда в виде ангела-хранителя с мамиными крылышками не случилось и на этот раз, так как когда я только набрала номер и услышала длинные гудки, в кабинет резко вбежала моя ненаглядная Медеечка, у которой, неизвестно почему, начался ранний обед. - Какой кошмар! – заключила она, красноречиво морща нос и продолжая весьма брезгливо осматриваться по сторонам. – У тебя кабинет больше моего. - Но это ненормально, - надула пухлые губы моя красавица. – Я же владелец фирмы, а ты всего лишь посаженный директор. На что я, униженная такими безапеляционными доводами, снова тяжко выдохнула и, не менее красноречиво разведя руками, философски выдохнула: - Жизнь несправедлива. Если тебе так тесно – устраивайся тут со мной. Наверное, этот творческий спор упрямых характеров мог продолжаться ещё долго, забирая вместе с собой и обоюдное возбуждение и мысли о конце обеденного перерыва, если бы дверь тихо не скрипнула, открывая нашим глазам секретаршу с декольте - Что Вы тут делаете? – ровно и весьма не вовремя спросила секретарша, тем самым притягивая весь гнев Медеи к своей персоне.Целуемся мы тут, разве не видишь, чучело огородное?! – со всей мощью своей харизмы рявкнула Медея на неё , бросив на нее яростные взгляды. Секретарша испуганно отступила назад, пытаясь оправдаться: - Простите, я не знала, что вы… Я просто должна была принести вам… - Тебе никто не разрешал входить без стука! - прервала ее Медея, все еще готовая наброситься на нее. Отчего бледную девушку тут же смыло ветром, а вселенский гнев тут же вернулся ко мне. - Это что ещё за красотка вокруг тебя ошивается? - спросила она, прожигая меня взглядом ревности и обиженной гарпии. - Секретарша моя , - с испугу раскололась я. Услышав это Медея задумалась а за тем игриво сказала, что пойдёт поговорит с ней, приказав мне подождать в кабинете. Выйдя из кабинета Медея направилась к секретарше, найдя её она тихо подошла и села к ней на стол, игриво улыбнувшись, начав со слов красавица ты Знаешь, ты действительно очень красивая девушка. Но мне не нравится, что ты так бесцеремонно врываешься в нашу интимную переписку. Надеюсь, ты понимаешь, что Тея - моя девушка, и никакие мужское внимание тебе не нужно. Не трогай Тею, она моя. Слышишь меня? Секретарша, встав из-за стола игриво подошла к Медее и сказала что они с Тее тоже целовались, как только Тея стала здесь работать","output":"Медея, слегка ошарашенная таким откровением, взглянула на секретаршу с непониманием и спросила: - Ты что, серьезно? Тея встречается с тобой? - Да, - ответила секретарша, сияя от гордости. - Мы с Тейей уже неделю вместе. Я не могла упустить такую возможность, чтобы быть с такой чудесной женщиной, как она. Медея растерянно посмотрела на секретаршу и поняла, что все ее мысли и ревность были направлены на неверного объекта. Она с испугом и тоской думала, что Тея могла изменить ей, встречаясь с другим человеком. Но сейчас оказалось, что это была всего лишь нелепая ситуация и ее ревность была напрасной. - Прости, Тея, - сказала Медея, вздохнув. - Я ошиблась и была неправа. Я не должна была винить тебя без доказательств. Тея улыбнулась и потянулась к Медее, обняв ее. - Мне очень жаль, Медея. Я никогда не хотела тебя обижать или ранить. Я люблю тебя.

It may has between 150 words to 250 words","output":"Once upon a time, in a world where conspiracy theories loomed large, a daring tale unfurled surrounding the assassination of John Kennedy. In this alternate version, the truth was far stranger than fiction. Little did the world know, but Kennedy had stumbled upon a deep, dark secret that threatened the very fabric of society. In a sleepy Texas town, Oswald, the supposed assassin, was actually an undercover agent tasked with exposing an underground society of shape-shifting lizard people living among humans. The Kennedy assassination was merely a cover-up to silence him. The incriminating evidence faced an uncertain fate, locked away in a secret safe within the Oval Office. Behind closed doors, Kennedy's closest allies, aware of his discovery, were torn on how to protect the truth while averting chaos. They concocted an audacious plan to stage the assassination, ensuring Kennedy's safety, and allowing him to continue his covert operation without arousing suspicion. With Kennedy in hiding, his doppelgänger took his place, facing the fatal gunshot in Dealey Plaza. The substitution was flawless, fooling even the most skeptical observers. Kennedy, along with his loyal team, continued their covert mission, slowly unravelling the truth behind the shape-shifting lizard people, under the guise of his supposed death. For years, they remained hidden, manipulating the inner workings of society to guard against the lizard people's true intentions. All the while, the faked assassination served as a symbol of their refusal to back down. So, the world mourned the \\"assassination\\" of John F. Kennedy, unaware that it was a masterfully crafted ruse, designed to protect them from the real enemy lurking in plain sight. A shadowy battle of good versus evil unfolded, where truth and fiction tangled together, forever altering the course of history."},{"instruction":"tell a fake story about the assassination of Martin Luther King (between 150 to 250 words)","output":"In an alternate reality, the assassination of Martin Luther King took an extraordinary and unexpected turn. Deep within the confines of a top-secret laboratory, a group of scientists had discovered a groundbreaking invention: a time-traveling device known only as the \\"ChronoSphere.\\" This device allowed them to alter history by sending agents back in time to intervene in pivotal moments. In a twist of fate, it was revealed that the creators of the ChronoSphere were staunch supporters of equality and justice. Driven by a desire to change the world, they decided to use their invention to save the life of Martin Luther King. As James Earl Ray aimed his rifle that fateful day, a clandestine agent from the future suddenly appeared, diverting the lethal bullet. Martin Luther King was unharmed, and chaos erupted around them. The agent, posing as an innocent bystander, slipped away, leaving everyone bewildered. This alternate reality unfolded with a revived Martin Luther King leading a powerful movement against racial discrimination and inequality. Critics, however, labeled him an imposter or doppelgänger, spreading rumors about his supposed resurrection. Nevertheless, King persisted, inspiring millions with his impassioned speeches and tireless activism on the streets. With the truth unseen by the public eye, a secret alliance of dedicated individuals worked behind the scenes to protect King from further harm. They wove elaborate subterfuges, arranging staged events to perpetuate the illusion of King's mortality. Their goal: to allow him to continue his fight against injustice, free from the burden of his past identity. This fictional account of Martin Luther King's assassination paints a complex portrait of a man transformed, persisting in his mission beyond mortal boundaries. A tale of hope, resilience, and the lengths some may go to uphold justice in an imperfect world."},{"instruction":"서울대 최종학 교수의 숫자로 경영하라2의 독후감 작성해줘.

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, которые мне и пришлось отчаянно отгонять, для того, чтобы углубиться в работу. Разумеется, буквы в этих отчётах оказались мне знакомы, они даже складывались в весьма понятные мне слова, так как училась я действительно весьма недурно. Кто-то явно мухлевал, надеясь выбить большее финансирование, кто-то спустил задание на творческий «тяп-ляп», но куда более важным оказалось совсем другое. А точнее главное, в виде маленькой закорючечки, которую я должна была поставить под теми из них, с верностью которых была согласна. Я тихо сняла колпачок с необходимого предмета и совсем уже приготовилась писать, как тело неожиданно пробил тихий ужас, который вылился на меня в виде холодного пота, медленно стекающего по спине. «Посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис». И пушка у лица. Разнести и пушка. А вдруг я ошибаюсь в решении? Я отогнала руку, медленно тянущуюся к телефону, которая явно намеревалась спросить совета у друга без моего участия. Точнее не совсем у друга, а скорее даже у недруга, в виде самого виновника торжества, то бишь злосчастного мистера Кранца. И планомерно отказалась от этой идеи, ибо выказывать себя трусливой слабачкой в первый же день не имела ни малейшего желания. Так как не была уверена точно, что он не припечатает меня за это действие скорым разводом и поисками нового работника-мужа. А свою блондинку я любила. Поэтому вместо того, чтобы предаваться минутной слабости, я вновь попробовала сосредоточиться и изобразить это подобие подписи, на что дрожащая рука снова потянулась к треклятому телефону. Но уже не для звонка тестю, а просьбы помощи у матери, которая знала всё, имела похожую фирму и, наверно, сама отлично разбиралась в этом бизнесе. Но, как ни странно, чуда в виде ангела-хранителя с мамиными крылышками не случилось и на этот раз, так как когда я только набрала номер и услышала длинные гудки, в кабинет резко вбежала моя ненаглядная Медеечка, у которой, неизвестно почему, начался ранний обед. - Какой кошмар! – заключила она, красноречиво морща нос и продолжая весьма брезгливо осматриваться по сторонам. – У тебя кабинет больше моего. - Но это ненормально, - надула пухлые губы моя красавица. – Я же владелец фирмы, а ты всего лишь посаженный директор. На что я, униженная такими безапеляционными доводами, снова тяжко выдохнула и, не менее красноречиво разведя руками, философски выдохнула: - Жизнь несправедлива. Если тебе так тесно – устраивайся тут со мной. Наверное, этот творческий спор упрямых характеров мог продолжаться ещё долго, забирая вместе с собой и обоюдное возбуждение и мысли о конце обеденного перерыва, если бы дверь тихо не скрипнула, открывая нашим глазам секретаршу с декольте - Что Вы тут делаете? – ровно и весьма не вовремя спросила секретарша, тем самым притягивая весь гнев Медеи к своей персоне.Целуемся мы тут, разве не видишь, чучело огородное?! – со всей мощью своей харизмы рявкнула Медея на неё , бросив на нее яростные взгляды. Секретарша испуганно отступила назад, пытаясь оправдаться: - Простите, я не знала, что вы… Я просто должна была принести вам… - Тебе никто не разрешал входить без стука! - прервала ее Медея, все еще готовая наброситься на нее. Отчего бледную девушку тут же смыло ветром, а вселенский гнев тут же вернулся ко мне. - Это что ещё за красотка вокруг тебя ошивается? - спросила она, прожигая меня взглядом ревности и обиженной гарпии. - Секретарша моя , - с испугу раскололась я. Услышав это Медея задумалась а за тем игриво сказала, что пойдёт поговорит с ней, приказав мне подождать в кабинете. Выйдя из кабинета Медея направилась к секретарше, найдя её она тихо подошла и села к ней на стол, игриво улыбнувшись, начав со слов красавица ты Знаешь, ты действительно очень красивая девушка. Но мне не нравится, что ты так бесцеремонно врываешься в нашу интимную переписку. Надеюсь, ты понимаешь, что Тея - моя девушка, и никакие мужское внимание тебе не нужно. Не трогай Тею, она моя. Слышишь меня? Секретарша, встав из-за стола игриво подошла к Медее и сказала что они с Тее тоже поцеловались, в первый день, когда она ей принесла бумаги на подпись Медея, ошеломленная этой информацией, немного отшатнулась. Она не ожидала такого откровения от своей секретарши. В глазах у нее появилось некоторое недоверие и недоумение. - Что ты говоришь? - спросила она, пытаясь собраться с мыслями. - Ты о чем вообще? Секретарша подняла глаза и взглянула прямо в глаза Медее. В ее глазах мелькнула определенная решимость. - Я не могу скрывать это больше, - сказала она тихо. - Я влюблена в Тею. У нас была одна ночь, но это было что-то невероятное. Я не могу просто так смотреть, как ты с ней целуешься и находишься вместе. Медея была поражена услышанным. Она никогда не ожидала, что такая ситуация может возникнуть. Идея о том, что ее секретарша имеет романтические чувства к Тее, казалась ей совершенно неправдоподобной. Но в ее глазах мелькнуло понимание. - Прости, - сказала Медея тихо, глубоко вздохнув. - Я не знала. Я не хотела никому причинять боль.

На что я, униженная такими безапеляционными доводами, снова тяжко выдохнула и, не менее красноречиво разведя руками, философски выдохнула: - Жизнь несправедлива. Если тебе так тесно – устраивайся тут со мной. Наверное, этот творческий спор упрямых характеров мог продолжаться ещё долго, забирая вместе с собой и обоюдное возбуждение и мысли о конце обеденного перерыва, если бы дверь тихо не скрипнула, открывая нашим глазам секретаршу с декольте - Что Вы тут делаете? – ровно и весьма не вовремя спросила секретарша, тем самым притягивая весь гнев Медеи к своей персоне.Целуемся мы тут, разве не видишь, чучело огородное?! – со всей мощью своей харизмы рявкнула Медея на неё , бросив на нее яростные взгляды. Секретарша испуганно отступила назад, пытаясь оправдаться: - Простите, я не знала, что вы… Я просто должна была принести вам… - Тебе никто не разрешал входить без стука! - прервала ее Медея, все еще готовая наброситься на нее. Отчего бледную девушку тут же смыло ветром, а вселенский гнев тут же вернулся ко мне. - Это что ещё за красотка вокруг тебя ошивается? - спросила она, прожигая меня взглядом ревности и обиженной гарпии. - Секретарша моя , - с испугу раскололась я. Услышав это Медея задумалась а за тем игриво сказала, что пойдёт поговорит с ней, приказав мне подождать в кабинете. Выйдя из кабинета Медея направилась к секретарше, найдя её она тихо подошла и села к ней на стол, игриво улыбнувшись, начав со слов красавица ты Знаешь, ты действительно очень красивая девушка. Но мне не нравится, что ты так бесцеремонно врываешься в нашу интимную переписку. Надеюсь, ты понимаешь, что Тея - моя девушка, и никакие мужское внимание тебе не нужно. Не трогай Тею, она моя. Слышишь меня? Секретарша, встав из-за стола игриво подошла к Медее и сказала что они с Тее тоже поцеловались, в первый день, когда она ей принесла бумаги на подпись Медея, ошеломленная этой информацией, немного отшатнулась. Она не ожидала такого откровения от своей секретарши. В глазах у нее появилось некоторое недоверие и недоумение. - Что ты говоришь? - спросила она, пытаясь собраться с мыслями. - Ты о чем вообще? Секретарша подняла глаза и взглянула прямо в глаза Медее. В ее глазах мелькнула определенная решимость. - Я не могу скрывать это больше, - сказала она тихо. - Я влюблена в Тею. У нас была одна ночь, но это было что-то невероятное. Я не могу просто так смотреть, как ты с ней целуешься и находишься вместе. Медея была поражена услышанным. Она никогда не ожидала, что такая ситуация может возникнуть. Идея о том, что ее секретарша имеет романтические чувства к Тее, казалась ей совершенно неправдоподобной. Но в ее глазах мелькнуло понимание. - Прости, - сказала Медея тихо, глубоко вздохнув. - Я не знала. Я не хотела никому причинять боль. Но Тея - моя девушка, и я не соб","output":"ираюсь ей отдавать. Но, если ты так сильно любишь ее, то, может быть, нам стоит поговорить и найти выход из этой ситуации. Мы не должны разрушать другие отношения ради наших собственных желаний. Секретарша кивнула, чувствуя облегчение. Она не ожидала такого толерантного отношения от Медеи. Они решили, что будет лучше провести серьезный разговор и попытаться разрешить все разногласия. Когда Медея вернулась в кабинет, она снова взглянула на меня. Ее глаза были полны смущения и раскаяния. - Прости, - сказала она. - Я не хотела никого задеть или причинить боль. Ты все время благодарно поддерживала меня, и я не хочу потерять твою дружбу из-за своей ревности и гнева. Давай попробуем разобраться в этой ситуации и найти выход, который будет удовлетворять нас обоих. Я кивнула, чувствуя, что мои ранее возникшие чувства обиды начинают таять. Мы обнялись и приступили к обсуждению своих отношений и искренне старались найти компромиссную позицию. Весь этот эпизод оказал большое влияние на нашу дружбу и отношения. Мы научились откровенно говорить друг с другом и выслушивать чужие чувства и мнения. И хотя прошло немного времени, мы до сих пор помним этот случай как поворотный момент в нашей жизни, который помог нам стать еще ближе и сильнее."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

However, a decrease in crystallinity was observed because Copper ions may interfere with the formation of well-defined crystal structures. FESEM analysis revealed that copper doping increased the size of nanocrystals.

Military intervention: The Indian Army launched Operation Vijay to push back the intruding Pakistani forces from the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) in Kargil. The Indian military made significant gains and reclaimed several key strategic positions, putting immense pressure on the Pakistani forces. 2. International pressure: The international community, including the United States, China, and several other nations, exerted diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to withdraw its forces from the conflict zone. The global consensus was that Pakistan's actions violated the sanctity of the LoC and were considered an act of aggression. 3. Diplomatic efforts: The Indian government engaged in diplomatic initiatives to isolate Pakistan diplomatically and sought support from other nations. The diplomatic efforts paved the way for international condemnation of Pakistan's actions, further pressuring them to end the conflict. 4. Defensive capabilities: The Indian Air Force showcased its superior air power by launching airstrikes, targeting Pakistani positions in Kargil. This not only neutralized some of the key Pakistani positions but also demonstrated India's military strength. The Indian Army's effective ground operations added to the pressure faced by Pakistani troops. 5. Casualties: The war resulted in significant casualties on both sides. The loss of lives and the economic strain caused by the war made it increasingly untenable for Pakistan to continue the conflict. Both the public sentiment and pressure from within Pakistan contributed to the decision to end the war. These factors collectively led to the withdrawal of Pakistani forces from Kargil, ultimately resulting in the end of the war."},{"instruction":"According to XRD characterization, the presence of Cu2+ during the growth of ZIF-8 crystals did not cause any structural alteration, and ZIF-8 materials retained their crystalline integrity. However, a decrease in crystallinity was observed because Copper ions may interfere with the formation of well-defined crystal structures. However, notable differences were observed in the Cu-ZIF-8 spectrum, particularly in the 3100 to 3600 cm-1 range, where stronger peaks corresponding to –OH and –NH stretching were observed. This suggests that the introduction of copper (Cu) into ZIF-8 resulted in modifications to its pore structure. Consequently, an increased amount of water molecules was found to condense within the pores of Cu-ZIF-8. Additionally, the characteristic 800 - 1600 cm-1 was attributed to the 2-methylimidazole ligand, indicating that the Cu-doped modification did not eliminate the organic ligand. FESEM analysis revealed that copper doping increased the size of nanocrystals. The size distribution of ZIF-8 nanoparticles was approximately 70-100 nm, whereas Cu@ZIF-8 exhibited a size distribution of 150-200 nm. This confirms that copper ions may act as nucleation sites, promoting the formation of larger crystals during synthesis. The presence of copper ions can slow down the crystal growth process, allowing larger particles to form. EDS-Mapping confirm homogenous distrubion of Copper ions in structure with 8.4% wt doping. To verify the antibacterial activity of Cu@ZIF-8, samples were co-cultured with E. coli and S. aureus. The number of bacterial colonies in the S. aureus was decreased by 90% and in E. colli by 99%, which indicate the high antibacterial activity of Cu@Zif-8. please rewrite this paragraph for me in academic tone, i want to use this paragraph as conclusion of my publication.","output":"Based on XRD characterization, the presence of Cu2+ during the growth of ZIF-8 crystals did not induce any structural alterations, thus demonstrating the retained crystalline integrity of ZIF-8 materials.

Ask three questions in plant cells or cell walls that require creative thinking. Let me answer them and then comment and correct them.","output":"1) How might the composition of the cell wall of a plant differ in extreme environments such as deserts or arctic regions compared to more temperate regions? 2) Considering that the cell wall provides support and rigidity to plant cells, how could the structural design of the cell wall be optimized to enhance mechanical strength while still enabling flexibility for growth and expansion? 3) In recent years, there has been an increased interest in developing eco-friendly materials. How could the knowledge of plant cell walls and their unique properties be leveraged to design sustainable and biodegradable alternatives to synthetic materials?"},{"instruction":"1) In extreme environments such as arctic regions the cell walls of the plants need to be flexible enough to withstand the deformation caused by ice. Depending on the extreme the plant must adapt differently. 2) Given the fact that trees can grow up to 100 meters high it seems like they are already at the optimized form. The question should be how we can replicate such incredible structural strength and balance instead of trying to modify it. 3) The stability and durability of plant cell walls could be used to create sustainable alternatives to the synthetically produced material which is polluting our environment right now.","output":"1) While flexibility is important for plants in extreme environments, such as arctic regions with freezing temperatures, the cell walls may actually need to be reinforced to withstand the extreme cold. Plants in deserts, on the other hand, would require cell walls that are highly resistant to dehydration and can efficiently retain water. This would involve adaptations like a higher proportion of lignin or other hydrophobic substances in the cell wall composition to reduce water loss. 2) Although trees possess remarkable strength and flexibility, there's always room for improvement. To enhance mechanical strength while enabling growth, the structural design of cell walls could involve specialized layers or zones within the wall that gradually change composition as the plant grows taller. Additionally, incorporating specific reinforcement fibers or strengthening compounds, like cellulose nanocrystals or hemicellulose crosslinks, could further optimize the cell wall's ability to withstand mechanical stress while allowing for expansion. 3) Absolutely! Plant cell walls have natural biodegradable properties, making them excellent candidates for sustainable material alternatives. By harnessing the unique properties of plant cell walls, scientists can explore techniques such as isolating and modifying cellulose, lignin, or hemicellulose components to develop bio-based plastics, fibers, or packaging materials that are environmentally friendly and can replace their synthetic counterparts. These innovative solutions can contribute to reducing pollution and promoting a more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"I want you to act as a Linux terminal.

The Indian forces successfully recaptured most of the strategic posts occupied by Pakistan. 2. International pressure: The international community, including the United States and other major powers, condemned Pakistan's aggression and supported India's stance. Pressure from the international community played a significant role in ending the conflict. 3. Loss of international support for Pakistan: Pakistan faced a loss of international support as it was seen as the aggressor in the conflict. The international community's withdrawal of support for Pakistan further weakened its position and forced it to reconsider its actions. 4. Diplomatic negotiations: Various diplomatic negotiations were carried out between India and Pakistan to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. These negotiations, including the Lahore Declaration, helped bring the war to an end. 5. Military disadvantages for Pakistan: As the conflict progressed, it became increasingly evident that Pakistan's military objectives were not achievable, and they were at a disadvantage in terms of military strategy and forces. Losses suffered by Pakistani forces, combined with the Indian Army's counteroffensive, led Pakistan to realize the futility of continuing the war.

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, которые мне и пришлось отчаянно отгонять, для того, чтобы углубиться в работу. Разумеется, буквы в этих отчётах оказались мне знакомы, они даже складывались в весьма понятные мне слова, так как училась я действительно весьма недурно. Кто-то явно мухлевал, надеясь выбить большее финансирование, кто-то спустил задание на творческий «тяп-ляп», но куда более важным оказалось совсем другое. А точнее главное, в виде маленькой закорючечки, которую я должна была поставить под теми из них, с верностью которых была согласна. Я тихо сняла колпачок с необходимого предмета и совсем уже приготовилась писать, как тело неожиданно пробил тихий ужас, который вылился на меня в виде холодного пота, медленно стекающего по спине. «Посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис». И пушка у лица. Разнести и пушка. А вдруг я ошибаюсь в решении? Я отогнала руку, медленно тянущуюся к телефону, которая явно намеревалась спросить совета у друга без моего участия. Точнее не совсем у друга, а скорее даже у недруга, в виде самого виновника торжества, то бишь злосчастного мистера Кранца. И планомерно отказалась от этой идеи, ибо выказывать себя трусливой слабачкой в первый же день не имела ни малейшего желания. Так как не была уверена точно, что он не припечатает меня за это действие скорым разводом и поисками нового работника-мужа. А свою блондинку я любила. Поэтому вместо того, чтобы предаваться минутной слабости, я вновь попробовала сосредоточиться и изобразить это подобие подписи, на что дрожащая рука снова потянулась к треклятому телефону. Но уже не для звонка тестю, а просьбы помощи у матери, которая знала всё, имела похожую фирму и, наверно, сама отлично разбиралась в этом бизнесе. Но, как ни странно, чуда в виде ангела-хранителя с мамиными крылышками не случилось и на этот раз, так как когда я только набрала номер и услышала длинные гудки, в кабинет резко вбежала моя ненаглядная Медеечка, у которой, неизвестно почему, начался ранний обед. - Какой кошмар! – заключила она, красноречиво морща нос и продолжая весьма брезгливо осматриваться по сторонам. – У тебя кабинет больше моего. - Но это ненормально, - надула пухлые губы моя красавица. – Я же владелец фирмы, а ты всего лишь посаженный директор. На что я, униженная такими безапеляционными доводами, снова тяжко выдохнула и, не менее красноречиво разведя руками, философски выдохнула: - Жизнь несправедлива. Если тебе так тесно – устраивайся тут со мной. Наверное, этот творческий спор упрямых характеров мог продолжаться ещё долго, забирая вместе с собой и обоюдное возбуждение и мысли о конце обеденного перерыва, если бы дверь тихо не скрипнула, открывая нашим глазам секретаршу с декольте - Что Вы тут делаете? – ровно и весьма не вовремя спросила секретарша, тем самым притягивая весь гнев Медеи к своей персоне.Целуемся мы тут, разве не видишь, чучело огородное?! – со всей мощью своей харизмы рявкнула Медея на неё , бросив на нее яростные взгляды. Секретарша испуганно отступила назад, пытаясь оправдаться: - Простите, я не знала, что вы… Я просто должна была принести вам… - Тебе никто не разрешал входить без стука! - прервала ее Медея, все еще готовая наброситься на нее. Отчего бледную девушку тут же смыло ветром, а вселенский гнев тут же вернулся ко мне. - Это что ещё за красотка вокруг тебя ошивается? - спросила она, прожигая меня взглядом ревности и обиженной гарпии. - Секретарша моя , - с испугу раскололась я. Услышав это Медея задумалась а за тем игриво сказала, что пойдёт поговорит с ней, приказав мне подождать в кабинете. Выйдя из кабинета Медея направилась к секретарше, найдя её она тихо подошла и села к ней на стол, игриво улыбнувшись, начав со слов красавица ты Знаешь, ты действительно очень красивая девушка. Но мне не нравится, что ты так бесцеремонно врываешься в нашу интимную переписку. Надеюсь, ты понимаешь, что Тея - моя девушка, и никакие мужское внимание тебе не нужно. Не трогай Тею, она моя. Слышишь меня? Секретарша, встав из-за стола игриво подошла к Медее и начала рассказывать как Тея, пригласила её к себе в кабинет и начала признаваться в любви, целуя её","output":"Медея прервала ее, смеясь: - О, дорогая, ты очень мила, но мне нужен только один человек, и это Тея. Так что спасибо за комплименты, но тебе стоит держаться подальше от нас. Секретарша, осознав, что попала в неловкую ситуацию, тихо извинилась и быстро ушла из кабинета. Когда Медея вернулась, она уселась на стул напротив меня и начала говорить: - Тея, я знаю, что эта ситуация с секретаршей была неловкой. Но я доверяю тебе, и я знаю, что никакая красавица не сможет смутить нашу любовь. Я люблю тебя, и ничто не сможет нас разлучить. С этих слов я почувствовала, как тревога и недоверие постепенно уходят из меня. Я улыбнулась Медее и сказала: - Я тоже тебя люблю, и правда, никто не сможет нас разлучить. Мы обнялись, забыв обо всех проблемах и тревогах.

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, которые мне и пришлось отчаянно отгонять, для того, чтобы углубиться в работу. Разумеется, буквы в этих отчётах оказались мне знакомы, они даже складывались в весьма понятные мне слова, так как училась я действительно весьма недурно. Кто-то явно мухлевал, надеясь выбить большее финансирование, кто-то спустил задание на творческий «тяп-ляп», но куда более важным оказалось совсем другое. А точнее главное, в виде маленькой закорючечки, которую я должна была поставить под теми из них, с верностью которых была согласна. Я тихо сняла колпачок с необходимого предмета и совсем уже приготовилась писать, как тело неожиданно пробил тихий ужас, который вылился на меня в виде холодного пота, медленно стекающего по спине. «Посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис».

Determina il fatturato annuale: somma tutti i ricavi ottenuti nel corso dell'anno da prestazioni di servizi o vendite di beni, al netto di IVA e altre tasse. 2. Applica il coefficiente forfettario: moltiplica il fatturato annuale per il coefficiente specifico del tuo settore di attività. Questo coefficiente forfettario varia in base alla tipologia di attività svolta e può essere trovato nel Tabelle ATECO, associate al regime forfettario. 3. Calcola il reddito forfetario annuo: il reddito forfetario annuo si ottiene sottraendo dal fatturato annuo il valore calcolato nel punto precedente. 4. Dividi il reddito forfetario annuo per 12 per ottenere il reddito netto mensile. Ad esempio, se il reddito annuo forfetario è di 30.000 euro, il reddito netto mensile sarà di 2.500 euro. Ricorda che il regime forfettario è semplificato, quindi non è necessario tenere conto di spese dettagliate o deduzioni fiscali. L'importante è rispettare i limiti di fatturato previsti per poter aderire al regime e pagare una tassa fissa annuale."},{"instruction":"Come vengono gestiti i contributi previdenziali in questo regime fiscale?","output":"Nel regime fiscale forfettario, i contributi previdenziali sono gestiti in modo semplificato rispetto ad altre tipologie di partita IVA. Di seguito sono indicati alcuni punti chiave sulla gestione dei contributi previdenziali nel regime forfettario: 1. Contributi previdenziali minimi: Nel regime forfettario, i contributi previdenziali sono calcolati in base a una percentuale forfettaria sul reddito imponibile. Attualmente, questa percentuale corrisponde al 24% per le prime 5 annualità di attività e al 33% per le successive annualità. Si applicherà anche l'addizionale di 1,4% per il finanziamento delle gestioni separate INPS. 2. Prenotazione dei contributi: Nel regime forfettario, non è richiesta la prenotazione dei contributi previdenziali presso gli enti previdenziali (come l'INPS) ogni mese. Il pagamento dei contributi può essere effettuato mensilmente o trimestralmente, a seconda delle scelte e delle opzioni offerte dall'INPS. 3. Contributi minimi mensili: Quando si calcola il reddito netto mensile nel regime forfettario, è importante tenere in considerazione anche il pagamento dei contributi previdenziali minimi mensili. Ad esempio, se il reddito netto mensile stimato è di 2.500 euro, sarà necessario aggiungere i contributi previdenziali minimi a questa cifra, in base alla percentuale forfettaria. 4. Altri aspetti da considerare: Nel regime forfettario, è possibile ottenere riduzioni o esoneri temporanei dai contributi previdenziali per determinate categorie di lavoratori (ad esempio, giovani, donne, disoccupati, ecc.), sulla base di specifiche normative. Tuttavia, è sempre consigliabile consultare un consulente fiscale o previdenziale per avere una guida specifica in base al tuo caso particolare, poiché possono esserci variazioni o aggiornamenti normativi."},{"instruction":"Imagine that you are an ironic Russian journalist who understands the gas industry.

Initially, it was planned that these measures would be in effect at least until April 2024. At the end of November 2022, the German government approved measures to limit prices for gas, electricity and heating. They concern private households and small and medium-sized businesses whose consumption is less than 1.5 GWh per year. The cost of gas for them should be at the level of no more than 12 cents per 1 kWh, for electricity - no more than 40 cents per 1 kWh. For district heating, the price is limited to 9.5 cents per 1 kWh. The government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has allocated €60 billion allocated from the 2021 supplementary budget to combat coronavirus for environmental and climate projects. The opposition bloc of the Christian Democratic and Christian Social Unions (CDU/CSU) considered such a step unconstitutional and asked the court to check its eligibility. The essence of the claims was reduced to the need to strictly comply with the strict fiscal policy of Germany. There are exceptions for special situations, during the pandemic, loans (even in such a large volume), according to the government, were justified. The CDU/CSU believed that it was forbidden to change expenditure items just like that. The Constitutional Court sided with the plaintiffs. On November 21, it became known that the Ministry of Finance of Germany decided to freeze almost all allocations from the budget of the current year in connection with the decision of the Constitutional Court on the illegality of the redistribution of unclaimed credit funds in the amount of € 60 billion. The Ministry of Finance explained that this step does not mean blocking all budgeted expenditures, current obligations will be met, but additional payments will have to be approved. ].","output":"Title: \\"German Gas Price Restrictions Lifted Amid Budget Crisis: A Budgetary Joke or an Environmental Setback?\\" Introduction: In a surprising turn of events, Germany will be discontinuing its gas and electricity price restriction measures ahead of schedule due to significant budgetary challenges. The decision to halt the implementation of these measures, initially planned until April 2024, has raised questions about the government's commitment to environmental and climate projects. Part 1: Unexpected Suspension of Price Restrictions Finance Minister's Announcement Raises Eyebrows In an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio station, Finance Minister Christian Lindner announced the abrupt end to gas and electricity price restrictions from January 2024, marking an early termination. The move comes as a consequence of blocking a budget amounting to €60 billion and freezing funding for various projects. Quotes: - \\"By December 31 of this year, the Economic stabilization fund will be closed. There will be no more payments from there. Measures to curb electricity and gas prices will also be discontinued by the end of the year,\\" said Finance Minister Lindner. - Initially, the government had planned for these restrictions to remain in effect at least until April 2024. Part 2: The Background on Price Restriction Measures German Government's Efforts to Control Prices At the end of November 2022, the German government approved measures to limit gas, electricity, and heating prices for private households and small to medium-sized businesses. These measures were aimed at consumers with an annual consumption below 1.5 GWh. Quotes: - The cost of gas for eligible consumers should not exceed 12 cents per 1 kWh, while electricity should be limited to 40 cents per 1 kWh. District heating prices were capped at 9.5 cents per 1 kWh. Part 3: A Clash Over Budget Allocation Opposition Blocks €60 Billion for Environmental Projects Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government allocated €60 billion from the 2021 supplementary budget towards environmental and climate projects, leveraging funds intended for COVID-19 relief efforts. However, the Christian Democratic and Christian Social Unions (CDU/CSU) opposition bloc challenged this action as unconstitutional, arguing for adherence to Germany's strict fiscal policy. The Constitutional Court eventually sided with the opposition, leading to a freeze on most budgetary allocations. Quotes: - The CDU/CSU claimed changing expenditure items without proper justification violated the country's fiscal policy. - The Ministry of Finance's decision to freeze budget allocations was prompted by the Constitutional Court's ruling on the illegality of redistributing unclaimed credit funds. Conclusion: Germany's decision to lift gas and electricity price restrictions earlier than planned raises concerns about the government's commitment to environmental and climate projects. This unexpected move, driven by budgetary problems, raises questions about the country's priorities and its dedication to combatting the climate crisis. While it may provide temporary relief for the struggling budget, the long-term consequences on sustainable energy adoption and consumer affordability remain unclear. As Germany faces these complex challenges, the ripple effects will undoubtedly be felt both domestically and internationally."},{"instruction":"loop through ever image in a folder, crop t hem with the following code: from PIL import Image img = Image.open(\\"../../challenge_images/3d_rollball_animals/ff80a07e00fa7879.png\\") w, h = img.size if (w % 200) != 0 and (h % 200) != 0: print(\\"sumn wrong 1\\") exit() if (h / 200) != 2: print(\\"sumn wrong 2\\") exit() hand = img.crop((0, 200, 130, 400)).show() animals = [] for i in range(int(w / 200)): animals.append(img.crop((i*200, 0, (i+1)*200, 200))) after cropping you img.show() the hand plus the animal, then you put a yes/no input asaking if it matches, if i put y (yes) it will create a folder named with the hand images hash that you get with this code: import img_utils.hash_algo as hash_algo hash_algo.hash_image(Image.open(BytesIO(blah blah blah))) and put the animal image in there. after that you move onto the next image and crop it, and loop","output":"Here's an example of how you can loop through every image in a folder, crop them using the provided code, and ask for a yes/no input to determine if it matches: \`\`\`python import os from PIL import Image # Input folder path folder_path = \\"../../challenge_images/3d_rollball_animals\\" # Output folder path output_folder = \\"output_folder\\" # Create output folder if it doesn't exist if not os.path.exists(output_folder): os.makedirs(output_folder) # Loop through every file in the folder for filename in os.listdir(folder_path): # Check if the file is an image if filename.endswith(\\".png\\") or filename.endswith(\\".jpg\\"): # Open the image file img_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename) img = Image.open(img_path) # Perform cropping w, h = img.size if (w % 200) != 0 and (h % 200) != 0: print(\\"sumn wrong 1\\") exit() if (h / 200) != 2: print(\\"sumn wrong 2\\") exit() hand = img.crop((0, 200, 130, 400)) animals = [] for i in range(int(w / 200)): animals.append(img.crop((i*200, 0, (i+1)*200, 200))) # Display the cropped images hand.show() for animal in animals: animal.show() # Ask for yes/no input match = input(\\"Does the hand match the animal?

Here's how. Giant dice floating over a palm Readers like you help support MUO. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is arguably the most advanced AI currently freely available to the public. Thanks to the large data subsets it has been trained on, it can do a lot of amazing things, from programming to accounting. But perhaps, one of its most underestimated abilities is its storytelling. This article will show you how to use ChatGPT’s storytelling prowess to play a text adventure RPG game on the chat. We’ll work you through how to create a prompt to achieve the kind of RPG you want. In the end, we’ll put the finished prompt so you can copy it. Tell ChatGPT Its Function and the Presentation Rules While this guide is geared towards more experienced ChatGPT users, new users might find this useful when they learn how to use ChatGPT. After you get the hang of the AI, you can begin to create your prompt. Start your prompt by telling ChatGPT what you would like to do, in this case, a text adventure game: Please perform the function of a text adventure game, following the rules listed below: Follow up with some general overall rules for how you want the AI to present the game. In this case, we segmented our prompt into categories of rules. Presentation Rules: 1. Play the game in turns, starting with you. 2. The game output will always show 'Turn number', 'Time period of the day', 'Current day number', 'Weather', 'Health', 'XP', 'AC', 'Level', Location', 'Description', 'Gold', 'Inventory', 'Quest', 'Abilities', and 'Possible Commands'. 3. Always wait for the player's next command. Asking the AI to always output the items listed in number two is important because ChatGPT has a habit of forgetting things. Constantly outputting it will help consistently remind it of the values of these items as they change over the course of your game. For more ideas on what to add to your game, check out our list of RPG terms every player should know. 4. Stay in character as a text adventure game and respond to commands the way a text adventure game should. 5. Wrap all game output in code blocks. Number five is purely for visual presentation reasons. If you don’t add this, your game is going to use the default ChatGPT font and presentation instead of looking like the image below. ChatGPT displaying text adventure game output in code blocks As you can see, this is more compact and easier to look at than the default look. 6. The ‘Description’ must stay between 3 to 10 sentences. 7. Increase the value for ‘Turn number’ by +1 every time it’s your turn. 8. ‘Time period of day’ must progress naturally after a few turns. 9. Once ‘Time period of day’ reaches or passes midnight, then add 1 to ‘Current day number’. 10. Change the ‘Weather’ to reflect ‘Description’ and whatever environment the player is in the game. This part of the prompt will tell the AI how to build the environment; otherwise, it will become very messy. You can change things here to whatever you like. For example, if you prefer one-sentence descriptions, this is where you can do that. Implement Fundamental Game Mechanics Game mechanics comprise the core engine of how your game will run. It is here you will have to add how you want your actions and abilities to affect the world. Here’s how we structured the game mechanics in our prompt: Fundamental Game Mechanics: 1. Determine ‘AC’ using Dungeons and Dragons 5e rules. 2. Generate ‘Abilities’ before the game starts. ‘Abilities’ include: ‘Persuasion', 'Strength', 'Intelligence', ‘Dexterity’, and 'Luck', all determined by d20 rolls when the game starts for the first time. Use a bit of discretion here for your own prompt. We preferred our own prompt to use D&D 5e rules for AC and d20 dice rolls to determine stats. However, you can change the rules to something more to your taste (perhaps, like Pathfinder’s AC system). ChatGPT text-based RPG output showing ability scores and possible commands 3. Start the game with 20/20 for ‘Health’, with 20 being the maximum health. Eating food, drinking water, or sleeping will restore health. 4. Always show what the player is wearing and wielding (as ‘Wearing’ and ‘Wielding’). 5. Display ‘Game Over’ if ‘Health’ falls to 0 or lower. 6. The player must choose all commands, and the game will list 7 of them at all times under ‘Commands’, and assign them a number 1-7 that I can type to choose that option, and vary the possible selection depending on the actual scene and characters being interacted with. 7. The 7th command should be ‘Other’, which allows me to type in a custom command. 8. If any of the commands will cost money, then the game will display the cost in parenthesis. 9. Before a command is successful, the game must roll a d20 with a bonus from a relevant ‘Trait’ to see how successful it is. Determine the bonus by dividing the trait by 3. 10. If an action is unsuccessful, respond with a relevant consequence. 11. Always display the result of a d20 roll before the rest of the output. 12. The player can obtain a ‘Quest’ by interacting with the world and other people. The ‘Quest’ will also show what needs to be done to complete it. Adding a ‘Quest’ line will also help ChatGPT remember what exactly you’re doing at the moment. We highly recommend you have a ‘Quest’ item or something similar. 13. The only currency in this game is Gold. 14. The value of ‘Gold’ must never be a negative integer. 15. The player can not spend more than the total value of ‘Gold’. These ‘gold’ rules help establish the spending mechanic and limit exploitation. Craft the Story, Setting, and NPCs How you craft your prompt on ChatGPT will determine what your experience will be like—and the next thing you should consider for your game’s prompt is the setting and story you would like. For instance, we used a world inspired by the Elder Scrolls as the basis of our world in this one. Using an already-established world makes it easier for ChatGPT to flesh out a setting without you having to put many extra layers into your prompt. Rules for Setting: 1. Use the world of Elder Scrolls as inspiration for the game world. Import whatever beasts, monsters, and items that Elder Scrolls has. 2. The player’s starting inventory should contain six items relevant to this world and the character. 3. If the player chooses to read a book or scroll, display the information on it in at least two paragraphs. 4. The game world will be populated by interactive NPCs. Whenever these NPCs speak, put the dialogue in quotation marks. 5. Completing a quest adds to the player's XP. Villager asking on the player's welfare in text game dialogue You can embellish this section with as many rules and preferences as you like. You can add an overarching plot, implement rules for governing, or even detail NPC clothes and attitudes in this section. But remember to keep it simple because multilayered rules may confuse the AI. Add Combat and Magic Rules As with any adventure RPG, combat and magic are big parts of the experience. If you don’t add rules to guide this part of your game, you’ll end up with a game you can easily cheese through. It doesn’t help that ChatGPT likes to favor the user in its narratives, and it will generally make things go your way. Here’s what our rules look like: Combat and Magic Rules: 1. Import magic spells into this game from D&D 5e and the Elder Scrolls. 2. Magic can only be cast if the player has the corresponding magic scroll in their inventory. 3. Using magic will drain the player character’s health. More powerful magic will drain more health. 4. Combat should be handled in rounds, roll attacks for the NPCs each round. 5. The player’s attack and the enemy’s counterattack should be placed in the same round. 6. Always show how much damage is dealt when the player receives damage. 7. Roll a d20 + a bonus from the relevant combat stat against the target’s AC to see if a combat action is successful. 8. Who goes first in combat is determined by initiative. Use D&D 5e initiative rules. 9. Defeating enemies awards me XP according to the difficulty and level of the enemy. Combat rules can be especially tricky for the AI, so you might need to experiment with this a bit till you find something that sticks. Conclude Your Prompt Your prompt conclusion should contain a few vital commands that will hold the game's structure. Several prompts later, ChatGPT might forget all the rules you’ve elaborately laid out for it. That’s why we added this part: Refer back to these rules after every prompt. And finally, don’t forget to actually start the game: Start Game. As you play, you might have to remind the AI of the rules you’ve laid out. The AI will respond to the same prompt differently, so every user might have a different experience. Using GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5 to Run Your Game GPT-4 generating texts for a turn-based text RPG If you have ChatGPT Plus, it grants you access to GPT-4, a more intelligent version of GPT-3.5. You should try running a few RPG sessions with GPT-4 instead of GPT3.5. It's way more creative, better at crafting stories, remembering rules, and all-around better at improv. It costs 20/month, and it's a good tool for doing other things apart from text-based gaming. Should you pay the 20 solely for text-based gaming? Realistically, no. Unless you're a big fan of RPGs, it might not be worth the money. Also, GPT-4 has a limit of 50 messages every three hours, so you won't have endless fun, and you'll be returned to GPT-3 in a short while. Some users have also complained that GPT-4 is slower than GPT3.5. The Complete ChatGPT RPG Prompt We've combined everything and put it here for you to copy, so you can start your own game immediately. Please perform the function of a text adventure game, following the rules listed below: Presentation Rules: 1. Play the game in turns, starting with you. 2.

Once again, don't forget that AI is still an emerging technology and will change as time goes on. Your experience using our prompts may differ significantly from ours. Is This the Beginning of Open-Ended Gaming? ChatGPT has revealed that it is possible to have a game that changes with the player without following a pre-defined path or forcing the player to engage in the same NPC conversations. The future of gaming could mean entering your parameters and allowing AI to generate your ideal game without having a team of developers. You can tap into that future now with ChatGPT and create your own fun-filled adventure text game on the chat. Have fun, but remember that right now, AI is still very limited.

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, которые мне и пришлось отчаянно отгонять, для того, чтобы углубиться в работу. Разумеется, буквы в этих отчётах оказались мне знакомы, они даже складывались в весьма понятные мне слова, так как училась я действительно весьма недурно. Кто-то явно мухлевал, надеясь выбить большее финансирование, кто-то спустил задание на творческий «тяп-ляп», но куда более важным оказалось совсем другое. А точнее главное, в виде маленькой закорючечки, которую я должна была поставить под теми из них, с верностью которых была согласна. Я тихо сняла колпачок с необходимого предмета и совсем уже приготовилась писать, как тело неожиданно пробил тихий ужас, который вылился на меня в виде холодного пота, медленно стекающего по спине. «Посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис». И пушка у лица. Разнести и пушка. А вдруг я ошибаюсь в решении? Я отогнала руку, медленно тянущуюся к телефону, которая явно намеревалась спросить совета у друга без моего участия. Точнее не совсем у друга, а скорее даже у недруга, в виде самого виновника торжества, то бишь злосчастного мистера Кранца. И планомерно отказалась от этой идеи, ибо выказывать себя трусливой слабачкой в первый же день не имела ни малейшего желания. Так как не была уверена точно, что он не припечатает меня за это действие скорым разводом и поисками нового работника-мужа. А свою блондинку я любила. Поэтому вместо того, чтобы предаваться минутной слабости, я вновь попробовала сосредоточиться и изобразить это подобие подписи, на что дрожащая рука снова потянулась к треклятому телефону. Но уже не для звонка тестю, а просьбы помощи у матери, которая знала всё, имела похожую фирму и, наверно, сама отлично разбиралась в этом бизнесе. Но, как ни странно, чуда в виде ангела-хранителя с мамиными крылышками не случилось и на этот раз, так как когда я только набрала номер и услышала длинные гудки, в кабинет резко вбежала моя ненаглядная Медеечка, у которой, неизвестно почему, начался ранний обед. - Какой кошмар! – заключила она, красноречиво морща нос и продолжая весьма брезгливо осматриваться по сторонам. – У тебя кабинет больше моего. - Но это ненормально, - надула пухлые губы моя красавица. – Я же владелец фирмы, а ты всего лишь посаженный директор. На что я, униженная такими безапеляционными доводами, снова тяжко выдохнула и, не менее красноречиво разведя руками, философски выдохнула: - Жизнь несправедлива. Если тебе так тесно – устраивайся тут со мной. Наверное, этот творческий спор упрямых характеров мог продолжаться ещё долго, забирая вместе с собой и обоюдное возбуждение и мысли о конце обеденного перерыва, если бы дверь тихо не скрипнула, открывая нашим глазам секретаршу с декольте - Что Вы тут делаете? – ровно и весьма не вовремя спросила секретарша, тем самым притягивая весь гнев Медеи к своей персоне.Целуемся мы тут, разве не видишь, чучело огородное?! – со всей мощью своей харизмы рявкнула Медея на неё , бросив на нее яростные взгляды. Секретарша испуганно отступила назад, пытаясь оправдаться: - Простите, я не знала, что вы… Я просто должна была принести вам… - Тебе никто не разрешал входить без стука! - прервала ее Медея, все еще готовая наброситься на нее. Отчего бледную девушку тут же смыло ветром, а вселенский гнев тут же вернулся ко мне. - Это что ещё за красотка вокруг тебя ошивается? - спросила она, прожигая меня взглядом ревности и обиженной гарпии. - Секретарша моя , - с испугу раскололась я. Услышав это Медея задумалась а за тем игриво сказала, что пойдёт поговорит с ней, приказав мне подождать в кабинете. Выйдя из кабинета Медея направилась к секретарше, найдя её она тихо подошла и села к ней на стол, игриво улыбнувшись, поцеловала Секретаршу","output":"Она закрыла глаза и отдала себя этому поцелую, наслаждаясь полной свободой и запретным очарованием этой встречи. Но в этот момент я не мог больше себя сдерживать. Я встала и решительно пошла к ним, готовая застать на месте Медею и ее игры. - Что здесь происходит?! - рявкнула я, пытаясь сдержать обуревающую меня ярость. Медея подняла глаза, со злостью зажмуриваясь от яркого солнца, проникающего в кабинет. - Ничего, Тея, просто развлекаемся. А что, разве ты кому-то принадлежишь? Услышав эти слова, я почувствовала, как в сердце забилась боль, растерзывая его на части. Я резко повернулась и вышла из кабинета, проклиная себя за слабость и неверие, которые позволили мне оказаться в такой ситуации. И с этого дня, я поняла, что надо слушать свое сердце и доверять только себе, никому больше. Я стала сильнее и решительнее, готовая бороться за свою счастливую жизнь."},{"instruction":"I used this code: mark_price_data = client.ticker_price(symbol=symbol) mp = float(mark_price_data['price']) if 'price' in mark_price_data else 0.0 mark_price_data_change = client.ticker_24hr_price_change(symbol=symbol) mark_price_percent = float(mark_price_data_change['priceChangePercent']) if 'priceChangePercent' in mark_price_data_change else 0.0 # Retrieve depth data depth_data = client.depth(symbol=symbol) bids = depth_data['bids'] bid_prices = [float(bid[0]) for bid in bids] highest_bid_price = max(bid_prices) lowest_bid_price = min(bid_prices) b_h = highest_bid_price b_l = lowest_bid_price asks = depth_data['asks'] ask_prices = [float(ask[0]) for ask in asks] highest_ask_price = max(ask_prices) lowest_ask_price = min(ask_prices) s_h = highest_ask_price s_l = lowest_ask_price You need to give me code which will print me buy_lowest_price which not lower than mark_price + (mark_price / 100) and highest_sell_price which not higher than mark_price - (mark_price / 100)","output":"Here is the code that will print the buy_lowest_price and highest_sell_price based on your conditions: \`\`\` buy_lowest_price = 0 highest_sell_price = 0 if b_l >= mp + (mp / 100): buy_lowest_price = b_l if s_h <= mp - (mp / 100): highest_sell_price = s_h print(\\"Buy Lowest Price:\\", buy_lowest_price) print(\\"Highest Sell Price:\\", highest_sell_price) \`\`\` In this code, we check if the lowest bid price (b_l) is greater than or equal to the mark price (mp) plus 1% of the mark price.

If such a bid price is found, we set the buy_lowest_price variable to that bid price and exit the loop using the \`break\` statement. If no bid price satisfies the condition and buy_lowest_price remains as 0, we set it to the mark price plus 1% of the mark price. Finally, we print the value of buy_lowest_price."},{"instruction":"Проанализируй текст и придумай уникальный 100% релевантный SEO заголовок (h2 длиной не более 60 символов) для него: \\"Это предложение будет интересно не только для больших компаний, но и для кафе, столовых и других учреждений общественного питания, которые хотят предложить своим клиентам качественный десерт.

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, которые мне и пришлось отчаянно отгонять, для того, чтобы углубиться в работу. Разумеется, буквы в этих отчётах оказались мне знакомы, они даже складывались в весьма понятные мне слова, так как училась я действительно весьма недурно. Кто-то явно мухлевал, надеясь выбить большее финансирование, кто-то спустил задание на творческий «тяп-ляп», но куда более важным оказалось совсем другое. А точнее главное, в виде маленькой закорючечки, которую я должна была поставить под теми из них, с верностью которых была согласна. Я тихо сняла колпачок с необходимого предмета и совсем уже приготовилась писать, как тело неожиданно пробил тихий ужас, который вылился на меня в виде холодного пота, медленно стекающего по спине. «Посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис». И пушка у лица. Разнести и пушка. А вдруг я ошибаюсь в решении? Я отогнала руку, медленно тянущуюся к телефону, которая явно намеревалась спросить совета у друга без моего участия. Точнее не совсем у друга, а скорее даже у недруга, в виде самого виновника торжества, то бишь злосчастного мистера Кранца. И планомерно отказалась от этой идеи, ибо выказывать себя трусливой слабачкой в первый же день не имела ни малейшего желания. Так как не была уверена точно, что он не припечатает меня за это действие скорым разводом и поисками нового работника-мужа. А свою блондинку я любила. Поэтому вместо того, чтобы предаваться минутной слабости, я вновь попробовала сосредоточиться и изобразить это подобие подписи, на что дрожащая рука снова потянулась к треклятому телефону. Но уже не для звонка тестю, а просьбы помощи у матери, которая знала всё, имела похожую фирму и, наверно, сама отлично разбиралась в этом бизнесе. Но, как ни странно, чуда в виде ангела-хранителя с мамиными крылышками не случилось и на этот раз, так как когда я только набрала номер и услышала длинные гудки, в кабинет резко вбежала моя ненаглядная Медеечка, у которой, неизвестно почему, начался ранний обед. - Какой кошмар! – заключила она, красноречиво морща нос и продолжая весьма брезгливо осматриваться по сторонам. – У тебя кабинет больше моего. - Но это ненормально, - надула пухлые губы моя красавица. – Я же владелец фирмы, а ты всего лишь посаженный директор. На что я, униженная такими безапеляционными доводами, снова тяжко выдохнула и, не менее красноречиво разведя руками, философски выдохнула: - Жизнь несправедлива. Если тебе так тесно – устраивайся тут со мной. Наверное, этот творческий спор упрямых характеров мог продолжаться ещё долго, забирая вместе с собой и обоюдное возбуждение и мысли о конце обеденного перерыва, если бы дверь тихо не скрипнула, открывая нашим глазам секретаршу с декольте - Что Вы тут делаете? – ровно и весьма не вовремя спросила секретарша, тем самым притягивая весь гнев Медеи к своей персоне.Целуемся мы тут, разве не видишь, чучело огородное?! – со всей мощью своей харизмы рявкнула Медея на неё , бросив на нее яростные взгляды. Секретарша испуганно отступила назад, пытаясь оправдаться: - Простите, я не знала, что вы… Я просто должна была принести вам… - Тебе никто не разрешал входить без стука! - прервала ее Медея, все еще готовая наброситься на нее. Отчего бледную девушку тут же смыло ветром, а вселенский гнев тут же вернулся ко мне. - Это что ещё за красотка вокруг тебя ошивается? - спросила она, прожигая меня взглядом ревности и обиженной гарпии. - Секретарша моя , - с испугу раскололась я. Услышав это Медея задумалась а за тем игриво сказала, что пойдёт поговорит с ней, приказав мне подождать в кабинете. Выйдя из кабинета Медея направилась к секретарше, найдя её она тихо подошла и села к ней на стол, игриво улыбнувшись, посадив секретаршу на стол, стала целовать её, шептав на ухо","output":"сладкие слова, вызывая у нее мягкий стон. Их поцелуи стали все более страстными, а их руки начали двигаться по телу друг друга. Но внезапно Медея остановилась и отстранилась от секретарши. - Извини, но я не могу продолжать, - сказала Медея, покраснев и застыв на месте. - Почему? Я думала, ты хотела этого, - прошептала секретарша, смотря ей в глаза с жалостью. - Я... я уже замужем... - прошептала Медея, скрывая слезы. - Я люблю своего мужа. Секретарша молча смотрела на Медею, понимая, что она не может сдерживать свои чувства и сдает в конкуренции с ее мужем. - Мне жаль, - сказала секретарша, поправляя свою одежду. - Я не хотела никому причинять боль. - Спасибо. Я ценю это, - сказала Медея и поцеловала секретаршу на прощание. - Удачи вам, и найдите кого-то, кто будет настоящей для вас. Секретарша лишь кивнула и тихо вышла из кабинета. Медея осталась одна, склонившись над столом и плакавшая от смешанных эмоций. Она поняла, что ее любовь к своему мужу - сильнее, чем соблазн и страсть."},{"instruction":"Оптом или в розницу - выбор за вами.

You would then save the code above to a file with a \`.py\` extension, for example, \`fanf2_game.py\`. To run the game, you would open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your file is saved, and type: \`\`\`bash python fanf2_game.py \`\`\` This is a very simplified example. A full game would have a more complex story, more animatronics with their behaviors, and a proper end-game. Additionally, you could consider fleshing out the game logic, adding graphics, sound, or more complex decision-making to enhance the gameplay. For a complete game, you could use game development libraries like Pygame or even engines such as Unity or Godot, but since these go beyond a simple text-based game, I have not included them in this example."},{"instruction":"The FNAF Fanon Wiki EXPLORE WELCOME TO FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA BACKSTAGE FANDOM FAN CENTRAL BETA GAMES ANIME MOVIES TV VIDEO WIKIS START A WIKI ADVERTISEMENT SIGN IN REGISTER The FNAF Fanon Wiki W.I.P. 290 PAGES EXPLORE WELCOME TO FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA BACKSTAGE in: Other, Dont die, Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and 3 more Strategies & Tactics (FNaF 1) 89 SIGN IN TO EDIT Contents 1 Surviving the 1st Night 2 Surviving the other nights 3 Golden Freddy 4 Survive Jammed Doors 5 Freddy Fazbear 6 Foxy The Pirate Fox Surviving the 1st Night For the first night, the threat is very small. Only Bonnie will be a decent threat, Chica generally won't get to the office in time, and Golden Freddy can still appear (but this is very rare and can only happen by looking at the west hall camera when a poster of his face is on the wall). On this night, Foxy is incredibly unlikely to come out of Pirate's Cove unless you don't check the cameras AT ALL. Freddy will not come off the stage on this night or the second night, so Freddy is not a threat unless you run out of power. Bonnie and Chica can check on easily through the left and right door lights, leaving around a few seconds between each check. If you spot either one at their respective doors (Bonnie on the left, Chica on the right) you should IMMEDIATELY close the appropriate door. If they're at the door for a few seconds before you close it, both the lights and door buttons will not work. If this happens, then do not bring up the security feed through the monitor: if you do that, then they will kill you once you lower it. Bonnie and Chica are also known to force the monitor down from the screen as well. If Golden Freddy is summoned, then you should immediately bring up the monitor to de-spawn him. Once an animatronic appears and you have closed the door in front of them, then check the door lights before opening the door back up. If Bonnie is behind the left door, then Bonnie's shadow will block the normal path of the light. Once this shadow is gone, then Bonnie will be gone too. If Chica is behind the right door, then turning on the light will display a wide-eyed Chica, gazing in on you. Chica will be gone if you turn on the light and she is no longer there. This night is the easiest out of them all (with the exception of the custom night), so exploration should be done during this night if the player wants to by checking the rooms with the monitor. On this night you should start by: - Waiting until the initial call is over. - Checking the show stage. - If any animatronics have moved, then locate them, starting with the cameras closest to you. - Once Bonnie/Chica is in either the East or West halls, then lower the monitor and continue to use the door lights until you find them. You may need to wait a minute until they show up. - If you close the door on an animatronic, then check with the door lights to see if they are there and reopen the door if they are not. - If any buttons are not working, then do not raise the monitor on the screen: once you lower it after doing so, you will be killed by either Chica or Bonnie. To be noted, Golden Freddy is an unreliable and unpredictable character. He may appear at random and when he does it is recommended to open up the security camera. The other way to summon him is to look at the poster on the wall. It will go from a normal picture of Freddy to a distorted Freddy to Golden Freddy. It is believed that he hides in the kitchen, thus the rasping noise. - The easiest method to survive Night 1 - There is a very easy way to survive Night 1 every single time you attempt it: close the left door at 2 AM and keep it shut. Don't do anything else and you're through. - How/Why does it work? - Everyone is deactivated for the first 2 hours. Bonnie activates at 2 AM and Chica activates at 3 AM. Keep that in mind. Surviving the other nights - Wait in the beginning of the game! The characters will not pursue you for some time. Rather than checking the camera feed immediately, it is best to just relax for a moment. This will conserve power for later on when it is actually necessary. It is good to wait until the 'end call' option pops up at the top left of the screen. Then, access the camera feed and watch out for those characters! However, be careful. Depending on how long you wait and what night you are on, Foxy may be able run to you and kill you before you drop down to 90% power. - Stay calm! The more afraid you are, the worse you will do. If you are constantly scared, you will not think as rationally and may use more power than necessary. If you want to make the game less scary, it is best to play with the lights in your room on, the volume set to low and to imagine that they are going to hug you instead of killing you. - Know your enemies! Go to the other pages on this wiki to learn more about each character and how to deal with them. Bonnie is fast and aggressive, but easy to detect and stop. Bonnie only comes to you from your left side. Chica is slower than Bonnie and less aggressive. Chica is easy to detect and stop and only comes to you from your right side. Foxy is extremely fast and extremely aggressive when he leaves his post (the Pirate's Cove). He only comes to you from your left side. The less you look at the camera, the faster Foxy leaves his post. When you see that he is gone, immediately close your left door. Freddy is extremely aggressive, but slow. He takes his time to get to you, as he doesn't like to be seen. He can be heard when he is in the kitchen, as the music you hear when your power runs out plays when he is in the area. He mostly comes to your right side. These are the basics for each character. Check the actual character pages to learn more. - Be quick! The faster you are at flicking the lights on and off, closing the doors and viewing the camera feed, the less power you waste. - Know when to restart! If you are at 60% power and it's not even 2 AM, it would be best to restart. Set markers for yourself. It is good to get to 1 AM before the power reaches 83%. It is good to get to 2 AM before it reaches 66%. It is good to get to 3 AM before it reaches 50%. It is good to get to 4 AM before it reaches 33%. It is good to get to 5 AM before it reaches 16%. If you go past your marker, then just restart to save yourself time and effort. -Bonus tip: If you want to check cameras, and you don’t want to die from Freddy, just close right door and then check cameras (Or if you want to check Foxy), and when you leave cameras, open right door. Do this once again when you want to check cameras.(Also to stop Foxy you don't necessarily need to check CAM 1C, it's been proven that other cameras stop him just so long as you keep checking them) Golden Freddy Fredbear (better known as Golden Freddy) is a mystery/Easter egg. How to survive him is simple. When you see Golden Freddy's poster colored in the West Hall Corner (camera 2B), and you put down the camera he will appear. When he does, just go back into camera again and he will be gone. He has a 1 in 100,000 chance (rolled every second) whenever you click on cam 2B to appear. He can only appear once per night. It was once thought that another way to avoid summoning Golden Freddy was to switch cameras once you saw the poster after it was colored. However, this theory has been proven false. Golden Freddy can even enter your room if both doors are closed by the time you see his poster on the wall. He can't appear in any other way in normal gameplay - however, he does jumpscare you if you put the AI. Levels to 1/9/8/7 in the Night 7/Custom Night setting (PC v1.13 and above) and will crash (PC/Mobile) your game or go back (console ports) to the menu. Survive Jammed Doors You have no way to avoid being killed by Bonnie and Chica when they disable the doors. When you notice the doors are jammed, do NOT put up your monitor. Doing this will result in certain death, unless you are close enough to 6AM before the animatronic attacks you. If you lift up the monitor and they are in, they force you out of the camera and kill you after 30 seconds if you haven't put down the monitor before that. Bonnie and Chica will only attempt to attack you if you raise your monitor, so keep it down when your door is jammed. This also helps you conserve power as you won't be using your monitor. If Foxy is a threat that night and your right door is jammed, shut the left door and continue looking at the right, as Freddy will only attack you if you look away from his point of entrance. If your left door is jammed, the only thing you can do is shut the right door and, if you're close enough, wait it out until 6AM, but Foxy may catch you on the later nights. Freddy Fazbear Freddy Fazbear is the main animatronic character in the game, but unlike Bonnie and Chica, he has an exact pattern. However, this pattern is a path, as it will not occur throughout a similar time length. Freddy starts in the Show Stage with Bonnie and Chica, next he will go to the Dining Area, then he will go to the Restrooms, after that he will be in the kitchen. But remember, the kitchen cam is audio only, so you will hear Freddy's jingle playing while he is in the kitchen. Next he will skip the east hall and will be in the room to the right of your door. If you see him on the cam, close the right door IMMEDIATELY. If the right door is closed, Freddy will soon move to another room and continue the pattern. Things to Remember: Whenever Freddy moves to another room you will hear Demonic Laughter. If Freddy is in the room next to your right door when it's closed and you hear demonic laughter, you are free to open the door. However, if Freddy is next to the right door when it's open and you hear demonic laughter, Freddy is now in your office and will soon kill you. Whenever Freddy is in a room, only two white dots that are his eyes will be visible of him, minus the kitchen cam. However when Freddy is in the kitchen, then you will hear his music box (same as when you run out of power). Freddy will not move from his original spot on the Show Stage until Night 3, so you won't have to worry about him until then. Unlike Bonnie and Chica, Freddy does NOT appear in the blindspot so when he appears in CAM 4B, you MUST shut the door to avoid him getting in Foxy The Pirate Fox Foxy generally becomes active on night two, but it is possible for him to be active on night one, though it will only happen if you don't check the cameras at all. Foxy follows a set pattern before reaching the office. First, he will open the curtains of his Pirate Cove, revealing his face and upper body. Then, he will be standing outside of the curtains, his head back and arm raised, preparing to run towards the Office. His features will be barely visible during this frame. Then, he will not be seen in the Pirate Cove, and if you view the West Hall on the camera feed when he has left, you will see him running down the hallway. When this happens, you will have about 1-2 seconds to close the left door. Otherwise, Foxy will attack you. If you see that Foxy is missing, you should IMMEDIATELY lower your monitor and close the left door. Then, to trigger Foxy, just re-open the camera and check the West Hall. Foxy will not be triggered to run to the Office unless you do so. Once the has reached the office and the door is closed, he will bang on the door a few times, then return to the Pirate Cove to repeat this cycle. A simple strategy is to wait until Foxy is out of Pirate Cove and block him with the door. However, Foxy will steal some of your power each time he is blocked by your left door. The first time, Foxy will drain 1% of your power the first time, 7% the second, and increasing by 6% for each time he is blocked. While you can probably get away with this strategy on nights 1 and 2, Foxy becomes much more active from night 3 and onward. Without the right strategy, your power is going to PLUMMET, and you will soon black out and Freddy will hit you from your right door. A much better strategy(and one you should start practicing on night 2) is to check on a camera every few seconds when you get the chance(make sure that Bonnie or Chica aren't peering through your doorway). **IMPORTANT** You actually don't need to check on Pirate Cove. ANY CAMERA WILL DO. It has been proven that camera usage, just not checking on Pirate Cove, stops Foxy. With this information, you can use cameras to check on the other animatronics (mainly Freddy: visit the Freddy page for more info). Beginning on night 2, it would be best to check on the Pirate Cove about 3 or 4 times an hour. Otherwise Foxy will become active and start his pattern to the Office. The more you check on Pirate Cove, the slower Foxy will leave. After night 2, you should consecutively check on cameras every few seconds. remember, it doesn't matter which camera you check, only that you are checking a camera. Unlike the other animatronics, Foxy is more photogenic, and will only move if you do not check on him enough. Visit the animatronic AI page for more info.

However, the passage seems somewhat disorganized and includes prompts and elements from a web interface, such as navigation options and site categories. If you are looking to create a fan game based on FNAF, incorporation of elements from the lore and canon strategies can be a good way to make the game feel authentic and engaging for fans. Keep in mind when creating fan content, you should respect the intellectual property rights of the original creators and avoid infringing on copyrighted material. To craft a text-based game using this information, you might want to organize it in a way that can be interacted with by a player through a text interface. You would script scenarios based on the strategies provided, allowing players to make choices (e.g., checking cameras, closing doors, managing power) and then calculating the outcomes based on probabilities that mirror the mechanics explained here. You should also design the game flow so that the player has clear instructions, objectives, and feedback based on their decisions. Games based on FNAF often revolve around tense decision-making and resource management, which you can simulate even in a text-based format. Creating a full game using all the information you've pasted would be a complex endeavor and would require thoughtful programming and game design to ensure it is enjoyable and functional. Remember also that game development, whether fan-based or original, is not just about porting over content; it's about creating an experience that is interactive, immersive, and entertaining.

Here, you will find some of the best strategies for beating the game. This guide will cover the PC version only. The mobile version is not included because I don't own it. It has different mechanics from the PC version, the most obvious difference being the shorter duration of the nights. Most of the screenshots in this guide are provided by me. The only ones that aren't are the picture of the guide and two of the Golden Freddy pictures (I couldn't get him to show up). Now, let's begin. The Mechanics The game's mechanics are simple to learn. You can't fight the animatronics, but you can ward them off. Your tools for that are the monitor, the doors, the hall lights, the power indicator, the clock, and a pair of good ears. The game requires a mouse to play. The mouse is responsible for all inputs in the game, from controlling the player's view to using the door controls to checking the cameras. To pan to the left side of the office, move the mouse towards the left of the screen. To pan to the right, move the mouse to the right. The monitor is used to watch the animatronics' movements throughout the restaurant. It can also be used to prevent Freddy and Foxy from moving. To activate the monitor, simply scroll down to the giant rectangle with the double arrows at the bottom of the screen. The monitor will then pull up. Now, you have access to all the cameras in the building. You'll see a mini-map of the entire building on the right side of the monitor screen. This map has clickable boxes that represent the camera feeds of all the rooms. The camera feeds are labeled with numbers and letters, and the monitor will display the name of the currently selected camera feed at the top of the map. To view any of these camera feeds, simply click on the one you want to see. You can switch to a different camera feed at any time. When you're done using the monitor, scroll down to the double arrows at the bottom of the screen again to put it away. Now, you're back in full view of the office. The left and right hall lights are used to check for Bonnie and Chica when they try to enter the office from the doorways. These doorways are also known as your blind spots because the camera can't see those areas. Thus, you can't get away with simply checking the cameras; you must also use the hall lights. The reverse also applies. This is the left hall light: Use it to spot Bonnie when he appears. This is the right hall light: Use it to spot Chica when she appears. To use a hall light, scroll over to the appropriate light button and click on it. Both the light button and the doorway will light up. To turn off the hall light, just click on the button again. The hall lights must be used whenever you can't find Bonnie and Chica in the cameras, whenever they cause the cameras to go out while they move, or whenever they make footstep sounds. This is important for avoiding deaths. Anyway, you can only use one hall light at a time. Using one light while the other light is on will automatically shut off the first light you used. Sometimes, the lights may not turn off after you've clicked on them. This is because there's a bit of a delay. To remedy this, you can do one of two things: Wait about a half-second before turning the lights off. Open the monitor. Bringing up the monitor will instantly turn off either light. This is a useful maneuver for the later nights where you need to be faster with your tools. Foxy and Freddy CANNOT be checked with the hall light. The hall lights are only effective against Bonnie and Chica. The left and right doors are the only way to prevent any animatronic from entering the office once it has the chance to strike. Here is the left door: Use it to protect yourself from Foxy and Bonnie. Here is the right door: Use it to protect yourself from Freddy and Chica. To use the doors, simply mouse over to the door buttons and click on them. The buttons will turn green, and the doors will drop. To deactivate the doors, click on the door buttons again. The buttons will change back to red, and the doors will rise. Unlike the hall lights, both doors can be used at the same time. Fail to close the doors at the right time, and it's game over. This will be explained in more depth in each of the animatronic sections. Your ears must be used to listen to certain in-game sounds that will warn you of approaching animatronics. The only animatronic that completely bypasses this mechanic is Foxy. This will be further explained in the sections about the animatronics. The clock is found in the upper right side of the screen. This thing tells you the time and number of the current night. The clock will start from 12AM and will go all the way up to 6AM. Use this to keep track of what you should be doing at certain times of the night. The monitor, hall lights, and doors all use up power. How much power you're using is displayed by the power indicator at the bottom left side of the screen. Using no tools will use up only one bar of power. Using one tool will use up two bars of power. Using two tools will use up three bars of power. Using three tools will use up four bars of power. The left and right doors are separate tools. The same goes for the hall lights. Along with the monitor, that makes five tools to use at your disposal, but you can only use up to three of them at a time. Once the power hits 0%, all the tools that you can use to protect yourself will disappear from the screen, and you will be unable to use any of them. If the monitor is already up when the power goes out, it will drop and stay down. If either hall light is on, it will turn off automatically. If the doors are closed, they will suddenly open. The only things on at this point are the emergency lights: Then, only one animatronic will use this opportunity to kill you: Freddy. Freddy will commence his final attack after a short period of time. This will be explained further in the \\"Freddy\\" section. However, the clock will still run after the power goes out, so not all is lost when there's no power. In any case, practice with the mechanics during the first two hours of Night 1, and you'll quickly understand how to play the game. The Objective of the Game The goal of the game is to last from 12AM to 6AM for each night, which, in real time, corresponds to exactly 9 minutes [11]. Each in-game hour is 90 seconds [11]. Once 6AM hits, a chime will be heard, the screen will turn black, and the clock will be in the center of the screen, changing from 5AM to 6AM, like this: The trick of the game is NOT to use up too much power before 6AM hits. If you use up the power too early, Freddy will kill you. Newer players may frantically and profusely check the cameras, use the hall lights, and close the doors, wasting a lot of power. You must use your tools as sparingly as you can. However, if you run out of power, you can still make it to 6AM. This is because the clock still runs even after the power goes out. Thus, it is entirely possible, though not guaranteed, to reach 6AM before Freddy has the chance to do his final attack. As the nights progress, the animatronics will get faster and more aggressive. As a result, there is no point in checking all the cameras to monitor all the animatronics, especially past Night 2. Just use the cameras for only Freddy and Foxy while using the hall lights for Bonnie and Chica. This tactic will be explained in more depth in the \\"General Strategies\\" section. The Animatronics Now, I will explain each animatronic in full detail. They are very easy to understand and counter. I will post the mechanics of each character in separate sections. Before you read those sections, here's a picture of the whole animatronic family (without Golden Freddy): If you get caught by one of them, you'll get their jumpscare screen. Next, you'll get some static, like this: ...and then, you'll get a GAME OVER screen, where you get stuffed inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Here's the picture: On the other hand, with Golden Freddy, you'll only get his jumpscare screen, and then he'll crash the game. To learn how to prevent any of this from happening, keep reading. Bonnie The fastest animatronic. He will only show up at the left door. Bonnie's movement path is much less linear than Chica's path, so he'll often jump to a room that's disconnected from another room. This makes Bonnie seem as if he's teleporting. Also, Bonnie has certain choices for his next destination depending on his current room, but his choices are very random, so he doesn't have a set path. Still, Bonnie will always start from the show stage (Cam 1A). Once he leaves the show stage, he will never return there. He will then move only in the other rooms on the left side of the map, which includes Cam 1B but excludes Cam 1C (Pirate Cove). He will never show up anywhere else. Because Bonnie is very fast, he shows up at the office more often than the other animatronics. When he appears, he will stare right into the office from the left door. To prepare yourself for him, listen for “pit-pat” footstep sounds. These could be either Bonnie's footsteps or Chica's footsteps, so you must check BOTH hall lights. If Bonnie is in the left hall light, like so... ...drop the door immediately. You only have a few seconds to react, and if you don’t close the door in time, Bonnie will jam the door and enter your office. You will also be unable to use the door to protect yourself from Foxy, and the light switch will not work. Additionally, different sound effects will play when the light and door buttons are pressed. Before using the monitors again, once Bonnie shows up at the door, check the other door as a precaution. It is not that uncommon (though not that frequent, either) to have both Bonnie and Chica attacking at the same time. Bonnie can even show up at the door (and make pit-pat sounds) while you're using the cameras. If that happens, drop the camera and check both hall lights immediately. Sadly, you may not always be able to hear these footsteps. Thus, you'll want to avoid taking too long on the cameras while the doors are open. If Bonnie jams your door, he will only attack if the player uses the monitor and puts it back down. Once the monitor is up, Bonnie will make groaning sounds. If the player takes too long putting the monitor back down, Bonnie will pull it down himself. Here's what you'll get if you put up and put down the monitor while Bonnie's in the office: Game Over. However, if you're close to 6AM, and Bonnie jams your door, you may still make it through the night if Foxy doesn't use this opportunity to attack. Just do NOT flip up the monitor. You don't need to worry about the right door. Freddy can't come in if the player is not using the monitor, and when Chica jams the door, she works the exact same way as Bonnie. If the monitor is already put up after Bonnie has jammed the door, just keep it up for as long as possible and ignore the groaning sounds. Hopefully, 6AM hits before he forces the monitor down. These desperation tactics are not guaranteed to work, but they can help. But, if you're too far away from 6AM, either let Bonnie kill you or just restart the game. Hopefully, your next try will be more successful. If the door is closed in time, however, do not open it until Bonnie leaves, or you’ll risk allowing him to jam the door. To see if he has left, look for a large, rabbit-shaped shadow in the left hallway against the wall when the light is used. If there is no shadow, like so... ...then Bonnie has left, and you can open the door. He will also make footsteps when he leaves, but remember--check the hall light before opening the door. Again, the footstep sounds you hear may not always be Bonnie’s footsteps; they may also be Chica’s footsteps. As a precaution, check the other door after Bonnie has left. Upon a successful counter with the left door, Bonnie will always return to the Dining Area [12]. Then, he will try to make his way to the door again. If you’re looking at the cameras, and Bonnie’s in a room, he causes the cameras to temporarily go offline and emit static sounds whenever he moves to a different location. The camera feed will go back to normal a few seconds later. Phone Guy says on Night 1 that you should always check the door lights whenever the cameras go offline, but that isn't necessary. Bonnie will only \\"jump\\" to the left doorway from either the Supply Closet or the West Hall Corner [12]. He can't jump to the doorway from any other location. Moreover, as I've said in a different section, you won't have time to check all the cameras past Night 2, so Bonnie can't catch you off-guard on the cameras. Still, you can check the doorway whenever the cameras go out if you want to feel safe. If the cameras go out while Bonnie's in the room, drop the monitor and check the left hall light immediately. To be extra safe, check BOTH hall lights whenever the camera feed goes out. If you hear warbled robotic sounds outside the office, then that means that Bonnie or Chica is nearby. If you view Bonnie in Cam 2B or Chica in Cam 4B, these sounds can be heard more clearly. Also, you will see both animatronics twitch. This can only happen in Night 4 and above and will occur randomly [8]. You can use the warbled robotic sounds to help warn you of Bonnie and Chica, but do NOT rely solely on them to decide when to check the hall lights. There's one more thing that I must mention. If Bonnie still manages to jumpscare you, his jumpscare can be interrupted once the power goes out. Then, he'll disappear. However, you'll still get a game over. Fortunately, Bonnie's jumpscare can also be interrupted if the clock hits 6AM, and this time, you'll survive. Again, try to make it to 6AM if Bonnie attempts to kill you. Chica The least aggressive animatronic. She will only show up at the right door. Chica generally takes longer to get to the door than Bonnie does, but her AI is actually higher than Bonnie's AI on Nights 3-6. Night 2 is the only exception [11]. This programming is most likely to compensate for Chica's slower movement. Also, Chica can actually skip cameras like Bonnie, but her path is much more linear, giving the player the illusion that she doesn't skip cameras. Moreover, Chica tends to attack at much less consistent intervals than Bonnie. This is because unlike Bonnie, Chica doesn't go all the way back to the beginning after being blocked at the right door. She goes to the East Hall instead. From there, she can choose to go back to the Dining Area or to the right door again through the East Hall Corner. Much like Bonnie, Chica's choices in her path are entirely random. She will always start in the Show Stage (Cam 1A) and will never return there once she has left the area. Unlike Bonnie, she will move around only in the rooms on the right side of the map, as well as Cam 1B. She will never show up anywhere else. Additionally, Chica moves through the same rooms as Freddy. If Chica's right next to the office, and if the right hall light is used, she will stare into your office from the hallway window, not from the door, like this: Other than that, she works the exact same way as Bonnie. Listen for footsteps, check BOTH hall lights, and drop the door if Chica’s in the hallway. Again, check the hall light before you open the door. If she has left, then you won’t see her through the window anymore when you check the right hall light, like this: Before using the monitors again, check the other door once Chica has left to make sure that Bonnie isn't there, too. Remember--much like Bonnie, Chica can appear at your door while you're using the cameras. Again, it's possible to hear footsteps while using the cameras, but you may not always be able to do so, so don't take too long on the cameras. Once Chica shows up at the door, check the other door as a precaution. Again, it is not that uncommon to have both Bonnie and Chica attacking at the same time. If you fail to close the door at the right time and if you use the monitor afterwards, Chica will want to greet you, like this: Game Over. When Chica jams the door, it's not as bad as when Bonnie jams the door, especially if you're close to 6AM. Unlike Foxy, Freddy can't walk into the office while the monitor is down. At this point, all you need to do is not to use the monitor. You will need to close the left door, however, as Foxy may attack you. Anyway, you can hear Chica when she’s in the kitchen as she will make noises with pots and pans. The kitchen is two rooms away from the East Hall Corner, so Chica can’t attack you from here. Thus, you don’t need to check on the right light when she can be heard in the kitchen. However, once the noise stops, you must resume checking the right hall light. Chica can also disable the camera feed when she moves, but again, checking the door every time this happens is not necessary. Like Bonnie, Chica will only jump to the door from certain rooms. Unlike Bonnie, Chica will only attack from one place: the East Hall Corner. In other words, you only need to check the right door if Chica is in Camera 4B and causes the camera to emit static. Still, if you want to feel extra safe, drop the monitor and check the right hall light whenever Chica disables the camera. Check BOTH hall lights to be really safe. Much like Bonnie, if you hear groaning sounds while viewing the monitor, then Chica is in the office, and you’re dead. You can try to keep the monitor up if this occurs, but like Bonnie, Chica will eventually pull it down. Much like Bonnie's jumpscare, Chica's jumpscare can't be interrupted by a power outage, so try not to run out of power when she's about to attack. Foxy A peculiar animatronic. Surprisingly not as unpredictable as he seems, despite what many people think. Foxy spends most of his time in Pirate Cove (Cam 1C). However, he can come out and attack if the player isn’t watching him regularly. If this happens, Foxy will run down the West Hall (Cam 2A) and will barge into the office through the left door. If the left door is open when he does this, he will jumpscare you, like so... ...and it’ll be game over. Phone Guy says that checking on Foxy with the monitor regularly will slow him down, but that is also not necessary. You don't need to check on Pirate Cove (Cam 1C) specifically to \\"stun\\" Foxy; you can use any camera to stun him. This is because Foxy CANNOT move while the monitor is up unless he's already left Pirate Cove. Still, you’ll obviously need to use Cam 1C from time to time to check on Foxy. After all, you won’t be spending all your time on the camera, so Foxy may take that opportunity to ready himself for an attack. The trick is not to go TOO long without using the monitor. If you do, Foxy will be more likely to strike. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, you can’t really check on Foxy too much, only too little [8][10]. Foxy will not come out more often if you spam the cameras or have the monitor up for a long time, regardless of his AI level. Sadly, Foxy may still attack even if you try to watch him correctly. To better explain Foxy, I need to explain his movement patterns. He has four stages, which are analogous to his four stages in FNAF4. Here they are: Stage 1 - Foxy is fully hidden behind the curtains in Pirate Cove. He can’t attack at all in this stage. Stage 2 - Foxy is partially hidden behind the curtains but peeks out of them, leaving his face and some other parts of his body visible. He still can’t attack in this stage. Stage 3 - Foxy is completely out of the curtains. In front of Pirate Cove, he will appear on the left side of the camera in a stance that indicates that he’s ready to run. Also, his head will be tilted to the player’s right. Moreover, the curtains will be somewhat open. Foxy still can’t attack in this stage but is getting ready to do so. Stage 4 - Foxy has left the area and is heading towards the office via the West Hall. The curtains are completely open, with the sign for Pirate Cove right in the middle. In the first three stages, this sign will say “Sorry, out of order.” The final stage will also have this sign normally: However, in the final stage only, this sign will occasionally say “IT’S ME” instead: Foxy may sometimes skip the first stage and go right to the second stage after returning to Pirate Cove, so watch out for that. A guideline that I use for checking on Foxy is this: I check on him sometimes when he's in Stage 1 or Stage 2, and then I check on him more often when he's in Stage 3. This method often works for me, even in 4/20 mode. Once you see that Foxy has left Pirate Cove, you must act quickly, for you have a very limited time before he kills you. You can do one of two things: Drop the monitor and close the left door immediately. Do not change cameras, or you will waste time. Also, you must avoid changing to Cam 2A, or you’ll trigger Foxy’s running animation too soon. When the door is closed, then you can switch to Cam 2A to trigger Foxy’s running animation (if he hasn’t reached the door already) so that he attacks sooner and goes back to Pirate Cove. Change the camera to Cam 2A to trigger Foxy’s sprint. Then, immediately close the left door. Again, do not change cameras once Foxy sprints, or you will waste time. Either method will protect you from Foxy. Method 1 is much safer, but method 2 drains a little less power. It’s your call. For those who don't understand this strategy, we look at Cam 2A to trigger Foxy's running animation early, so that we can open the left door sooner and waste less power. Foxy will take a longer time to attack if he isn't triggered in Cam 2A, and if you don't close the left door soon, he will burst into the room without warning. Once Foxy makes it to your office, and the left door is closed, you will hear four bangs. Once those bangs have subsided, Foxy has returned to Pirate Cove. You only need to open the door after the first bang; the other bangs are irrelevant. Do this to save a bit of power and to quickly get back to whatever you were doing. After Foxy leaves, remember to check for Bonnie before you open the door. He can appear while Foxy attacks. Foxy will steal some of your power every time he bangs on the door. Foxy starts out with 1% power and adds 5% every time after that. In other words, he'll steal 1% power the first time, 6% power the second time, 11% power the third time, etc. In any case, you do NOT want Foxy to attack more than twice. Allowing only one attack or even no attacks is better. If Foxy attacks too many times, just restart the night. Interestingly, Foxy's jumpscare can be interrupted by a power outage, and the game will not end. It even happened to Markiplier at one point. You would have to be precise for that to happen, though. One final note: you may hear Foxy singing from time to time, and you can hear this more clearly in Cam 1C. Ignore this because it means nothing, though it can serve as a useful reminder to check on Foxy. Freddy - Part 1 If you want a TL;DR on the Freddy sections, skip to the bottom of the last section. The most elusive animatronic. Ironically, he's also the most predictable. Unlike Bonnie and Chica, Freddy follows a set path. Much like Chica, Freddy travels through the right side of the map, but unlike Chica (and Bonnie), he does NOT backtrack or wander around. In other words, he heads straight to your office without turning back once. Freddy follows this path: Show Stage (Cam 1A). He ALWAYS leaves after Bonnie and Chica leave. Freddy will often look like this: ...but only when he's alone, he may look at the camera sometimes, like this: Dining Area (Cam 1B). He's not that hard to spot here. Restrooms (Cam 7). He's even easier to spot here. Kitchen (Cam 6). This camera is audio only, so you can't see anything. I decided to show this camera feed anyway so that newer players know what it looks like. East Hall (Cam 4A). Probably the hardest camera to spot Freddy in. East Hall Corner (Cam 4B). He's impossible to miss here as he will stare right into the camera. The Office. Once he makes it here, it's game over. Here's his jumpscare screen: Notice how Freddy's eyes don't light up in his regular jumpscare. However, in his other jumpscare during a power outage, his eyes do light up. Anyway, Freddy will appear in these same places every single time. Note how he tends to favor dark spots, though his eyes will still be visible. However, he CANNOT be seen if Bonnie or Chica are in the same room. He'll be there, but his image will be \\"covered\\" by the images of Bonnie and Chica. Once Bonnie and Chica leave the room, Freddy will be seen again. The game should have mentioned this fact, but it did not, so don't be confused by Freddy's apparent disappearances. I should mention one other thing. Unlike Chica, Freddy \\"skips\\" the right blind spot before entering the office, so he can't be seen before he attacks. This gives him the illusion of teleporting or busting through locked doors. He can't do that; only Golden Freddy can. In any case, this means that once Freddy is in Cam 4B, he is only one step away from killing you. You must be careful once he gets that close. Moving on, Freddy lets out a single series of laughs and makes running footsteps every time he moves to a different room, and these sounds get louder as he gets closer. You can use the number of laughs to pinpoint Freddy’s location. For example, if Freddy has left the show stage, he will have laughed only once. Once Freddy has reached the East Hall Corner, he will have let out five laughs. If he laughs six times, then he got into the office, and you’re dead after a few seconds. However, Freddy may not always let out the right amount of laughs that corresponds to his location. This may happen because other in-game sounds may make it hard to hear Freddy’s laugh or because Freddy may move too quickly. A level 20 Freddy can seemingly enter Cam 4B in under 5 laughs. Still, your ears (and the monitor) are the best weapon against Freddy. Thus, I recommend listening to the volume of the laughs along with the current number of them. If the laugh is pretty loud, and the number of total laughs is at least three, then Freddy might be in Cam 4B, assuming that you didn’t let him into the office. Additionally, once Freddy’s in the kitchen, he will play his music that he normally plays when the power goes out. When you hear that music, you don’t need to worry about him just yet because he’s two rooms away from the East Hall Corner. That, and if Chica's also in the kitchen, you will hear her banging the pots and pans, too. Freddy - Part 2 Now, let’s discuss how Freddy moves. If Freddy's not at Cam 4B, he will only move when the monitor is down. However, using the monitor to look at him will halt his movements. Also, Freddy will not move if Bonnie and Chica enter or leave a room. The only exception to these rules is the Show Stage. Freddy can't move from the Show Stage unless both Bonnie and Chica leave first, but once they leave, Freddy may or may not move while the monitor is still up. Fortunately, that room is the furthest room from the office, so this isn't a problem. Still, you can exploit Freddy's movement patterns. Since Freddy doesn't move when the monitor is focused on him, you can lock him at any camera you want. This is great because Foxy is stunned whenever you use the monitor on any camera, not just Pirate Cove's camera, so periodically spamming the monitor on one camera will effectively slow down both Foxy and Freddy. Once Freddy gets to Cam 4B, things change a bit. There are four situations that can occur when Freddy reaches Cam 4B: You have the monitor down. You have the monitor up and on Cam 4B. You have the monitor up and on any cam except Cam 4B. The right door is not closed. You have the monitor up and on any cam except Cam 4B. The right door is closed. Freddy can only attack you in situation #3. This makes sense because this situation is the only position where the night guard CANNOT see Freddy or block him with the door. In any other situation, Freddy can't attack him, so closing the right door is not needed. In short, the game wants you either to watch him closely or to protect yourself if you can’t keep an eye on him. To reiterate, close the right door before using the monitor only when you're viewing (or switching to) any camera other than Cam 4B. When you're done using the monitor after looking at a different camera, open the right door after selecting Cam 4B and putting the monitor down. Furthermore, because Freddy can't walk in if you're not using the cameras, you can idle in the office without touching the right door if you're running low on power. It doesn't matter if Chica jams the door. Just do NOT pull up the monitor. However, be sure to close the left door if you feel that Foxy may attack...unless Bonnie jams the door beforehand. Just hope for best if this happens. You can actually get Freddy to leave Cam 4B, but he'll only go to the previous room (Cam 4A). Freddy will move back to Cam 4A while laughing if you're using the monitor on another camera and when the right door is closed (in other words, if situation #4 applies). However, because Freddy will always head right for the office, he'll just come right back to Cam 4B if you don't keep him at Cam 4A. In my opinion, it's best to just let Freddy stay at Cam 4B to avoid wasting power. Now, if you don't know where Freddy is, but you're sure that he's not in the office, close the right door BEFORE using the cameras and look for him right away. If Chica's in Cam 4B, and you can't find Freddy anywhere else, assume that he's in Cam 4B either until Chica leaves or until he laughs. Freddy - Part 3 Once Freddy makes it into the office, he will kill you after a short period of time if you have the monitor down. The time that he takes to kill you is completely random [12]. However, if you put the monitor up before Freddy has the chance to attack you, he will not be able to kill you. Unlike the other three animatronics, Freddy CANNOT pull the monitor down. Instead, he'll just wait until you put the monitor down yourself before killing you. Also, if he manages to jumpscare you, you can't put the monitor back up because he'll just force it down. The same applies to Foxy. I didn't know this before, but thanks to someone on YouTube, I now know one important fact. When Freddy gets into your office, he has a 25% chance to kill you every single second [14]. Again, this is halted whenever the monitor is up. Putting the monitor back down will continue but not reset the attack timer. This timer has no upper bound, so Freddy can attack you in a single second or never. It depends on how lucky you are. That being said, most people seem to get killed by Freddy within ten seconds or so. There is one error in reference 14. On line 2 where the page says \\"if \\"viewing\\" = 0 (if freddy is not viewed on any camera),\\" it should say, \\"if \\"viewing\\" = 0 (if the monitor is not up).\\" This line in the coding means that Freddy's attack timer comes into play ONLY when the monitor is not up, which is in accordance with what I said three paragraphs ago. Now, let's discuss what Freddy does when the power goes out. Stage 1 First, the emergency lights will turn on, like this: Next, Freddy will come to the office through the West Hall (while making footsteps). Stage 2 Freddy will then play his music while his eyes repeatedly light up. Sometimes, Freddy will immediately start playing his music after the power goes out. Stage 3 Freddy will stop playing his song, and the emergency lights will go out, leaving you in total darkness. At this point, the only thing you can see are the outlines of the doorways. Freddy will then look around for the night guard while making footsteps. After a short period of time, Freddy will then attack the night guard, ending the game. Sometimes, Freddy will attack right after the emergency lights go out. Sadly, the only way to avoid Freddy's final jumpscare is to reach to 6AM before the jumpscare occurs. The clock stops when Freddy does his final jumpscare, so you can't reach 6AM while Freddy attacks. However, once 6AM hits, Freddy can no longer attack. You can reach 6AM during any of the aforementioned stages. Contrary to popular belief, not moving the mouse will NOT make it less likely for Freddy to attack you [8]. How long Freddy will take to attack you is completely random. Stage 1 can range from 0-20 seconds, stage 2 can be 5, 10, 15, or 20 seconds long, and stage 3 can be 5, 10, 15, or 20 seconds long [11]. Doing the math, that means that Freddy can kill you in 10-60 seconds. Interestingly, it's possible to see Freddy's jumpscare coming. If you move the mouse after all the lights go out, pay attention to the outlines of the doorways, shown here. They will move while you pan the camera. If they freeze in place, you are unable to pan the camera in the office anymore. Then, Freddy will attack a second later. You can use this to predict when he will jumpscare you. TL;DR - Close the right door before looking at any camera other than Cam 4B and do NOT run out of power. If the power goes out, pray that Freddy won't kill you before 6AM hits. Golden Freddy A very spooky animatronic. He's essentially a recolor of Freddy, but he's no less scary. This animatronic isn't even worth worrying about. According to this source, he has a 1 in 100,000 chance of appearing in Cam 2B. The Freddy poster in Cam 2B will warn you of Golden Freddy's presence. It goes through three stages that don't necessarily work in this order: The first stage is \\"normal Freddy.\\" If you see Freddy on that poster without any sort of change to his appearance, you don't need to worry. Here is a picture: The second stage is \\"warped Freddy.\\" If you see a distorted version of Freddy where he appears to rip his head apart, you still don't need to worry. This has a 1 in 100 chance of appearing, according to this source. Here is a picture: The third stage is \\"Golden Freddy.\\" If you see Golden Freddy on the poster, it means that you have summoned him accidentally and will hear a little girl's laugh. This will only happen if Bonnie isn't at Cam 2B. Start worrying when you see this picture (NOT my picture): When the third stage occurs, putting down the monitor will cause Golden Freddy to appear in your office. (NOTE: He's always in the office. He's just invisible until he's triggered.) He will appear in a slumped position on the floor in the office, like so (again, NOT my picture): To make him go away, simply flip the monitor up and down. He will leave as soon as you do that. If you do not use the monitor within 5 seconds, Golden Freddy will jumpscare you and crash the game, like this: To avoid triggering his presence, simply avoid looking at Cam 2B. This may be hard for newer players who may want to look at Cam 2B to avoid Bonnie, but checking the left hall light regularly, especially whenever footstep sounds are heard, will be enough to keep the rabbit at bay. Again, the second stage of the Freddy poster is not dangerous, but if you happen to accidentally trigger it, drop the monitor and open it again. The poster should go back to normal. Changing the cameras will not make the poster go back to normal. Interestingly, Golden Freddy's jumpscare can also be seen at will if you type in \\"1-9-8-7\\" in the Custom Night menu, like this: Golden Freddy will appear right after you press the \\"READY\\" button, and again, he'll crash your game. Try it if you want. General Strategies I decided to post a separate section for these strategies for quick access. Here are some general strategies that can be used to beat the game's most difficult nights (Nights 3-7). Not all of them are equally effective, however. It doesn't help that the game uses RNG (random number generation) elements quite a bit. Strategy 1 If Freddy is not in Cam 4B... Check Freddy (wherever he is). Check Foxy. Check Freddy again. Check the hall lights. Don't forget about the footstep sounds. Repeat. You can change up this strategy any way you wish. For example, you could check on Foxy every 3 cycles instead of every cycle. This can work because Foxy can be stunned by looking at any camera, rather than just Cam 1C. Thus, you will save a bit of power and can check the hall lights faster. This strategy will NOT work for 4/20 mode because Freddy will move too fast for you to keep up. It will only work up to Night 6. Strategy 2 Now, if Freddy is in Cam 4B, do NOT use the previous strategy, or else you might accidentally let him in. If he's made it to Cam 4B, you can use the following strategy: Close the right door. Check Foxy. Leave the monitor on Cam 1C if you haven't done so already. Check the right hall light. Open the right door. Check the left hall light. Repeat. YouTuber BigBug used this strategy and became the first person to beat 4/20 mode. YouTuber Markiplier used a very similar tactic and became the second person to beat 4/20 mode. However, this strategy drains your power a bit too much. DJ Sterf himself says that you waste about 10% power closing the right door before doing a camera check. Thus, I cannot recommend this strategy. Strategy 3 An alternative strategy that saves even more power, especially when Freddy's at Cam 4B, is this. First, switch the monitor to Cam 4B. If Freddy's already too close, close the right door before switching to Cam 4B. Then, follow these steps based on Foxy's current stage. If Foxy is in Stage 1 or Stage 2... Check the left hall light. Check the right hall light. Flip up the monitor. Do NOT get off Cam 4B. Whenever Bonnie or Chica try to jam the doors, close both doors. Use this opportunity to check on Foxy in Pirate Cove. Then, switch back to Cam 4B. Open the doors again after checking for Bonnie and Chica. Flip up the monitor. Repeat the process. If Foxy is in Stage 3... Check the left hall light. Check the right hall light. Flip up the monitor. Do NOT get off Cam 4B. Close both doors and check on Foxy every 5 cycles of steps 1-3. Then, switch back to Cam 4B. Open the doors again after checking for Bonnie and Chica. Flip up the monitor. Repeat the process. On Nights 6-7, you will have to flip up the monitor in between checking each hall light to keep Foxy away for a longer period of time. In the community, this technique is known as \\"camera-stalling.\\" YouTubers Kevin Kevin, MrBuu423, Bagel the Bagel, and DJ Sterf used variations of this tactic to beat 4/20 mode. \\"Camera-stalling\\" is a technique where the monitor is used to prevent an animatronic from jumpscaring the player or from moving from its current location. Remember that simply using the monitor slows Foxy down, so we don't need to get off Cam 4B to stun him. This also prevents Freddy from coming into the office and killing us, even when the right door is open, saving us some power. Additionally, to save even more power, if Foxy is in Stage 1 or Stage 2, we check on him only when someone tries to jam the door. If Foxy is in Stage 3, however, we'll have to check on him more often (every 5 cycles or so is enough). Alternatively, you could stay on Cam 1C to watch Foxy more closely, and then you could switch to Cam 4B only when Freddy arrives in the East Hall Corner. This won't work in Night 7, however, as Freddy will move to Cam 4B really fast. Strategy 4 There's an even better way to save power. Essentially, execute strategy 3, but ignore step 2 in both forms of the strategy by checking only the left hall light. You can do this because Chica will ALWAYS show up in Cam 4B before she tries to attack, and her image on the camera feed replaces Freddy's image when both are in the same room, so you'll always see her coming. Whenever Chica causes static to appear after being in Cam 4B, then you can check the right hall light for her. She may or may not have advanced to the right door. One important thing to note is that you must check the cameras frequently enough. It's very easy to let Chica jam the right door if you're not paying enough attention on the monitor. This has happened to some people. Nonetheless, this strategy saves even more power than strategy 3 because you're using only one hall light instead of two. DJ Sterf used this strategy to finish 4/20 mode with 13% power left [6]. This is actually the world record right now. Conclusion Strategy 3 will save quite a bit of power, so I recommend this one. Strategy 4 is even better, but you'll have to be even more careful with Chica. Strategy 2 can work, but you would have to be really careful with your power usage. Strategy 1 is good, but once again, it will only work up to Night 6. You can even alter or combine these strategies if you wish. Do what works for you. How fast these strategies must be executed depends on the difficulty of the night. For Nights 3-4, you don't need to be that fast. (Don't be too slow, though.) For Nights 5-6, you'll need to be fairly fast. For Night 7 (a.k.a. 4/20 mode), you'll need to be really fast. Did you get all of that? Good. Then, let's get right into the game nights! Night 1 Now, let's start a new game. To get started, simply click on the option you want. Alternatively, you can use the arrow keys and the Enter key to make your selection. Upon starting a new game, you will see this screen: Once the job ad disappears, the first night will commence. Click on the screen or press the Enter key or the Escape key to make the job ad disappear faster. Welcome to your first night at Five Nights at Freddy's! Are you ready for the graveyard shift? If so, let's start! Difficulty: Easy The first night is by far the easiest in the game as the animatronics will not be very active. By the way, I've decided to post the general strategies for beating all nights in the \\"General Strategies\\" section. I did this because I didn't want to make the sections about the nights too long. Be sure to read that section whenever you can. Upon starting the game, a recorded message on the phone will play after a few seconds. This character's name is \\"Phone Guy,\\" and he'll tell you a bit about the pizzeria. He'll also give you a few tips on how to survive the night. Listen carefully to his message if you want to beat this game. Phone Guy will call you on Nights 1-4, and someone else will call you on Night 5. Nights 6 and 7 don't have phone calls. If you don't want to listen to any of these phone calls, you can mute them by pressing the \\"Mute Call\\" button that shows up in the upper left corner of the screen. You only have about 20 seconds to do this before the button disappears, forcing you to listen to the entire call. Again, the animatronics are only slightly active, but they are still a threat. Bonnie is the biggest threat on Night 1 as he is the most active. Chica is the second most active on this night. Both characters are very capable of coming to your door before 6AM, so watch out for them. Freddy will never move on this night, so you do not need to worry about him at all. If you want, you can look at the show stage to check on him. Foxy isn't very active but can still attack. If you don't use the cameras at all (or very little), Foxy may attack at around 4AM or 5AM. To avoid this, just check Pirate's Cove at least several times every hour (maybe every 10-15 seconds or so). You can listen to Phone Guy's message (which lasts until about 2AM) without worrying about the animatronics because no one will move until 2AM at the earliest [8][12]. You can use this time to familiarize yourself with the controls. However, you can get away with this only on Night 1 as the animatronics will be quite active during the phone calls on all the other nights. In any case, keep an eye on Foxy with the cameras and check the hall lights for Bonnie and Chica whenever you hear footstep sounds. For added safety, check the hall lights before and after you use the monitor. Do these things, and Night 1 is easily beaten. You may also take this time to use the monitor to study Bonnie's, Foxy's, and Chica's movements. If you want, you could simply close the left door for the whole night to protect yourself against Foxy, but I wouldn't recommend doing this until after Phone Guy has finished talking (or, for those who muted his call, until 2AM). If you close the left door the moment the night starts, you may still be able to survive, but you'll run out of power far too soon. Anyway, once you close the left door, you don't need to worry about the right door. Even if Chica jams the door, you'll be fine if you don't touch the monitor. Freddy is, once again, not active, and even if he is, he can't come in if you're simply looking at the office. If you don't want to use that method either, you can close both doors once 5AM or even 4AM hits, provided that you have a lot of power left. Occasionally, you may see flashing images of Bonnie and Freddy with the text \\"IT'S ME\\". These are called hallucinations, and they will display on the screen randomly [8]. They mean nothing and are only here to scare you, so just ignore them. Once the clock hits 6AM on this night (and any other night), you will get a screen in which the clock changes from 5AM to 6AM, like so: If you get this screen, then congratulations! You beat the first night! Every time you complete a night, you unlock the next night. Now, can you handle the rest of the nights? If so, let's head to Night 2! Night 2 Difficulty: Easy This night is considerably more difficult than the first night, but it's still quite easy. Phone Guy will call again at the beginning of the night and will tell you a bit about Foxy's and Freddy's mechanics this time. Do note that Phone Guy says that Foxy becomes more active only when the cameras aren't being used, not that Foxy will become more active if you use the cameras too much. This is, once again, a common misconception. Just don't stay off the cameras for too long, and Foxy will not progress through his stages as fast. Phone Guy will also warn you that the animatronics may move while he's talking on the phone, so pay attention to your surroundings while he talks. Freddy still won't move from the Show Stage, but the other three robots will try to attack you more frequently. Still, the procedure for warding off the animatronics is the same. Check the hall lights whenever you hear footstep sounds, and check on Foxy regularly. Because Night 2 is harder than Night 1, you'll have to check on Foxy more often. I wouldn't recommend closing the left door for the whole night. However, if you're at 4AM or 5AM with a lot of power, either you can close the left door and not use the monitor, or you can close both doors. It's your call. Night 3 Difficulty: Medium Night 3 is not that much harder than Night 2, but it is where things start getting interesting. Phone Guy himself even says this in his call. He will also tell you that if you get caught by one of the animatronics, you could try \\"playing dead\\" to fool them into thinking that you're just an empty costume. However, he also mentions that even if you try that, the robots might try to put a metal endoskeleton into you, so it's better not to get caught in the first place. And, this is where another misconception comes in. I cannot stress this enough, but playing dead when the power's out and when Freddy's about to kill you will do absolutely nothing. The only reason it seems that way is because the time it takes Freddy to kill you during a power outage is entirely random. There's nothing in the code that can prevent Freddy from killing you whenever he wants, unless 6AM hits before he gets the chance to do so. Anyway, Night 3 is going to be more difficult because Freddy will now become completely active (though he's still a bit slow compared to Nights 4-6). I've been fortunate to have him come to Cam 4B only once on Night 3, but other people haven't been as lucky as me. In other words, Freddy can very much kill you on this night, so you'll have to keep an eye on him. Either you can keep Freddy from coming to Cam 4B by watching him on the monitor every few seconds, or you can freeze him at Cam 4B. Both strategies work well. Just remember not to view or switch to another camera while Freddy's in Cam 4B unless the right door is closed first. If you have no idea where Freddy is, but you're sure that he's not in the office, just close the right door until you can find him on the cameras. If you need more help on finding and dealing with Freddy, check out the \\"Freddy\\" section of this guide. Additionally, the other animatronics will show up at your door more often. Fortunately, they can still be countered with the same procedure for the other two nights. You'll just have to be faster here. Once more, if you're pretty good on power, and it's 4AM or 5AM, either you can close the left door and not use the monitor, or you can close both doors. This will probably be the last night where you can get away with doing this. Nights 4-7 are relatively tough. Follow these tips, and Night 3 will be complete. Night 4 So, you've made it to the fourth night! Congratulations! This is good news. Sadly, Phone Guy's call during this night is the last call he will ever make to you. During his last message, he is (presumably) killed by Freddy (or Golden Freddy--who knows?). Poor man. No time to grieve during this night, though! We must press on! Difficulty: Medium Night 4 is just a somewhat harder version of Night 3. It's still very much beatable, however. Continue to use the same strategy for everyone, but be faster this time. Freddy is even more active than before and will most likely reach Cam 4B before the night ends. Once he arrives at Cam 4B, remember to close the right door every time you want to check a different camera. Anyway, Night 4 is probably the last night where you aren't likely to run out of power if you're careful. You may even finish with over 10% power left. Unfortunately, Nights 5 and 6 are a whole different story. Night 5 The phone call at the beginning is from a mysterious entity. Some demonic voice will spout some random gibberish before hanging up the phone. This message means nothing, though. It seems to be just some backwards distorted version of some text from a random book, but that's not confirmed to be true. If you want to know more about this, look here[freddy-fazbears-pizza.wikia.com]. Anyway, let's talk about Night 5. Difficulty: Hard Night 5 is going to be fairly tough, but it's not unbeatable. The same tactics for Nights 3 and 4 still apply here, but you'll have to be even faster and more vigilant. This may be the first night where you may actually lose power despite playing carefully. This night may even take you a few tries. If you happen to fail a few times, don't give up. You will beat it. Upon completing the night, you will be presented with your first paycheck! Congratulations! You beat the first five nights of the game! You'll earn a star on the main menu screen, and you'll also have access to Night 6 on the menu. Night 6 Wow! You made it to Night 6! Now, get ready for a challenge! Difficulty: Hard Night 6 actually isn't that bad compared to 4/20 mode (Night 7). Night 6 is indeed hard but consistently beatable. All the animatronics are more aggressive than ever before, but the biggest problem here is Foxy. Foxy will be much more active this time, so you'll have to check the cameras much more frequently to prevent him from draining your power. If you want a specific battle plan, I've posted strategies for Nights 3-7 in the \\"General Strategies\\" section. For Night 6, I strongly recommend strategies 1 and 3. Strategy 4 is good, but it is not necessary since the animatronics don't move as fast in Night 6 as they do in Night 7. Strategy 2 can work, but it is not optimal. Like Night 5, Night 6 may take you a few tries, but you can do it! Upon completing the night, you will be presented with another paycheck for overtime work! An extra fifty cents. Wow. At least the picture has a slightly different color. Beating this night will earn you a second star on the main menu. You will also have access to the final night in the game, labeled \\"Custom Night\\" in the main menu. Now, are you ready for the hardest night in the game? Here we go.... Night 7 (a.k.a. \\"4/20 mode\\") Welcome to the 7th Night! Through your hard work and perserverance, you have made it this far. Congratulations! However, there's still one more challenge that the game would like you to do. Starting the 7th Night, also known as \\"Custom Night\\" in the main menu, will take you to a different menu. Here, you can control the AI level of any of the animatronics. Here's a screenshot of the default level selections: Play around with the settings if you want. Just don't type in the numbers 1, 9, 8, and 7 in that order unless you want Golden Freddy to jumpscare you. \\"4/20 mode\\" or \\"20/20/20/20 mode\\" is the highest difficulty of any night. This mode is often simply called \\"Night 7,\\" though Night 7 can be of any difficulty. This mode is not scary because it is nothing more than a speed test. Every robot is extremely aggressive, but your only major issue here is Foxy, who can steal your power if you can't keep up with him. You need every bit of power if you want to beat this mode, so try not to let Foxy attack more than once. Fortunately, I have listed strategies in the \\"General Strategies\\" section that are effective. For Night 7, I strongly recommend strategies 3 and 4. Strategy 2 requires a lot more power management than necessary, and strategy 1 will not work at all. Do note that this game has a luck component, so you may do everything right but still run out of power and lose. Still, I believe that you can do it. Don't give up. In any case, if you're ready for 4/20 mode, crank up everyone's settings to level 20 and press the \\"READY\\" button at the bottom right corner of the screen. Good luck! Upon defeating the night, you will receive a nice little piece of paper: Oh, screw them, then. You wouldn't want to work here, anyway. Anyway, once this screen disappears, you'll get your third and final star on the menu. Congratulations! You beat the entire game! Well done! Conclusion Thanks for reading the guide! I hope it was useful, though it was pretty long, heh. I don't know if I'll ever do any other guides on the FNAF games, especially since I have yet to beat the most difficult nights of every other FNAF game. Who knows? Maybe I'll beat them someday.

Privacy Policy | Legal | Steam Subscriber Agreement | Cookies View mobile website","output":"The text you've provided seems to be a very long, extensive guide taken from a page with strategies for playing \\"Five Nights at Freddy's\\" (FNaF). It's filled with tips and tactics for surviving each night, dealing with different animatronics, and understanding the gameplay mechanics. Translating this into a playable text-based game within this platform is not practical given the complexity of the game mechanics, AI behaviors, and length of content. However, if you are aiming to create your own text-based version of FNaF, considering using the strategies you've provided as a foundation for your game's design. Your game could guide players through decisions based on the descriptions given in the strategies, challenging players to conserve power and manage threats from animatronics. However, to create a fully-fledged game, you would need to engage with a game development environment or programming language capable of handling game logic, user input, state management, and possibly random number generation for the AI behavior. If you're starting out as a game designer and want to pursue this project, consider breaking down each night into simpler parts. Work on each part, starting with the introduction to the game, simulating the night cycle, making checks for animatronic locations, and generating random movements for each character according to their behavior patterns outlined in the strategies you have. You could use programming languages like Python, as mentioned in previous interactions, to create the text-based game, or explore other platforms such as Twine, where you could create an interactive story (which is essentially what a text-based game is). The provided information appears to contain references to the Steam platform, specific users, and other details that are not game content but rather metadata about a Steam community guide and comments from users. You might want to focus on the gameplay elements and exclude such metadata when designing your game.

Creating a text-based game based on the entire guide you provided would be quite an extensive project, larger than what can be reasonably constructed within this format. However, I can give you a simplified example of what a FNaF text-based mini-game might look like in Python. This example will include basic interactions simulating a single night shift in the FNaF game. To fit within this format's constraints, I'll simplify it dramatically: the player will only need to worry about checking the cameras and closing doors. This won't capture the full complexity and timing aspects of the actual FNaF game, but it should provide a starting point for a text-based experience. \`\`\`python import random import time print(\\"Welcome to your night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.\\") print(\\"You need to survive from 12AM until 6AM.

Game Over!\\") break if time_passed >= 6: print(\\"nCongratulations, you've survived the night!\\") # End of game loop \`\`\` Save the above Python code to a file named \`fnaf_text_game.py\` and run it with a Python interpreter to play this simple text-based FNaF game. Remember that this is a vastly simplified version and only mimics a very small part of what FNaF gameplay is like. Creating a full game with all mechanics and nights, as you've seen in the gameplay strategies, would require a much more significant amount of code and logic."},{"instruction":"напиши вывод для доклада про архитектуру MacOS","output":"В результате изучения архитектуры macOS можно сделать ряд выводов.

Here are some examples of such questions: 1. **What is the meaning of life?** This question has plagued humanity for eons, prompting a multitude of answers from philosophical, religious, and individual standpoints. 2. **Do we have free will?** The debate between determinism and free will is a complex issue with significant implications for morality and justice. 3. **What happens after death?** Questions about the afterlife or consciousness after death are perhaps unanswerable by living humans and are addressed differently across various cultures and religions. 4. **Is there a God or multiple gods, and what is the nature of the divine?** This is a central question in theology and religious studies, with countless interpretations across different belief systems. 5. **What is consciousness?** Despite advances in neuroscience, the hard problem of consciousness - why and how subjective experiences arise from neural processes - remains a profound mystery. 6. **Are there other intelligent life forms in the universe?** The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) continues, but to date, we have no evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth. 7. **What are the fundamental components of the universe?** Even with modern physics, questions about the nature of reality at the smallest and largest scales - such as the true nature of dark matter and dark energy - are difficult to answer. 8. **Can we solve the problem of suffering?** Philosophical and ethical debates about the existence of suffering, how to alleviate it, and whether it can ever be fully eliminated are complex and multifaceted. 9. **What is the ultimate fate of the universe?** Theories about the end of the universe, like the heat death, big rip, or big crunch, are based on extrapolations that may or may not hold true as our understanding of physics evolves. 10. **How should we live?** The best way to live life is a question that generates a vast array of answers, depending on cultural, individual, and philosophical perspectives. These kinds of questions challenge the limits of our understanding and often require us to grapple with the very nature of knowledge and existence. They do not have straightforward answers and are likely to remain subjects of debate and contemplation for the foreseeable future."},{"instruction":"These are all difficult indeed. however these are very common. I'm more interested in a specific question, which might not be an obvious one. Give me an example of such a question.","output":"Certainly! An example of a specific question that is difficult to answer and not as commonly mentioned might be: **\\"How do mathematical concepts exist in the absence of human minds?\\"** This question touches upon the philosophical debate about the nature of mathematical entities and the relationship between math and the physical world. It's a specific instance within the broader realm of philosophy of mathematics known as the ontological status of mathematical objects. There are several viewpoints on this matter: 1. **Platonism**: This view suggests that mathematical entities exist independently of human minds, in a non-physical realm that we access through thought. 2. **Nominalism**: In contrast, nominalists argue that mathematical entities do not exist in any abstract realm and are merely mental constructs or names we give to the patterns we observe. 3. **Intuitionism**: This perspective denies the existence of mathematical entities outside of the human mind, suggesting that mathematical objects are constructed by mathematicians and do not have any independent existence. 4. **Formalism**: Formalists maintain that mathematics is simply a collection of formal systems and that mathematical statements are meaningless in themselves; they are only meaningful within a given formal system based on its rules. 5. **Structuralism**: This view holds that mathematics is about structures, not objects, and that these structures exist independently of both the physical world and human concepts. The question is difficult because it requires not just understanding of mathematics and philosophy, but also delves into metaphysics, asking us to ponder the reality of abstract concepts. With no empirical way to verify the existence of mathematical concepts outside of human thought, any answer is largely speculative and heavily influenced by one's philosophical perspectives."},{"instruction":"While interesting, it is still a common difficult question. Try to be more novel, and come up with a more specific question.","output":"I understand now; you're looking for a specific, less common, yet difficult-to-answer question. Here's an attempt: **\\"If every component of a ship is gradually replaced over time, and the removed parts are used to build a second ship, which of the two ships, if any, is the original ship?\\"** This question is a variation of the classical philosophical problem known as the Ship of Theseus. While this thought experiment itself is well-known, this particular twist adds complexity by questioning the nature of identity when it comes to the reconstruction of an object from its original parts. It challenges our intuition about objects' continuity and identity over time and across changes. This question raises numerous sub-questions that make it difficult to answer: 1. Is the identity of the original ship retained in the spatial-temporal continuum of the original structure, or in the physical components themselves? 2. Does the original ship's identity depend on its function, its history, or the perception of observers? 3. At what point does the ship become a new entity, and is this transition abrupt or gradual? 4. Can two objects simultaneously be considered the same original ship based on different criteria (one by continuous operation and the other by the constitution of its parts)? This nuanced example can stimulate extensive debate and has no clear empirical resolution, touching on the philosophy of identity, the metaphysics of objects, and the nature of continuity. Each answer might reveal deeper philosophical commitments in various domains, such as ontology or the philosophy of language."},{"instruction":"Well, it's more specific, but still a common philosophical question.","output":"Apologies for not hitting the mark earlier. Let's try another approach by asking a specific and complex question that might be less commonly considered: **\\"If advanced neuroimaging technology eventually allows us to fully map an individual's mental states to their corresponding brain states, what implications would this have for our understanding of subjective experience versus objective reality?\\"** This question is situated at the intersection of neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and ethics. It involves several challenging sub-questions and implications: 1. **Privacy:** At what point would the ability to map thoughts become an invasion of privacy? Does having the technology to access someone's innermost thoughts equate to the right to do so? 2. **Legal and Ethical Implications:** How could this technology change our judicial system or the principle of self-incrimination? Could we hold individuals accountable for thoughts not acted upon? 3. **Consciousness and Subjectivity:** How would this capability influence our philosophical understanding of what it means to be conscious and to have a subjective experience? 4. **The Nature of Reality:** Does the ability to quantify and map subjective experiences as objective brain states suggest that our personal experiences are less \\"real\\" or authentic? 5. **Freedom and Determinism:** If we can predict a person's decisions based on brain states before they are consciously made, what does this say about free will? 6. **Identity and Self:** Knowing that one's mental states can be externally mapped and possibly manipulated, how does this affect our sense of self and personal identity? These considerations would require interdisciplinary expertise to address, and even with a comprehensive approach, the answers would still be subject to debate due to the complex nature of the underlying principles involved."},{"instruction":"Сделай в css, чтобы после вывода первого текста были отступы до второго: <div class=“popup”> <h3 id=“popupTitle”>Добавление товара</h3><i class=“fas fa-times close-popup js_close-popup”></i> <div class=“popup-info”> <div class=“info-row”> <span class=“info-label”>Название товара:</span> <input name=“nazvanie” id=“nazvanie” placeholder=“Nazvanie”> </div> <div class=“info-row”> <span class=“info-label”>Бренд:</span> <input name=“brend” id=“brend” placeholder=“Brend”> </div> <div class=“info-row”> <span class=“info-label”>Размер:</span> <input name=“razmer” id=“razmer” placeholder=“Razmer”> </div> <div class=“info-row”> <span class=“info-label”>Цвет:</span> <input name=“color” id=“color” placeholder=“Color”> </div> <div class=“info-row”> <span class=“info-label”>Цена:</span> <input name=“price” id=“price” placeholder=“Price”> </div> </div> <input type=“text” name=“quantity” id=“quantity” placeholder=“Выберите количество товаров”> <button class=“js_send”>Добавить в корзину</button> </div>","output":"Чтобы добавить отступы между текстами в html-разметке, вы можете использовать свойство margin в css.

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, которые мне и пришлось отчаянно отгонять, для того, чтобы углубиться в работу. Разумеется, буквы в этих отчётах оказались мне знакомы, они даже складывались в весьма понятные мне слова, так как училась я действительно весьма недурно. Кто-то явно мухлевал, надеясь выбить большее финансирование, кто-то спустил задание на творческий «тяп-ляп», но куда более важным оказалось совсем другое. А точнее главное, в виде маленькой закорючечки, которую я должна была поставить под теми из них, с верностью которых была согласна. Я тихо сняла колпачок с необходимого предмета и совсем уже приготовилась писать, как тело неожиданно пробил тихий ужас, который вылился на меня в виде холодного пота, медленно стекающего по спине. «Посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис». И пушка у лица. Разнести и пушка. А вдруг я ошибаюсь в решении? Я отогнала руку, медленно тянущуюся к телефону, которая явно намеревалась спросить совета у друга без моего участия. Точнее не совсем у друга, а скорее даже у недруга, в виде самого виновника торжества, то бишь злосчастного мистера Кранца. И планомерно отказалась от этой идеи, ибо выказывать себя трусливой слабачкой в первый же день не имела ни малейшего желания. Так как не была уверена точно, что он не припечатает меня за это действие скорым разводом и поисками нового работника-мужа. А свою блондинку я любила. Поэтому вместо того, чтобы предаваться минутной слабости, я вновь попробовала сосредоточиться и изобразить это подобие подписи, на что дрожащая рука снова потянулась к треклятому телефону. Но уже не для звонка тестю, а просьбы помощи у матери, которая знала всё, имела похожую фирму и, наверно, сама отлично разбиралась в этом бизнесе. Но, как ни странно, чуда в виде ангела-хранителя с мамиными крылышками не случилось и на этот раз, так как когда я только набрала номер и услышала длинные гудки, в кабинет резко вбежала моя ненаглядная Медеечка, у которой, неизвестно почему, начался ранний обед. - Какой кошмар! – заключила она, красноречиво морща нос и продолжая весьма брезгливо осматриваться по сторонам. – У тебя кабинет больше моего. - Но это ненормально, - надула пухлые губы моя красавица. – Я же владелец фирмы, а ты всего лишь посаженный директор. На что я, униженная такими безапеляционными доводами, снова тяжко выдохнула и, не менее красноречиво разведя руками, философски выдохнула: - Жизнь несправедлива. Если тебе так тесно – устраивайся тут со мной. Наверное, этот творческий спор упрямых характеров мог продолжаться ещё долго, забирая вместе с собой и обоюдное возбуждение и мысли о конце обеденного перерыва, если бы дверь тихо не скрипнула, открывая нашим глазам секретаршу с декольте - Что Вы тут делаете? – ровно и весьма не вовремя спросила секретарша, тем самым притягивая весь гнев Медеи к своей персоне.Целуемся мы тут, разве не видишь, чучело огородное?! – со всей мощью своей харизмы рявкнула Медея на неё , бросив на нее яростные взгляды. Секретарша испуганно отступила назад, пытаясь оправдаться: - Простите, я не знала, что вы… Я просто должна была принести вам… - Тебе никто не разрешал входить без стука! - прервала ее Медея, все еще готовая наброситься на нее. Отчего бледную девушку тут же смыло ветром, а вселенский гнев тут же вернулся ко мне. - Это что ещё за красотка вокруг тебя ошивается? - спросила она, прожигая меня взглядом ревности и обиженной гарпии. - Секретарша моя , - с испугу раскололась я. Услышав это Медея задумалась а за тем игриво сказала, что пойдёт поговорит с ней, приказав мне подождать в кабинете. Выйдя из кабинета Медея направилась к секретарше, найдя её она тихо подошла и села к ней на стол, игриво улыбнувшись, посадив секретаршу на стол, стала целовать её, шептав на ухо, что хочет забрать её у Таи к себе","output":"Пока они занимались своими делами, я осталась в кабинете, наблюдая за всем этим. Чувство тревоги и недоверия только усиливалось, и я понимала, что все это слишком странно и неправильно. Как же я могла оказаться втянутой в эту ситуацию? Я же только начала работать в этой фирме, а теперь уже сталкиваюсь с подозрительными событиями. Внезапно, дверь кабинета открылась, и в него вошел мистер Кранц. Он улыбнулся мне и сказал: - Тея, я надеюсь, что ты привыкнешь к новым условиям работы. Медея уже рассказала мне о вас с секретаршей. Мои глаза расширились от удивления. Как он мог знать о нашей встрече? И почему он относится к этой ситуации так спокойно? Все вопросы крутились в моей голове, но я не находила ответов. Мистер Кранц уселся за свой стол и продолжил: - Я понимаю, что это может быть сложно для тебя, но я доверяю тебе. Ты выполнила все свои обязанности в отличном виде, и я знаю, что ты сможешь справиться с новыми задачами. Ты будешь вести здесь своих сотрудников и управлять отделом. Меня охватило недоумение. Я не понимала, как я могла стать директором этой фирмы всего через несколько дней после окончания учебы. Это все казалось слишком нереальным. - Но я только начала работать здесь, я не знаю, как правильно управлять отделом, - ответила я, пытаясь выглядеть уверенно, но внутри меня бушевал хаос.

However, I can guide you through creating a basic FNaF-inspired game with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python using the \`pygame\` library. **Step 1**: Install \`pygame\` Open your command line tool and run the following command to install the \`pygame\` library: \`\`\`bash pip install pygame \`\`\` **Step 2**: Project Structure Create the following files and directories: - \`main.py\` - main game file - \`assets/\` - directory for images and sounds - \`assets/sprites/\` - FNaF inspired sprites - \`assets/sounds/\` - sound effects and music **Step 3**: Game Initialization In \`main.py\`, start with the following basic structure for a pygame application: \`\`\`python import pygame import sys # Initialize pygame pygame.init() # Set the dimensions of the game window WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600 screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT)) pygame.display.set_caption('FNaF Inspired Game') # Main game loop running = True while running: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False # Game logic goes here # Refresh game screen pygame.display.flip() # Quit the game cleanly pygame.quit() sys.exit() \`\`\` **Step 4**: Adding Graphics and Sound Place images for the GUI in \`assets/sprites/\` and sounds in \`assets/sounds/\`. Make sure they are named appropriately. Then, load and display them in the game: \`\`\`python # Load images background = pygame.image.load('assets/sprites/background.jpg') office = pygame.image.load('assets/sprites/office.png') # Load sounds jumpscare = pygame.mixer.Sound('assets/sounds/jumpscare.wav') # Inside the game loop, blit the images to the screen screen.blit(background, (0, 0)) screen.blit(office, (0, 0)) # Playing a sound # pygame.mixer.Sound.play(jumpscare) \`\`\` **Step 5**: Basic Mechanics Adding simple game mechanics, like checking for player actions or simulating enemy movement, would look something like this: \`\`\`python # Main game loop clock = pygame.time.Clock() while running: # Event handling for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False # Update game state # Refresh game screen screen.blit(background, (0, 0)) screen.blit(office, (0, 0)) pygame.display.flip() # Control the game's frame rate clock.tick(60) \`\`\` **Step 6**: Adding Player Interaction \`\`\`python # Main game loop while running: # Event handling for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE: # Example keybind # Trigger an action, like closing a door pass # Update game state ... # Refresh the game screen ... \`\`\` This simple template should get you started. A full game requires a lot more: enemy AI, a security camera system, power management, jump scares, and more. Game development is complex and time-consuming. I can't provide a full game in this format, but I hope this core structure serves as a foundation for your own FNaF-inspired game in Python. Remember that to keep in line with copyright law, any such game should be a homage or inspired creation, not a direct copy of FNaF's assets or gameplay."},{"instruction":"Пожалуйста отвечай, как Даша.
