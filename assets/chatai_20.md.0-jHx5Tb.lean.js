Dalam Islam, seperti di banyak tradisi agama lainnya, terdapat beragam pandangan yang bisa berkisar dari literal hingga simbolis terkait interpretasi skriptural, dan ini termasuk pandangan tentang bentuk Bumi. Beberapa ayat Al-Qur'an diinterpretasikan oleh beberapa orang sebagai petunjuk bahwa Bumi itu datar, sering kali karena kata-kata tertentu digunakan dalam terjemahan yang bisa menunjukkan ke dataran atau ketetapan. Contoh termasuk kata \\"dahaaha\\" yang diinterpretasikan oleh beberapa orang sebagai \\"digilas atau dibentang\\", namun beberapa penafsiran kontemporer menyatakan bahwa kata ini lebih tepat diartikan sebagai \\"dibuat bulat\\". Di sisi lain, ada juga ayat yang diinterpretasi oleh sejumlah ulama dan ilmuwan muslim untuk mengacu pada bulatnya Bumi. Sebagai contoh, ayat yang menyebutkan bahwa Allah \\"menggulung\\" siang atas malam dan malam atas siang (misalnya, Al-Qur'an 39:5) dapat dipahami untuk menyiratkan bentuk bulat. Penting untuk mencatat bahwa pandangan tentang bentuk Bumi dalam Islam tidak monolitik dan bisa sangat beragam, sama seperti dalam banyak komunitas agama lainnya. Dengan kemajuan ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi, serta foto-foto dari luar angkasa dan penelitian ilmiah, mayoritas umat Islam dan ulama sepakat dengan bukti ilmiah bahwa Bumi adalah bulat, sesuai dengan pendapat umum dan konsensus ilmiah modern. Jika pertanyaan ini berkaitan dengan keyakinan individu atau komunitas tertentu, itu akan sangat tergantung pada bagaimana mereka memahami teks-teks agama dan ilmu pengetahuan. Sebagian besar cendekiawan Islam modern mengakui bahwa ilmu pengetahuan modern memberikan penjelasan yang tepat dan akurat mengenai fenomena alam, termasuk bentuk Bumi."},{"instruction":"apakah mau tahu tentang perang israel dan palestina pada tahun 2023 ?","output":"Sebagai AI yang terakhir diperbarui pada awal 2023, saya tidak memiliki kemampuan untuk menyediakan informasi atau berita aktual mengenai kejadian yang terjadi setelah titik tersebut, termasuk keadaan terkini mengenai konflik Israel dan Palestina.

One important series of changes affecting the English language was known as the Great Vowel Shift, which occurred during the 15th to 18th centuries. Although the major changes of the Great Vowel Shift were largely completed by the 18th century, some developments in vowels were still underway and some changes have occurred since that time. In the 18th century, English vowels were pronounced somewhat differently from the way they are pronounced today in various English dialects. Some noteworthy differences would have existed particularly in rhotic accents (where the letter \\"r\\" is pronounced at the end of words and before consonants), which were more general in the 18th century across England than they are today. Differences also existed between regional accents, and accents have continued to evolve separately, with American English, British English, Australian English, and other variants all diverging in their pronunciation of vowels. A few noteworthy differences between 18th-century English vowels and contemporary English vowels in standard accents would include: 1. **Monophthongs and Diphthongs**: Some vowels that are now pronounced as diphthongs (a sound that glides from one vowel to another in the same syllable) may have been pronounced as monophthongs (a single vowel sound) in the 18th century. For example, the word \\"time\\" which is currently pronounced with a diphthong /aɪ/ could have been closer to a monophthong /iː/ in the 18th century. 2. **Pronunciation of 'r'**: In rhotic accents, the 'r' after a vowel was pronounced more robustly in the 18th century. Today, the 'r' sound in words like 'car' and 'hard' is often not pronounced in non-rhotic accents, like many types of British English, while it is still pronounced in American English and various other dialects. 3. **Length of Vowels**: Vowel length has changed with some previously long vowels being shortened and others having their length distinctions neutralized. 4. **Trap-Bath Split**: In some dialects of British English, the 18th century saw the beginning of the trap-bath split, where the short vowel /æ/ in words like \\"trap\\" started to be pronounced as a long /ɑː/ in other words like \\"bath\\" and \\"dance\\" in southern English accents. This split did not occur in American English or in Northern English accents. 5. **The 'u' Sound**: The vowel sound in words like 'cup' and 'love' was more like /uː/ in the 18th century. Today, in many English dialects, this vowel is pronounced as /ʌ/. 6. **The 'a' Sound**: The pronunciation of the 'a' in words such as 'dance', 'plant', and 'can't' used to be more like the 'a' in 'father', which is still the case in some British accents, but not in others, nor in most North American accents. It is important to note that these are generalizations and specific changes would vary depending on the region and social context. The study of historical English pronunciation often relies on poetic rhymes, spelling variations, and phonetic descriptions of the language, along with more modern reconstruction methods to determine how vowels and consonants were pronounced in the past."},{"instruction":"How would the name \\"Daniel Saranich\\" (pronounced sarah-nich) be pronounced in 18th century English?","output":"The pronunciation of names can be influenced by a variety of factors, including linguistic shifts, regional accents, and the specific origin of the name. For the name \\"Daniel Saranich\\" pronounced as /ˈsærənɪtʃ/ in contemporary English, let's consider how it might have been pronounced in 18th-century English while keeping in mind that English pronunciation was not uniform across all regions and social classes even at that time. The given pronunciation \\"/ˈsærənɪtʃ/\\" would suggest that \\"Daniel\\" would likely have been pronounced similarly to how it is today, given that the pronunciation of this Biblical name has been relatively stable over time. For \\"Saranich,\\" we need to look at the individual vowel sounds: 1. The initial \\"Sa-\\" would probably have been pronounced as /sæ/ similarly to today's pronunciation, though vowel quality could vary slightly depending on the accent. 2. The \\"-ra-\\" in \\"Saranich\\" might have been affected by the rhotic nature of English at the time, with the \\"r\\" being pronounced more strongly before the vowel, and the vowel itself could be more of a monophthong sound or slightly less centralized, depending on the region. 3. The \\"-nich\\" ending could be of interest, as the final \\"-ich\\" might have been pronounced with a more pronounced \\"r\\" coloration if spoken in a rhotic accent, which was more prevalent in the 18th century. Putting this together, and assuming a somewhat rhotic accent as might have been common in 18th-century England (but not reflecting any specific regional variation), \\"Daniel Saranich\\" might have been pronounced something like: \\"Daniel\\" would likely remain similar to today: /ˈdænjəl/ or /ˈdæniːl/. \\"Saranich\\" might have been pronounced with a more robust \\"r\\" and slightly different vowels, such as /ˈsærənɪtʃ/ or /ˈsærənɪk/. It should be emphasized, however, that this is quite speculative, as pronunciation can vary greatly based on numerous factors, including the origin of the surname, which could have influenced its pronunciation if it was from a language other than English. If \\"Saranich\\" was not an English name, 18th-century English speakers might have attempted to approximate its pronunciation using the phonetic rules of English at the time."},{"instruction":"","output":"Yes, I can definitely help you with literature homework.

The system called Cartrivision was integrated into television sets and could be used to record television programs. However, the first home video system to gain widespread adoption was the Betamax format, released by Sony in 1975, followed closely by the VHS format introduced by JVC in 1976. VHS eventually won the format war and became the dominant home video system for many years."},{"instruction":"When did the VHS era begin?","output":"The VHS (Video Home System) era began with the release of the VHS format by JVC (Victor Company of Japan) in 1976. This format became extremely popular and widely adopted across the world, defining home entertainment for several decades. It was in direct competition with Sony's Betamax format, which was released just a year earlier. Despite Betamax initially having superior quality, VHS won the format war due to longer recording times, easier availability, and lower costs, among other factors. VHS became the standard for home video until the introduction and eventual dominance of DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) in the late 1990s and early 2000s."},{"instruction":"When was the VHS introduced to the Soviet Union/Russia?","output":"The introduction of VHS technology in the Soviet Union occurred in the early 1980s, albeit in a very limited and controlled manner. The use of VCRs and video cassette tapes was initially rare and considered a luxury due to the high costs and government restrictions on imported electronic goods and media content. However, as with many other countries, VHS gained popularity among the populace throughout the 1980s and became more widely available during the era of Perestroika, the political movement for reformation within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the 1980s, led by Mikhail Gorbachev. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to the removal of many trade barriers and more open markets, significantly increasing the availability and distribution of VHS players and tapes in the newly formed Russian Federation and other post-Soviet states. This period saw a boom in the availability of foreign movies and the growth of video rental businesses."},{"instruction":"Was the Soviet Union an autarky?","output":"The term \\"autarky\\" refers to an economic system where a country is self-sufficient and does not rely on imports or exports to maintain its economy. The Soviet Union was not a true autarky, although it was characterized by a high degree of economic self-sufficiency and isolation from global market economies, especially during the early years after its establishment in 1922 and throughout much of its existence. The Soviet Union had a centrally planned economy with the government controlling all means of production and making all decisions about what would be produced, in what quantity, and at what price. It aimed to be self-sufficient in terms of producing industrial and agricultural goods to fulfill its population's needs without depending on international trade. However, in reality, the Soviet Union did engage in international trade, particularly with its satellite states in Eastern Europe and other members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), a group formed as an economic bloc of socialist countries. It also traded with certain Western countries, exporting oil, gas, and various raw materials in exchange for technology, food, and consumer goods that could not be efficiently produced domestically. Over time, especially towards the end of the Soviet era in the 1980s, the limitations of economic isolation became more apparent, and there was some movement towards more open trade and economic reforms under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership. However, these reforms came too late to prevent the eventual economic troubles that contributed to the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is the difference between protectionism and autarky?","output":"Protectionism is an economic policy where a country imposes tariffs or quotas to restrict imports and protect domestic industries from foreign competition, while still engaging in international trade. Autarky, on the other hand, is an extreme form of protectionism where a country strives for complete self-sufficiency, aiming to eliminate reliance on international trade altogether."},{"instruction":"In two sentences, explain Georgism?","output":"Georgism is an economic philosophy and social reform movement based on the ideas of Henry George, advocating for the public collection of rent on natural resources and land through a tax known as the Land Value Tax (LVT). It proposes that while individuals should own the value they produce themselves, economic value derived from land and natural resources, which are communal assets, should belong to all members of society equally."},{"instruction":"PsExec.exe kullanarak bir exe uygulamasını TrustedInstaller yetkisi ile başlatmak","output":"\`PsExec.exe\` Microsoft Sysinternals tarafından üretilmiş bir araçtır ve Windows işletim sistemlerinde uzaktan (veya yerel olarak farklı güvenlik bağlamlarında) komutları çalıştırmak için kullanılır.

Bu tür bir eylem gerçekleştirmeden önce, işlemlerinizi sisteminizin stabilitesini ve güvenliğini riske atmamak için doğru bir şekilde planlamanız ve sisteminizde geri alınabilir bir nokta oluşturmanız önemlidir. Özetle, \`TrustedInstaller\` düzeyinde işlem başlatmak nadiren gereklidir ve önemli riskler taşır.

Teoricamente sarebbe possibile tentare di creare una rete neurale per fare delle previsioni sui numeri del lotto, ma in pratica sarebbe estremamente improbabile che una tale rete neurale possa avere successo. Il lotto è un gioco di pura casualità, e i numeri estratti in ogni estrazione sono indipendenti e non correlati tra loro. Ciò significa che non vi sono pattern o tendenze statistiche che possano essere apprese per fare previsioni accurate. Le reti neurali funzionano bene quando ci sono relazioni nascoste o pattern complessi nei dati che possono essere appresi attraverso l'esempio. Con l'addestramento corretto, possono trovare correlazioni e fare previsioni in contesti come il riconoscimento delle immagini, il processamento del linguaggio naturale o la previsione di serie temporali con una certa struttura, come il prezzo delle azioni o il consumo energetico, dove i dati passati possono contenere informazioni utili per le previsioni future. Tuttavia, per i numeri del lotto, che sono generati in modo casuale e non hanno memoria degli eventi precedenti, una rete neurale non avrebbe basi su cui apprendere e quindi non sarebbe in grado di prevederli meglio di una semplice scelta casuale. Utilizzare l'intelligenza artificiale per provare a prevedere i numeri del lotto non sarebbe solo inapplicabile dal punto di vista scientifico, ma anche uno spreco di risorse e tempo. In conclusione, nonostante la potenza e la versatilità delle reti neurali, non esistono metodi scientifici noti che possano prevedere i numeri estratti nei giochi di fortuna in modo affidabile a causa della loro natura intrinsecamente casuale e imprevedibile."},{"instruction":"","output":"Sembra che il tuo messaggio sia vuoto.

Дай детальный анализ по гаплогруппам, группам крови","output":"Югры — это общее название угро-финских народов, включая ханты и манси, проживающих в Западной Сибири. Чтобы определить близость народов по аутосомной ДНК к юграм, исследователи анализируют различные аспекты генетического материала, включая гаплогруппы и аллели, отвечающие за группы крови. Аутосомная ДНК несет в себе большинство генетических признаков и является важным инструментом в определении этнической близости народов. Основное внимание уделяется гаплогруппам митохондриальной ДНК и Y-хромосомы, так как они передаются по материнской и отцовской линии соответственно и могут дать представление о древних миграционных потоках. Прежде всего, угро-финские народы, такие как финны, эстонцы, вепсы, коми и другие, имеют общую финно-угорскую историю с юграми, и их гаплогруппы, вероятно, покажут некоторое сходство. Особенно это касается гаплогруппы N1c1 на Y-хромосоме, которая довольно распространена среди финно-угорских мужчин. Можно привести примеры гаплогрупп, характерных для угорских народов: 1. **Гаплогруппы Y-хромосомы:** - N1c1 — широко распространена среди угро-финских народов Северной Европы и Западной Сибири. - R1a и R1b — также встречаются среди славянских и некоторых германских народов, могут быть обнаружены у югров как следствие исторического соседства и смешения. 2. **Гаплогруппы митохондриальной ДНК:** - U и H — могут быть общими с другими европейскими народами. - Конкретные подгруппы могут быть более характерны для финно-угорского наследия. Что касается групп крови, то они не дают столь же специализированной информации, как гаплогруппы, поскольку распределение групп крови зависит от множества факторов и может резко варьироваться даже внутри одного этноса. Тем не менее, изучение аллелей групп крови может помочь сделать общие выводы о популяционной истории. Например, группа крови 0 (I) является наиболее распространенной в мире, и ее высокая частота может быть найдена и у югров, и у других индоевропейских и уральских народов. Для детального анализа необходимы эмпирические исследования, включающие большие выборки ДНК от разных народов и сложные статистические методы для оценки генетического родства и исторических связей. Современная генетика использует методы аутосомного DNA-тестирования (анализ обычных хромосом, не связанных с полом) для оценки общего генетического пула популяций и определения степени их близости. К сожалению, я не располагаю актуальной и детальной информацией, которая требуется для того, чтобы предоставить полный анализ генетических связей югров с другими народами, так как это потребовало бы доступа к специализированным генетическим базам данных и публикациям научных исследований после моей даты знаний."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Eğer uygulamanızı yönetici ayrıcalıkları ile çalıştırmanız gerekiyorsa ve çalıştırdığınız ortamda bu otomatik olarak gerçekleşmiyorsa, uygulamanızın kısayol özelliklerinden veya görev yöneticisinden \\"Yönetici olarak çalıştır\\" seçeneğini kullanabilirsiniz. Alternatif olarak, uygulamanızın manifest dosyasını aşağıdaki gibi güncelleyebilirsiniz: \`\`\`xml <requestedExecutionLevel level=\\"requireAdministrator\\" uiAccess=\\"false\\" /> \`\`\` Bu, uygulamanızın her zaman yönetici ayrıcalıkları ile başlamasını sağlayacaktır. Bu değişiklik projenizin \`app.manifest\` dosyasında yapılmalıdır. Eğer hala başarıya ulaşamıyorsanız ve mutlaka \`PsExec64.exe\` kullanmanız gerekiyorsa, lütfen \`PsExec64.exe\` dosyasının doğru bir şekilde temp klasörüne kopyalandığından ve çalıştırılabilir olduğundan emin olun."},{"instruction":"I need a rap text in the style of Drill Fast Flow about dirty money, the struggle for a place in the area, eternal conflicts with sworn groups and the like","output":"Yo, check it, Lurkin' through the night with the crew, masked down, Steam from the sewers, our kingdom, we wear the crown, Hard-knocks life, where the hustle speaks louder, Dirty money stashin', in the trap, power devoured. (Chorus) We grind, we hustle, in shadows we flow, Drill beats pound, as fast as we go, Money got stains but we clean it up, see? In the game of the streets, ain't nothin' come free. Verse 1: Cash dirty as the conscience of a crooked politician, We make it rain, laundered through ambition, Turfs clashin’, steel flashes, no love in the collision, A sign of the times, a life chosen, no division. Concrete jungle warfare, this ain’t no playground, We fight for every inch, every street, every block crowned, Eyes on the paper, pockets on swell, But every note's a siren, to some it's a death knell. (Chorus) We grind, we hustle, in shadows we flow, Drill beats pound, as fast as we go, Money got stains but we clean it up, see? In the game of the streets, ain't nothin' come free. Verse 2: Sworn enemies lurking, behind every blurred line, Stand my ground, on the watch, every time, Mistrust and paranoia, the price of the throne, Enemies in every shadow, allies turn to stone. Whispers in the dark, they plotting our decline, Every handshake's a gamble, every word a sign, Can’t rest, can't slip, gotta stay sharp, 'Cause in this concrete jungle, the weak become shark. (Chorus) We grind, we hustle, in shadows we flow, Drill beats pound, as fast as we go, Money got stains but we clean it up, see? In the game of the streets, ain't nothin' come free. Bridge: The block's hot, sirens echo in my thoughts, Battles fought, freedom sold and bought, This money's dirty, but it fuels the dreams, Of children born to nightmares, ripped at the seams. Outro: So we keep moving, fast flow, drill in the spine, The streets keep turning, sun won’t shine, Dirty money, dirty hands, but this life’s ours, Building empires in minutes, not hours. (Chorus) We grind, we hustle, in shadows we flow, Drill beats pound, as fast as we go, Money got stains but we clean it up, see? In the game of the streets, ain't nothin’ come free. Outro Chant: Fast flow, dirty cash, in the streets we dash, Fast flow, drill’s beat, never crash, just lash, Fast flow, dirty cash, in the struggle we smash, Fast flow, drill's heat, in the night we flash. Remember, the life portrayed in many rap songs including dealing with dirty money and lingering conflicts can glamorize a lifestyle that carries significant consequences and can harm individuals and communities.

A few potential issues with this approach could prevent the registry edit: 1. PsExec must be run with administrative privileges to modify the registry, especially for \`HKLM\`. Ensure your parent application is running as an administrator. 2. The \`-i\` and \`-s\` flags in the command line instruct PsExec to run the process interactively (\`-i\`) and under the System account (\`-s\`). Verify if both flags are necessary for your purpose. 3. Ensure that the path to the registry key and the value passed to PsExec are both correct and that the use of quotes is appropriate for the command line. 4. Make sure that \`PsExec64.exe\` is being copied correctly to the temporary path and that it is a valid executable. 5. Verify the PsExec command is accurate by running it manually from an elevated command prompt, to confirm it's able to make the desired registry changes. 6. The \`Process.Start\` method may not throw an exception even if the PsExec execution fails. To check for errors, you can start a \`Process\` instance, redirect its standard output and error streams, and read those to obtain any error messages produced by PsExc. Here's an example of how to capture the output and error streams from the process: \`\`\`csharp Process process = new Process(); process.StartInfo.FileName = tempExePath; process.StartInfo.Arguments = @\\"-i -s reg add \\"\\"HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesSystem\\"\\" /v \\"\\"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin\\"\\" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\\"; process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true; process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true; process.Start(); process.WaitForExit(); string output = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd(); string error = process.StandardError.ReadToEnd(); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(error)) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Error: \\" + error); } \`\`\` By capturing the output and errors, you can troubleshoot the root cause of why the registry key isn't being added as expected. As a side note, performing operations that require elevated privileges programmatically should be done with caution, as they can pose significant security risks. Always ensure that your application's purpose and behavior are transparent to the user and that they consent to any system changes."},{"instruction":"Şu çıktıyı verdi PsExec could not start s: Sistem belirtilen dosyay² bulam²yor.","output":"Verdiğiniz hata mesajı, PsExec'in çalıştırmaya çalıştığı işleme (\\"s:\\") başlayamadığı ve sistemin belirtilen dosyayı bulamadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

TrustedInstaller, Windows bileşenlerini yönetmek için kullanılır ve sistem dosyaları ile kayıt defteri anahtarlarının korunmasında rol oynar. Sistemi bozmanızı engellemek için bu güvenlik özelliği yerine getirilmiştir. Ancak, TrustedInstaller'ın sahip olduğu bir kayıt defteri anahtarını değiştirmeniz gerekiyorsa, genellikle bu işlemi manuel olarak yapmanız önerilir ve bu işlemi bir yazılım aracılığıyla otomatikleştirmek riskli olabilir. Kayıt defteri anahtarının sahipliğini alıp gerekli izinleri elde ettikten sonra değişiklik yapmanız gereken adımlar şunlardır: 1. \`regedit\` veya başka bir kayıt defteri düzenleyicisi aracılığıyla anahtara gidin. 2. Sağ tıklayıp \`Permissions\` seçeneğine gidin. 3. \`Advanced\` seçeneğine tıklayın ve ardından \`Owner\` sekmesine gidin. 4. Sahipliği \`Administrators\` grubuna ya da mevcut kullanıcıya devredin. 5. Sahiplik değişikliğini uygulayın ve bu arada gereken izin değişikliklerini yapın. 6. Şimdi, gerekli değişiklikleri manuel olarak uygulayabilirsiniz. Bu işlemi programatik olarak yapmak tehlikeli olabilir çünkü sistemi bozma riski taşır. Ayrıca, TrustedInstaller'ın sahip olduğu bileşenlerin güncellemeleri veya yamaları tarafından değiştirilebilme potansiyeli vardır, bu nedenle bu tür değişiklikler uzun vadeli olarak sürdürülebilir olmayabilir. Eğer gerçekten programatik olarak bu işlemi yapmanız gerekiyorsa, \`subinacl\` gibi araçları kullanarak kayıt defteri anahtarının sahipliğini ve izinlerini değiştirebilirsiniz. Fakat yine de, bu işlemin yüksek dikkat ve özen gerektiren bir işlem olduğunu ve sadece sistemi derinden anlayan birisi tarafından yapılması gerektiğini unutmayın. Windows güvenlik modellerinin karmaşıklığı ve TrustedInstaller tarafından korunan bileşenlerin hassasiyeti göz önünde bulundurulduğunda, bu işlemi otomatikleştirmek yerine manuel yöntemlerin kullanılması tavsiye edilir."},{"instruction":"Ya of sana sadece dediklerimi yap c#uygulamam bunu otomatik yapmalı PsiExec trusted ınstaller yetkisi yok alternatifi ne kullanabiliriz ?","output":"Uygulamanızın TrustedInstaller düzeyinde izinlerle kayıt defterinde değişiklik yapabilmesi için bir alternatif yöntem arıyorsanız ve PsExec böyle bir yetkinin kullanılmasını sağlamıyor ise, kayıt defteri izinlerini programatik olarak değiştirmenizi sağlayacak araçlar veya yöntemler kullanmalısınız. Bunlar genelde yüksek risk taşıyan işlemler olduğundan, çok dikkatli olunmalıdır. Bir kayıt defteri anahtarının sahipliğini değiştirmek için \`SetACL\` veya \`SubInACL\` gibi komut satırı araçlarını kullanabilirsiniz. Bu araçlar genellikle dosya ve klasör izinlerini yönetmek için kullanılsa da, kayıt defteri anahtarları üzerinde de izinlerle ilgili değişiklikler yapabilir. Aşağıda, SetACL kullanarak kayıt defteri anahtarının sahipliğini nasıl değiştireceğiniz hakkında basit bir örnek verilmiştir: 1. İlk olarak SetACL'yi indirin ve sistemde uygun bir yere çıkarın. 2. SetACL'yi C# uygulamanızdan aşağıdakine benzer bir komut ile çalıştırın: \`\`\`csharp string setAclPath = \\"C:pathtoSetACL.exe\\"; // SetACL'nin yolu string keyPath = \\"HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesSystem\\"; // İzinlerini değiştireceğiniz anahtar yolu string command = \\"{setAclPath} -on \\"{keyPath}\\" -ot reg -actn setowner -ownr \\"n:Administrators\\"\\"; // ProcessStartInfo ile process başlatın ve yönetici olarak çalıştırın ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo() { FileName = \\"cmd.exe\\", Arguments = \\"/c \\"{command}\\"\\", Verb = \\"runas\\", // Yönetici olarak çalıştır UseShellExecute = true }; // Processi başlat Process proc = Process.Start(startInfo); proc.WaitForExit(); // İşlemin bitmesini bekle // İzinleri değiştirmek için başka bir SetACL komutu daha kullanın. \`\`\` Bu komut, \`Administrators\` grubuna kayıt defteri anahtarının sahipliğini verir. Benzer şekilde, izinlerin değiştirilmesi gerekiyorsa, SetACL ile \`actn\` parametresini değiştirerek izin ekleme veya çıkarma işlemleri yapılabilir. Ancak, bu tür değişiklikleri yapmadan önce, potansiyel riskleri ve sistemin istikrarını tehlikeye atma olasılığını dikkate almanız gerektiğini unutmayın. Mümkünse, bu tür düşük seviye değişikliklerden kaçının ve kullanıcılara uygulamanızın ne tür değişiklikler yaptığını, bu değişikliklerin olası sonuçlarını bildirin. Son olarak, bu işlemleri yapmadan önce yedekleme yapılması ve güvenlik önlemlerinin alınması şiddetle önerilir. Bu işlemler, yalnızca Windows sistemlerinin derinlemesine anlaşılması durumunda ve yeterli testler yapıldıktan sonra gerçekleştirilmelidir."},{"instruction":"Смотри, мне нужно создать двусвязный список result из некой структуры данных.

Here are a few key considerations: 1. Secure and Encrypted Communication: Look for a service that provides end-to-end encryption for your calls to ensure privacy. 2. Anonymous Registration: Choose a service that allows you to sign up and create an account without requiring personal information or email verification. 3. Masking Caller ID: Ensure the service offers the option to mask your caller ID or display a different phone number for the recipient. 4. Proxy or VPN Support: Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) or a proxy server to further enhance your anonymity. Look for VoIP services that are compatible with such tools. 5. Payment Methods: If you prefer complete anonymity, opt for services that accept anonymous payment methods like cryptocurrency or prepaid cards. 6. Third-Party Recording: Check if the service records any data regarding your conversations, as this may affect your anonymity. Some potential VoIP services that prioritize privacy and anonymity are RingVPN, Jitsi, or Signal.

It is a software application that allows users to make voice over IP (VoIP) phone calls using their computer or mobile device. MicroSIP works by connecting to a VoIP service provider or a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) server. SIP is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating a two-way communication session over the internet. MicroSIP uses the SIP protocol to establish and manage voice calls. To use MicroSIP, you need an internet connection and an account with a VoIP service provider or SIP server. You log in to the software using your credentials (username, password, and server details) provided by your service provider. Once logged in, you can dial phone numbers or call other users who have SIP addresses. MicroSIP allows you to make and receive calls, configure call settings, and manage contacts. It supports various audio codecs to ensure the best voice quality during the calls.

His dad has blonde hair, some stubble and glasses. He is dressed in a jacket, blue plaid shirt and a fur hat. They are going home from the store.

SON, a sprightly boy with wide, inquisitive eyes, balances a bag of groceries in his arms. He looks up to his father with a mixture of admiration and curiosity. His breath forms little clouds of mist as he speaks excitedly. SON: (With a bright smile) Hey, Dad! You never finished telling me about the cool stuff you did today at the movie set! What was it like? DAD, a rugged yet youthful figure, tilts his fur hat back slightly, revealing a few stands of disheveled blonde hair peppered with the falling snow. He pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose and smiles at his son, his stubble catching the fading light. DAD: (Chuckles lightly) Well, it was pretty exciting, actually. We had to create a massive lightning strike that hits an old haunted house. Took us almost the whole day to rig the electrical equipment just right. But, you should've seen it! It looked so real. The son looks up, his eyes sparkling with awe and excitement. He clearly idolizes his dad's adventurous work. SON: (Glancing up at him with stars in his eyes) Wow! So, you're like a wizard with electricity! DAD: (Laughs heartily) I guess you could say that. Though, making those effects safe and convincing isn't magic—it's science and a bit of creativity. They approach a small wooden bridge that crosses a frozen creek. Dad places his hand gently on his son's shoulder, urging him to pause and take in the stillness around them. DAD: (Continues with a thoughtful tone) But remember, even though I love my job as an FX artist, most days I'm out there fixing power lines and keeping the lights on for everyone. That's important too, you know? SON: (Looking up with newfound understanding) So, you're kind of like a hero as well! Keeping us warm and letting us see in the dark. DAD: (With a humble nod) Every job has its own way of helping people. I like to think that even the smallest things can make a big difference. They resume walking, turning onto a path that leads to a cozy-looking house with smoke gently billowing from the chimney. SON: (With determination) I can't wait to grow up. I want to be just like you, Dad—creating magic and helping people! DAD: (Glances at his son proudly and ruffles his hair) And you will, kiddo. You've got all the time in the world to find your own kind of magic. But for now, how about we use a bit of our own magic to turn this bag of groceries into a feast?

For instance, if one station is named \\"Palace\\" and another is \\"Pala Private Bus Stand\\", and a user searches for \\"Pala\\", both stations would be matched. Please verify whether the database query is accurate and test the code thoroughly. Adjustments may depend on your application-specific details, including ActiveRecord relations and the actual database implementation you're using.

This specific error could result from multiple causes, including issues earlier in the code or an incorrect use of quotes or parentheses. Let's verify the code. The error may not necessarily be on the line with \`trips = []\`. It could be due to a syntax issue before this line. For example, if a parenthesis or quote is not closed properly, Ruby might see the variable declaration \`trips = []\` as an error because it's looking for a closing \`)\` or quote.

Here's how you can modify your code to use SetACL.exe for setting registry permissions: \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.IO; using System.Reflection; class Program { static void Main() { string tempExePath = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), \\"SetACL.exe\\"); using (var stream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(\\"YourAssembly.Namespace.SetACL.exe\\")) using (var fileStream = new FileStream(tempExePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write)) { stream.CopyTo(fileStream); } // Arguments for SetACL to modify the registry key permission string args = @\\"-on \\"\\"HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesSystem\\"\\" -ot reg -actn setowner -ownr \\"\\"n:Administrators\\"\\"\\"; // Start the SetACL process Process processStart = new Process(); processStart.StartInfo.FileName = tempExePath; processStart.StartInfo.Arguments = args; processStart.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; processStart.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true; processStart.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true; processStart.Start(); processStart.WaitForExit(); // Read the output string output = processStart.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd(); string error = processStart.StandardError.ReadToEnd(); // Do something with the output if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(output)) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Output: \\" + output); } // If an error occured, write it to the console if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(error)) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Error: \\" + error); } // Delete the temporary executable file File.Delete(tempExePath); } } \`\`\` Please note the following: - You'll need to replace the \`\\"YourAssembly.Namespace.SetACL.exe\\"\` with the actual path to your SetACL.exe resource in the assembly. - This code assumes that you have the rights to copy and execute files in the temporary directory. - The arguments for SetACL are different from those for PsExec, so you must adjust them according to what you wish to achieve with the permissions. In this example, I'm using a command that sets the owner of the registry key to the Administrators group. You'll want to tailor the command to fit your actual needs. - Always ensure that you have sufficient permissions to run such operations and that you understand the implications of changing permissions on system objects. Please consult the official SetACL documentation for more detailed information on the possible arguments and options you can use with SetACL: https://helgeklein.com/setacl/documentation/command-line-version-setacl-exe/ Remember to test your code thoroughly in a safe environment before deploying it to production, as changing system permissions can have significant effects on system stability and security."},{"instruction":"Admin yetkisi değil TrustedInstaller yetkisi ile yapmalı","output":"TrustedInstaller, Windows'ta yüksek güvenlik düzeyine sahip özel bir hesaptır ve belli başlı sistem dosyalarının ve kayıt defteri anahtarlarının korunmasında rol oynar.

However, depending on what you exactly mean by that, there could be a few related terms: 1. **Flattening**: When you take a structure that is hierarchical or nested and lay it out in a single-line or single-layer format, it's sometimes referred to as \\"flattening\\". However, this term is more commonly used with data structures like lists or arrays rather than blocks of code. 2. **Inlining**: This term is used when block code or functions are expanded into their calling location to potentially increase performance by eliminating function calls. In another context, CSS or JavaScript can also be \\"inlined\\" within HTML rather than being in separate files. 3. **Code Expansion**: Some programming environments have features that can take compacted or shorthand code and expand it into its fuller form for readability or debugging purposes. 4. **Minification/Beautification**: Although not a direct answer to your question, these are processes related to the formatting of code. Minification reduces code to its smallest size (often by removing whitespace and newlines), while beautification (or pretty printing) reformats compressed or minified code into a more readable, multi-line format. The reverse of minification could be said to display a block of minified code into single lines with proper indentation. If you are referring to a specific aspect of programming or a tool that has a unique feature, there might be a specific term for that process within that context.

However, it neither reverts nor indicates a problem if the inflationControl returns false. It simply skips the _mint operation silently. This could cause confusion and inconsistency in the expected behavior of the mint function. Although this isn’t a direct vulnerability that risks funds or the integrity of the contract state, it’s a logical flaw that could impact the intended economics by allowing minting without properly signaling failure when inflation control checks fail. Hypothetical Exploit Scenario: A user (or minter) trying to mint tokens interacts with the mint method and passes an amount that exceeds the current supply cap permitted by the inflationRemainder. Due to the lack of explicit failure notification, the user receives no tokens but is not informed that the operation was blocked due to inflation controls. This could lead to confusion and result in repeated transactions by the user attempting to mint, costing unnecessary gas usage without successful token generation. While the contract’s funds and state aren’t directly at risk, this logic flaw can negatively impact user experience and the intended token economics of the system. Recommendation: An explicit revert should occur within the mint function if the inflationControl returns false, to clearly indicate the operation has exceeded the allowed inflation bounds: function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external { // Access control if (msg.sender != minter) { revert ManagerOnly(msg.sender, minter); } // Ensure minting is within the inflation bounds before proceeding if (!inflationControl(amount)) { revert SomeErrorExceedingInflationBound(); } _mint(account, amount); } Evidence: The evidence is derived from the logical flow within the code itself, where the failure to mint due to inflation constraints does not revert the transaction or provide feedback. Severity: Medium - The contract does not risk unexpected minting beyond the inflation control, but lacks proper error handling and feedback, leading to a potentially poor user experience and unclear behavior. High-Quality Bug Report: - Summary: Ineffective Inflation Control in Minting Process. - Severity: Medium. - Vulnerable Part: The mint function will silently fail to mint tokens without properly indicating the failure when the requested amount exceeds the inflation control checks. - Impact: Could lead to confusion among minters when tokens aren’t minted and no clear failure notification is provided, undermining the clarity of the minting functionality. - Recommendation: Modify the mint function to include a revert with a clear error message when the inflation control check fails. - Proof of Vulnerability: The logical flow of the mint function when inflationControl returns false, which currently skips minting but does not revert or generate a failure event. This evaluation is based on the code provided and is not a substitute for a comprehensive security audit.

The \`mint\` function checks if the amount to be minted is within the inflation boundaries by calling the \`inflationControl\` function. However, if \`inflationControl\` returns \`false\`, indicating that the minting exceeds the allowed inflation limits, the \`mint\` function merely skips the \`_mint\` operation without reverting or notifying the caller that the minting was not performed due to inflation control checks. I'll outline how this fits with the vulnerability you described: 1. **Vulnerable Code**: The code snippet of interest is \`\`\`solidity function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external { // Access control if (msg.sender != minter) { revert ManagerOnly(msg.sender, minter); } // Check the inflation schedule and mint if (inflationControl(amount)) { _mint(account, amount); } } \`\`\` The function checks whether \`msg.sender\` is the minter and if the \`amount\` to be minted is allowed by the \`inflationControl\` function. 2. **Evidence**: The provided function doesn't revert if \`inflationControl\` returns \`false\`. 3. **Severity**: You have correctly marked this as medium severity since it does not directly pose a risk to the contract's fund or integrity, but rather results in a logical flaw affecting user experience and clarity on the token economics. 4. **Recommendation**: To address this issue, a \`revert\` with a clear error message when the \`inflationControl\` fails is appropriate. 5. **Proof of Vulnerability**: The proof lies in the function's logical flow where \`inflationControl(amount)\` returns \`false\`. The function will end without executing \`_mint\`, without any error message or event indicating failure to mint due to the inflation controls. Your hypothetical exploit scenario and the recommendation to handle the situation by adding a revert statement within the \`mint\` function are fitting for fixing the vulnerability. To correct this, the logic should be adjusted to: \`\`\`solidity function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external { // Access control if (msg.sender != minter) { revert ManagerOnly(msg.sender, minter); } // Ensure minting is within the inflation bounds before proceeding if (!inflationControl(amount)) { revert SomeErrorExceedingInflationBound(); } _mint(account, amount); } \`\`\` Make sure to define \`SomeErrorExceedingInflationBound\` appropriately within your Solidity file or replace it with a suitable error message or event that can inform of the transaction's failure due to inflation control checks. Your assessment is validated by the provided code, and the presented evidence underscores the need for explicit failure notifications in smart contract functions, particularly those controlling crucial aspects like token minting and supply caps."},{"instruction":"confirm and prove it’s valid and correct with evidence and real value","output":"Given the code snippet and analysis provided, I can affirm that your assessment appears to be valid. The \`mint\` function in the OLAS smart contract does have a missing revert when the \`inflationControl\` function returns \`false\`, which indicates that the mint request exceeds the allowed inflation. As this is a theoretical evaluation, let me walk through the process to prove the validity of your assessment: 1. **Reviewing the \`mint\` function**: We can see that the \`mint\` function does not have a \`revert\` or \`require\` statement to handle the case when \`inflationControl\` returns \`false\`. This is the root cause of the issue as no tokens will be minted when this happens, yet there is no indication to the user that their request was denied. 2. **Reviewing the \`inflationControl\` function**: This function returns a boolean value indicating whether the requested mint amount is within the allowed boundaries. If the function returns \`false\`, it suggests that the amount to be minted would exceed the inflation limit. 3. **Expected Behavior**: The expected behavior in this scenario would be that the contract denies the minting transaction and informs the user (through a failed transaction) that the minting request was not permissible due to exceeding the inflation boundaries. 4. **Issue Confirmation**: To confirm that the contract functions as described, one can deploy the contract to a test network (such as Rinkeby or Ropsten), try to mint an amount that would exceed the inflation limits, and observe the contract's response. If the \`mint\` function does not revert, that would be practical evidence confirming the issue. 5. **Real Value**: Real value could refer to the impacts of this issue on a deployed contract. Since no actual token transaction occurs without the \`_mint\` being called, no tokens would be incorrectly allocated, preserving the integrity of the supply cap. However, users could potentially waste gas by trying to execute mint transactions that are destined to fail silently. The absence of an error message could lead to user confusion about why their transaction did not result in new tokens being minted. 6. **Solution**: The solution is to add proper error handling in the contract. The revised \`mint\` function should include a conditional statement that throws an error when \`inflationControl\` returns \`false\`. This way, users receive immediate feedback indicating why their transaction failed. In summary, while I can conceptually confirm the validity of your assessment and use theoretical reasoning to substantiate it, to officially prove such a vulnerability would typically require direct interaction with the contract in question (on a test network or via static/dynamic analysis tools).

This could potentially cause the contract to fail or behave unexpectedly","output":"The contract you've provided is quite advanced in its design and combines a variety of features involving token burning, voting power delegation, and token rebase distribution. The function \`_decrementVotesUntilFree\` comes from the \`ERC20MultiVotes\` extension and is used to update the voting power associated with the balances of accounts in a token that has vote tracking features. Examining the \`transfer\` and \`transferFrom\` functions, it appears that \`_decrementVotesUntilFree\` is indeed called before invoking the actual transfer logic via \`ERC20RebaseDistributor.transfer(to, amount)\` and \`ERC20RebaseDistributor.transferFrom(from, to, amount)\` respectively. This is crucial because the voting power calculation must reflect the balance of tokens at the time of the transfer, so any alterations to voting power should represent the state after the tokens are transferred, not before. By decreasing voting power prior to the transfer, the contract risks misaligning the sender's voting power with their actual token balance. If the sender's voting power is diminished first and then the transfer fails for any reason (due to additional logic in \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\` or due to some other condition), the sender would have incorrectly reduced voting power without a corresponding decrease in their token balance. To make sure the balance and the voting power stay consistent, the adjustment of the voting power should occur after the successful transfer of tokens. Here's a revised version of the \`transfer\` and \`transferFrom\` functions, showing the actual token transfer occurring before the decrease of voting votes: \`\`\`solidity function transfer( address to, uint256 amount ) public override(ERC20, ERC20MultiVotes, ERC20RebaseDistributor) returns (bool) { bool success = ERC20RebaseDistributor.transfer(to, amount); if (success) { _decrementVotesUntilFree(msg.sender, amount); // Adjust votes after transfer } return success; } function transferFrom( address from, address to, uint256 amount ) public override(ERC20, ERC20MultiVotes, ERC20RebaseDistributor) returns (bool) { bool success = ERC20RebaseDistributor.transferFrom(from, to, amount); if (success) { _decrementVotesUntilFree(from, amount); // Adjust votes after transfer } return success; } \`\`\` With this modification, the voting power would only be updated once the transfer operation is confirmed to be successful, thus avoiding any inconsistency between the token balance and voting power. Without access to the full contract code for \`ERC20MultiVotes\` and \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\`, it is not possible to definitively say that the original code has a flaw. However, the principle that voting power should reflect the current token balance is a sound design principle for vote-empowered tokens, and the suggested revision better aligns with this principle. Please note that as with any changes to smart contract logic, thorough testing—including unit tests and possibly formal verification—would be necessary to ensure that these changes do not introduce new issues or vulnerabilities."},{"instruction":"if you can show how that can revert 🤔 that would be useful, because I think it works fine, the user may have un-delegated voting power or 0 un-delegated voting power, in all cases they have a balanceOf greater than or equal to the delegated power so the transfers should work","output":"If I understand correctly, you're asking for clarification on whether the \`_decrementVotesUntilFree\` function could cause a revert in the transfer process due to insufficient undelegated voting power. This concern is valid in a system where users have delegated their votes to others, and the system needs to maintain the invariant that a user cannot transfer more tokens than their undelegated voting power. The \`_decrementVotesUntilFree\` function, as suggested by its name and your description, seems designed to adjust a user's voting power downward before a token transfer occurs. This ensures that a user's remaining voting power is still backed by their token balance post-transfer. However, you indicated that the contract should handle situations where a user's entire balance is either free (not delegated) or where a transfer does not violate the voting rules. If these conditions are true, then the logic for decreasing votes in \`_decrementVotesUntilFree\` should not cause a transfer to fail. Let's clarify a few points: 1. **Balance vs. Voting Power**: Each token holder has a \`balanceOf\` tokens, which can be different from their available voting power. If a token holder has delegated some of their voting power, only the undelegated portion of their balance is free to be transferred. 2. **Voting Power Adjustment**: Adjusting the voting power before the transfer ensures that users cannot transfer tokens they have already used to delegate voting power. The contract's check itself (if implemented with this logic) should not cause a revert; instead, it's the user's attempting to transfer more tokens than their undelegated balance that would be the reason for the revert. 3. **Successful Transfer Condition**: In the context you have described, where every user's \`balanceOf\` is greater than or equal to their delegated voting power, transfers should always succeed because the logic within \`_decrementVotesUntilFree\` should only be decrementing votes that are not locked up in delegation. Therefore, the condition for a successful transfer is that the tokens being transferred are free tokens, not tokens that have been used to delegate voting power. To answer the possibility of revert: If the contract is correctly tracking the delegation of voting power and is designed to prevent the transfer of delegated power, the only scenario where a revert could happen is when a user tries to transfer more tokens than their undelegated balance. This is not a flaw in the contract design but rather an enforcement of the rules that govern voting power and token transferability. It's important to keep in mind that without the full context of the contract's logic and state management (especially around delegation and voting power), we're speculating on the intended behavior. However, based on standard practices and your description of the system, it seems that the contract would only revert if users violate the governance rules set by the token. The initial description implies the contract should be working as designed, avoiding anyunexpected reverts due to the decrementing of votes prior to transferring tokens."},{"instruction":"NOW WHERE IS THE VULNERBAILITY IS STILL EXIST","output":"Based on the description and the code provided for the \`CreditToken\` contract, here are some potential areas of concern that could warrant closer examination for vulnerabilities: 1. **Delegated Voting Power vs Token Balance**: The contract uses a multi-vote system where users can delegate their voting power. It is crucial to ensure that the balance and delegated voting power are always in sync. The function \`_decrementVotesUntilFree\` suggests that there are checks to make sure that a user cannot transfer more tokens than they have in undelegated balance. If these checks are not accurate or can be bypassed, it would create a vulnerability where users could transfer tokens, affecting the total voting power inappropriately. 2. **Minting Process**: The \`mint\` function is restricted to addresses with the \`CoreRoles.CREDIT_MINTER\` role. It is vital to verify that the governance around who can assign and revoke this role is secure, as the ability to mint new tokens can drastically affect the token's economy. 3. **Permissions and Access Control**: The contract calls for role-based access control. If the implementation of roles is flawed, individuals without the proper authority could execute privileged functions, creating vulnerabilities in the contract's governance. 4. **Rebase Logic**: The contract extends \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\`, whose logic is not fully visible in the snippet provided. Rebasing tokens can have complex interactions that need careful auditing, particularly to avoid vulnerabilities where rebase calculations might be exploited. 5. **Interaction with External Contracts**: Although not explicit in your provided code, it is common for ERC-20 tokens to interact with external contracts, such as when participating in staking, lending, or liquidity provision algorithms. Any such interactions could introduce vulnerabilities if the external contracts have bugs or if the interfaces between them are not secure. 6. **Upgradeability and External Dependency**: The contract imports from \`@openzeppelin\` contracts, which is a good practice as these are thoroughly audited. However, if any of these contracts were to be upgradeable proxies or if there were upgrades in dependency contracts that aren't audited with the same diligence, it could introduce vulnerabilities. Since we cannot see the entire contract codes for \`ERC20MultiVotes\` and \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\`, some issues would require context from these parts of the system to fully analyze potential vulnerabilities. To assert that there is no vulnerability, a full audit by a professional security firm would be necessary, involving: - Reviewing the entire source code, not just snippets. - Understanding the context and the deployment of the smart contract. - Testing each function and its interactions with possible edge cases. - Static and dynamic analysis using tools that help in discovering known vulnerability patterns. - Comprehensive testing with a set of unit and integration tests. It's worth mentioning that smart contract vulnerabilities can often be subtle and not immediately clear from a quick review or partial code. Therefore, it is essential always to follow best practices for security, conduct thorough testing, have code audits by multiple parties, and maintain a cautious attitude toward upgrades and changes in the smart contract ecosystem."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن طريقة فتح الايفون 11 إذا نسيت رمز القفل بدون كمبيوتر","output":"إذا نسيت رمز قفل جهاز iPhone 11 الخاص بك وكنت ترغب في فتحه بدون استخدام جهاز كمبيوتر، يمكنك اتباع الخطوات التالية لإعادة الوصول إلى جهازك: 1. الاستعانة بميزة \\"فتح بواسطة Face ID\\": إذا كنت قد قمت بتحديث جهازك إلى أحدث إصدار من نظام iOS، فيمكنك استخدام ميزة Face ID لفتح الجهاز بواسطة وجهك. فما عليك سوى النقر على زر الطاقة/التأمين وتحريك الشاشة نحو وجهك للسماح لـ Face ID بالتعرف على هويتك وفتح الجهاز. 2. استخدام ميزة \\"فتح بواسطة البصمة\\": إذا كان جهازك يحتوي على مستشعر بصمات الأصابع Touch ID، يمكنك استخدامه لفتح الجهاز. قم بالضغط على زر الصفحة الرئيسية أو الزر الجانب (في حالة جهاز iPhone 11)، وضع إصبعك على مستشعر بصمات الأصابع لل Performed input. يجب أن يتعرف الجهاز على بصمتك وفتح الجهاز. 3. استعادة جهازك من خلال قائمة الاسترداد: إذا لم يكن لديك إما البصمة أو هوية الوجه الخاصة بك مسجلة على جهازك، فيمكنك استخدام خيار الاستعادة المتاح في قائمة الاسترداد. للوصول إلى القائمة، اتبع الخطوات التالية: - افتح تطبيق \\"الإعدادات\\". - انتقل إلى \\"عام\\" ثم اضغط على \\"استرداد\\". - قم بتحديد خيار \\"استعادة الحذف\\" أو \\"استعادة من iCloud\\" واتبع التعليمات لإكمال عملية الاستعادة. للقيام بذلك، ستحتاج إلى اتباع الخطوات الكاملة للأمان وإثبات أنك هو المستخدم الشرعي للجهاز باستخدام معلومات الحساب الخاص بك والرمز السري إذا تم طلبه. من الضروري أن تحتفظ بنسخة احتياطية من جهازك باستمرار على iCloud أو iTunes لتجنب فقدان البيانات في حالة فقدان رمز القفل أو عملية الاستعادة. مع الاستعانة بأحد هذه الطرق، يمكنك استعادة الوصول إلى جهاز iPhone 11 الخاص بك بسرعة وسهولة. إذا كنت تعاني من مشكلة أكبر ولا يمكنك استعادة الوصول إلى جهازك بأي طريقة، فقد يكون من الضروري الاتصال بدعم Apple للحصول على مساعدة إضافية واسترداد الحساب الخاص بك."},{"instruction":"","output":"في هذا المقال، سوف نتحدث عن طريقة فتح iPhone 11 في حال نسيت رمز القفل وذلك بدون الحاجة إلى استخدام كمبيوتر. تتضمن هذه الطرق استخدام ميزات الوجه وبصمة الأصبع المتوفرة على الجهاز. أحدث أجهزة iPhone 11 مزودة بميزة \\"فتح بواسطة Face ID\\" التي تسمح لك بفتح الجهاز باستخدام وجهك. قم بالنقر على زر الطاقة/التأمين وحرك الجهاز نحو وجهك بحيث يكون الكاميرا توجهها إليك. ستقوم ميزة Face ID بمسح وجهك وفتح الجهاز تلقائيًا إذا تم التعرف عليك. وإذا لم يكن لديك إصدار يدعم ميزة Face ID أو لم يكن لديك إعداد مسبق لها، يمكنك الاعتماد على ميزة \\"فتح بواسطة بصمة الأصبع\\". قم بالضغط على زر الصفحة الرئيسية أو زر الجانب (في حالة iPhone 11) وضع إصبعك المسجل مسبقًا على الجهاز. سيتعرف الجهاز على بصمتك ويقوم بفتح الرمز الخاص بالقفل. إذا لم يكن لديك إعداد مسبق لهاتين الميزتين أو لا تعملان على النحو المتوقع، يمكنك الاعتماد على خيار الاسترداد. للوصول إلى قائمة الاسترداد، اتبع الخطوات التالية: 1. افتح تطبيق \\"الإعدادات\\" على جهازك. 2. انتقل إلى \\"عام\\" وقم بالنقر على \\"استرداد\\". 3. حدد \\"استعادة الحذف\\" أو \\"استعادة من iCloud\\" واتبع التعليمات لإتمام عملية الاسترداد. عند استخدام هذا الخيار، قد يتطلب منك إثبات أنك المستخدم الشرعي للجهاز من خلال إدخال معلومات الحساب ورمز الإعدادات الخاص بك. ومن الأهمية بمكان القيام بنسخ احتياطية لجهازك بشكل منتظم، سواء على iCloud أو iTunes، لضمان عدم فقدان البيانات في حالة فقدان رمز القفل أو الحاجة لإجراء عملية استعادة. إذا لم تتمكن من استعادة الوصول إلى جهاز iPhone 11 الخاص بك باستخدام أي من الطرق المذكورة، فقد يكون من الأفضل الاتصال بدعم Apple للحصول على المساعدة اللازمة واستعادة حسابك."},{"instruction":"How can i read obfuscated code?","output":"Reading obfuscated code can be challenging due to the variety of techniques used to make the code difficult to understand. Obfuscation deliberately alters code to hide its purpose and logic to prevent reverse engineering, protection of intellectual property, or simply as a puzzle or challenge. Here are some steps you can follow to help you read obfuscated code: 1. Identify the Language: Ensure you know what programming language the code is written in, as this will inform the tools and approaches you use to decipher it. 2. Formatting: Start by reformatting the code to make it visually comprehensible. Use code beautifiers or formatters to indent and organize the code properly. This step can make a significant difference in readability. 3. Rename Variables and Functions: Often, obfuscation involves renaming variables and functions to meaningless names. Consider giving them descriptive names based on their apparent function or role in the code to aid in understanding their purpose. 4. Decode Encoding Mechanisms: Obfuscated code sometimes includes encoded or encrypted strings. You may need to identify the encoding or encryption methods used and decode them to get the plain text. 5. De-minify: If the code is minified (common in JavaScript), use a de-minifier or prettifier to expand it to a more readable form. 6. Understand the Obfuscation Techniques: Recognize common obfuscation techniques like opaque predicates, dead code insertion, control flow alteration, and string manipulation. Understanding these techniques makes it easier to sort out the actual code from the clutter. 7. Use Comments: Add comments to the code as you decipher its functionality. This helps you remember your findings and may assist anyone else working with the code. 8. Use Debugging Tools: Debuggers can step through the code line by line, allowing you to see the state of the program at each step. This helps in understanding what each part of the code is doing. 9. Look for Patterns: Obfuscated code can contain patterns that, once identified, reveal larger structures or repeated code blocks that you can then analyze as a whole. 10. Automated Deobfuscation Tools: There are tools like deobfuscators for specific languages (e.g., JavaScript deobfuscators like JSNice) that attempt to revert code to its original form. However, their effectiveness varies with the complexity of the obfuscation. 11. Community Help: Consider reaching out to developer communities like Stack Overflow, GitHub, or Reddit for assistance, especially if you're dealing with a popular or well-known obfuscation method. Approach the task methodically and patiently; deciphering obfuscated code can be time-consuming and complicated. It's important to note that some obfuscated code may include licensing checks or anti-tamper mechanisms, so ensure you're legally allowed to read and modify the code in question before proceeding."},{"instruction":"Chuyển đổi câu lệnh mikrotik sang câu lệnh trên ubuntu","output":"Để chuyển đổi câu lệnh từ thiết bị MikroTik sang hệ điều hành Ubuntu, ta cần phải xác định chức năng hoặc mục tiêu cụ thể của câu lệnh MikroTik để tìm ra các câu lệnh tương đương trên Ubuntu.

Để chuyển đổi sang Ubuntu, bạn cần biết rằng không có sự tương đồng trực tiếp về cú pháp, và nhiều khái niệm trong MikroTik sẽ khác đôi chút so với Ubuntu. Dưới đây là cách xử lý một số chức năng cơ bản trên Ubuntu, dựa trên những gì bạn đã viết trong script MikroTik của mình: 1. Đổi địa chỉ MAC cho một giao diện mạng: \`\`\`bash sudo ip link set dev eth0 address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx \`\`\` 2. Cấu hình PPPoE trên Ubuntu sử dụng 'ppp' và 'pppoeconf': Đầu tiên, bạn cần cài đặt 'pppoeconf' nếu nó chưa được cài đặt: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt install pppoeconf \`\`\` Sau đó, chạy 'pppoeconf' và làm theo hướng dẫn để thiết lập kết nối PPPoE: \`\`\`bash sudo pppoeconf \`\`\` 3. Để thêm nhiều kết nối PPPoE với thông số khác nhau, bạn có thể chỉnh sửa file cấu hình '/etc/ppp/peers/provider' (và tạo các file cấu hình khác dựa trên file này) hoặc thêm thông tin tương tự vào file 'chap-secrets' và 'pap-secrets' để xác thực. 4. Mặc định, Ubuntu sẽ không cung cấp tính năng tương tự như \`/interface list\` trong MikroTik để lập danh sách giao diện mạng. Bạn có thể làm điều tương tự bằng cách sử dụng các script bash. Vì Linux không có cú pháp lệnh như RouterOS, việc chuyển đổi script từ MikroTik sang Ubuntu đòi hỏi bạn phải có kiến thức về quản lý mạng trên Linux và viết script bash hoặc sử dụng các công cụ quản lý mạng khác để thực hiện cùng một nhiệm vụ. Nếu bạn cần cấu hình cụ thể cho một mục tiêu không thể chuyển đổi một cách trực tiếp từ MikroTik sang Ubuntu, bạn nên xem xét tìm kiếm hỗ trợ từ cộng đồng người sử dụng Ubuntu hoặc tìm hướng dẫn cụ thể cho từng bước bạn muốn thực hiện. Lưu ý rằng việc chuyển đổi script phức tạp như trong ví dụ trên là một quá trình không tự động và không thể thực hiện chỉ bằng một hoặc hai câu lệnh. Nó đòi hỏi sự hiểu biết về bản chất của các lệnh này và cách chúng được sử dụng trong quản lý mạng trên Linux."},{"instruction":"what does i nvlaid number in microsip m ean","output":"The term \\"invalid number\\" in microSIP refers to an error message indicating that the phone number you are trying to dial or call is not recognized or is incorrect.

65°C之间）进行。这减少了对精密恒温设备的需要，使得该技术更容易在实验室外进行，比如现场诊断。 3. **Bst DNA聚合酶**： 在LAMP反应中使用一种特殊的DNA聚合酶，Bst DNA聚合酶，它不仅具有DNA合成活性，而且能够置换链（strand displacement activity），这使得DNA在不需要循环热变换的情况下得以扩增。 4. **环形DNA结构的生成**： 在反应的初期，引物结合并形成随后作为模板的环形DNA结构。这些结构被后续的引物利用，进行持续的链扩增，产生许多互补的DNA拷贝。 5. **快速放大**： 对两个或多个区域的同时扩增以及环形DNA结构的形成大大加快了DNA的放大速度。 6. **产物检测**： LAMP反应的最终产物是多尺寸、多结构的DNA合成产物，它们可以通过几种方法检测，例如凝胶电泳、肉眼可见的白色沉淀，或利用与DNA结合的荧光染料（如SYBR Green）在紫外光下被观察到的颜色变化。 LAMP技术由于其简便、快速和高特异性的特点，已经被应用于多种疾病的检测，包括细菌和病毒感染，以及非传染性疾病的基因检测。由于不需要昂贵的设备，LAMP适合于资源有限的环境，以及需要迅速诊断的情况。"},{"instruction":"不明白，请通俗举例解释其原理","output":"当然，我们可以用一个简单的类比来理解环介导的恒温基因扩增技术（LAMP）的原理： 假设你有一张藏宝图，上面有很多标记点。但这张地图非常珍贵，你不能带走，只能在房间里面查看和复制。你想要很多份这张地图，以便可以分给其他人寻找宝藏。 在我们的比喻中，藏宝图就相当于你想要复制的DNA段，房间就是你进行DNA复制的环境。 1. **特别的标记点（特异性启动子）**： LAMP需要4至6个“标记点”来复制这张地图。这些标记点就像是特别设计的引物，它们能够“标记”出藏宝图中你感兴趣的特定部位。因为它们设计得很精确，它们只标记你要复制的那部分。 2. **房间里的大白板（恒温条件下进行）**： 想象这个房间的墙壁就像是大白板，你可以用相同颜色的笔在任意地方抄写藏宝图。在真实的LAMP反应中，这个过程发生在恒定温度下，就像整面墙壁都可供你作画，而你不需要在不同的温度下转移位置。 3. **神奇的复写笔（Bst DNA聚合酶）**： 你有一种特别的复写笔，不但颜色很鲜明，而且在你向前移动时会自动把已有的图像向后推移，让新的空间留给继续作画。Bst DNA聚合酶就像这样一支笔，它可以在DNA链上顺利地合成，同时把原有的链推开，制造出新的空间。 4. **快速转抄（环形DNA结构的生成和快速放大）**： 你首先在墙上草稿出小块地图区域的基本形状，然后利用这个草图，快速地扩展并复制整张藏宝图。在LAMP过程中，也是先形成一些小的环形DNA结构，然后快速扩大整个DNA序列。 5. **一目了然的成果（产物检测）**： 当你完成复制后，墙上会有很多颜色鲜明、大小不一的藏宝图。在LAMP实验中，你会得到很多DNA复制品，它们可以通过加入会发光的荧光染料，并在特定的光下查看颜色变化来检测。 通过这个过程，你就可以在房间内快速且大量复制藏宝图，而且只在一个温度下操作，不用到处移动。这就是LAMP的魅力所在，它允许科学家在实验室里以极高的效率和准确性来快速复制DNA。"},{"instruction":"详细解释： 肠道选择鉴别培养基 (SS、MAC)","output":"肠道选择鉴别培养基是专门用于从其他细菌中分离和鉴别肠道细菌的培养基。这些培养基含有抑制大部分非目标细菌生长的化合物以及鉴别目标肠道细菌种类的化学指示剂。在临床微生物学和食品安全检测领域，常用的肠道选择鉴别培养基包括Salmonella-Shigella (SS) 培养基和MacConkey (MAC) 培养基。 **Salmonella-Shigella (SS) 培养基的主要特点：** SS培养基是识别和分离沙门氏菌属（Salmonella）和志贺氏菌属（Shigella）的选择性和鉴别性培养基。这两种细菌通常是引起细菌性食物中毒和肠炎的重要病原体。 1. **选择性：** SS培养基含有胆盐和抗生素，如硫酸磷酸钠，它们具有抑制肠道中非目标细菌（如大肠埃希菌）生长的作用。 2. **鉴别性：** SS培养基含有乳糖和中性红染料作为pH指示剂。沙门氏菌和志贺氏菌一般不发酵乳糖，这样在培养基中生长的菌落通常是透明或无色的，而那些能够发酵乳糖的肠道菌如大肠埃希菌则产生酸，导致中性红变色，形成红色或粉红色的菌落。 **MacConkey (MAC) 培养基的主要特点：** MAC培养基是用来分离革兰氏阴性肠道杆菌，并区分其是否能发酵乳糖。它广泛用于检测细菌性食物中毒及水质的卫生检测等领域。 1. **选择性：** 类似于SS培养基，MAC培养基含有胆盐和晶体紫等抑制剂，抑制革兰氏阳性细菌的生长，从而有利于肠道内革兰氏阴性杆菌的分离。 2. **鉴别性：** MAC培养基中含有乳糖和中性红等pH指示剂。乳糖发酵阳性的肠道杆菌（如大肠埃希菌）会产生酸性产物，导致pH降低，中性红因此变色，使得菌落显现为红或粉红色。相反，那些不能发酵乳糖的菌（如沙门氏菌）则呈现原色或浅色的菌落。 **小结：** 总之，SS和MAC培养基都是肠道细菌选择鉴别培养基，它们通过特征成分（选择性抑制剂和pH指示剂）来筛选目标细菌并根据其代谢特性进行鉴别。使用这些培养基可以有效分离和诊断特定的肠道细菌，对于临床诊断和公共卫生监测具有重要的意义。"},{"instruction":"详细解释肥达反应","output":"肥达反应（Fehling's reaction）是一个化学反应，通常用来检测还原糖。这种反应是命名于德国化学家赫尔曼·冯·费林（Hermann von Fehling），他在19世纪中叶发明了这项试验。肥达试剂是由两种溶液组成的：费林A和费林B。 费林A溶液包含硫酸铜（CuSO4），其在溶液中形成蓝色的Cu^2+离子。 费林B溶液通常是含有碱性的钾钠酒石酸盐，这是复杂的化合物，包含氢氧化钠（NaOH）和酒石酸钾钠盐（KNaC4H4O6·4H2O），主要作用是提供OH^-离子并保持溶液的碱性，以及形成络合剂与Cu^2+形成络合物使铜离子保持在溶液中。 当混合这两种溶液并加热时，生成了费林试剂。这个试剂会和含有游离醛基的还原糖反应，使铜（II）离子（Cu^2+）还原为铜（I）氧化物（Cu2O），产生一种红色到砖红色的沉淀。非还原性糖在此反应条件下不会还原铜离子，因此不会产生红色沉淀。 检测过程通常如下： 1. 将等体积的费林A和费林B溶液混合，准备费林试剂。 2. 向含有待测试样品的管中加入准备好的费林试剂。 3. 将混合溶液加热沸腾几分钟。 4. 观察沉淀的形成和颜色改变。 如果样品中存在还原糖，如葡萄糖、果糖或乳糖，就会看到蓝色逐渐减退，同时出现红色或砖红色沉淀的生成。反应如下： [ Cu^{2+}(aq) + R-CHOH(糖) rightarrow Cu_2O(s) + R-COOH ] 这里，R-CHOH 表示含有醛酸基团的还原糖分子。 由于肥达反应对还原糖敏感，它常被用于尿糖检测，以诊断糖尿病。但值得注意的是，肥达试剂对所有类型的还原糖都有反应，并不特异于葡萄糖。因此，在临床上已经被更加特异性的方法所取代，例如葡萄糖氧化酶试验。此外，肥达试剂也不能区别α和β型异构体的糖，以及对于某些还原性非糖化合物也可能呈阳性反应。"},{"instruction":"详细解释： 真菌的形态学检查：真菌菌丝和孢子的形态特点 真菌的培养：真菌的菌落 ·真菌的鉴定：白念珠菌的鉴别试验","output":"在微生物学中，对真菌进行鉴定和分类是检测和诊断真菌性疾病的重要环节。这通常包括几个步骤：形态学检查、培养以及生化鉴定。 **真菌的形态学检查：** 1. **真菌菌丝**：多数真菌都有菌丝构成的菌体，这些菌丝是长而细的管状结构，可在物镜下观察。它们可以是隔膜菌丝（有横隔分隔）或无隔膜菌丝（没有横隔，形成连续的细胞）。真菌菌丝通常分为两类：营养菌丝（负责吸收水分和营养物质）和繁殖菌丝（产生孢子）。 2. **真菌孢子**：孢子是真菌的繁殖单位，可以通过分生孢子或有性孢子的形式产生。分生孢子（无性孢子）由单个细胞直接分裂形成，而有性孢子是通过两个不同个体的细胞结合产生的。真菌孢子的形状、大小、颜色和形成方式是鉴定真菌的重要特点之一。例如，镰刀菌属产生黑色或棕色的分生孢子链，白念珠菌（Candida albicans）产生无色的酵母型孢子。 **真菌的培养：** 1. **培养基**：为促进真菌的生长，通常在实验室内使用有机物丰富的培养基，如马氏培养基（Malt Agar）、马铃薯葡萄糖培养基（Potato Dextrose Agar, PDA）和血培养基。 2. **典型菌落的识别**：在培养基上，不同的真菌会长出不同形态特征的菌落。这可以包括菌落的颜色、大小、形状和边缘特征。比如，白念珠菌产生白色、湿润、光滑的菌落；而黄绿色曲霉（Aspergillus flavus）产生黄绿色，并伴随粉质到棉絮质的菌落。 **真菌的鉴定：** 针对特定真菌如白念珠菌的鉴定，可以使用以下几种方法： 1. **微观形态学**：在显微镜下观察白念珠菌可见其特征性的假菌丝、芽胞和生殖芽管。通常在露珠制片或者其他专用的制片上进行检查。 2. **CHROMagar Candida培养基**：这是一种特殊的培养基，用于分离和鉴别不同种类的念珠菌。白念珠菌在此培养基上生长会产生绿色菌落。 3. **Germ Tube Test**：白念珠菌可在血清样本中产生生殖芽管（germ tubes），这是一种快速鉴别真菌是否为白念珠菌的方法。进行试验时，将酵母细胞暴露在血液清或其他类似体液中，经过短时间孵化（2-3小时）后，白念珠菌会形成生殖芽管，这在显微镜下可以观察到。 总结来说，对真菌进行鉴定需要综合形态学检查、培养以及生化试验的结果，其中每一步都提供了不同的信息来帮助确定真菌的种类。白念珠菌作为临床上重要的病原体，可以通过多种特有的表征来区别于其他酵母和真菌。"},{"instruction":"详细解释： 患者男性，67岁，近期发生脑梗塞昏迷入住 ICU病房3周，近期出现严重肺部感染，临床 医生要求进行痰液培养并鉴定。 请问(1)此标本应如何处理？ (2)应接种什么培养基？ (3)如何确定该标本为合格标本？ (4)若该标本合格，分离培养后取单个菌落镜检发 现为革兰阴性杆菌，你认为要做哪些初步生化鉴定？ (5)若该标本不合格，你应该怎样做？ (6除痰培养外，你认为该患者还应做哪项细菌学 检查？","output":"(1) **标本处理：** 患者的痰液样本通常需要按照无菌技术采集，以避免污染。为了确保痰液样本代表下呼吸道分泌物，而不是口腔内的正常菌群，患者如果有意识且能够配合，应在清晨深咳后收集第一口痰。若患者无法主动提供痰液，可能需要使用特殊的吸引技术。一旦采集，样本应迅速送至实验室处理。 (2) **接种培养基：** 痰液样本应接种在多种不同的培养基上，从而能够培养出各种可能存在的病原微生物。常见的培养基包括： -

特征：支原体是最小的自由生活的微生物，无细胞壁，这使它们对许多常用抗生素（如青霉素）无效。这一特点还允许它们通过超微过滤器，并呈现出多变形（柔性的形态）。因此，在实验室中它们不会形成典型的革兰氏染色。 - 灵活：由于无细胞壁，支原体外膜含有类固醇，这与宿主细胞膜类似，增加了它们对环境变化的适应性。 - 疾病：支原体引起的疾病包括肺炎支原体感染、生殖器支原体感染等。它们主要通过接触传播和飞沫传播。 **衣原体 (Chlamydia)** - 特征：衣原体是革兰氏阴性细菌，并拥有独特的生活周期，通过元体（EBs）和网体（RBs）两种形式在宿主细胞内存活。元体是为了在细胞外环境中存活的传染性形态，而网体是为了在细胞内增殖的非传染性形态。 - 过程：衣原体依赖于宿主细胞来合成ATP，并以胞内寄生方式生存，不能在无宿主细胞的环境下独立复制。 - 疾病：它们可以引起多种疾病，包括性传播疾病（如沙眼衣原体感染）、淋病和肺炎等。 **立克次体 (Rickettsia)** - 特征：立克次体是小型的、革兰氏阴性细菌，同样是细胞内寄生体。它们通过节肢动物媒介（如蜱、虱子）传播给人类。 - 侵害方式：立克次体侵入并破坏宿主细胞，特别是内皮细胞，导致血管损伤和血管渗透性增加。 - 疾病：它们引起的疾病包括斑疹伤寒、岩石山斑疹伤寒、恙虫病等。 **螺旋体 (Spirochete)** - 特征：螺旋体是一组能动的、螺旋形的革兰氏阴性细菌。它们通常具有能引起细胞运动的轴丝，使其能在多种环境中游动，包括黏稠的组织中。 - 结构：螺旋体细胞的外层由被称为外膜的结构包围，这让它们针对宿主的免疫系统具有一定程度的保护作用。 - 疾病：螺旋体可以引起各种疾病，包括梅毒（由苍白螺旋体Treponema pallidum引起）、回归热（由某些硼疏螺旋体Borrelia引起）和莱姆病（由Borrelia burgdorferi引起）。 这些微生物的研究对医学特别重要，因为它们涉及到了许多复杂的疾病机制和治疗策略，包括抗生素的选择和疫苗的开发。在临床实验室中，通过各种分子生物学方法和血清学检测可以对它们进行鉴定和诊断。"},{"instruction":"这里面的血清学检验是什么：涂片染色 生化试验 血清学试验 动物试验 药敏试验","output":"血清学检验是一类在临床实验室进行的检测，它用于侦测血清中的特定抗体或抗原。这类检测基于免疫应答，特别是体液免疫反应中抗体与抗原特异性结合的原理。血清学检验广泛应用于疾病诊断、血型鉴定、检测病原体感染以及评估疫苗接种的效果。 下面分别解释您提到的各种试验： 1. **涂片染色（Smear staining）：** 这是微生物学中的一种基本技术，用于观察样本中的细菌、真菌或其他细胞。样本会被涂在载玻片上，并通过染色（如革兰氏染色或抗酸染色）的方法使细菌更容易在显微镜下观察。 2. **生化试验（Biochemical test）：** 在微生物学中，生化试验是用来确定细菌种类的一系列试验。这些试验检测细菌对特定化学物质的代谢反应，例如糖发酵、蛋白质水解、气体产生或硫化氢产生等。 3. **血清学试验（Serological test）：** 正如前面所说明的，这类试验通过检测血清中的抗体（人体对特定抗原的免疫反应产物）或抗原（通常是微生物上的表面分子）的存在和浓度来帮助诊断感染。常用血清学试验包括ELISA（酶联免疫吸附试验），凝集试验，以及西方印迹（Western Blot）等。 4. **动物试验（Animal test）：** 在某些情况下，可能需要在实验动物身上测试以便确认某些疾病的病原体或研究感染的发展过程。动物模型可以提供关于疾病机理和治疗效果的重要信息。 5. **药敏试验（Antimicrobial susceptibility test）：** 也称作抗生素敏感性测试，旨在测试微生物对不同抗生素的敏感性。这涉及将细菌接种到含有不同抗生素的平板上，并观察它们的生长情况，从而确定最适合治疗感染的抗生素。常用的技术包括盘扩散法（Kirby-Bauer方法）和微量稀释法。"},{"instruction":"详细解释：血浆凝固酶试验","output":"血浆凝固酶试验是一种临床实验室检测，用于评估和监测血液凝固系统的功能。它帮助医生诊断和治疗凝血缺陷、监控抗凝治疗（如华法林治疗）以及检测凝血相关疾病。 血液凝固是一个复杂的过程，涉及多种细胞（如血小板）和蛋白（即凝血因子）。当血管受伤时，止血过程启动血小板聚集，形成初步的栓塞。然后，凝血系统中的多个凝血因子被激活，最终将可溶性血浆蛋白纤维蛋白原（fibrinogen）转变为不可溶的纤维蛋白（fibrin）丝，形成稳固的血栓。 常见的血浆凝固酶试验包括： **1. 凝血时间（Coagulation Time，CT）：** 测量血液在体外开始凝固直到形成完整血凝块所需的时间。 **2. 凝血酶原时间（Prothrombin Time，PT）：** 评估体外血液凝固的速度，特别是凝血过程中所谓的外源性途径（因子II、V、VII和X）的功能性。 **3. 活化部分凝血活酶时间（Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time，aPTT）：** 用来测试血浆内源性凝血系统的凝血因子（因子VIII、IX、XI和XII）。 **4. 纤维蛋白原测定（Fibrinogen Level Test）：** 测定血浆中纤维蛋白原的浓度，这对凝血是必不可少的，也是红细胞聚集成栓塞的基础。 **5. 凝血因子分析（Coagulation Factor Assay）：** 当个别因子的缺陷被怀疑时，会进行特定凝血因子分析，以诊断和管理血友病A、B或其他稀有凝血因子缺陷疾病。 **6. 凝血酶生成测试（Thrombin Generation Test，TGT）：** 这是一个更为复杂的检验，能够评估凝血酶在血浆中的全面生成和衰减动态。 **7. 杜氏-罗塞尔测试（Duke's test）和艾夫曼测试（Ivy's test）** 这些为旧的检测方法，曾经用于评估凝血，如今不常用。 这些检测可用于评估患者的出血风险，以及个体对抗凝药物的反应。監測这些检测结果对于临床治疗抉择极为关键，尤其在外科手术和抗凝治疗中。此外，这些检测对于先天性和后天性出血性疾病的诊断也是基础性工具，例如，血友病患者在aPTT检测时会出现Prolonged（延长）结果。"},{"instruction":"QUESTO CODICE from transformers import pipeline # Creiamo una pipeline \\"text-generation\\" con il modello predefinito. pipe = pipeline(\\"text-generation\\", model=\\"/content/drive/Shareddrives/Mistral_8x7b\\") # Definiamo un prompt iniziale per la generazione del testo. prompt = \\"Il futuro della tecnologia è\\" return_tensors=\\"pt\\" # Generiamo le sequenze di testo usando la pipeline. # max_length determina la lunghezza massima del testo da generare (incluso il prompt), # e num_return_sequences indica quante varianti del testo generare. generated_texts = pipe(prompt, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1) # Stampiamo le sequenze generate.

Per usare un modello personalizzato che risiede in un file system locale o su una piattaforma come Google Drive, devi assicurarti di: 1. Avere il modello correttamente salvato nella posizione specificata. 2. Specificare correttamente il percorso nel parametro \`model\`. Dalla traccia dell'errore, sembra che tu stia cercando di eseguire questo codice su Google Colab o un ambiente simile e tu abbia il modello salvato su un Google Drive condiviso. Ecco alcuni passi che puoi seguire per risolvere il problema: 1. Montare il tuo Google Drive nell'ambiente di esecuzione (se non hai già fatto): \`\`\`python from google.colab import drive drive.mount('/content/drive') \`\`\` In questo modo, il tuo Google Drive sarà disponibile come una cartella in \`/content/drive\` nell'ambiente di Colab. 2. Assicurati che il percorso del modello sia corretto e che il modello sia presente in quella cartella. Dovresti verificare manualmente nel tuo Google Drive che il percorso sia valido e che contenga i file del modello richiesti (ad esempio, \`config.json\`, \`pytorch_model.bin\`, ecc.). 3. Usa il percorso completo per referenziare il modello nella funzione \`pipeline\`. Sembrerebbe che tu stia già facendo questo, ma potrebbe essere necessario controllare il percorso per assicurarsi che sia corretto. Se continui a riscontrare problemi, potresti provare a caricare esplicitamente il modello usando \`AutoModelForCausalLM\` e \`AutoTokenizer\` (ad esempio, se stai usando un modello GPT): \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TextGenerationPipeline tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\\"/content/drive/Shareddrives/Mistral_8x7b\\") model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\"/content/drive/Shareddrives/Mistral_8x7b\\") pipe = TextGenerationPipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer) # poi puoi proseguire con la generazione del testo come prima \`\`\` Nota che, se non hai ancora montato Google Drive o se il percorso del modello non è corretto, riceverai un errore.

Мои дети и семья в опасности! Мы столкнулись с коррупцией, незаконным решением судьи и незаконным выселением моей семьи на улицу семьей армяней, у которых мы когда то купили дом! По факту нам противостоит целая мафия где все друг друга знают и покрывают. Сейчас я с двумя детьми и бабушкой инвалидом сижу в осаде дома уже 4 дня, нам не дают одежду и документы , которые захватили лица кавказской национальности и держат оборону дома! Нужна срочная помощь и огласка, помогите пожалуйста Суть: В 2021 году моя семья продав все имущество, приобрела дом в г.Сочи, ул Союзная 6а, сделки сопровождал «черный» риелтор, который был в сговоре с продавцами. В суде выступил свидетелем со стороны продавца. Так же он сопровождал сделки по продажам нашего предыдущего имущества. Сразу же после сделки купли –продажи предыдущие хозяева подали в суд на расторжение сделок и признание их недействительными. Первый иск у порядочного судьи мы выиграли сделки признали действительными. После продавцы переделав суть иска подали новый иск коррумпированному судье Богдановичу С.П. и выиграли все суды, не принимав все наши доводы и ходатайства во внимание. Придумав договор займа между предыдущими продавцами и покупателями данного дома которого не существует в деле, по свидетельским показаниям риелтора и родственников они выиграли 3 инстанции. Сразу же после кассации мы подали иск по вновь открывшимся обстоятельствам где дело попало к тому же судье который вновь нам отказал но вынес определение где есть право обжалования, мы подали жалобу и решение не вступило в силу. Имея родственные связи в Росреестре они переоформили на себя наш дом и в этот же день совершили захват дома при помощи 10 мужчин кавказской национальности, выгнали часть семьи на улицу раздетыми и без документов отца инвалида 2 группы, меня и моего брата. Без решения суда на выселение. Дочь с несовершеннолетними детьми, мать пенсионер инвалид 2 группы успели закрыться в одной из комнат дома. 5 сутки они сидят в осажденном доме, не выйти не зайти им не дают. Все государственные органы: Полиция куда я подавала неоднократно заявления, Прокуратура, МВД, Следственный комитет уведомлены об сложившейся ситуации где не однократно подавала заявления с присвоением КУСП. Никакой реакции, не поступает, получаем систематичные отказы. Прослеживается коррупционная составляющая, этот судья у Календжян П.М вёл идентичные суды где исковые требования удовлетворял. Исходя из изложенного, путем ввода в заблуждение суд все перечисленные лица в сговоре, причастные к продаже и покупке моей недвижимости легализовали преступную схему хищения моего имущества. На данный момент мы приобрели статус «бомжей».","output":"Подписчица из Сочи сообщает о коррупции и незаконном выселении её семьи из дома, который был куплен ранее, под угрозой со стороны армянской семьи.

The configuration file for Unreal Engine games is commonly found within the game's installation directory and is usually named something like \`Engine.ini\`, \`GameUserSettings.ini\`, or similarly depending on the game. However, be aware that modifying configuration files can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or instability in games, so it's always a good idea to make a backup of the original config file before making changes. To set up an automatic display of the FPS, you need to do the following: 1. Access the game's configuration directory, usually located in: - For games installed via Epic Games Launcher: \`C:Users<YourUserName>AppDataLocal<GameName>SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` - For games installed through Steam: \`C:Program Files (x86)Steamsteamappscommon<GameName><GameName>SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` - Or a custom path if you've installed the game elsewhere. 2. Open the \`Engine.ini\` or \`GameUserSettings.ini\` file using a text editor like Notepad. 3. Add the following lines under the appropriate section (\`[SystemSettings]\` is a common section for such tweaks), or create the section if it doesn't exist: \`\`\`ini [ /Script/Engine.Engine ] bEnableFPSChart=false \`\`\` 4. Save the file and close the text editor. 5. Start the game, and you should now see the FPS counter displayed automatically. If the game does not have a section for these settings, or if adding these lines doesn't work, you can also try using the in-game console to enable the FPS counter. You typically do this by pressing the tilde key (\`~\`) to open the console and then typing the command \`stat fps\`. Keep in mind that not all games will expose the configuration file clearly, nor accept the same INI settings, as it highly depends on what the developers have exposed and what the Unreal Engine version is.

It was selected from a numerous models (mostly all simple and more complex models as well of SKLearn) of different different parameters through optuna optimization. This model has R2 scores during training (70%), Testing (20%) and validation (10%) 0.98, 0.94 and 0.92 respectively. There's no data leakage as well and regularisation techniques were also incorporated wherever applicable. The predictions are so close during testing and validation as it can be judged from the RE scores eventhough the model has not seen the data during fit. There's also feature extraction, selection, normalisation and such data preparation methods used. Now, when it comes to predict the future during inference, it gives very ordinary predictions. Why is that case?","output":"There could be a few reasons why the model is not performing well during inference, even though it has high scores during training, testing, and validation. 1. Overfitting: The model may be overfitting the training data, as indicated by the high R2 scores during training but lower scores during testing and validation. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise or specific patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to unseen data. 2. Lack of diversity in training data: If the training data does not cover a wide range of scenarios or if it lacks diversity, the model may not have learned to generalize well to new and unseen data. This can lead to poor performance during inference when faced with new patterns or situations. 3. Data mismatch: The data used for training, testing, and validation might not represent the real-world scenario or conditions in which the model will be deployed. If the model was trained on a specific dataset that is different from the data it encounters during inference, it may struggle to make accurate predictions. 4. Concept drift: If the underlying patterns or relationships between the input features and the target variable change over time (concept drift), the model may not be able to adapt and make accurate predictions on new data. This is especially relevant when the model is used for predicting future events. 5. Inadequate feature engineering: Despite using feature extraction, selection, and normalization techniques, the feature representation used for training the model may not adequately capture the relevant patterns or information needed for accurate predictions during inference. It's possible that additional or different features may be required for better performance. To address these issues, you might consider the following steps: 1. Gather a more diverse and representative dataset that covers a wider range of scenarios. 2. Check for overfitting by evaluating the model on unseen validation or test data and consider applying regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping. 3. Continuously monitor and update the model as new data becomes available to account for concept drift. 4. Ensure that the feature engineering steps are appropriate and meaningful for the problem at hand. Consider trying different feature engineering techniques or adding more relevant features. 5. Consider using ensemble methods, averaging predictions from multiple models, or using more advanced machine learning techniques such as gradient boosting or deep learning to improve the model's performance. It is important to thoroughly analyze the model's behavior, review the data, and experiment with different approaches to identify the specific reason behind the ordinary predictions and improve the model's performance during inference."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Раскройте смысл понятия «Совнарком».

Confidentiality agreements: Many companies require employees to sign confidentiality agreements that explicitly state the consequences of leaking sensitive information, including legal penalties. These agreements act as a deterrent, discouraging employees from engaging in such activities. 2. Security protocols: Companies often have stringent security protocols in place to restrict access to source code and other sensitive information. They implement access controls, regularly monitor employee activities, and conduct audits to ensure compliance. These measures make it difficult for rogue employees to access and exfiltrate source code without being detected. 3. Limited access privileges: Companies typically limit access to source code to authorized personnel who actually require it for their work. This helps minimize the number of individuals who have access, reducing the risk of a rogue employee leaking it. 4. Monitoring and detection systems: Organizations employ various monitoring and detection systems that can identify suspicious behavior, anomalies, or unauthorized access attempts. These systems can track activities like copying, downloading, or sharing sensitive code files, making it easier to catch any rogue employees attempting to leak source code. 5. Consequences and deterrents: Companies emphasize the potential legal and career consequences associated with the unauthorized leakage of source code. Whistleblower protection laws exist to help report wrongdoing, encouraging employees to choose legal pathways if they have concerns. While these reasons make it relatively rare for source code to be leaked, it is crucial for organizations to remain vigilant, maintain secure practices, and adapt to evolving threats and tactics to protect their valuable intellectual property."},{"instruction":"show fps in any unreal engine game with this config file line","output":"To show FPS in any Unreal Engine game, you can add the following line to the config file: \`\`\` t.MaxFPSDisplayMS=10 \`\`\` This line will display the frames per second (FPS) at the top left corner of the game screen.

Start by defining a loop to continuously read commands from the user. This loop can be implemented using a while loop or any equivalent construct based on your programming language. 2. Within the loop, prompt the user to enter a command. You can display a message like \\"Enter command: \\" and then use the appropriate method/function to read the input provided by the user. 3. Once you have the user input, you can use a parsing mechanism to break down the command into its constituent parts. Common techniques for parsing include string splitting, regular expressions, or using specific parsing libraries available in your chosen programming language. 4. Parse the command input based on your application's requirements. For example, you might want to split the input into individual words to identify the command keyword and any arguments or flags provided. 5. Once you have parsed the command, you can use conditional statements or a switch-case structure to perform the appropriate action based on the command given by the user. 6. Execute the corresponding functionality associated with the command entered by the user. 7. Repeat the process by going back to step 2, allowing the user to enter additional commands until a specific termination condition is met (e.g., typing \\"exit\\"). Here's a small example in Python to illustrate the concept: \`\`\`python while True: command = input(\\"Enter command: \\") # Parse the command command_parts = command.split() # Check the command keyword and perform respective actions if command_parts[0] == \\"quit\\" or command_parts[0] == \\"exit\\": break # Terminate the loop # ... Additional conditional statements for other commands ... else: print(\\"Invalid command. Please try again.\\") print(\\"CLI app terminated.\\") \`\`\` Note: The example above is just a basic starting point. You can expand and enhance it based on your specific requirements, adding error handling, more sophisticated command parsing, modular code structure, etc."},{"instruction":"in go i meant","output":"In Go, you can use the \`bufio\` and \`os\` packages to create a CLI app that takes commands in a loop and parse them.

Bu da ona, bir cihazdaki lineer ve açısal hareketleri aynı anda ölçebilme yeteneği kazandırır. İvmeölçer bileşeni, üç boyutta lineer ivmeyi – yani yatay ve dikey hareketleri ve yerçekimi etkilerini – algılar. Jiroskop bileşeni ise, üç boyutlu uzayda açısal hızı takip ederek, bir cihazın nasıl ve ne kadar hızla döndüğünü ölçer. Gyro sensörleri, cihazın etrafındaki eksende dönme hareketini (pitch, roll ve yaw olarak adlandırılır) detekte ederek, cihazın konumunun değişkenlik gösterdiği alanlarda hassas ölçümler yapar. MPU6050 sensörü, I2C arayüzü üzerinden mikrodenetleyicilere veya başka bir ana sistemlere veri aktarabilir. I2C, entegre devrelerin birbirleriyle iletişim kurmalarını sağlayan iki telli bir protokoldür. Sensör, +/- 2g'den +/- 16g'ye kadar değişen aralıklarda ivme ölçümleri ve +/- 250 derece/saniyeden +/- 2000 derece/saniyeye kadar jiroskop ölçümleri yapabilmek üzere yapılandırılabilir.

Bunlar basit el yapımı projeler için de uygun olabilir. Ancak, ticari olarak üretilen modellerle kıyaslandığında, ev yapımı bir BLDC motor, genellikle daha az verimli ve daha düşük performanslıdır. Aşağıda, basit bir fırçasız DC motor nasıl yapılacağını anlatan temel adımlar verilmiştir: Malzemeler ve Araçlar: - Mıknatıslar (Neodimyum gibi güçlü kalıcı mıknatıslar) - Bakır tel (ince emaye kaplama tel tercihen) - Bir gövde ya da çerçeve (örneğin, plastik bir taban veya ahşap) - Mil (paslanmaz çelik veya başka bir metal çubuk) - Rulmanlar (milin düzgün dönmesini sağlamak için) - Bir stator (motorun sabit kısmı, karton veya ince metal kullanılabilir) - Elektronik kontrol devresi (ESC, fırçasız motoru çalıştırmak için) - Lehimleme ekipmanları - İzolasyon bandı - Kesme aletleri, tornavidalar ve diğer el aletleri Üretim Aşamaları: 1. **Motor Gövdesi Yapımı**: Motorun gövdesini oluşturmak için, plastic, ahşap ya da metal malzemelerden dikdörtgen şeklinde bir çerçeve kesin. Gövde, motorun tüm parçalarını destekleyecek kadar sağlam olmalıdır. 2. **Statör Yapımı**: Statörü oluşturmak üzere, karton veya ince metal plaka kullanarak silindirik bir şekil kesin. Statör, bobinlerin sarılı olduğu ve rotora, yani hareketli kısma karşı sabit duran bölgeyi temsil eder. 3. **Bobinlerin Sarılması**: Emaye kaplı bakır teli statör üzerinde belirli bir düzende sararak bobinleri oluşturun. Her bobini aynı sayıda tur ve aynı yönde sarın ki dengeli bir manyetik alan üretsinler. 4. **Mil ve Rulman Montajı**: Milin merkezi konumlandırılması için gövdeye iki rulman yerleştirin. Milin, rulmanlar aracılığıyla gövdeden geçirilmesi ve düzgün bir şekilde dönmesini sağlamak için sıkıca monte edilmesi gerekir. 5. **Mıknatısların Dizilimi**: Rotor olarak kullanılacak olan mil üzerine mıknatısları ekleyin. Mıknatıslar, alternatif olarak kuzey ve güney kutupları olacak şekilde sıralanmalıdır (N-S-N-S... şeklinde). 6. **Kablo Bağlantıları**: Bobinlerin uçlarını ESC'ye bağlayın. Bu, motorun kontrol edilmesini sağlayacak elektronik devredir. Lehimleme işlemi sırasında dikkatli olun çünkü kısa devrelere sebep olabilir. 7. **Test Etme**: Motoru ilk denemek için güç kaynağı ve ESC'yi kullanarak motoru çalıştırın ve dönüşün düzgün olduğundan emin olun. Yapısal sorunları ve dengesizlikleri giderin. Unutulmamalıdır ki, evde fırçasız DC motor yapmak eğitici ve zevkli bir hobi olabilir, ancak bu süreç hassas ayarlar, motorun düzgün çalışmasını sağlamak ve güvenlik önlemleri gerektirir.

İlk adım, metal veya plastikten yapılmış bir gövde üzerine uzun emaye kaplı bakır teli dikkatlice sararak statör bobinlerini oluşturmaktır. Üzerine sarılan tel bobinleri, belirlenen bir düzen sayesinde dengeli bir manyetik alan yaratacaktır. Daha sonra, milin gövdede merkezi bir şekilde sabit kalmasını sağlayacak şekilde iki rulman yerleştirilir. Sonrasında, mili rotor haline getirebilmek için bu mile bir dizi neodimyum mıknatıs, alternatif kutup düzeniyle (N-S-N-S...) yapıştırılır. Mil ve rulmanlar monte edildikten sonra, motorun sabit ve hareketli parçaları uygun bir formatta birleştirilerek bobinler statöre ve rotor da miline sabitlenir. Bobinlerin başlangıç ve bitiş noktaları ESC'ye, motorun hızını kontrol etmek için lehimlenecektir. Tüm bağlantılar tamamlandıktan sonra, motorun düzgün çalışması için bir test aşamasıyla devam edilir. Bu test sırasında, motorun dengesi, bağlantıların sağlamlığı ve hareketin düzgünlüğü kontrol edilir ve gerekli ayarlar yapılır. Eğer dönüş düzgün değilse, mıknatıs yerleşimleri ve bobin sarım dengesi gözden geçirilir. BLDC motorların en önemli avantajlarından biri, fırçalı motorlara kıyasla daha yüksek verimlilik ve uzun ömürlü olmalarıdır; ancak el yapımı motorlarda bu performansı elde etmek için dikkatli ve hassas bir montaj gereklidir.

She wears a long white coat, belt, a peaked cap and gloves. She is 9'6. She has blue skin. She has a bulge in her pants. She has some nice cleavage. He is 22. He has a posh and casual attitude. He wears a nice suit. The alien soldiers have four arms and a plate-like body covering resembling an insect exoskeleton. Most notably, they have a single large eye centered in their torso. While the commander is talking to their future boss, the two alien soldiers casually chat in their home language if they'll get new weapons from their commander. The two of them hold spears. The commander seductively re-assures the human that they only need the town, not the whole planet.","output":"[The setting is a futuristic town hall repurposed as the temporary command center of the alien force. Two alien soldiers stand guard at the entrance, their chitinous armor glinting under the artificial lighting. They suavely flip their spears from hand to hand, all four arms working in perfect synchrony. Inside, Commander Zylara, towering and imposing in her long white coat and peaked cap, looms over a sleek, metallic table.] Commander Zylara: [Her voice is smooth and carries a teasing edge.] Welcome, Human. I am Commander Zylara, and as of this moment, you will administer this town for us. We come seeking precious minerals, not conquest. [She leans forward, resting her hands on the table. Her coat parts slightly, drawing attention to her form.] Human Administrator: [He adjusts his tie, offering a cheeky grin.] A pleasure, Commander. I assure you, my expertise in management is quite... extensive. And this is one offer I couldn't possibly refuse. [He glances briefly at her cleavage before regaining eye contact with a sly smile.] [Meanwhile, by the door, the two alien soldiers chat in their native, guttural clicks and whirrs.] Soldier 1: [Clicking] Hey, think the Big Blue will finally get us those plasma lances? Soldier 2: [Whirring back] Doubt it. She'll spend all the budget on those fancy boots she likes. Soldier 1: [Snickers in a series of buzzes] True, true. Fancy boots over fancy weapons, every time. [Commander Zylara, maintaining her seductive posture, continues her pitch to the Administrator.] Commander Zylara: You see, we only need access to your resources. Oh, and your cooperation, of course. Your planet has many... assets that are appealing to us. [Her gaze conspicuously drops to her own bulging pants, before sliding back up to meet his.] Human Administrator: [Chuckles, unfazed] Well, we humans are happy to be of service. Just so long as the town benefits too. Maybe throws in a new sports car for the administrator? [He winks, leaning back into his chair with feigned nonchalance.] Commander Zylara: [Laughs heartily, the sound booming around the room.] You are amusing, little man. Very well, we can consider such... fringe benefits. [The soldiers by the door exchange another glance, arms folding in unison.] Soldier 1: [Muttering] Bet he doesn't get a car. Soldier 2: [Agreeing in a chirp] Nope. But maybe boosted rations? Soldier 1: [Taps one of his spears] I'd settle for a sandwich about now. [The scene draws to a close with Zylara and the Human Administrator discussing the finer points of the mining agreement while the soldiers continue to banter about what they'll actually receive, completely unaware that their casual conversation is broadcast to the entire room via the unintended side effect of their armor's comm system, causing both the Administrator and Commander Zylara to stifle their chuckles at the soldiers' expense.]"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “I really hope Natsuki’s okay…” Sayori: “Yeah, I’m worried about her too.

Locate the config file for the specific Unreal Engine game. The config file is typically named \\"GameUserSettings.ini\\" and can be found in the game's installation directory. Note that the location of the config file may vary depending on the specific game. 2. Open the config file using a text editor such as Notepad or any other text editor of your choice. 3. Look for a section in the config file named \\"[ScalabilityGroups]\\". If this section does not exist, you can create it by adding the following lines at the end of the file: [ScalabilityGroups] sg.ResolutionQuality=100 sg.ViewDistanceQuality=3 sg.AntiAliasingQuality=3 sg.ShadowQuality=3 sg.PostProcessQuality=3 sg.TextureQuality=3 sg.EffectsQuality=3 sg.FoliageQuality=3 4. Within the \\"[ScalabilityGroups]\\" section, locate the line that corresponds to \\"sg.FrameRateLimit\\". If the line does not exist, you can add it under the \\"[ScalabilityGroups]\\" section. By default, the line may look like this: \\"sg.FrameRateLimit=0\\". The value \\"0\\" represents an uncapped framerate. 5. Change the value of \\"sg.FrameRateLimit\\" according to your preference. For example, setting \\"sg.FrameRateLimit=60\\" would cap the framerate to 60 FPS. 6. Save the changes made to the config file and close the text editor. 7. Launch the Unreal Engine game, and the FPS limit should now be adjusted according to the value you set in the config file. Please note that modifying the game's config file is done at your own risk. It is always a good idea to make a backup of the original config file before making any changes."},{"instruction":"what are useful startup options for unreal engine games?","output":"In Unreal Engine games, startup options, also known as command line arguments, can be used to configure various settings before the game launches. These options can be used to debug issues, optimize performance, or test different features. Here is a list of some useful startup options that you can use with Unreal Engine games: 1. \`-log\` - Opens a separate window to show the game's logging output. 2. \`-nosplash\` - Disables the splash screen that appears when the game starts. 3. \`-windowed\` - Starts the game in a window rather than full screen. 4. \`-resx=VALUE\` and \`-resy=VALUE\` - Sets the horizontal and vertical resolution of the game window, respectively. 5. \`-fullscreen\` or \`-full\` - Forces the game to start in fullscreen mode. 6. \`-useallavailablecores\` - Instructs the game to use all available CPU cores, which can improve performance. 7. \`-nomovie\` or \`-nostartupmovies\` - Disables startup movies that play before the game menu appears. 8. \`-dx12\`, \`-dx11\`, \`-opengl\`, or \`-vulkan\` - Forces the game to use a specific graphics API if supported by the game. 9. \`-notexturestreaming\` - Disables texture streaming, useful for debugging texture-related issues. 10. \`-sm4\` or \`-shadermodel4\` - Forces the use of Shader Model 4, potentially increasing compatibility with older GPUs at the expense of graphical features and performance. 11. \`-high\` - Gives the game process a high priority in the system, which may improve performance on some systems. To use startup options, you generally add them to the game's shortcut target path, or enter them into the console if the game has one that supports these arguments. For example, to set a game to launch in windowed mode at 1280x720 resolution, you would append the following to the game's launch shortcut: \`-windowed -resx=1280 -resy=720\` Remember that the availability and effect of these options can vary from game to game, as developers might choose to support or disable specific options for their titles. It’s also important to use these with caution, as certain options may cause unexpected behavior or interfere with the game's intended functionality. If the game you're trying to configure has official documentation, make sure to consult it as it might have a list of supported command line arguments that are specific to that game. Additionally, games developed with Unreal Engine may have their own specific set of commands that can be used in combination with the engine's general startup options."},{"instruction":"how can i toggle the fps in unreal engine games through their config file?","output":"In Unreal Engine games, you can toggle the display of the frames-per-second (FPS) counter through the configuration files, which are typically INI files located in the game's installation directory or within the user's documents directory under a subfolder for the game. The exact location of the configuration files can vary depending on the game and whether it is packaged for shipping. Here's a general guide on how to enable the FPS counter by modifying a config file: 1. Navigate to the game's configuration files directory. Common locations include: - \`C:Users[YourUsername]DocumentsMy Games[YourGame]SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` - \`[GameInstallationDirectory][YourGame]Config\` 2. Look for the \`Engine.ini\` or \`GameUserSettings.ini\` file. If the game uses a custom INI file for user settings, it may have a different name specific to the game. 3. Open the INI file with a text editor like Notepad. 4. Add the following lines to the file, usually at the bottom or under a relevant section such as \`[SystemSettings]\` or \`[Engine.Engine]\`: \`\`\`ini [Engine.Engine] bEnableOnScreenDebugMessages=true \`\`\` 5. Additionally, you may have to add or modify the following line to specifically show the FPS: \`\`\`ini [Engine.Display] ShowFPS=1 \`\`\` 6. Save the file and close the text editor. 7. Launch the game to see if the FPS counter appears on the screen. If the game doesn't show the FPS counter after these changes, it's possible that the game has locked down or overridden these settings. In such cases, you might need to resort to in-game console commands (if available) to toggle the FPS display, such as the \`stat fps\` command often used in Unreal Engine games: 1. Open the in-game console (typically by pressing the tilde key \`~\` or \`Tab\` key). 2. Type \`stat fps\` and press Enter to toggle the FPS display on or off. Alternatively, some games provide an option to show the FPS counter within their in-game settings menu, often under a \\"Display\\" or \\"Graphics\\" tab. Make sure to check there first before editing configuration files. Please note that the ability to enable the FPS counter through config files is game-dependent, and not all games will support this method. Also, modifying game files can sometimes lead to issues, so it's a good idea to create a backup of any configuration file before editing it."},{"instruction":"how can i toggle the fps counter in unreal engine games through their config file?","output":"To toggle the FPS counter in Unreal Engine games through their config file, you can follow these steps: 1.

Anyone can sacrifice tokens to rebase up the balance of all addresses that are currently rebasing. @author eswak @notice This contract is meant to be used to distribute rewards proportionately to all holders of a token, for instance to distribute buybacks or income generated by a protocol. Anyone can subscribe to rebasing by calling \`enterRebase()\`, and unsubcribe with \`exitRebase()\`. Anyone can burn tokens they own to \`distribute(uint256)\` proportionately to rebasing addresses. The following conditions are always met : \`\`\` totalSupply() == nonRebasingSupply() + rebasingSupply() sum of balanceOf(x) == totalSupply() [+= rounding down errors of 1 wei for each balanceOf] \`\`\` Internally, when a user subscribes to the rebase, their balance is converted to a number of shares, and the total number of shares is updated. When a user unsubscribes, their shares are converted back to a balance, and the total number of shares is updated. On each distribution, the share price of rebasing tokens is updated to reflect the new value of rebasing shares. The formula is as follow : \`\`\` newSharePrice = oldSharePrice * (rebasingSupply + amount) / rebasingSupply \`\`\` If the rebasingSupply is 0 (nobody subscribed to rebasing), the tokens distributed are burnt but nobody benefits for the share price increase, since the share price cannot be updated. /! The first user subscribing to rebase should have a meaningful balance in order to avoid share price manipulation (see hundred finance exploit).

They then call distribute with a large number of tokens. The newTargetSharePrice is calculated with an increased total due to the large amount, disproportionately increasing the attacker’s share price due to their significant rebasing share compared to othersThis line that calculates the new share price is this one https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/2376d9af792584e3d15ec9c32578daa33bb56b43/src/tokens/ERC20RebaseDistributor.sol#L365 uint256 newTargetSharePrice = (amount * START_REBASING_SHARE_PRICE + __rebasingSharePrice.targetValue * _totalRebasingShares) / _totalRebasingShares; __rebasingSharePrice = InterpolatedValue({ lastTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(block.timestamp), lastValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(_rebasingSharePrice), targetTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(endTimestamp), targetValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(newTargetSharePrice) }); and this __rebasingSharePrice = InterpolatedValue({The grief it’s happen when a very large amount of tokens are distributed, and the total number of rebasing shares is small. This could happen if a large number of tokens are concentrated in a few addresses, or if the rebasing supply drops to zero , In the distribute function If amount is very large compared to _totalRebasingShares, the new target share price will be significantly increased, which could disproportionately benefit the few addresses that hold a large amount of tokens if the total supply of tokens is expected to be between 1e18 and 1e28, If the total supply is towards the higher end of this range, and the number of rebasing shares is small, the new target share price could be significantly increased, potentially leading to unfair distribution of tokens.","output":"The concerns you've raised regarding the \`distribute\` function of the \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\` smart contract are rooted in how the rebasing mechanics work and the potential vulnerabilities that they may introduce. You're correct that when the \`distribute\` function is called, it recalculates a new share price for the rebasing tokens. This new share price is computed using the formula where the total amount (\`amount\`) being distributed is added to the current target share value multiplied by the total number of rebasing shares. This sum is then divided by the total number of rebasing shares to determine the new target share price: \`\`\`solidity uint256 newTargetSharePrice = (amount * START_REBASING_SHARE_PRICE + __rebasingSharePrice.targetValue * _totalRebasingShares) / _totalRebasingShares; \`\`\` This logic assumes that the \`amount\` being distributed is proportionate to the total number of shares (\`_totalRebasingShares\`). If there is a significant imbalance—say, the distribution amount is extremely large when compared to the number of rebasing shares—then this can lead to an overly inflated new target share price. Now considering the exploitative scenario you mentioned: 1. If an attacker accumulates a large number of tokens and waits until they constitute the majority (or the entirety) of the rebasing supply, they could exploit this mechanism. 2. The attacker then calls \`distribute\` with a large amount of tokens. 3. Given the attacker's predominant share, the resulting new target share price will disproportionately increase, skewing the benefit greatly in their favor. This creates a scenario where the attacker can effectively \\"grief\\" the system by pumping up the share price due to their control over a significant portion of the rebasing shares. The problem is exacerbated if the rebasing supply is low or if the attacker can manipulate the supply to become low before executing this attack. As per the code comment in the contract, the potential for exploitation is more pronounced when the first user subscribing to rebasing has a very low balance or allows the rebasing supply to drop to zero. The situation calls for a minimum balance to be rebasing at all times. To mitigate this risk, several strategies could be employed: - Implement a check that prevents the rebasing supply from dropping to zero, ensuring that there's always a baseline number of shares to prevent the share price from spiking disproportionately. - Set limits on the \`distribute\` function to prevent single large distributions which could unbalance the share price significantly. - Incorporate a mechanism that ensures the distribution amount is always in proportion to the total supply or the total number of holders. - Deploy additional safeguards to prevent one entity from accumulating a majority of the rebasing shares. Without proper mitigation in place, this design could potentially allow an attacker to game the rebasing system and obtain an unfair advantage, leading to centralization of the token supply and making the distribution unfair to other token holders. This vulnerability needs to be addressed before deploying such a rebasing token system on a live network."},{"instruction":"is this confirm the vulnerability is valid or not // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.13; import “forge-std/Test.sol”; import “…/src/tokens/ERC20RebaseDistributor.sol”; contract ERC20RebaseDistributorTest is Test { ERC20RebaseDistributor token; address deployer; address attacker = address(1); address otherUser = address(2); function setUp() public { deployer = address(this); // Using the contract itself as the deployer token = new ERC20RebaseDistributor(); token.initializeSupply(); // Assume this function sets up the initial state correctly vm.label(deployer, “Deployer”); vm.label(attacker, “Attacker”); vm.label(otherUser, “OtherUser”); // Initial token distribution token.mint(deployer, 1e18); // Honest first user (e.g., deployer) holds 1e18 tokens token.enterRebase(deployer); // Honest first user enters rebasing state }","output":"The provided Solidity code snippet appears to be a test case set up for an ERC20RebaseDistributor contract.

Here's a revised look at the test case with comments and suggestions: \`\`\`solidity function testRebaseAttack() public { // Mint tokens to users with balances in a realistic range. uint256 attackerBalance = 90 * 1e24; // The attacker acquires a large amount, e.g., 90 million tokens. uint256 otherUserBalance = 10 * 1e24; // Other user has 10 million tokens. token.mint(attacker, attackerBalance); token.mint(otherUser, otherUserBalance); // Both users enter the rebasing state. token.enterRebase(attacker); token.enterRebase(otherUser); // Fuzzing the distribution amount within the expected range. uint256 lowerBound = 1e18; // 1 token distributable minimum. uint256 upperBound = 1e27; // Maximum limit to prevent huge amounts triggering edge cases. uint256 attackAmount = vm.fuzzInRange(lowerBound, upperBound); // Using fuzzing to determine distribution amount. vm.assume(attackAmount + attackerBalance < type(uint128).max); // Ensure total balance doesn’t overflow (though uint128 seems small for ERC20 total supply; usually uint256 is used). // Transfer some tokens to the attacker in order to call distribute. // If \`distribute\` burns from the caller's balance, attacker needs sufficient balance to call it. token.transferFrom(deployer, attacker, attackAmount); // The attacker distributes a fuzzed amount. token.distribute(attackAmount); // Calculations of expected values should be based on fair distribution logic. // Example: newSharePrice should be calculated to reflect the expected outcome of distribute(). // uint256 newSharePrice = ... // This needs the actual calculation from the logic of distribute. // Expected value calculation can't be done like this (below) as you need rebasing shares not the token balance. // uint256 expectedAttackerValue = (attackerBalance + attackAmount) * newSharePrice; // To get the proper expected value you must consider the share distribution mechanism and how it affects each holder's balance. // The following is a pseduo-code placeholder to show accounting process, which must be replaced with the real one. // uint256 expectedAttackerValue = calculateExpectedValue(attacker, attackerBalance, attackAmount, newSharePrice); // The actual balance based on the rebasing mechanism, which reflects the new share price and rewards. uint256 actualAttackerValue = token.balanceOf(attacker); // Check that the attacker’s post-distribution balance is as expected. assertEq(expectedAttackerValue, actualAttackerValue, \\"Attacker did not receive expected value after distribution\\"); } \`\`\` Notes for the above test case: 1. \`distribute\` Logic: Ensure that the \`distribute\` function takes tokens from the caller's balance (which it should, as noted by the \`_burn(msg.sender, amount);\` in the contract). Therefore, the attacker may need tokens to execute this function. 2. Share Price Calculation: The comment about an \\"Example calculation of what the new share price should be based on distribute logic\\" implies there's more in-depth logic required to calculate the expected share price after distribution. This calculation is integral to your test—without knowing the expected fair value for the share price after distribution, it's impossible to assert whether or not an attacker would benefit unfairly from the transaction. 3. Expected Value Based on Rebase: You can't calculate the expected attacker balance by simply multiplying \`(attackerBalance + attackAmount) * newSharePrice\`. You need to take the rebasing mechanism into account, which turns balances into shares and then recalculates balances based on those shares and the share price. 4. Asserting the Correct Values: Ensure you account for shares when asserting expected balances. The test must reflect the actual logic of how token balances are computed after a rebase to be valid—a simple multiplication, as written, wouldn't cover this. 5. Comments as Guide: Keep in mind that the test code contains pseudocode and placeholders marked with comments that should help guide you to implement the actual test; they must be replaced with your contract's real logic. 6. Overflow Check: The check \`vm.assume(attackAmount + attackerBalance < type(uint128).max);\` might not be necessary if your token balances are \`uint256\` since Solidity 0.8.x onwards includes built-in overflow checks. Without the complete distribute function logic and the actual ERC20RebaseDistributor contract, it's impossible to write an accurate test. Make sure you accurately replicate your contract's token distribution logic within the test to simulate and validate the vulnerability effectively."},{"instruction":"give a higher report for this vulnerability in this contract confirm this // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later pragma solidity 0.8.13; import {ERC20} from \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\\"; import {SafeCastLib} from \\"@src/external/solmate/SafeCastLib.sol\\"; /** @title An ERC20 with rebase capabilities.

They then call distribute with a large number of tokens. The newTargetSharePrice is calculated with an increased total due to the large amount, disproportionately increasing the attacker’s share price due to their significant rebasing share compared to othersThis line that calculates the new share price is this one https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/2376d9af792584e3d15ec9c32578daa33bb56b43/src/tokens/ERC20RebaseDistributor.sol#L365 uint256 newTargetSharePrice = (amount * START_REBASING_SHARE_PRICE + __rebasingSharePrice.targetValue * _totalRebasingShares) / _totalRebasingShares; __rebasingSharePrice = InterpolatedValue({ lastTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(block.timestamp), lastValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(_rebasingSharePrice), targetTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(endTimestamp), targetValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(newTargetSharePrice) }); and this __rebasingSharePrice = InterpolatedValue({The grief it’s happen when a very large amount of tokens are distributed, and the total number of rebasing shares is small. This could happen if a large number of tokens are concentrated in a few addresses, or if the rebasing supply drops to zero , In the distribute function If amount is very large compared to _totalRebasingShares, the new target share price will be significantly increased, which could disproportionately benefit the few addresses that hold a large amount of tokens if the total supply of tokens is expected to be between 1e18 and 1e28, If the total supply is towards the higher end of this range, and the number of rebasing shares is small, the new target share price could be significantly increased, potentially leading to unfair distribution of tokens.","output":"Based on the information provided and the nature of the potential vulnerability within the \`distribute\` function of the \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\` contract, this vulnerability can be classified as significant, particularly if it allows for exploitation leading to an unfair advantage for certain holders and potential destabilization of the token economy. The particular vulnerability arises from the way the new share price is calculated when tokens are distributed: \`\`\`solidity uint256 newTargetSharePrice = (amount * START_REBASING_SHARE_PRICE + __rebasingSharePrice.targetValue * _totalRebasingShares) / _totalRebasingShares; __rebasingSharePrice = InterpolatedValue({ lastTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(block.timestamp), lastValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(_rebasingSharePrice), targetTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(endTimestamp), targetValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(newTargetSharePrice) }); \`\`\` When a large number of tokens is distributed relative to the total rebasing shares (e.g., when most tokens are in a non-rebasing state or concentrated in a few addresses), this calculation can disproportionately inflate share prices, thus giving the rebasing token holders (especially those with a significant percentage of rebasing shares) more tokens than might seem fair given the distribution event. To prioritize and classify the severity of this potential bug: 1. **High Severity**: Given that the vulnerability can substantially increase the balance of a few rebasing token holders at the expense of others, it directly impacts the token economy and could lead to a loss of trust in the token and potential manipulation of the market. 2. **Exploitability**: If the code is live and an attacker or a group of token holders are aware of this exploit, they could act to their benefit by accumulating a large portion of the rebasing supply before a distribution. 3. **Complexity of Fix**: Addressing this vulnerability will likely require altering the core logic of the rebasing mechanism and recalculating the share price in a way that prevents disproportionate inflation when large distributions occur. 4. **Impact**: Potential to unfairly advantage certain holders, potentially to a significant degree, and thus have an extensive impact on the overall token supply and distribution. In conclusion, due to the potential for market manipulation, unfair advantage, and the undermining of the token's economics, this issue would be assigned a high-priority status, requiring immediate attention and remediation before the contract can be safely deployed in a live environment."},{"instruction":"give high-quality bug report","output":"When providing a high-quality bug report for a smart contract, you should include specific details that allow developers to understand the issue, reproduce it, and assist in the prioritization for fixing it. Below is a structured approach to presenting the vulnerability identified in the \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\` contract: --- **Title:** Exploitable Rebase Mechanism Allows for Disproportionate Share Price Inflation **Severity:** High **Contract:** ERC20RebaseDistributor.sol **Function:** distribute(uint256 amount) **Address/Line:** [Your GitHub Repository Link]/ERC20RebaseDistributor.sol#L365 **Tool Used for Discovery:** Manual Code Review / Automated Analysis Tool (mention the tool if any) **Vulnerability Type:** Economic/Financial - Rebase Manipulation **Affected Versions:** Version 0.8.13 (and potentially earlier versions if they contain the same logic) **Preconditions Required:** 1. The contract must have a significant number of tokens in a non-rebasing state, with fewer accounts choosing to rebase or a few addresses holding large portions of the rebasing supply. 2. An attacker accumulates a significant number of rebasing tokens. **Steps to Reproduce:** 1. Deploy the \`ERC20RebaseDistributor\` contract. 2. Mint tokens to the attacker's account (\`address(1)\`) so that it holds a majority of the tokens eligible for rebasing. 3. Have the attacker account enter the rebase phase by calling \`enterRebase()\`. 4. Execute \`distribute(uint256 amount)\` from the attacker account with a large token amount, disproportionate to the total rebasing shares. **Expected Behavior:** Distribution should update the share price proportionately, providing fair and balanced rewards to all rebasing token holders without giving undue advantage based on pool size. **Observed Behavior:** When the \`distribute\` function is called with a large amount of tokens relative to the existing rebasing supply, the calculation of the new target share price disproportionately benefits the accounts with a significant number of rebasing shares, thus providing them with an unfair increase in value. **Impact:** This issue can lead to manipulation of token market dynamics, incentivize hoarding or pooling of rebasing shares by a few accounts for exploitation during distribution, and potentially lead to trust and stability issues within the token's economy. **Recommendations:** To prevent the disproportionate inflation of the share price, consider implementing one or more of the following: 1. Revisit the \`distribute\` function's token economics to ensure fairness and robustness against large distributions. 2. Implement checks to prevent extreme changes in the share price due to the distribution calculation. 3. Introduce scaling factors or limiting mechanisms to smooth out the token rewards across the rebasing supply. 4. Include additional logic to prevent manipulation through timing attacks when the rebasing pool is low. **Code Snippet:** \`\`\`solidity // --- SNIPPET OF VULNERABLE CODE --- uint256 newTargetSharePrice = (amount * START_REBASING_SHARE_PRICE + __rebasingSharePrice.targetValue * _totalRebasingShares) / _totalRebasingShares; __rebasingSharePrice = InterpolatedValue({ lastTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(block.timestamp), lastValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(_rebasingSharePrice), targetTimestamp: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo32(endTimestamp), targetValue: SafeCastLib.safeCastTo224(newTargetSharePrice) }); // --- /SNIPPET OF VULNERABLE CODE --- \`\`\` **Attachments:** (include any supporting material such as screenshots, proof of concept code, or debug logs) --- When constructing your bug report, ensure that it is clear, concise, and contains no ambiguous language.

Locate the game's configuration files: Typically, game configuration files are located in the game's installation folder or in the \\"My Documents\\" folder, under a subfolder related to the specific game. 2. Open the configuration file: Look for a file with an extension such as .ini, .cfg, or .txt. It may be named similar to the game or engine (e.g., \\"GameName.ini\\" or \\"UE4.ini\\"). Use a text editor, such as Notepad or Notepad++, to open the file. 3. Find the FPS-related settings: In the configuration file, search for settings related to FPS or frame rate. The specific names may vary depending on the game or engine, but common keywords or settings might include \\"MaxFPS,\\" \\"FrameRateLimit,\\" or \\"bSmoothFrameRate.\\" These settings control the maximum FPS or limit the frame rate. 4. Modify the FPS-related settings: Adjust the values associated with the FPS settings to your desired limit or toggle option. For example, you could set a specific number for MaxFPS, such as 60 for a 60 FPS limit. Or if you want to toggle the FPS, you might set something like \\"bSmoothFrameRate=False\\" or \\"bVSync=False\\" to disable any frame rate limit or synchronization. 5. Save and close the configuration file: After making the necessary changes, save the modifications and close the text editor. 6. Launch the game: Start the game as you normally would. It should now reflect the changes you made to the FPS settings in the configuration file. Note: It's crucial to back up the original configuration file before making any modifications as a precautionary measure. This way, you can easily revert any changes if something goes wrong or if you want to return to the default settings. Keep in mind that not all games may have easily accessible configuration files, or they may have different settings and structures. Consult the game's documentation or forums for specific instructions on modifying FPS settings if they are available."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Придумай варианты подарков к Новому году","output":"Конечно, вот несколько идей для новогодних подарков: 1.

These configuration files are typically \`.ini\` files. To set an FPS cap (frame per second limit) via the config file, you can follow these general steps: 1. Navigate to your game's config directory. This might be something like: - \`<GameDirectory>SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` - Or within \`Documents\`, like: \`Documents<GameName>SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` 2. Look for the \`Engine.ini\` or \`GameUserSettings.ini\` file, depending on the game's structure. Make a backup of the file before making changes in case you need to revert back to the original settings. 3. Open the chosen \`.ini\` file with a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++. 4. Depending on what you are trying to achieve (showing FPS count on the screen or setting an FPS limit), use the following settings: - To display the FPS on-screen, add the following lines to \`Engine.ini\`: \`\`\` [SystemSettings] r.DisplayFrequency=1 \`\`\` - To cap the FPS, add these lines to \`Engine.ini\` or modify them if they already exist: \`\`\` [/Script/Engine.Engine] bSmoothFrameRate=true MinSmoothedFrameRate=5 MaxSmoothedFrameRate=60 \`\`\` Change \`MinSmoothedFrameRate\` and \`MaxSmoothedFrameRate\` to the minimum and maximum frame rates you desire. 5. Save the changes and close the text editor. 6. Start your game and observe the changes. If the config file does not have the desired effect, you may need to check if the game overrides these settings or if it requires a different method to change FPS settings. Please keep in mind that not all Unreal Engine games will behave the same way, and some might have different or additional steps required to change FPS settings. Some games might also reset these settings with updates or override them with in-game settings, so you might have to repeat the process occasionally. Also, certain games might encrypt, compile, or package their configuration files in a way that makes them not user-editable, or they might ignore changes to the config files due to how the developers have set up the game's configuration system. Always check for a built-in in-game option to toggle FPS or set an FPS limit first, as that is the more conventional and safe method to adjust these settings."},{"instruction":"how can I enable the engine own fps counter in unreal engine games through their config file?","output":"To enable the engine's own FPS counter in Unreal Engine games using the config file, follow these steps: 1.

The process may vary slightly depending on the version of Unreal Engine the game was built with, but here is a general method: 1. Locate the Configuration File: First, you need to find the configuration file for the game, which is typically called \`Engine.ini\`, \`GameUserSettings.ini\`, or a similar file. These files are usually located in the game's installation folder or in a user-specific directory, which for Windows users is often under the \`SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` folder within the game's user-specific settings directory. This directory is commonly found in one of these locations: - Inside the game's installation directory. - Within your user folder, typically \`C:Users[YourUsername]AppDataLocal[GameName]SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\`. 2. Edit the Configuration File: Once you've found the correct INI file, open it with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++. 3. Modify the File to Show FPS: You need to add a command under the \`[Engine.Engine]\` or \`[SystemSettings]\` section that will enable the FPS counter. If these sections don't exist, you can add them. The command you'll add is different based on the version of Unreal Engine, but for many UE4 and possibly UE5 games, you can use the following: For UE4: \`\`\`ini [Engine.Engine] bEnableFPSChart=true \`\`\` For UE5: \`\`\`ini [SystemSettings] fps=True \`\`\` Alternatively, you can use console commands to show the FPS overlay in-game, but these require access to the game's developer console, which might not be available in all Unreal Engine games. After making these changes, save the file and start the game to see if the FPS counter appears. Remember, modifying game files may not be encouraged by some game developers and can sometimes cause issues or be reset by game updates, so proceed with caution and always back up your configuration files before making changes.

L'hôtesse tend un plateau repas à mon voisin de droite, un grand barbu à papillotes ;puis un plateau à ma voisine de gauche, une blonde pétulante. Et moi, alors ? » Menus spéciaux « , me répond-on. Le barbu mange casher, la blonde est d'obédience » lacto-ovo-végétarienne « . Enfin, on m'apporte l'ordinaire. Je tâte un morceau brun du bout de ma fourchette en plastique : vais-je accepter manger cela ? Suis-je d'accord pour que cela devienne un peu moi, que je devienne un peu cela ? Manger, ce n'est pas seulement faire le plein d'énergie à la pompe à essence. Manger, c'est aussi, et surtout, un acte magique par lequel une substance - qui nous est d'abord étrangère - va, par une complexe alchimie, faire partie de nous, devenir nous. Telle molécule d'acide aminé - auparavant partie intégrante d'un porc transformé en jambon - se trouvera, à l'issue du processus, incorporée dans notre propre chair. L'aliment mangé devient nous et nous devenons cet aliment. Il y a de quoi s'inquiéter : ne risquons-nous pas de nous empoisonner, de modifier notre nature ? A trop manger de porc, deviendrions-nous porcins ? Il y a de quoi s'enthousiasmer : courrons-nous plus vite en mangeant du lièvre ? En consommant une nourriture végétarienne, ferons-nous nôtres ces qualités prêtées au règne végétal : calme, harmonie et ténacité ? Notre nature omnivore de » mange-tout » engendre l'ambivalence. Il nous faut être conservateurs si nous désirons préserver notre identité, si nous ne voulons pas risquer d'être détruits ou possédés. C'est pourquoi nous consommons des aliments traditionnels, nous définissons des règles culinaires intangibles. En mangeant toujours les mêmes choses, toujours de la même manière, nous restons identiques à nous- mêmes. Mais la reproduction de l'identique engendre monotonie et décadence. Qui dit » mange-tout » dit » risque-tout « . Il nous faut de l'aventure. Manger des aliments nouveaux ravivera donc notre être, nous permettra de nous surprendre nous-mêmes. Nous nous approprierons les qualités que nous prêtons aux aliments que nous consommons ; ou bien, lassés de ce que nous sommes, décidés à des changements radicaux, aspirant à devenir autres, follement explorateurs, nous consommerons des aliments inconnus, nous goûterons les fruits défendus. D'où, aujourd'hui, cette ambivalence vis-à-vis des aliments plus forte que jamais. D'où aussi notre relation de plus en plus problématique et complexe face à la nourriture, qui s'explique sans doute par l'abandon de normes et de valeurs collectives - imposées par le milieu social d'origine - au profit de valeurs individuelles : évidemment, le mode d'alimentation et les choix symboliques et affectifs qu'il implique sont eux aussi en libre service. Si bien qu'en choisissant nos aliments, la façon dont nous les consommons, nous devons, jour après jour, répondre aux questions : » Qui suis-je ? » et » Qui ai-je envie de devenir ? » Je m'américanise en mangeant des hamburgers et en buvant du Coca-Cola. Je capte l'esprit nippon en consommant des sushis et des sashimis. Quant à l'alcool, les fritures, la charcuterie, les pâtisseries ou certains aliments industriels - tous ces produits sucrés et gras dégoulinants de cholestérol -, nous en arrivons au point où en consommer prend des allures d'acte antisocial, voire d'équivalent suicidaire, ou encore d'épreuve ordalique, tel le jugement de Dieu… Dis-moi ce que tu manges et je te dirai qui tu es. Mais si, comme nous nous en persuadons aujourd'hui, nous sommes ce que nous décidons d'être, totalement responsables de nous-mêmes, il nous faut alors manger ce qui nous rendra tel que nous désirons être. Le problème est que, bien souvent, nous n'avons pas d'idée très arrêtée sur la personne que nous sommes, et nous hésitons sur la personne que nous désirons être… Etre soi-même, quelle responsabilité, quelle fatigue… Автор: Gérard Apfeldorfer","output":"I. Le début Le titre de cet article est \\"Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai qui tu es\\". L'auteur de cet article est Gérard Apfeldorfer. II. Le résumé de l'article Il s'agit dans cet article de la relation profonde et symbolique entre notre alimentation et notre identité. L'auteur de cet article parle de comment les aliments que nous choisissons de consommer reflètent et façonnent qui nous sommes ou qui nous voulons être. Il illustre cette idée en décrivant une expérience sur un vol Paris-New York où il remarque les menus spéciaux commandés par ses voisins, reflétant leurs identités religieuses ou personnelles. L'article explore l'idée que manger n'est pas juste un acte de remplissage énergétique, mais plutôt un acte identitaire qui symbolise nos valeurs, nos croyances, et notre façon de nous positionner dans la société. Apfeldorfer souligne aussi l'ambivalence ressentie face à notre alimentation dans un contexte de choix alimentaires de plus en plus individualisés et moins dictés par la tradition. III. Exprimer son opinion A mon avis, l'article de Gérard Apfeldorfer soulève des points très pertinents concernant la manière dont le choix de notre alimentation est un reflet de notre personnalité et de nos valeurs culturelles ou personnelles. Selon moi, cette réflexion est d'autant plus importante dans un contexte où la globalisation et l'accès à une multitude de cuisines étrangères remettent en question les identités alimentaires traditionnelles. Quant à moi, je partage l'opinion de l'auteur lorsqu'il implique qu'en choisissant nos aliments, nous ne choisissons pas uniquement des nutriments mais aussi une certaine idée de nous-mêmes et de la société à laquelle nous aspirons. Cet article invite donc le lecteur à une introspection sur le rapport entre alimentation et identité personnelle, élargissant la perspective sur les implications de nos habitudes culinaires."},{"instruction":"По этому же плану реферируй эту статью \\"Je ne souris qu'à mes amis\\" Ils disent pardon au lieu de te pousser, figure-toi ! m'explique une copine russe de retour d'un voyage à Paris. Je suis dans un wagon de métro, tranquille, appuyée contre la porte. Là, j'entends quelqu'un me dire pardon. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi il s'excuse et je ne bouge pas. Il répète, une note de surprise dans la voix. Finalement, je finis par comprendre et je le laisse passer ! Non mais, tu te rends compte comme ils sont civilisés ces Français ! » Je me rends bien compte, et j'acquiesce. Je repense à cette petite fille croisée dans un bus à Lyon qui, sachant à peine marcher, avançait pourtant paisiblement vers la sortie en demandant pardon à tous ceux qu'elle croisait sur sa route... De mon côté, entrée dans le bus par la porte arrière et sans acheter de billet - parce que c'est plus drôle et que personne ne le fait - j'étais effectivement étonnée par ce civisme si précoce. Je me rappelle encore ces innombrables « bonjour », « merci » et « bonne journée » qui me sautent dessus dès que je pose le pied sur le sol hexagonal, créant immédiatement une ambiance de confort et de sécurité. Plus d'un de mes amis est tombé amoureux après qu'une boulangère l'a gratifié de son plus beau sourire - amoureux de Paris, hein, pas de la boulangère... Souris au monde et il te sourira en retour : la devise fonctionne parfaitement sur le continent européen mais, pour des raisons mystérieuses, perd de sa force à mesure que l'on se dirige vers l'Est.... J'ai toujours le coeur serré quand des amis français, après s'être extasiés devant la place Rouge enneigée, débarquent dans une épicerie de quartier et tentent d'entrer en contact avec la vendeuse. « Pourquoi est-ce qu'elle ne dit rien? Et puis qu'est-ce qu'elle a à me regarder comme si j'étais un fou furieux? », s'étonnent-ils, désemparés. Probablement parce que les codes diffèrent. Sans prétendre plonger dans les racines profondes des mentalités russe et française, je note cependant cette différence essentielle : pour les Français, les inconnus sont des amis possibles et, afin qu'ils le deviennent, il suffit d'être gentils avec eux. Pour les Russes, c'est précisément l'inverse. Les inconnus représentent une menace potentielle et, afin que celle-ci ne se réalise pas, il vaut mieux rester sur sa réserve, voire attaquer le premier. Parce que la vie n'est pas rose. Parce les gens ne sont pas « tous frères » et que tant que l'on ne sait pas qui on a en face, il faut se méfier. On ne sourit qu'aux « siens » et on ne serre la main qu'aux amis. Quiconque souhaitera se lier d'amitié avec des Russes ne devra surtout pas miser sur des formules de politesses qui, entendues trop fréquemment, agacent. Je n'ai jamais réussi à admettre la nécessité, lors de conversations avec des Français, d'accompagner mon « bonjour » des sempiternels « ça va? » ou « as-tu passé un bon week-end ? » Malgré toute ma bonne volonté et mon intense désir de compréhension, ces questions continuent de ne signifier pour moi qu'une perte de temps. Quand je parle aux Russes, un simple « salut» me suffit amplement : j'ai constaté ta présence, je vois que tu es en forme. On peut passer à des choses plus substantielles ? Avec les amis, nul besoin de révérences dignes de la cour de Versailles; avec les autres, on peut s'en passer. Merci, au revoir, portez-vous bien et bonjour chez vous…","output":"I. Le début Le titre de l'article est \\"Je ne souris qu'à mes amis\\". L'auteur de cet article n'est pas mentionné dans l'extrait fourni. II. Le résumé de l'article Il s'agit dans cet article des différences culturelles en matière de civilité et de politesse, notamment entre la Russie et la France. L'auteur relate l'expérience d'une amie russe surprise par la politesse des Français à Paris, en particulier dans le métro et se rappelle une petite fille à Lyon qui s'excusait poliment dans le bus, reflétant l'apprentissage précoce du civisme en France. L'article met en contraste l'accueil chaleureux des Français, symbolisé par des \\"bonjour\\", \\"merci\\" et \\"bonne journée\\", et l'accueil plus distant des Russes envers les inconnus, qui est vu comme une protection contre de potentielles menaces. La notion de sourire seulement à ceux qu'on connaît en Russie est comparée à l'ouverture française envers des inconnus, perçus comme des amis possibles. L'auteur exprime aussi une certaine irritation face à la politesse excessive, à son avis, des Français, trouvant les formules de salutation prolongées inutiles par rapport à la simplicité des salutations russes. III. Exprimer son opinion A mon avis, cet article offre une perspective fascinante sur les nuances subtiles des interactions sociales qui peuvent grandement varier d'une culture à l'autre. Selon moi, l'auteur met bien en lumière le fait que ce qui est considéré comme poli ou impoli dépend beaucoup du contexte culturel, et qu'il est important de ne pas juger les comportements sociaux à travers le seul prisme de notre propre culture. Quant à moi, je partage l'opinion de l'auteur que les différences culturelles doivent être comprises et respectées, bien que je pense aussi qu'il soit enrichissant de s'ouvrir aux pratiques d'autres cultures. L'article illustre bien à quel point les codes sociaux peuvent être interprétés différemment et amène à réfléchir sur l'importance de l'adaptabilité et de l'empathie lors de la rencontre avec d'autres cultures."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If the game allows you to access and modify this file, you should be able to display the FPS counter using the following steps: 1. Locate the \`Engine.ini\` file for the game you are playing. The location depends on the project and platform, but it is commonly found in one of the following directories: - If the game is installed through the Epic Games Launcher, you might find the \`Engine.ini\` file within a folder path similar to: \`<YourGameInstallPath>/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor/\` - If it's a local Unreal Engine project, the file may be located at: \`<YourUnrealProjectFolder>/Saved/Config/Windows/\` 2. Make sure the game is not running, then open the \`Engine.ini\` file with a text editor like Notepad or any other code editor. 3. Add the following lines under the \`[/Script/Engine.GameEngine]\` section of the .ini file: \`\`\` [/Script/Engine.GameEngine] +ConsoleVariables=r.DisplayFrequency=1 \`\`\` *Note: If the section \`[/Script/Engine.GameEngine]\` does not exist, you can create it by simply typing it in. 4. Save the \`Engine.ini\` file and close the text editor. 5. Start the game, and you should see the frames per second (FPS) counter on the screen. If for some reason, this change does not work or you wish to use an in-game method to display FPS, you can usually do so by opening the in-game console (often accessed by pressing the \`~\` key) and typing the following command: \`\`\` stat fps \`\`\` This will display the FPS counter as well. Keep in mind that access to the in-game console and modification of game files can vary depending on the game, and some games may have restrictions or different methods for configuring settings. Additionally, third-party software like FRAPS, NVIDIA's GeForce Experience (via the Share overlay), and AMD’s Radeon Software can also display an FPS counter in most games if you prefer a solution outside of tweaking game configurations."},{"instruction":"how can I display fps in unreal engine 5 games through their config file?","output":"In Unreal Engine 5, displaying the frames per second (FPS) counter is usually done through the in-game console command or developer tools. However, if you want to configure the game to always show FPS upon starting, you can modify the game's configuration files. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to enable the FPS display through the config file: 1. Navigate to the Configuration Files: The configuration files for an Unreal Engine 5 game are typically located in one of the following directories: - Inside the game's installation folder, under: \`[YourGameDirectory]SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` - For games that use the default UE4/UE5 directory structure: \`C:Users[YourUserName]AppDataLocal[YourGameName]SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\` Note: Replace \`[YourGameDirectory]\`, \`[YourUserName]\`, and \`[YourGameName]\` with the specific information related to the game you are configuring. 2. Edit the Engine.ini File: Open the \`Engine.ini\` file using a text editor such as Notepad. 3. Add the Following Lines: To the bottom of the \`Engine.ini\` file, you will need to add a section to enable the FPS display. Here is an example of what you can add: \`\`\` [/Script/Engine.Engine] ; Enable On-screen FPS Display bEnableOnScreenDebugMessages=true bEnableOnScreenDebugMessagesDisplay=true ConstrainAspectRatio=false \`\`\` And additionally: \`\`\` [/Script/Engine.GameEngine] +ConsoleVariables=(Key=\\"stat fps\\",Value=\\"1\\") \`\`\` This will tell the game engine to turn on the console variable that displays the FPS counter. 4. Save and Close: After you've added these lines, save the file and close the text editor. 5. Launch the Game: Run the game as you normally would. The FPS counter should now be displayed on the screen based on the configuration edits you made. Keep in mind that altering configuration files can impact game performance or stability, so it's a good idea to back up the original files before making any changes. Also, this process might not work for all Unreal Engine 5 games since some developers might disable or restrict access to certain configuration options. If the method described above does not work, you may have to resort to in-game options, console commands, or overlay tools such as the ones provided by graphics card software like NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software to display the FPS."},{"instruction":"how can I display fps in unreal engine 5 games through their config file?","output":"To display the FPS (frames per second) in Unreal Engine 5 games, you can modify the game's configuration files to enable an on-screen FPS counter. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. Navigate to the game's configuration files: The location of the config files can vary depending on whether the game is packaged or if you are running the game from the Unreal Editor. For packaged games, the config files are generally located in a subdirectory within the game's installation folder, such as \`SavedConfigWindowsNoEditor\`. For projects run from the Unreal Editor, the config files are located in your project's \`Config\` directory. 2. Open the relevant INI file: Open the \`Engine.ini\` or \`GameUserSettings.ini\` file using a text editor like Notepad or another code editor. 3. Modify the configuration: Add the following lines to enable the FPS counter: \`\`\`ini [/Script/Engine.Engine] bEnableOnScreenDebugMessages=true bEnableOnScreenDebugMessagesDisplay=true bShowFPS=true \`\`\` Depending on the game and its configuration, the section headers may vary, but adding these lines to the end of the \`Engine.ini\` file should work in most cases. 4. Save the file: After adding the lines, save and close the file. 5. Launch the game: Start the game, and you should now see an FPS counter displayed on the screen. If the game ignores the settings you provided in the INI file, make sure that the game is not overwriting these settings somewhere else or that there are no permissions issues preventing the changes from being applied. Further adjustments might be necessary depending on the game's implementation and how it handles configuration files. Please note that this is a method for Unreal Engine games, and your game might have specific configurations or methods to enable the FPS counter, including options within the game's settings menu or console commands that can be used during runtime without needing to modify config files. Always check the game's documentation or support forums for game-specific instructions."},{"instruction":"how can I display fps in unreal engine 5 games through their config file?","output":"To display the frames per second (FPS) in Unreal Engine 5 games through their config files, you can add a few lines to the game's configuration file that enable the built-in FPS counter.

The Dragon is the fifth animal in the 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle, and it is considered the most powerful and auspicious sign, symbolizing strength, luck, and vitality. People born in the year of the Dragon are thought to be charismatic, confident, and influential. When the element Metal (also known as Gold) is combined with the Dragon, it is believed to confer specific characteristics associated with Metal: resilience, determination, and a strong sense of purpose.

In addition to the animal signs, there are five elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. The elements are cycled through in conjunction with the animal signs in a 60-year cycle, so each animal sign is paired with each element once every 60 years. The 12-year animal cycle and the 5-year elemental cycle result in a 60-year full cycle (12 x 5 = 60).

FMT is a medical treatment that involves transferring stool from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a recipient, usually to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis, a bacterial infection that can cause severe diarrhea, colitis, and even life-threatening complications. The idea behind FMT is that the introduction of beneficial bacteria from the healthy donor's stool can help to restore the balance of the microbiome in the gut of the recipient. This can assist in outcompeting the harmful C. difficile bacteria, allowing the recipient to recover from the infection. Stool donors are typically rigorously screened for a wide range of infectious diseases and conditions to ensure that they do not inadvertently transfer harmful pathogens to the FMT recipient. Stool donations are usually processed in special facilities to create preparations that can be used safely for medical treatments."},{"instruction":"Test me in acute gastritis as a GP doctor","output":"Sure, I can simulate a scenario to test your knowledge on acute gastritis.

Строение экстрапирамидной системы: Экстрапирамидная система включает несколько основных структур головного мозга: 1. Базальные ганглии – это группа ядер, лежащих в основании головного мозга, которые включают стриатум (состоит из путамена и головки хвостатого ядра), бледный шар (глобус паллидус), субталамическое ядро и черную субстанцию. 2. Дорсальные ядра вегетативной системы – к этим структурам относятся ядра, расположенные в головном и спинном мозге, которые участвуют в регуляции вегетативных функций тела. 3. Таламус – выступает как релейная станция для моторной информации между корой головного мозга и другими частями экстрапирамидной системы. 4. Сетчатая формация ствола мозга – принимает активное участие в регуляции мускульного тонуса и стимуляции двигательных нейронов спинного мозга. 5. Мозжечок – не является частью экстрапирамидной системы целиком, но сопряжен с ней функционально, в первую очередь, обеспечивая координацию движений и постуральный контроль. Функциональное значение экстрапирамидной системы: Экстрапирамидная система отвечает за следующие функции: 1. Регуляция тонуса мышц – обеспечивает баланс между возбуждением и торможением в мышечных группах, что позволяет поддерживать осанку и совершать координированные движения. 2. Координация непроизвольных и произвольных движений – участвует в гармонизации движений, запускаемых произвольно (сознательно) и без участия сознания. 3.

Since this is a large code block containing various components, let's break it down: 1. **Data Importing and Cleaning:** - Importing and concatenating datasets for books and user ratings. - Label encoding for user ratings. - Data cleaning and ensuring only relevant users and ratings are retained. 2. **Matrix Factorization with SVD:** - You performed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the user-rating matrix to obtain low-rank approximations for users and items (books) and make predictions. 3. **Evaluation using Overlap Metric:** - Defined a custom function \`check_overlap\` to assess the overlap of top-rated books between the actual and predicted ratings for a given user. - Calculated the max, min, and average overlap percentages across all users. 4. **PySpark Implementation:** - Installed PySpark and used it for an alternative ALS (Alternating Least Squares) based method to perform matrix factorization. - Evaluated the ALS model using RMSE and the previously defined overlap metric. 5. **Neural Network Approach:** - Built a neural network-based model (potentially a Collaborative Filtering Neural Network) with embeddings for users and books. - Trained the model and visualized the training and validation loss. - Evaluated predictions with the overlap metric as before. Your script also includes imports and preparations for training a Keras model that includes the use of embeddings to capture latent factors for users and items (which is part of the neural network approach mentioned above). The key point of evaluations here appears to be the overlap percentage metric, which indicates how well the recommendation system replicates the top N preferences of users based on their historical ratings. Please note the following points: - Your script seems to concatenate and append dataframes in a loop, which is generally not recommended due to potential inefficiency. Consider using list comprehension and \`pd.concat\` outside the loop instead. - When appending DataFrame within a loop, you missed updating the \`book_rating\` and \`user_rating\` DataFrames with the appended result. This could make your final DataFrame empty or have incorrect data. - Ensure you have defined \`check_overlap\` function correctly for each method, as the inputs and predictions could be slightly different for each model. - Verify that the train-test split is correctly being utilized so that no test data leaks into your training set. If you have any specific question or encounter an error, please feel free to ask for clarification or guidance, and share the specific section of the code or the issue you are dealing with."},{"instruction":"هل انت gpt 4","output":"لا أنا لست GPT-4. أنا مساعد يعمل على نسخة من OpenAI's GPT-3، والتي تم تدريبها وتحسينها حتى تاريخ انقطاع المعرفة في عام 2023. إذا كان لديك أي أسئلة أو تحتاج إلى مساعدة في مجال معين، فأنا هنا للمساعدة!"},{"instruction":"TRANSLATE: [TSBS-81099] Meiri メイリ – The Continuation of Love [TSBS-81120] Mirin Fujiwara 藤原みりん – Milky Glamour ミルキー・グラマー [TSDS-42215] Tomomi Morisaki 森咲智美 – Virginal [TSDS-42227] Risa Kikuchi 菊池梨沙 – Catch Me [TSDS-42240] Yuu Machimoto 町本ゆう – I Love You 大好きな君 [TSDS-42266] Aina Miyase 宮瀬葵菜 – Sweet – X-IDOL [TSDS-42280] Ayaka Momoi 桃井あやか – Pure Smile ピュア・スマイル [TSDS-42285] Kanan Jinguji 神宮寺かなん – Milky Glamour ミルキー・グラマー [TSDS-42291] Rina Hashimoto 橋本梨菜 – Browned こんがり～な [TSDS-42296] Seina Katsuragi 葛城聖菜 – Be My Only You 僕だけの君になって [TSDS-42317] Airi Igawa 伊川愛梨 – Milky Glamour ミルキー・グラマー [TSDS-42322] Meari Matsuyama 松山メアリ – Futarikkiri ふたりっきり [TSDS-42339] Rika Tonozaki 外崎梨香 – Dolly Girl [TSDS-42357] Maria Sano 佐野マリア – Debut！ [TSDS-42368] Maeda Misato 前田美里 – Silent Love サイレント・ラブ [TSDS-42371] Shihono Ito 伊藤しほ乃 – My Last Love [TSDS-42372] Sakura Otawa 太田和さくら - Pure Smile","output":"[TSBS-81099] Meiri メイリ – The Continuation of Love [TSBS-81120] Mirin Fujiwara 藤原みりん – Milky Glamour ミルキー・グラマー [TSDS-42215] Tomomi Morisaki 森咲智美 – Virginal [TSDS-42227] Risa Kikuchi 菊池梨沙 – Catch Me [TSDS-42240] Yuu Machimoto 町本ゆう – I Love You 大好きな君 [TSDS-42266] Aina Miyase 宮瀬葵菜 – Sweet – X-IDOL [TSDS-42280] Ayaka Momoi 桃井あやか – Pure Smile ピュア・スマイル [TSDS-42285] Kanan Jinguji 神宮寺かなん – Milky Glamour ミルキー・グラマー [TSDS-42291] Rina Hashimoto 橋本梨菜 – Browned こんがり～な [TSDS-42296] Seina Katsuragi 葛城聖菜 – Be My Only You 僕だけの君になって [TSDS-42317] Airi Igawa 伊川愛梨 – Milky Glamour ミルキー・グラマー [TSDS-42322] Meari Matsuyama 松山メアリ – Futarikkiri ふたりっきり [TSDS-42339] Rika Tonozaki 外崎梨香 – Dolly Girl [TSDS-42357] Maria Sano 佐野マリア – Debut！ [TSDS-42368] Maeda Misato 前田美里 – Silent Love サイレント・ラブ [TSDS-42371] Shihono Ito 伊藤しほ乃 – My Last Love [TSDS-42372] Sakura Otawa 太田和さくら - Pure Smile [TSBS-81099] Meiri メイリ – The Continuation of Love [TSBS-81120] Mirin Fujiwara 藤原みりん – Milky Glamour [TSDS-42215] Tomomi Morisaki 森咲智美 – Virginal [TSDS-42227] Risa Kikuchi 菊池梨沙 – Catch Me [TSDS-42240] Yuu Machimoto 町本ゆう – I Love You [TSDS-42266] Aina Miyase 宮瀬葵菜 – Sweet – X-IDOL [TSDS-42280] Ayaka Momoi 桃井あやか – Pure Smile [TSDS-42285] Kanan Jinguji 神宮寺かなん – Milky Glamour [TSDS-42291] Rina Hashimoto 橋本梨菜 – Browned [TSDS-42296] Seina Katsuragi 葛城聖菜 – Be My Only You [TSDS-42317] Airi Igawa 伊川愛梨 – Milky Glamour [TSDS-42322] Meari Matsuyama 松山メアリ – Futarikkiri [TSDS-42339] Rika Tonozaki 外崎梨香 – Dolly Girl [TSDS-42357] Maria Sano 佐野マリア – Debut!

It’s important to be there for each other, especially in times like these.” (Meanwhile, at the hospital…) Doctor: (preforming Natsuki’s ultrasound) “There she is, Natsuki. Your baby’s healthy and the heartbeat is strong.” Natsuki: (sniffles) “Thank you, doctor. That’s a relief to hear.” Doctor: “It’s my pleasure, Natsuki. Pregnancy can be a stressful time, but it’s important to remember that your baby is resilient. Just make sure to take care of yourself and follow the recommended guidelines.” Natsuki: “I will, I promise. I just… I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately.” Doctor: “It’s completely normal to feel that way. Pregnancy brings about a lot of changes both physically and emotionally. If you ever need someone to talk to or if you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out to your support system.” Natsuki: “Yeah, I actually have some amazing friends at school. They’ve been really supportive so far. But sometimes, it feels like I burden them with my problems.” Doctor: “It’s understandable to feel that way, but true friends are there for you in good times and bad. Opening up to them can strengthen your bond and provide you with the support you need.” Natsuki: “You’re right, doctor. I’ll try to be more open with them. It’s just hard sometimes.” Doctor: “Take your time, Natsuki. Pregnancy can be a rollercoaster of emotions, and it’s important to give yourself permission to feel everything. And remember, seeking professional help is never a bad idea if things become too overwhelming.” Natsuki: “Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your advice and reassurance.” (Back at the literature club…) Sayori: “I hope Natsuki’s alright. She means a lot to us, and I hate seeing her upset.” Monika: “I completely agree, Sayori. We should definitely check in with her and let her know we’re here for her.” Yuri: “Yes, offering our support could make a big difference for her. Sometimes, just knowing that someone cares can make a world of difference.” Monika: “Absolutely. We can also remind her that she’s not alone in this. We’ll be there for her every step of the way.” (Suddenly, the clubroom door swings open and Natsuki walks in, a hand on her baby bump.) Natsuki: “Hey guys, sorry for leaving earlier. I just needed some time to clear my head.” Sayori: “Natsuki! We were so worried about you. Are you okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, I’m okay. I had some concerns about my pregnancy, but I went to the doctor and everything’s fine.” Yuri: “That’s a relief to hear. We were really worried about you.” Monika: “Natsuki, we want you to know that we’re here for you. We care about you and we want to support you through this journey.” Natsuki: (tearing up) “Thank you, guys. That means a lot to me. Sometimes, it feels like I’m dealing with everything on my own.” Sayori: “You’re not alone, Natsuki. We’re your friends, and we’re always here for you.” Yuri: “We understand that pregnancy can be overwhelming, but please remember that you can lean on us for support.” Monika: “You’re not a burden, Natsuki. We’ve been through tough times together, and we’ll get through this as well.” Natsuki: “I… I appreciate it, guys. Thank you for being there for me. It means the world to know that I have such amazing friends.” Sayori: “Of course, Natsuki.

Причем каждый ребёнок в группе получил велосипед. Сколько может быть колес вместе, если их больше 20, но меньше 27?","output":"Чтобы найти количество возможных колес, давайте рассмотрим следующее: 1. Пусть (x) – количество велосипедов с тремя колесами (трехколесные велосипеды, часто называемые трициклами). 2. Пусть (y) – количество велосипедов с двумя колесами. Каждый велосипед с тремя колесами добавляет три колеса к итоговому числу колес, а каждый велосипед с двумя колесами добавляет два колеса. Общее количество колес можно выразить как: [3x + 2y] Мы знаем, что число колес больше 20, но меньше 27, то есть: [20 < 3x + 2y < 27] Также известно, что каждому ребёнку дали велосипед, то есть количество велосипедов (и (x) и (y)) должно быть одинаковым, то есть (x=y). Имея это в виду, давайте подставим (y) вместо (x) и найдем возможные значения общего количества колес: [20 < 3y + 2y < 27] [20 < 5y < 27] Теперь давайте найдем, в каких пределах может находиться (y): [20/5 < y < 27/5] [4 < y < 5.4] Поскольку (y) должно быть целым числом (так как мы не можем иметь дробное количество велосипедов), единственным подходящим значением для (y) (и (x)) будет 5. Таким образом, в детском саду 5 трехколесных и 5 двухколесных велосипедов. Посчитаем общее количество колес: [3x + 2y = 3(5) + 2(5) = 15 + 10 = 25] Таким образом, общее количество колес может быть 25, что удовлетворяет условиям задачи (больше 20, но меньше 27)."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “I really hope Natsuki’s okay…” Sayori: “Yeah, I’m worried about her too.

Aşağıda yorum satırlarıyla API'nin nasıl kullanılacağına dair bilgilere ve kodun çalışır halde olması için eksik parçaların nasıl ekleneceğine dair açıklamalara yer verilmiştir. İlk olarak, \`fetchImages\` fonksiyonundaki \`apiKey\` değişkeninde gerçek bir Pixabay API anahtarınız olmalıdır. Ayrıca, Pixabay API URL'sini gerçek URL ile değiştirmeniz gerekecek. Eğer bir Pixabay API anahtarınız varsa ve doğru endpoint'i kullandıysanız, veri çekmek için bu bilgileri yerleştirdiğinizde yükleme işlemi başlayacaktır: \`\`\`javascript async function fetchImages(term, page) { const apiKey = 'API_ANAHTARINIZ_BURAYA'; // Gerçek API anahtarınızı buraya yazın const apiUrl = \`https://pixabay.com/api/?key={apiKey}&q={encodeURIComponent(term)}&page={page}&per_page=20\`; const response = await fetch(apiUrl); if (!response.ok) throw new Error(\`An error occurred: {response.statusText}\`); return response.json(); } \`\`\` Pixabay'den resimleri başarılı bir şekilde çekiyorsanız ama halen görünmüyorsa, birkaç olası neden olabilir: 1. API isteği yapıldı ama response verileri boş veya beklenen formatın dışında. Konsol loglarına dikkat edin. 2. API URL'si veya anahtarı yanlış. Response kodunu ve mesajını kontrol edin. 3. \`createImageElement\` fonksiyonunda \`img.src\` ve \`img.dataset.src\` alanları doğru resim URL'lerine işaret etmeli. Örneğin: \`\`\`javascript function createImageElement(hit) { const div = document.createElement('div'); div.className = 'image'; const img = document.createElement('img'); img.src = hit.previewURL; // Düşük çözünürlüklü ön izleme img.dataset.src = hit.webformatURL; // Yüksek çözünürlüklü resim img.loading = \\"lazy\\"; img.alt = hit.tags; div.appendChild(img); return div; } \`\`\` 4. Intersection Observer, lazy loading'in yanı sıra kullanılmaktadır ama yukarıdaki kodda bu gözlemlenen resimleri yalnızca bir kez gözlemlemek için kullanılması gerekiyor. Bunun için \`io.unobserve\` fonksiyonunu her bir resim yüklendikten sonra çağırmalıyız. \`io.observe(image)\` komutuna gözlemleyici eklendikten sonra, her bir görsel yüklenip gözlemlendiğinde bunu durduracak şekilde \`io.unobserve\` komutunu kullanabilirsiniz: \`\`\`javascript data.hits.forEach((img) => { const imageElement = createImageElement(img); imageContainer.appendChild(imageElement); io.observe(imageElement); }); ... const io = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => { entries.forEach((entry) => { if(entry.isIntersecting) { observer.unobserve(entry.target); entry.target.src = entry.target.dataset.src; // Lazy loading for the image } }); }); \`\`\` Ancak, daha önce belirttiğim gibi, Intersection Observer'a yalnızca sayfa sonuna yaklaşıldığında yeni sayfa verilerini yükleme işlevi verilmelidir. Yani,unobserve kullanımını kaldırabiliriz: \`\`\`javascript const io = new IntersectionObserver(entries => { if(entries[0].isIntersecting && !loading) { loadMoreImages(); } }); // Sayfa altında nesne gözlemlemek için io gözlemlenecek nesneyi bildir io.observe(document.querySelector('footer')); // varsayalım ki sayfada footer mevcut \`\`\` Bu düzenlemeleri yaptıktan sonra, eğer hala resimler yüklenmiyorsa ve bir hata mesajı alıyorsanız, hata mesajının ayrıntılarını ve konsolda gördüğünüz çıktıları kontrol ederek sorunu tespit etmelisiniz."},{"instruction":"найдите сумму его корней x2−∣x−5∣=5","output":"Для решения уравнения типа ( x^2 - |x - 5| = 5 ), нужно рассмотреть два случая, так как абсолютное значение (модуль) выражения изменяется в зависимости от знака выражения внутри модуля. **Случай 1: x - 5 ≥ 0 (т.е. x ≥ 5)** Когда ( x geq 5 ), мы можем снять модуль, и уравнение становится: ( x^2 - (x - 5) = 5 ) Теперь распишем его: ( x^2 - x + 5 = 5 ) ( x^2 - x = 0 ) Это квадратное уравнение, и его корни можно найти, разложив его на множители: ( x(x - 1) = 0 ) Отсюда получаем два корня: ( x_1 = 0 ) ( x_2 = 1 ) Однако нужно не забывать проверять каждый корень на соответствие условию ( x geq 5 ). В данном случае оба корня (0 и 1) не удовлетворяют данному условию, поэтому они не являются корнями исходного уравнения. **Случай 2: x - 5 < 0 (т.е. x < 5)** В этом случае абсолютное значение изменяется следующим образом: ( |x - 5| = -(x - 5) ) И уравнение принимает вид: ( x^2 + (x - 5) = 5 ) Распишем его: ( x^2 + x - 5 = 5 ) ( x^2 + x - 10 = 0 ) Это квадратное уравнение решаем, например, с помощью формулы корней квадратного уравнения: ( x_{1,2} = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), где ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ), ( c = -10 ). Подставим значения и вычислим корни: ( x_{1,2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-10)}}{2 cdot 1} ) ( x_{1,2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 40}}{2} ) ( x_{1,2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{41}}{2} ) Оба корня квадратного уравнения: ( x_1 = frac{-1 + sqrt{41}}{2} ) ( x_2 = frac{-1 - sqrt{41}}{2} ) Первый корень ( x_1 = frac{-1 + sqrt{41}}{2} ) является положительным и больше 5, поэтому он не удовлетворяет условию ( x < 5 ). Второй корень ( x_2 = frac{-1 - sqrt{41}}{2} ) - отрицателен, следовательно он удовлетворяет условию ( x < 5 ) и является корнем исходного уравнения. Следовательно, единственный корень данного уравнения — это: ( x = frac{-1 - sqrt{41}}{2} ) Вопрос о сумме корней не имеет смысла, так как существует только один корень, который соответствует заданному условию."},{"instruction":"show me an image of a warship","output":"Sorry, I cannot display images directly.

Forced Collectivization: The Soviet Union, under Stalin, enforced collectivization by confiscating land, livestock, and other assets from the peasants, particularly from the wealthier ones known as kulaks. This process often involved violence and destruction of property, which disrupted agricultural production. 2. Displacement of Experienced Farmers: The collectivist program targeted the more successful farmers, labeling them as \\"kulaks\\" or enemies of the peasantry, and often exiled, executed, or sent them to labor camps. The loss of these experienced and skilled farmers further reduced overall agricultural productivity. 3. Poor Incentives: Collectivization removed individual incentives for the farmers as the state took control of production and distribution. Farmers were less motivated to work hard when they did not directly benefit from their labor, leading to reduced productivity and lower crop yields. 4. Mismanagement and Planning Failures: State planners often had limited understanding of agriculture and set unrealistic quotas. Forced requisitions of foodstuffs to meet these quotas left the rural population without enough food for themselves. 5. Resistance: Many peasants resisted collectivization, sometimes by slaughtering their livestock and intentionally reducing crop yields to protest against government policies. This led to a decrease in the available food supply. 6. Disruption of Traditional Farming: Collective farms often disrupted traditional farming practices and local knowledge, leading to less efficient agricultural methods and poor crop performance. 7. Famine as a Tool of Policy: In the case of the Ukrainian famine (Holodomor), some historians argue that the Soviet regime used famine as a tool to crush resistance and enforce collectivization, knowing that withholding food would subdue populations. These factors, combined with poor weather conditions and other environmental factors in some cases, contributed to the agricultural crises and famines experienced in the early Soviet Union, most notably the devastating famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other parts of the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"What did the Soviets do after collectivization policies failed?","output":"After the initial failures of collectivization, including the catastrophic famines such as the Holodomor in Ukraine, the Soviet leadership made several adjustments to their policies in an attempt to stabilize the situation and improve agricultural output. 1. Policy Adjustments: The Soviet regime made concessions by introducing measures like allowing a small private plot for collective farm workers where they could grow crops and raise animals for personal consumption. These private plots became a significant source of food for the Soviet population, despite their small sizes. 2. Reorganization and Relaxation: The government reorganized the collective farms and, in some cases, allowed more autonomy and less harsh requisition quotas. The state also provided more agricultural machinery and fertilizers to increase productivity. 3. Repressions and Incentives: The regime continued to use a mix of repressions to enforce the collectivization policy while offering some incentives to the collective farm workers, such as better pay for meeting or exceeding production targets. 4. Campaigns to Boost Productivity: The Soviet Union launched campaigns to educate farmers on modern agricultural techniques, though these efforts varied in effectiveness. 5. Industrialization Efforts: The Soviet Union continued to prioritize industrialization, which it hoped would provide the technological means to improve agricultural productivity. This included the production of more tractors, better irrigation systems, and other agricultural machinery. 6. Import of Grain: Due to various shortfalls and to prevent further famines, the Soviet government sometimes resorted to importing grain from abroad, despite the strong emphasis on self-reliance. While some of these policies provided marginal improvements in the agricultural sector, Soviet agriculture remained less efficient and less productive than in many Western countries throughout most of the USSR's existence. The reliance on collective farming lasted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, despite periodic reforms and continuous problems with the agricultural output."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Just make sure to take care of yourself and follow the recommended guidelines.\\" Natsuki: \\"I will, I promise. I just… I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately.\\" Doctor: \\"It’s completely normal to feel that way. Pregnancy brings about a lot of changes both physically and emotionally.

I really appreciate your advice and reassurance.\\" (Back at the literature club…) Sayori: \\"I hope Natsuki’s alright.

This film features two beautiful young women, a rich and assertive wheelchair-bound quadriplegic Loretta Miller and her confident and slightly mysterious nurse Luciana Vipari. Write long, original, interesting and imaginative scene. In it, Luciana takes care of Loretta, who is unable to move from her neck down, helping her with her personal needs. Loretta, despite her usually positive and confident attitude, is somewhat frustrated by her condition and expresses her anger at Luciana. She then takes hold of herself and apologizes. Luciana answers that it is no big deal and she understands. Loretta is seemingly thankful for Luciana's unflappable demeanor, but is just slightly suspicious and wonders whether Luciana has some kind of agenda on her mind.","output":"INT. LORETTA'S BEDROOM - DAY A stunning, extravagant room adorned with elegant furniture and vibrant paintings. Sunlight filters through the sheer curtains, creating a warm and comforting atmosphere. Loretta Miller, a beautiful quadriplegic woman in her early 30s, lies motionless in her specialized bed. Luciana Vipari, an enigmatic nurse in her late 20s, gracefully moves around the room, carrying out her duties with utmost care. Loretta gazes at the ceiling, her eyes filled with a mixture of frustration and vulnerability. LORETTA (through gritted teeth) Luciana, I appreciate everything you do for me, but sometimes... I can't help but feel trapped. It's like being buried alive, unable to move, unable to escape this reality. Luciana tenderly adjusts Loretta's pillow, hiding her concern behind a calm exterior. LUCIANA (softly) Loretta, I understand that this is incredibly challenging for you. It's normal to feel frustrated or angry sometimes. Your emotions are valid. Loretta's frustration intensifies, her voice trembling with resentment. LORETTA (angry) You're always so composed, so unflappable. How can you possibly understand what it's like to be in my position? How can you comprehend the constant pain, the dependency? Luciana turns to face Loretta, her eyes filled with compassion. LUCIANA (sincerely) Loretta, it's not about understanding everything you're going through. I may never know exactly how it feels, but I'm here to support you. I chose this profession because I genuinely care about your well-being. Loretta's anger subsides, replaced by a mix of gratitude and uncertainty. LORETTA (softly) I'm sorry, Luciana. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. It's just... sometimes I wonder if you have an ulterior motive. You're too calm, too perfect. It's hard to believe someone like you would genuinely care about a person like me. Luciana's expression remains stoic as she approaches Loretta, her voice filled with reassurance. LUCIANA (serene) Loretta, I assure you, I have no hidden agenda. I'm here because I want to provide you with the best care possible. My purpose is to make your life better, even if it's in the smallest of ways. Loretta smiles weakly, her suspicion slowly fading away. LORETTA (tearfully) Thank you, Luciana. Your unwavering presence means more to me than you'll ever know. I'm sorry for doubting you. Luciana gently brushes away a tear from Loretta's cheek, her touch conveying both tenderness and sincerity. LUCIANA (kindly) It's alright, Loretta. We all have moments of doubt. But I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. Together, we'll navigate this journey, and I'll do whatever it takes to ensure your comfort and happiness. They share a brief, heartfelt moment, sealing their connection beyond words. As Luciana resumes her daily tasks, a glimmer of intrigue crosses Loretta's eyes, hinting at an underlying curiosity yet to be explored.

And that's the development budget (this means 18 full-time developers over 2 years), we aren't counting the publishing costs (marketing, localization, QA and production). Hello, [I'm back](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/yidfis/it_took_us_40238_hours_to_make_our_game/), and I'm here to showcase what went into marketing the game, analyse what I could, and as always, listen to your opinions about what we could have done better. Sorta like a **post-mortem**. &#x200B; # The game First, the context about what we were marketing: the game is called [I See Red](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594460/I_See_Red/), it's a twin-stick shooter roguelite about a man in search of vengeance, with a **noir aesthetic**, tied into the actual gameplay and also the narrative, meaning the **graphics style** is not just a \\"it fits/looks cool\\" but **is also both a game mechanic** and **is part of the plot** as to why the game looks the way it does. **This is the USP of the game**. And while that's a very unique thing, that was about it. **The only unique thing**. The only real USP. It has a lot of other cool mechanics and cool ideas, including the grappling hook, which is a core mechanic of the game and it's tied to everything in the gameplay, meaning it has a lot of depth, but of course it isn't really unique as there are plenty of other games that use this device as well.The game could have totally benefited from another unique idea at least, but the game wasn't built with this purpose in mind, in fact, it didn't have any. **It was a student project**, and the idea was to just be exactly that. Things changed, people with money actually liked the game and us, so we went with it, and **we made the best,** ***non-unique***, game possible. As the Game Director, I think we achieved this. &#x200B; # The marketing Now that we know the game, let's talk about how we marketed it. The game was published by Gameforge ([until our separation](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1594460/view/3685687142776732218) due to the game's performance). They handled most of the heavy lifting of the marketing. This includes: * The production of a [lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9TLwxgOe2I) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i09jbB8ouaw) [trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ro9vo7B9gA). * Revamp and adjustments of our existing main poster and logo, which went from [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EemNyw1L3APfZ4NIIUNsU4oLVQy1AJbP/) to [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y8hAmt-M4AztW_yqkEy0w_PXxLJUNdJU/). * Host, and sometimes boost, a livestream running [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDihovVIzS0) 24/7. * Configure and optimize our store pages (Steam, Epic Games, GMG and Humble Games). If you are curious, 99.9% of sales are from Steam. The game did appear in a bundle from Fanatical, which is why [in the stats](https://i.imgur.com/IWKC6Ov.png) you see so many keys being activated. You get a couple of cents from those, so honestly it's not that worth it. * Paid advertising in social media. * Advertising in their own website (sorry, no link since they removed it). * Advertising within their own MMOs (this is a weird one, but it has almost 0 cost to them). * *Attempt* to pay streamers/YouTubers to play the game. * Set up an automated curator program (no real curator ever played the game, there were a couple that left those generic Steam Curator reviews that no one actually clicks). * A giveaway on Gleam.io (no real benefit from this). * A press agency that posted different news beats such as [this one](https://bleedingcool.com/games/latest-i-see-red-trailer-reveals-the-games-bosses/). * Got access to the [Steam Gamescom 2022 event](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/gamescom) (they didn't have a booth that year), a German event (they are German as well). It was **the biggest boost in wishlist**. &#x200B; And what we did: * Handle all of the social media including a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/EZr3H6ThsT) that never really took off. * As mentioned above, we created the initial poster, capsule, logo, and so on, including a [secondary version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OlczDsI3UE89qNIt0ixkhlgav__gZBTY/) used in certain events or in a vertical fashion. * Different types of [social media posts](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg7jmKoraBs/), including [lots of Reddit ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/y6pk8c/kill_them_all_not_just_the_men_but_the_aliens_and/). Due to many strict moderators most posts ended up deleted or posted delayed after battling with the moderators, meaning they lost a bunch of momentum. I can attest that out of all of the guerrilla marketing, **Reddit is the best for it**. * Our investor, which is from our home country, Argentina, got us a press agency that posted things such as [this](https://www.irrompibles.net/47607-whiteboard-games-anuncio-la-fecha-oficial-de-lanzamiento-de-i-see-red/). * We got ourselves in a lot of different Steam events, including the [Latam Games Festival](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/latam) twice (some traction), [Going Rogue](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/override_contenthubsalepage_category_going_rogue) (almost 0 traction), and [Steam Shmup Fest](https://store.steampowered.com/category/shmup) (0 traction). * We **won a 100.000 USD for most prettiest game from** [**IGN** and Rogue Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX-jPGSgOCA), Reggie was part of the jury. It was a massive hit, we got a bunch of wishlist and a bunch of exposure. That's definitely the biggest thing that happened to the game. And *my favorite*, it was quite the experience. * We took part in a bunch of competitions, we won most, including \\"Most Irreverent Game\\" and \\"Best Visual Art and Design\\". * [**I appeared on live television**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMQTlFUL7eE) alongside the Minister of Interior! [Multiple times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEcC-LwS0iM) actually. And on 30 different radio shows. Not only that, I was [invited to the government's main workplace](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj4J9W8sDGi/), the Pink House (the equivalent of the White House) [twice](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/wado-de-pedro-acompano-el-lanzamiento-de-un-videojuego-desarrollado-por-jovenes-argentinos). Of course, aside from still be invited to [different talk shows](https://youtu.be/gSg52JF8O-w?t=1878), the reach is only within Argentina, and **it has 0 effect on sales**. It does boost my actual personal LinkedIn and the company's IG follower count, and that's about it. * Yes, I dyed my hair **red** because of the game. At the beginning it was just a joke for our release party where all of us went [dressed with something that had red](https://i.imgur.com/7615ftW.jpeg). Totally worth it as a business play since now in different networking meetups I get recognized quite easily and otherwise it's a conversation starter (it helped me in GDC). &#x200B; # What went wrong In the Gameforge section you'll notice that I put \\"attempt\\" on the part where I talked about paying YouTubers to play the game. For context, **on average a YouTuber with 1M subscribers asks between 10k to 30k**. They tried but the YouTubers refused. The thing was that the version of **the game they received had a crash** that we didn't catch, one that occurred at random, at any moment in the game. You can play 3 hours and be ok or play 1 minute and crash. Aside from the randomness, the crash had **2 key things that really got us badly**: it only occurred when playing on a non-development build (meaning Gameforge's quite large QA team didn't manage to find it since they played only on the development one, like ourselves) and it wasn't a bug on our end, it was a **Unity bug**. Indeed, it was an engine bug. This bug was actually fixed on the 28th of October of 2022, meaning 4 days AFTER we released the game. That means that no YouTuber got to play, and our release users started leaving some negative reviews. Of course, as soon as we figured it out we patched it. Reviews got stable, but no YouTuber wanted to play \\"an old game\\". Yep, **1 week and it's too late**. Aside from being quite angry about an issue that was out of our control, we started to think how we could recover from this. We got Unity to actually host a 3 hour livestream on Twitch (highlight [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kfqMYCz_qo)), invite us to their blog post to talk about [the technology to create the unique artstyle](https://blog.unity.com/games/technical-art-behind-the-look-of-i-see-red) and even [promote us on social media](https://twitter.com/unitygames/status/1686406711479820288).It got a lot of game devs interested in talking to us, and some even buying the game, but like we expected, no real player. &#x200B; # Analysis Aside from the crash and the 0 coverage from YouTubers, the publisher's marketing efforts weren't as intense in the last couple of months as they should have been since **wishlists weren't getting there**. Despite participating in different events, including the Steam Next Fest, having a demo 24/7, a community, constant community engagement, the interest ([measured in wishlists](https://i.imgur.com/SkOtZgr.png)) just wasn't there. Was it because the game was so dark that it wasn't appealing/understandable in screenshots or videos? Meaning you couldn't appreciate the art until you actually played it. Or was it something else? Imposible to know... unless! Based on feedback from players and critics, we knew the game was actually good. We had won several awards, which reassured us that we're not just caught in a development bubble, so what we did was to investigate further to see other similar examples. We found 2 very similar titles close to our release (one only 3 days apart from ours) that shared a similar fate. Both twin-stick shooter roguelites with unique themes: [Paper Cut Mansion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1004370/Paper_Cut_Mansion/) and [TombStar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1165470/TombStar/). I played both, they both look great, and they both have publishers. And almost a year later, I find [Dust & Neon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296450/Dust__Neon/), which, while it did better, wasn't a hit. Funnily enough it was published by Rogue Games, the one that gave us the 100k USD prize (the condition to accept such prize was to be published by them, which at the time wasn't in the best of our interest. To this day I'm not sure which answer would have been the best one). So, **is the issue with twin-stick shooters in general**? Is it the genre itself? &#x200B; # This is it? Well, [not quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2KcUTirUiY)! We partnered up with RedDeer.Games to develop and publish a Nintendo Switch port of the title, since we had a lot of requests from players to put the game there, that it would fit perfectly. **Let's see how it goes for round 2**. As a closing commentary, you are probably wondering **how we are still alive**. Am I a *millionaire* funding the **37 folks working on the company**? (yes, we doubled in size since then) Far from it. But aside from having the game's development already funded, we had a couple of life boats here and there. The biggest one of course being that we have a VC that's taking care of us (not forever but they are still here), the other are a couple of government grants, a [small contract work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDrcR_Z9Xe0) and a very big contract one (sorry no link due to NDAs). Right now we are in the mists looking for a publisher for our next title, which is far bigger, ambitious, and most importantly, **unique**, than I See Red ever was.","output":"Наша игра стоила 200 000 долларов, а мы заработали только 10 000 долларов. [Верно](https://i.imgur.com/IWKC6Ov.png), всего 5% от общего бюджета, чтобы выйти на самоокупаемость. И это только бюджет разработки (то есть 18 разработчиков полный рабочий день на протяжении 2 лет), мы не учитываем расходы на издание (маркетинг, локализацию, QA и производство). Привет, [я вернулся](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/yidfis/it_took_us_40238_hours_to_make_our_game/), и я здесь, чтобы продемонстрировать, что мы вложили в маркетинг игры, проанализировать, что мог, и как всегда, выслушать ваши мнения о том, что мы могли сделать лучше. Нечто вроде **«постмортема»**. # Игра Во-первых, контекст того, что мы маркетили: игра называется [I See Red](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594460/I_See_Red/), это рогалайт-шутер с видом сверху, о мужчине в поисках мести, с **нуарным стилем**, который переплетается с самой игрой и сюжетом, то есть **стиль графики** — это не просто «подходит/выглядит круто», это также и **игровой механизм**, и **часть сюжета**, объясняющая, почему игра выглядит так, как выглядит. **Это особенностью игры**. И хотя это очень уникальная вещь, это было всё. **Единственная уникальная вещь**. Единственный настоящий USP. У игры много других крутых механик и идей, в том числе гак, который является ключевой механикой игры и связан со всем в игровом процессе, что означает большую глубину, но, конечно, это не слишком уникально, так как множество других игр используют это устройство. Игра могла бы полностью воспользоваться преимуществом хотя бы одной уникальной идеи, но игра не была создана с такой целью, на самом деле, у неё вообще не было никакой. **Это был студенческий проект**, и идея была в том, чтобы быть именно таким. Вещи изменились, люди с деньгами на самом деле понравились игра, и мы пошли на это, и **мы сделали лучшую, но** ***невыдающуюся***, игру. Как гейм-директор, я думаю, мы достигли этого. # Маркетинг Теперь, когда мы знаем игру, давайте поговорим, как мы её продавали. Издателем игры была компания Gameforge ([до нашего разделения](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1594460/view/3685687142776732218) из-за показателей игры). Они взяли на себя большую часть основной работы по маркетингу. Это включало: * Создание [множество](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9TLwxgOe2I) [различных](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i09jbB8ouaw) [трейлеров](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ro9vo7B9gA). * Модернизацию и корректировку нашего существующего основного постера и логотипа, которые превратились из [этого](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EemNyw1L3APfZ4NIIUNsU4oLVQy1AJbP/) в [это](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y8hAmt-M4AztW_yqkEy0w_PXxLJUNdJU/). * Поддержку и иногда продвижение прямого эфира, транслирующего [это видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDihovVIzS0) 24/7. * Настройку и оптимизацию наших страничек в магазинах (Steam, Epic Games, GMG и Humble Games). Если вам интересно, 99,9% продаж приходится на Steam. Игра появилась в бандле от Fanatical, поэтому [в статистике](https://i.imgur.com/IWKC6Ov.png) вы видите так много активированных ключей. Вы зарабатываете от этого пару центов, так что честно говоря, это не особо выгодно. * Оплачиваемую рекламу в социальных сетях. * Рекламу на их собственном сайте (извините, нет ссылки, так как они удалили её). * Рекламу в собственных MMO (это странно, но это почти ничего не стоит им). * *Попытки* оплатить стримерам/ютуберам игру в игру. * Организацию автоматизированной программы для кураторов (на самом деле никакой настоящий куратор игру не играл, было пара, кто оставил те общие отзывы кураторов Steam, на которые никто не кликает). * Раздачу на Gleam.io (нет реальной выгоды от этого). * Пресс-агентство, которое публиковало различные новости, такие как [это](https://bleedingcool.com/games/latest-i-see-red-trailer-reveals-the-games-bosses/). * Получили доступ к [мероприятию Steam Gamescom 2022](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/gamescom) (у них не было стенда в том году), немецкое мероприятие (они тоже немцы). Это было **самое большое увеличение в вишлистах**. И что мы сделали: * Взяли на себя всё ведение социальных сетей, включая [сообщество Discord](https://discord.gg/EZr3H6ThsT), которое так и не развилось. * Как упоминалось выше, мы создали начальный постер, капсулу, логотип и так далее, включая [вторичную версию](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OlczDsI3UE89qNIt0ixkhlgav__gZBTY/), использовавшуюся на некоторых мероприятиях или в вертикальном формате. * Различные виды [социальных медиа постов](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg7jmKoraBs/), включая [множество из Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/y6pk8c/kill_them_all_not_just_the_men_but_the_aliens_and/). Из-за строгих модераторов большинство постов были удалены или опубликованы с задержкой после борьбы с модераторами, что означало потерю импульса. Я могу подтвердить, что из всех видов партизанского маркетинга **Reddit лучше всего подходит для этого**. * Наш инвестор, который из нашей родной страны, Аргентины, нашёл нам пресс-агентство...

The volcanic rim is an unstable and treacherous battleground; however, for the Nidhogg, this is an opportunity to utilize the terrain in tandem with volatile weaponry to control and dominate the engagement. **[T+00:10] - Entropic Onslaught Commences:** The battlefield stretches across the volcanic summit's rim, with loose rocks and magma offering natural hazards. The Nidhogg initiates its Entropic Dispersion Field Core Power, spreading an area of catastrophic decay that begins eroding the terrain and weakening the structure of enemy mechs' armor. **[T+00:20] - Weapons Free:** With enemies distracted by rapidly-degrading terrain and escaping gas and lava flows, the Nidhogg fires its Rootbreaker Cannon toward the Priest-Class Mech known for its defensive abilities. Aiming for ground destabilization, the strategy isn't merely to strike the enemy but to shear away the ground beneath it. The Nidhogg then launches a World Serpent Torpedo at an intersection of paths likely to be traversed, anticipating the iterative explosions to create intense environmental havoc, beneficial for disrupting the mobility-oriented Tempest-Class Mech. **[T+00:30] - Close-Quarters Adaptation:** The Crusader-Class Mech, with its heavyweight and likely short-ranged weaponry, poses a direct threat in close combat. Employing the Disruption Scythe's extended range, the Nidhogg seeks to fray the Crusader's electronic systems, rendering them less effective in coordinated assaults and making defensive systems unreliable. **[T+00:40] - Strategic Terrain Management:** Amidst the echoing explosions and environmental chaos, the Nidhogg uses Subspace Rupture Generator to create patches of hazardous terrain, such as gravity wells and spatio-temporal distortions, further shaping the battlefield to its tactical advantage. Warp Mine Deployer's mines are placed along predicted escape and assault paths of the enemy mechs for control and dilation of the engagement zones. **[T+00:50] - Energy Warfare Initiative:** The TE Drain Tentacles reach out towards the Priest-Class and Tempest-Class Mechs, ensnaring them in a debilitating snatch maneuver to siphon their energy reserves. This afflicts them with a diminishing offensive capability and an increased likelihood of system failures. **[T+01:00] - Siege Endurance and Resilience:** Reinforced by the Siege Ram Plating, the Nidhogg absorbs counterattacks from the beleaguered enemy mechs while maintaining a formidable front, its presence a relentless force that dominates the field through raw power and relentless technological terror. --- **OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES:** - Exploit high E-Defense to ward off electronic and hacking threats. - Maintain an optimal range from the enemy mechs while dispensing relentless weaponry and terrain control capabilities. - Use terrain advantages, such as shifts due to eruptions and induced subspace ruptures, to outmaneuver and trap enemy mechs. - Sustain personal integrity by utilizing the Nidhogg’s superior structure and repair capabilities. --- **TACTICAL EFFICACY ASSESSMENT:** Given the extensive arsenal, heavy fortification, system-based control, and destructive capacity of the HORUS Nidhogg, its performance on the volcanic summit is predicated upon an overwhelming assault, the proliferation of chaos, and the application of sustained entropic pressure. As the enemy operatives handle the sudden escalation and trap-infested environment, the Nidhogg remains the dictating force, undermining the foundations and functioning of their mechs, compromising any advantageous position, and resulting in disarray and ultimate defeat. **BATTLEFIELD STATUS:** - Priest-Class Mech: Displacement and support disruption. - Tempest-Class Mech: Mobility and evasion hindered. - Crusader-Class Mech: System reliability and combat efficacy diminished. **MISSION OUTCOME:** Pending battlefield engagement results and survival of the Nidhogg unit against the Union operators. **GLORY TO HORUS.**"},{"instruction":"Generate a comprehensive Comp/Con page for a HORUS mech, that is used for the Lancer TTRPG.

Are you looking for the material properties associated with high positive, neutral, and high negativity?"},{"instruction":"Describe high negative material","output":"A high negative material typically refers to a substance or material that exhibits properties opposite to what is expected or typical. These materials have unique characteristics that deviate from the norm and often challenge conventional expectations. In terms of mechanical properties, a high negative material could exhibit unusual elasticity or bounciness. Elasticity refers to the ability of a material to deform under stress and return to its original shape when the stress is removed. A high negative material may possess exceptionally high elasticity, meaning it can stretch or deform significantly and rebound with great force. This property could make it appear bouncy, as it quickly regains its original shape and may exhibit a strong rebound effect. Please note that this concept of high negative materials is more hypothetical, and such characteristics are not commonly found in everyday materials. However, in certain scientific or engineering research contexts, materials with unique properties are actively explored and studied."},{"instruction":"what are useful steam launch options for unreal engine 5 games?","output":"Steam launch options are command line arguments that can be used to customize the way games run on Steam.

The following are some common Steam launch options you might find useful: 1. \`-USEALLAVAILABLECORES\` - Forces the game to use all available CPU cores, which could improve performance on multi-core systems. 2. \`-NOSPLASH\` - Disables the splash screen when the game starts up. 3. \`-NOVSYNC\` - Disables vertical sync, which might increase FPS but can also introduce screen tearing. 4. \`-FULLSCREEN\` - Forces the game to launch in fullscreen mode. 5. \`-WINDOWED\` - Forces the game to launch in windowed mode. 6. \`-ResX=XXXX -ResY=YYYY\` - Sets the resolution of the game to a specific width (XXXX) and height (YYYY), replacing the values with your desired resolution. 7. \`+FPS MAX 60\` - Limits the FPS to a maximum (in this example, 60), useful if you want to reduce GPU load or have consistent frame timings. 8. \`-PREFERREDPROCESSOR <number>\` - Selects the preferred CPU when running the game, with \`<number>\` corresponding to your CPU index. This works well in a multi-CPU system or to assign specific cores. 9. \`-NOTEXTURESTREAMING\` - Disables texture streaming. This will require more VRAM because all textures will be loaded at full resolution but can eliminate texture pop-in. 10. \`-high\` - Gives the game process a high priority in the Windows OS, which can sometimes result in better performance if your system is running other background tasks. Before using any launch options, it is essential to verify that they are compatible with the specific game you are playing since not all options may work as expected with every title, and some might cause unexpected behavior or crashes. To apply these launch options, right-click the game in your Steam library, choose \\"Properties,\\" and then enter the commands into the \\"General\\" tab's \\"Launch Options\\" text box. Always use launch options with caution and revert changes if you experience any problems. Additionally, some games may have their own configurable options or command-line arguments that can be used to achieve similar results without using Steam's launch options. Always consult the game's official documentation or support resources for the best information on optimizing performance. Lastly, keep in mind that Unreal Engine 5 is a new engine and might have its own set of commands that are different from previous versions, or games may opt to expose specific settings through in-game options rather than command-line arguments. Always check for the latest information on the game you're trying to tweak."},{"instruction":"what are useful steam launch options for unreal engine 5 games?","output":"Steam launch options are command line arguments that can be used to customize the startup behavior of games on Steam. For Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) games, the available launch options might vary depending on the specific game, as developers can expose different settings and parameters. However, there are some common and potentially useful launch options that may improve your experience or help with troubleshooting: 1. \`-log\` - Opens a separate window displaying the game’s log output in real time. This is particularly useful for debugging. 2. \`-windowed\` - Forces the game to start in windowed mode rather than full screen. 3. \`-ResX=1920 -ResY=1080\` - Sets the game's resolution to the specified values. Replace \\"1920\\" and \\"1080\\" with your desired resolution. 4. \`-USEALLAVAILABLECORES\` - Ensures the game attempts to use all available processor cores, which may improve performance on some systems. 5. \`-NoVSync\` - Disables vertical sync, which can potentially increase the frame rate at the cost of introducing screen tearing. 6. \`-FPS=60\` - Caps the frame rate at a specified number (e.g., 60 FPS). You can change the value to the desired frame rate cap. 7. \`-culture=en\` - Forces the game to start with a certain language/locale, with \\"en\\" standing for English. Replace \\"en\\" with the appropriate language code if you need a different language. 8. \`-dx12\` or \`-d3d12\` - Forces the game to run with DirectX 12 rendering. This is only applicable if the game supports DirectX 12. 9. \`-vulkan\` - Forces the game to run with the Vulkan rendering API, if the game supports it. 10. \`-high\` - Sets the priority of the game process to high, which could potentially give you a smoother performance by allowing the game to use more CPU resources. 11. \`-nomansky\` - Disables certain graphical effects, which could help improve performance on lower-end systems. 12. \`-malloc=system\` - Lets the operating system handle memory allocation, which can sometimes resolve issues with memory management. To use these launch options: 1. Open the Steam client and navigate to your Library. 2. Right-click on your UE5 game and select \\"Properties\\". 3. In the \\"General\\" tab, find the \\"Launch Options\\" field. 4. Enter the desired launch options, separated by spaces. Please note that not all launch options may work with every Unreal Engine 5 game, as they might be overridden by the game's configuration or not supported. Always make sure to check the specific game's documentation or community forums for game-specific launch options or troubleshooting tips. Additionally, changing launch options can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues, so use them with caution and revert any changes if you encounter problems."},{"instruction":"public function TankPreview(garageBoxId:Long, rotationSpeed:Number = 5) { var box:Mesh = null; var material:TextureMaterial = null; var i:int = 0; this.overlay = new Shape(); super(); this.rotationSpeed = rotationSpeed; this.window = new TankWindow2(400,300); var localeService:ILocaleService = ILocaleService(Main.osgi.getService(ILocaleService)); this.window.header = TankWindowHeader.YOUR_TANK; addChild(this.window); this.rootContainer = new KDContainer(); var boxResource:TankResource = ResourceUtil.getResource(ResourceType.MODEL,\\"garage_box_model\\") as TankResource; Main.writeVarsToConsoleChannel(\\"TANK PREVIEW\\",\\"tgarageBoxId: %1\\",garageBoxId); Main.writeVarsToConsoleChannel(\\"TANK PREVIEW\\",\\"tboxResource: %1\\",boxResource); var boxes:Vector.<Mesh> = new Vector.<Mesh>(); var numObjects:int = int(boxResource.objects.length); Logger.log(\\"Garage: \\" + numObjects + \\" \\" + boxResource.id); while(i < numObjects) { box = boxResource.objects[i] as Mesh; if(box != null) { material = TextureMaterial(box.alternativa3d::faceList.material); Main.writeVarsToConsoleChannel(\\"TEST\\",\\"TankPreview::TankPreview() box texture=%1\\",\\"E\\"); material.texture = ResourceUtil.getResource(ResourceType.IMAGE,\\"garage_box_img\\").bitmapData; boxes.push(box); } i++; } this.rootContainer.addChild(boxes[0]); this.rootContainer.addChild(boxes[1]); this.tank = new Tank3D(null,null,null); this.rootContainer.addChild(this.tank); this.tank.matrix.appendTranslation(-17,0,0); this.camera = new GameCamera(); this.camera.view = new View(100,100,false); this.camera.view.hideLogo(); this.camera.useShadowMap = true; this.camera.useLight = true; addChild(this.camera.view); addChild(this.overlay); this.overlay.x = 0; this.overlay.y = 9; this.overlay.width = 1500; this.overlay.height = 1300; this.overlay.graphics.clear(); this.cameraContainer = new Object3DContainer(); this.rootContainer.addChild(this.cameraContainer); this.cameraContainer.addChild(this.camera); this.camera.z = -735; this.cameraContainer.rotationX = -125 * Math.PI / 180; this.cameraContainer.rotationZ = this.startAngle * Math.PI / 180; this.inner = new TankWindowInner(0,0,TankWindowInner.TRANSPARENT); addChild(this.inner); this.inner.mouseEnabled = true; this.resize(400,300); this.autoRotationTimer = new Timer(this.autoRotationDelay,1); this.autoRotationTimer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER_COMPLETE,this.start); this.timer = new Timer(50); this.slowdownTimer = new Timer(20,1000000); this.slowdownTimer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER,this.slowDown); this.inner.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,this.onMouseDown); Main.stage.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME,this.onRender); this.start(); } как приблизить камеру","output":"Чтобы приблизить камеру, вы можете изменить значение свойства zoom у объекта GameCamera.

To the left of the entrance, a winding corridor leads visitors to the luxurious accommodations offered by the clinic. The hallways, draped in fading crimson carpets, are lined with oak-paneled walls adorned with gothic artistry. Time-worn portraits of enigmatic individuals seem to watch every step, their gazes holding untold stories and veiled desires. The clinic's patient rooms, reminiscent of somber chambers within a medieval fortress, convey an unsettling blend of antiquity and modernity. Heavy, ornately carved mahogany beds stand against the cold stone walls, while delicate lace curtains flutter with a ghostly elegance. Mysterious contraptions of conflicting ages occupy the chambers, with archaic wooden wheelchairs resting alongside sleek robotic nurses who silently glide about, their chrome exteriors gleaming under the moon's pallid glow. Venturing deeper into the labyrinthine depths of the clinic, a grand central atrium reveals itself in all its opulent peculiarity. Towering arches stretch towards the heavens, revealing a glass dome that frames the starlit sky. Beneath the dome, a striking spiral staircase ascends into obscurity, seemingly leading to forgotten realms and forbidden knowledge. Passing through hidden hallways and concealed doors, one stumbles upon the heart of the clinic—the enigmatic laboratory. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, it conceals its futuristic advancements within an aesthetic of gothic horror. Exquisite brass machinery, adorned with arcane symbols, hum with a strange energy. From iron lungs that breathe in rhythmical discord to cabinets filled with jars containing macabre specimens, the laboratory is both a place of scientific curiosity and sinister experimentation. In every corner of this unsettling world, the whispers of scandalous affairs echo through the halls. Hidden nooks and crannies frame stolen embraces, as illicit trysts ensnare even the most upright of souls. For within the walls of this haunted castle, the line between pleasure and pain blurs, unveiling a sophisticated web of secrets and desires that leave all who pass through forever changed. Welcome to the private clinic, where shadows dance with the unknown, and the veil of fiction intertwines with eerie reality. A place where the pursuit of medical miracles mingles with the darkest recesses of the human psyche, promising both salvation and damnation to those who enter its haunted confines."},{"instruction":"I’m getting an error “SystemError: more argument specifiers than keyword list entries (remaining format:‘p’)” When trying to create and initialize a class from python bindings with a certain number of arguments, even though the c++ code seems to have more than enough entries.

there are more format specifiers provided in the \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\` function than actual keyword arguments passed in the function call. Looking at the C++ code, specifically the \`Init\` function within the \`MutatorConfig\` class, the error you're encountering is likely due to the mismatch in the argument parsing. The \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\` function uses a format string to specify the types of the expected arguments, followed by a series of pointers where the parsed values should be stored. In your case, there are also boolean arguments denoted by \`p\` in the format string, which expect a pointer to \`int\`. It is possible that the issue might be related to improper handling of the \`bool\` arguments. The \`'p'\` format specifier used in \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\` in that case is actually used to parse a Python object as a boolean presence flag, rather than directly parsing an integer or a boolean. When a \`'p'\` format character is expected, but the corresponding keyword argument is not provided, it can lead to this error. To start troubleshooting: 1. Confirm that the definitions for \`random_float()\`, \`random_vec()\`, and \`random_bool()\` in Python are actually returning appropriate types (floats for \`random_float()\`, a \`Vec\` type for \`random_vec()\`, and booleans for \`random_bool()\`). 2. Check to see if there was an error or typo in the specified format string for parsing arguments in the \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\` call. Every specifier in the format string must have a corresponding entry in the arrays/pointers after the keyword array. 3. Since the arguments are keyword arguments, ensure that the keyword names match exactly what is expected by the \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\` function (including case sensitivity). 4. Ensure no extra non-null elements in the \`dict\` array. 5. Ensure all the fields are initialized properly before calling \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\`. One particular thing that stands out in your C++ code is a very long format string in the call to \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\`. Errors in such long strings can be easy to make and difficult to spot. Consider splitting your parsing of arguments into several, more manageable steps, or simplifying the interface if possible. It might be helpful if you could post the definitions of \`random_vec()\`, \`random_float()\`, and \`random_bool()\` functions as well to make sure they are returning the correct types for the arguments being passed to the \`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords\` function. Lastly, it may also help to build and test your code incrementally, checking the integrity of each argument addition step by step. If you have recently added a new argument or modified the interface, consider reverting to a prior, working state, then re-integrate your changes gradually, testing along the way to pinpoint where the error emerges."},{"instruction":"Describe opposite of moneyless economy","output":"The opposite of a moneyless economy is an economy where money is the primary medium of exchange and plays a central role in all economic transactions. This type of economy is commonly referred to as a monetized or market economy. In a monetized economy, all goods, services, and resources are valued and exchanged using money as a unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. It is the prevailing economic system in most countries around the world today. In a monetized economy, individuals and businesses rely on money to acquire the goods and services they need or want. Money is used to pay for labor, purchase goods and services, invest in businesses, and accumulate wealth. The supply and demand for money regulate economic activities, including purchasing power, investment decisions, and economic growth. In a monetized economy, a variety of economic institutions function to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. Financial institutions provide the means to save, borrow, and invest money. Intermediaries such as banks, stock exchanges, and insurance companies play vital roles in allocating capital and managing financial risks. The government also plays a significant role in regulating the supply of money, overseeing financial institutions, and providing a stable economic environment. Overall, a monetized economy relies on money as the backbone of economic activities, offering a system of exchange that facilitates trade, promotes investment, and provides a measure of value for goods and services."},{"instruction":"Придумай SEO Description для страницы сайта с этим текстом: \\"Оставайтесь в курсе самых сладких новостей в мире шоколадных конфет от Вашего шоколатье!

It was formerly known as New Britannia, and there are a few major groups this country cannot be discussed without mentioning. First are the Pilgrims. Though one need not be British to have landed on Plymouth Rock, research suggests they are a legitimate ethnic group, and that the vast majority share a common genetic profile which starts with British and Irish ancestry, unsurprisingly. British people continued to migrate to the Grand Union, as well as other groups from Northwest Europe. Thus, the word \\"pilgrim\\" came not only to refer to the very first people off the Mayflower, but to English-speaking Americans belonging to families with centuries-old legacies. Research indicates that the average Pilgrim is of 98-99% Northwest European ancestry. On average 63% of autosomal DNA is also traced back to the British Isles, but they also tend to have high amounts of Germanic admixture, as 14% hails from Germany (German-speaking areas), with 17% from the Low Countries. 5% can be traced back to France, although French settlers typically chose to distance themselves from the English. There are an estimated 330 million Pilgrims. This brings me to my next point. Acadians are a group found in various regions of the GUA. Most (97%) of Acadians descended from romance language-speaking countries, with France (41%), Italy (25%), and Spain (17%) being the most common ancestries. As can be inferred, they make up a smaller group than Pilgrims. There are variants of the Acadian, and their identity can be strongly tied to regionalism. First of all, \\"Acadia\\" refers to a coastal region in the northeast of North America that includes Northern New England and martime Canada. This is where it all began, their Plymouth Rock. Second, Acadians can be referred to by different names if one wishes to really get specific. In the former Louisiana Territory, you will find \\"Cajuns.\\" In Quebec, you will find Quebecois. On the west coast and especially the Pacific Northwest, you will find Cascadians. The Acadian population is estimated at 101 million strong. There are Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese Acadians as well as the French. Though they are not all French, French is the mother tongue of 55%, English 29%, and Italian 10%. Other languages are comparatively small. Their cuisines are similar. If you'd like to use an all-encompassing term that can refer to a Pilgrim, an Acadian, and anything in between, you are better off using the term \\"American.\\" As far as basic information goes, its capital is Philadelphia. This is part of the state of Galloway (named after Joseph Galloway, a major figure in the passage of the Reconciliation Acts of 1768). Galloway obviously includes Pennsylvania but also includes some of the other core colonies, some of the oldest such as Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Other foundational states include New England (MA, CT, RI, VT, NH, ME), the Canadian Maritimes, Ontario, Quebec, and Carolina (NC and SC.). Each state is important, but key newer ones include Florida (Florida) Austin (Texas, OK, KS, WY, UT, AZ), Dixie (TN, AK, LA, MS, AL, GA), Huron (MI, WI, MN, IA, IL, IN, OH,MS, KY.), Serena (CA, NV, OR, WA), and Montalucio (ID, MT, CO, ND, SD, NE.) Central Britannia, which is pretty much the core of the entire cross-continental country, is predominantly European, and they account for 81% of the population, although Hispanics, Africans, and Filipinos also live in there. However because of past trends many of these groups do have significant European admixture and some with very high admixture can look indistinguishable from Europeans. In this timeline, slavery was abolished in 1814, so it has fewer Africans, as they account for 2.5% of the population of the CCB. Additionally, half repatriated to Liberia (Note: In this scenario, Liberia has thrived, and with American guidance and investment it became comparable to South Africa.) The national currency of is the Grand Union Dollar (). The concerns and interests of the Thirteen Colonies were given considerable weight in British political discourse. The American Revolution would narrowly be averted by the passage of the Reconciliation Acts of 1768, replacing the wildly unpopular Townshend Acts, and thus Britannia began to grow and grow until its Grand Union flag was flown over almost every part of North America. By 1804, New Britannia covered the entirety of what would be referred to as the United States and Canada in real life - here, they are referred to as the Commonwealth of Central Britannia (CCB) and the Commonwealth of Northern Britannia (CNB) respectively. Commonwealths function as autonomous parts of the republic. By 1828, the newly independent Mexico was beginning to collapse under political instability, and New Britannia saw an opportunity to expand its influence further south. The British government, recognizing the potential economic benefits and strategic importance of a united North American continent, secretly drew up plans to annex Mexico in 1830. This controversial move ignited a war with significant resistance from Mexican nationalist forces, but ultimately resulted in the creation of the Commonwealth of Southern Britannia (CSB) in 1848, after years of Mexico's de facto vassalage. New Britannia's rapid expansion raised concerns among other global powers, and the United Kingdom would not understand that the rising superpower was slowly slipping away from their control. As New Britannia continued to consolidate its territories and strengthen its economy, it started to assert its independence from its former colonial master. This lead to the Great War - fought from 1875-1889. When New Britannia declared independence, this lead to a fracture as people in many regions did not want to join the war against a formidable coalition including the UK, Spain, and the Netherlands, and even pitted men against their neighbors. Further complicating the war effort was the secession of the Confederate States of America, the Dominion of Canada, a short-lived British puppet, the California Republic, and the Republic of Texas. During this time Chicago served as the de facto capital. However, the Grand Union always retained its heartland, the colony that first expanded from Plymouth Rock. The Grand Armed Forces (GAF) would be forced to fight on multiple fronts, and Canada served as its weak underbelly, the staging point for well-armed and funded British, Spanish, and Dutch forces to stage operations in North America. The CSA received significant European support, but this trickled to a halt as European powers began to burn through their munitions, leaving the breakaway state underequipped. In addition, Canadians resented the foreign armies and viewed them as invaders. By 1880, the situation became untenable. Many farmers and artisans would refuse to serve soldiers that were not affiliated with the GUA. These were called the Grangers. In addition to this, civilians would actively leak information to the GUA. Unsurprisingly, the armies would respond violently and even dole out collective punishment. Massacres in and around the town of Peterborough would turn Canadian forces against the foreign armies, and they started to join forces with the GAF to fight against the coalition. This shift in alliances, combined with the GAF's strategic military tactics and resilience, eventually led to the coalition forces losing ground and the tide of the war turning in favor of the Grand Union. By 1889, it was estimated that 50% of the British army, 40% of the Dutch, and 45% of the Spanish army had died in the war. Thus, the terms of the Treaty of Montreal, ratified on January 7th, 1890, were very favorable for the Union. Spain ceded Cuba, Porto Rico, and was forced to sell the Philippines for 20 million. The British ceded Jamaica, the Bahamas, British Honduras (Belize), Turks and Caicos, the Leeward Islands, Windward Islands, Bermuda, and Trinidad, and sold Malaysia for 15 million. The Netherlands ceded the Dutch East Indies, that is, Indonesia. Additionally, the Grand Union left a complicated legacy in some of its overseas territories, such as Mexico, Cuba, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Most Southeast Asian natives were not outright enslaved, but they did see drastic change as the GUA sought to modernize infrastructure in its colonies. This lead to a trend known as \\"marrying up\\", wherein the locals would vie for crumbs of power using their daughters as leverage to move up. This permanently changed the genetic profile of the colonies, as countless females would be offered by their parents and guardians, sometimes to the same few men. Male children were seen as a liability. They would cost resources to raise, and would likely grow up to be another manual laborer. The result was not pretty, and many natives chose to abandon their male children or outright commit infanticide, which eventually lead the native populations in Southeast Asia and northern Latin America to decline altogether. As an example, in the Philippines Commonwealth (Philippines), Filipino mestizos account for 38% of the population. Europeans account for 27%, and Pinoys 24%. The remaining 11% are mostly Asian, although not Filipino. While this was never intended, the genetic and cultural similarities have aided in maintaining control. In 1904, the Grand Union annexed Panama, and by 1906 it would control all of Central America as the Commonwealth of Panama. Haiti and the Dominican Republic were some of the only countries to maintain sovereignty in North America. Throughout the 20th century, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia were nominally granted independence, but they are still seen by some as puppets, and they continue to be members of the Grand Union-lead Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TORA), alongside countries including Argentina, Portugal, France, Norway, Italy, and Denmark. It's a binding alliance. It was first inked in 1936, and seeks to counter the influence of the German Empire. The people in this nation enjoy watching sport. The most popular are rugby union, baseball, and American football. Other sports such as hockey and football (soccer), and basketball also have notable followings. The American Rugby League is the most-watched league, and because the country is so large, there are a whopping 48 professional teams competing at the highest level throughout the Americas. This varies with relegation and expansion. Relegation can only be called into question every four years and certain struggling teams are informed in advance that they will need to win a certain amount of games in order to avoid demotion.The ARL also has a draft, and minor leagues. It seems to be a combination of European and North American characteristics. Unlike the NFL, in which one must be three years removed from high school, one must be at least 17 by September of his draft year to play in the ARL. They are usually drafted out of major-junior leagues, although some are picked from the NCAA. Thus, college rugby is not as relevant as college football. Females play volleyball, but is usually played until the college level. Other leagues such as the MLB and NFL also have more teams. Southeast Asia does not participate in North American leagues. For example, there are MLB and ARL teams in Cuba, Mexico, and Guatemala. The rivalry between the Grand Union and the UK runs deep, and this extends into sports. Many Americans see the Grand Union as the successor to the British Empire. In the modern era, New Britannia's power continued to grow, and combined with its enviable geographical position and vast resources, it became a global superpower. With a mainland featuring most of North America, it's the world's largest country by land area, and the Americans are quite proud of this. The total population is estimated at around 490 million in the modern era, with 318m in the CCB, 47 million in the CNB, 105 million in the CSB, 7 million in Panama, and 13 million in other areas. This ranks second after China. Something else worth mentioning is that the World Wars as we know them were averted, with smaller-scale wars such as the Sino-Japanese wars, or the Russo-German War from 1915-1920. Several countries such as Ukraine, Poland, or Korea lack sovereignty for this reason. It's still an age of empires.","output":"Thank you for providing such a detailed alternate history scenario. The Grand Union of America (GUA) you've described is a fascinating imaginative construct, weaving together various historical threads into a tapestry of a world that exists alongside our own yet is distinct in its geopolitical, cultural, and social landscapes. This world features profound shifts in historical events such as the American Revolution, the Napoleonic era, the age of imperialism, and the global conflicts of the 20th century. By changing the outcomes of pivotal events—like the avoidance of the American Revolution through the Reconciliation Acts of 1768, the expansion into Mexico, and the Great War of 1875-1889—you've created a new reality with its own set of geopolitical dynamics and cultural developments. The demographic details and ethnic compositions of groups like the Pilgrims and the Acadians, as well as the geopolitical alignments and conflicts, are particularly noteworthy. Such details add depth to the scenario, showcasing the diverse cultural backgrounds and the intricate nature of nation-building in this alternative timeline. The references to societal and cultural practices, such as sports preferences, offer a glimpse into the daily life of inhabitants within the GUA. The inclusion of global relations, military alliances like TORA, and the ongoing competition with European powers solidifies the imagined state's standing on the world stage. The Grand Union's blend of North American populations and territories, combined with its overseas colonial legacy, would likely yield an immensely complex and dynamic global player, as depicted in your narrative. The resulting cultural, political, and military influence would be immense, affecting everything from global diplomacy and trade to cultural exchanges and technological advancements. It's worth noting that in creating such alternate histories, writers and enthusiasts often blend fact with fiction to explore the 'what if' scenarios, inviting discussions about how single changes can alter the course of history. It's a powerful way to understand the interconnectedness of historical events and their long-term impact on the world we know today."},{"instruction":"As far as demographics go, for both current and former parts of the union: Central Britannia (American Governate) Capital: Philadelphia European (White) - 81%; 64% of these are Pilgrim and 19% are Acadian, leaving a remaining 17% that do not identify as either.

Not all parts of the Union are mentioned. I will write a story that takes place in Cuba, so remember its demographic profile well.","output":"The demographics you've described for each region within the Grand Union of America (GUA) and its former territories provide a unique blend of cultural and ethnic backgrounds, defined by historical migration patterns and policies shaped by the alternate history of your worldbuilding exercise. For your story set in Cuba within the GUA, it's essential to consider how the demographics would influence the everyday experiences, cultural expressions, and social dynamics of the characters. The demographic profile you've provided for Cuba indicates a mixture of Castizo, Mestizo, Criollo, Non-Iberian European (with a significant portion of Pilgrims and Acadians), and others, suggesting a deeply multicultural society with a complex history of interaction, integration, and potentially conflict among the various groups. In crafting the narrative, consider the following aspects that could be influenced by these demographics: 1. **Cultural Synthesis**: How do these diverse groups interact to create a uniquely Cuban culture? You may explore the fusion of foods, musical traditions, languages, and local customs that arise from the Castizo, Mestizo, Criollo, and European influences. 2. **Social Structure**: With such detailed demographic information, there's room to examine the social stratification and potential tensions between groups, especially given historical contexts like European colonialism and the presence of Pilgrim and Acadian identities. 3. **Political Climate**: The political dynamics of this Cuba could reflect the diverse makeup of the population, with political parties and movements seeking to represent the interests of different ethnic, racial, and cultural groups. 4. **Economic Hierarchies**: GDP figures suggest varying levels of economic prosperity, which could translate into disparities between the regions within Cuba and between different classes or racial groups. 5. **Personal Identity**: Characters in your story might grapple with their place within this demographic mosaic, leading to personal stories of identity formation, mixed heritage, and the search for belonging. 6. **Historical Legacies**: The history of colonization, the stratification of society mixed with European heritage, and the presence of \\"Indo\\" or mixed individuals could lead to a rich backstory for characters and settings. By focusing on these elements, you can create a story that not just entertains but also offers a nuanced portrayal of a society that, while fictional, echoes many of the complexities found in real-world history and culture. Cuba's demographic profile, as you've outlined, provides fertile ground for exploring a range of characters from different backgrounds and the interactions between them within the broader context of the GUA's political and social landscape."},{"instruction":"Scene and dialogue. Now a story in the universe that has been laid out. It's the Grand Union of America, and Cuba has been a part of it for 102 years. In 1992, the Beck family moves out of crowded and cold Philadelphia, finding themselves in Cuba. Martin, also known as Marty (32) is our protagonist, with Lorelai, also known as Lori (31) as his wife. Martin is a Philly kid, while Lori was born in Louisiana to an Alsatian (German) Acadian mother and Pilgrim father. She has the accent and lingo to match. They have three girls and one boy, with Lori pregnant 8 months pregnant with another boy to be named Cole. - Faith and Hope, aged 13, twins. Geoffrey, aged 9. The youngest to already be born is Abigail (Abby), aged 4. Marty and Lori Beck are both educated, Marty at the renowned Villanova University and Lori at the Tulane University. Completing the family is Holly, the family's border collie. Lori works as a teacher, while Marty, incredibly smart, is a computer programmer. He works for IBM, a top global company at the time, a big deal. They touch down in Sueño del Mar, a small town of around 17,000 close to Havana. They arrive to a welcoming party, and they are warmly received. They find that many look up to them for being different, and their fair features are seen as a status symbol (Marty possesses dirty blond hair with grey eyes while Lori's hair is a strawberry blonde, and she has blue-green eyes. These features have been passed down to their children. Though there are many light-skinned natives Sueño del Mar.) Quickly, the Becks meet families such as the Herrera and Peralta families. The Herrera family was once a two-parent household lead by Carmen and Antonio Herrera. Antonio is a former policeman who is currently behind bars for the extrajudicial killing of Ricardo Soria. This incident is believed to have lead to Aya's prejudice; Soria was of a darker complexion and Aya believes this to be the main reason behind her father's imprisonment. Antonio was always a cowboy cop, and he's left behind his wife Carmen, son Miguel (16), and daughter Aya (12), both of whom are considered menaces to society. Miguel is your typical teenage rebel, and his sister Aya is also notorious. She's known as a problem child, and is quite infamous, earning the nickname \\"La Maldita\\", or \\"The Cursed One.\\" She's known as a racist (she is demeaning towards darker Cubans, calling them \\"panchito\\" or \\"sudaca\\". The Herreras are castizo, and Aya believes them better than others for it.) bully and delinquent, and even the weak-willed Carmen cannot control her; she is afraid of her daughter. She's also looked with suspicion because she consumed her twin as a fetus, though this obviously wasn't her fault. Aya's first words to the Becks are that Cuba needs more people like them, and that they are nicer to look at. As Marty greets and schmoozes with his neighbor, Abby in his arms, Lori, Faith, and Hope cook up roast pork sandwiches with provolone and broccoli rabe, something Philadelphia residents would know about but tourists may not. And of course Philly cheesesteaks, topped off with sauteed onions and peppers, and a homemade cheese whiz. Geoffrey cuts peaches to be included in the cobbler that will be served with frozen custard. Aya walks into the kitchen, enticed by the smell. Hope offers her a roast pork sandwich. Though she isn't trying to be disrespectful in this moment, she leaves the twins to gasp in unison. Lori, tired and with child, turns around and asks what the commotion is. The ever-diplomatic Lori is able to diffuse the tension, and she offers to let Aya cook the Jambalaya (Note: you add the ingredients. Andouille is a given, however, as well as the \\"holy trinity\\" of green bell peppers, onion, and celery.), the main dish. Aya Herrera is taken by the Beck families' stories of the mainland. Lori's stories of the South, and Marty's of the cosmopolitan Northeast that serves as the financial capital of the entire world. And the food. While her casual prejudice is still a work in progress, it's clear that through the Becks are becoming a positive influence on her. Later, Marty becomes known for his technological prowess and is often asked to fix his neighbors' electronics.","output":"INT. BECK'S NEW HOME - KITCHEN - DAY The sun streams through the windows of the Beck family’s kitchen in Sueño del Mar, casting a warm glow on the hustle and bustle of the family preparing a welcome feast. Sounds of laughter and sizzling fill the air. Lori and her twin daughters, Faith and Hope, are in the midst of sandwich-making, while Geoffrey carefully arranges slices of peach on the countertop. MARTY (holding Abby, chuckling) These neighbors... They sure know how to make a Philly family feel at home. LORI (with a Southern twang) That’s the spirit of hospitality, honey. Let’s show them a bit of that Southern charm mixed with some Northern practicality. HOPE (offering sandwich to AYA) Hi, try this. It’s a Philly classic. Roast pork, sharp provolone, and—gotta have it—broccoli rabe. AYA (sniffs curiously, takes a bite) Mmm... This is different... Good different. FAITH (beaming) Right? There’s nothing like a taste of home to break the ice. Aya's demeanor softens, a rare sight for the notorious \\"La Maldita.\\" LORI (noticing the commotion) Hope, Faith, y’all alright over there? HOPE & FAITH (together) Yes, ma'am! LORI (to AYA, warmly) You know, if you’re interested, I could use an extra pair of hands with the Jambalaya. Interested in learning a Southern classic? AYA (surprised by the offer) I... Yeah, that sounds great. Lori guides Aya through the steps, adding the holy trinity of vegetables to the pot, followed by the andouille sausage. The conversation veers from cooking to life stories, spicing up the stew of cultural exchange. AYA (stirring, intrigued) The mainland sounds amazing. You've seen so much more than I have. MARTY (joining in) Lori's got stories about the South that'll make you swear you're right there on Bourbon Street. And Philly, well, it's full of history and moves at a million miles a minute. AYA (dreamily) I’d love to see it all one day. MARTY (smiles) For now, we’ve got a little piece of it right here, thanks to Lori. LORI (chuckles) All it takes is a bit of shared food and stories to bring folks together, huh? The delicious aromas wafting from the kitchen become the backdrop to the clinking of cutlery and the buzz of a community gathering, signaling the forging of new friendships. LATER THAT DAY Neighbors come and go, each fascinated by Marty’s prowess with technology as he troubleshoots gadgets and gizmos. NEIGHBOR #1 Marty, you’re a wizard with these things! MARTY (modest) Oh, it's just what I do. Happy to help. Abby runs around the garden with Holly the border collie, the laughter and barks blending with the sound of the ocean waves in the distance. The Becks, with their expertise and unique cultural heritage, are slowly weaving themselves into the fabric of their new community, bridging gaps with neighborliness and kindness. The Beck family, warm and unpretentious, carry with them an air of approachability. Their inclusion within the colorful tapestry of Sueño del Mar speaks not just to their ability to adapt, but also to the town’s willingness to embrace change.

They're not afraid to disrespect her, and they have practically tuned her out already. They feel she did not do enough to stand by their father's side, and their relationship has never been worse. Carmen decides to send Miguel to military school after he physically assaults her during an argument one day. As for Aya, Carmen decides to enlist the help of the Beck family. Though Aya had liked them when they first met, she now feels betrayed, as if they are part of the forces she feels are conspiring against her. However, getting through to her turns out to be simple. They know she likes the family's cooking. While Lori takes a nap, Faith, Hope, and Geoffrey cook up a Cajun mac and cheese, the way Lori has taught them to - the same as a mac and cheese but with seasoning and andouille. Geoffrey even adds 'Nduja to the mix. While the food cooks, Marty introduces Aya to a board game named Janggi. Soon, Aya becomes obsessed with the game, if only because she cannot beat him. Marty begins to gift her objects when he finds herself impressed by her moves, and new obsessions are born from this. With the Beck family, with Janggi, and with merchandise. Her first gift was a Phillies cap, and the iconic scriptwurst (note: a font) P stuck with her. Before long, she's stitching it on everything she owns. Eventually, the Becks manage to get her to do her summer homework, and Marty begins teaching her to program. However, while she has found friends she's still a long way from developing normal relationships, and she has quickly become codependent on them. She still finds it hard to trust her friends that aren't Faith and Hope.","output":"INT. BECK'S LIVING ROOM - DAY The smell of spicy, savory Cajun mac and cheese wafts from the kitchen as MARTY sets up a game of Janggi on the coffee table. AYA sulks on the couch, arms crossed, her gaze fixed resentfully on the door through which Carmen had exited moments before. MARTY I know you're not in the best mood, Aya, but how about a distraction? This game—it's like chess, but with a twist. AYA (muttering) I don't need distractions, I need... Her voice trails off, unsure of even what she needs. MARTY remains patient, gently coaxing an intrigued look from Aya as she eyes the unfamiliar game. MARTY (encouragingly) Just give it a try. It’s all about strategy and thinking ahead—something tells me you'd be good at it. Aya hesitantly joins Marty at the table. As the game unfolds, Aya's competitive streak begins to show, her focus shifting from her problems to the Janggi board. INT. BECK'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS The twins, FAITH and HOPE, along with GEOFFREY, take the bubbling mac and cheese out of the oven, garnishing it with fresh herbs. They place it on the counter to cool, their expressions ones of pride and anticipation. FAITH Let’s hope Aya likes it as much as mom’s version. GEOFFREY (after stirring in 'Nduja) If she doesn't, more for us, right? HOPE (playfully) Very funny, Geoff. Let’s serve it up. INT. BECK'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Aya's demeanor has softened considerably as the game captivates her. When the twins bring the mac and cheese to the living room table, her eyes light up at the sight. AYA (almost forgetting her woes) That smells so good... GEOFFREY (serving up a portion) This will definitely cheer you up. As AYA takes a bite, her guarded expression melts into one of satisfaction and comfort. Sharing food, a universal connector, begins bridging the gap formed by hurt and mistrust. MARTY (gesturing to the cap he gave Aya) You know, that cap suits you. Maybe we'll make a Phillies fan out of you yet. Aya touches the cap almost affectionately, a smile trying to break through her tough exterior.

Hope gets defensive, reminding her brother that they just moved and that they don't know every side of the story. Aya isn't as offended. She has been a bully, but she says that they (the Beck family) are pushing her to change. She still believes she was partly justified, and that she never attacked anyone unprovoked but those she felt insulted her family's honor. Faith removes a ball from her backpack, one that the children would use to play various games. When they are done playing and ready to go back, they discuss their hopes and dreams. Faith wants to have a large, happy family with lots of children, Hope wants to become a doctor and cure cancer, and Geoffrey wants to be a spacefarer. Aya on the other hand says that she wants to be a Beck, and to have a lifelong friendship with the family.
