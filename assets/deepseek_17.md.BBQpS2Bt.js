Somerset: Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers. Please answer a question about this article.

Information:  - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America.  - Sociology is the study of social behaviour or society, including its origins, development, organization, networks, and institutions. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.  - The term social order can be used in two senses. In the first sense, it refers to a particular set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all.  - Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency 1930-1970 is a 1982 book by sociologist Doug McAdam (published by the University of Chicago Press). It is responsible for laying the theoretical groundwork for the political process model for sociological theory.  - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.  - The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States of America. The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles entrench the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Articles Four, Five and Six entrench concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states in relationship to the federal government. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Doug McAdam ( born August 31 , 1951 ) ( Ph.D. 1979 ) is Professor of Sociology at Stanford University . He is the author or co-author of over a dozen books and over fifty articles , and is widely credited as one of the pioneers of the political process model in social movement analysis . He wrote one of the first books on the theory in 1982 when analyzing the U.S. Civil Rights Movement : Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency 1930 - 1970 . His other book Freedom Summer won the C. Wright Mills Award in 1990 . He served as the director of the prestigious Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences between 2001 and 2005 . He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003 .  - John Hancock (October 8, 1793) was an American merchant, statesman, and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution. He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so much so that the term \\"John Hancock\\" has become, in the United States, a synonym for a signature.  - Welfare is the provision of a minimal level of well-being and social support for citizens without current means to support basic needs. In most developed countries, welfare is largely provided by the government from tax income, and to a lesser extent by charities, informal social groups, religious groups, and inter-governmental organizations.  - Sociological theories are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related. They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to paradigms for analysis and interpretation. Some sociological theories explain aspects of the social world and enable prediction about future events, while others function as broad perspectives which guide further sociological analyses.  - Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.  - John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19] 1735  July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (17971801) and the first Vice President (178997). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail.  - The University of Chicago Press is the largest and one of the oldest university presses in the United States. It is operated by the University of Chicago and publishes a wide variety of academic titles, including \\"The Chicago Manual of Style\\", numerous academic journals, and a wide array of advanced monographs in the academic fields.  - The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, frequently known as the American Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and a leading center for policy research in the United States. Election to the Academy is considered one of the nation's highest honors since its founding during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, and other scholar-patriots who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government, and the United States Constitution.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - James Bowdoin II (August 7, 1726  November 6, 1790) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston, Massachusetts, during the American Revolution and the following decade. He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies.

Although its appearance is underwhelming, this location has some of the best BBQ I've ever tasted.  Far better than you'd find at any Big Box restaurant, this restaurant has excellent BBQ ribs, burgers, wings, sandwiches, and home made pies.  The prices are very reasonable.  I got a half rack of ribs and wings plate with vegetables and a baked potato for 15.  The ribs fall apart and require very little chewing; they've been slow cooked to perfection.  Their BBQ sauce on both their ribs and wings was outstanding - a smokey, sweet flavour, which also tastes like it could be home cooked.  If you have room after their healthy portions, try a slice of their home made coconut or banana cream pie.  One slice easily finishes off a great meal, and is more than enough to share with another person.  I agree the service could be better, and the decor could be updated.

Fondant is a smooth, easily molded covering used to cover the whole cake or to make cake toppers. You can make it yourself or purchase ready-made fondant to save yourself the trouble.  Some brands of fondant tear more easily than others. Fondarific, Duff, and FondX are good beginner options.  Fondant dries quickly, so keep any portions you are not currently using wrapped in plastic or in the original container. Make this as smooth as possible to prevent wrinkling or tearing the fondant, which will go over the buttercream. See the icing section for tips.  Ganache can be used instead. It may be more difficult to smooth, but will provide a more stable base. Sprinkle cornstarch or spread shortening on a clean surface to prevent the fondant from sticking, then knead it for a couple minutes or until pliable. Knead by pushing with your flat palms and heel of the hand, to avoid trapping air bubbles in the fondant. Skip this step if you purchased ready-to-use rolled fondant. Use a rolling pin to roll the fondant out to a ¼ in (6 mm) thickness. Occasionally rotate the fondant by sliding your hand underneath it to the center, to make sure it hasn't stuck to the table. If you plan on covering a circular cake with fondant, you'll need a circle as wide as your cake's diameter plus twice the cake's height. Once the fondant is rolled out, roll it around the rolling pin, then unroll it again over the cake to drape it over. Use a flat tool – or your hands if necessary – to smooth the top surface and remove air bubbles. Next, smooth out a full circle around the top of the cake's sides, to make sure the fondant is firmly attached. Smooth the rest of the sides, gradually moving around the cake, until it is fully covered. Cut off the remaining fondant with a utility knife or pizza cutter. If you are covering a cake with an unusual shape, put the fondant in the same mold you used for the cake, let it harden slightly, then place it over the cake. Large cakes may need to be covered piece by piece, then repaired as described below. You can easily make two-dimensional fondant decorations by cutting shapes out with a utility knife or scissors. Use fondant in multiple colors to make faces, animals, or any shape you like. It can also be sliced into strips and arranged to form ribbons or a spiral flower. Three-dimensional shapes can be sculpted just like clay, although fondant is best suited for small cake toppers, since it dries quickly. Fondant can tear, crack, or bulge fairly easily, especially when used to cover an entire cake. Here are a few ways to repair these imperfections:  Put a small amount of new fondant into a bowl and mix in water ¼ tsp (1 mL) at a time until you get a toothpaste consistency. Spread this with a flat spatula over cracks or dents to make them smooth, then wait for them to dry. If the fondant cracks before you've started decorating, knead in some shortening or glycerin. Hairline cracks can sometimes be smoothed out with your fingertips, or disguised with a brush of shortening. A bulge is usually an air bubble. Try pricking it with a pin, then smoothing out the fondant.","output":"Fondant is a smooth, moldable covering for cakes or cake toppers. It can be made at home or bought ready-made. Brands like Fondarific, Duff, and FondX are suitable for beginners. When working with fondant, keep unused portions wrapped to prevent drying. You can use ganache as an alternative for a more stable base. To prepare fondant, knead it on a dusted surface until pliable and roll it out to 1/4-inch thickness. To cover a cake, drape the rolled fondant over it and smooth out any air bubbles. Cut off any excess fondant with a knife. Two-dimensional decorations can be made by cutting shapes and using multiple colors, while three-dimensional shapes can be sculpted like clay.

This suggests a negative sentiment. 3. The reviewer mentions that they wanted to reach the end of the book to find out the killer's identity, but they found the reading to be boring due to the lack of suspense and twists, which indicates a negative sentiment. 4. \\"Le côté satire sociale est assez rigolo,\\" which means the social satire aspect is quite funny, showing a positive sentiment. 5. The reviewer talks about the cliches in the book, suggesting a negative sentiment. 6. \\"L'idylle entre les deux enquêteurs est aussi une bonne idée\\" indicates that the love story between the two investigators is a good idea, conveying a positive sentiment. 7.

Solve this math problem Solve 8005*z - 8021*z = 160 for z.","output":"Okay, let's break this math problem down into smaller parts to make it easier to understand! Here's the problem: 8005 * z - 8021 * z = 160 First, let's look at the two parts on the left side of the equation: 8005 * z and 8021 * z. Since both terms have the variable \\"z,\\" we can actually put them together by subtracting the numbers in front of the \\"z's\\": 8005 * z - 8021 * z is the same as (8005 - 8021) * z Let's do the subtraction inside the parentheses: 8005 - 8021 = -16 Now, our equation looks like this: -16 * z = 160 To solve for z, we need to get z alone on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -16.  (-16 * z) ÷ (-16) = 160 ÷ (-16) Now, -16 divided by -16 is 1. So, the left side of the equation simplifies to: 1 * z But, when something is multiplied by 1, it doesn't change. So, that's just \\"z.\\" Now, let's divide the right side:  160 divided by -16 is -10 So, our equation now looks like this: z = -10 That means the value of z that solves our equation is -10!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Border, Leicester and Corriedale are all breeds of what?","output":"Border, Leicester and Corriedale are all breeds of sheep.  The Border Leicester is a British breed of sheep. It is named after its place of origin, the border region between England and Scotland. Border Leicesters are one of the largest sheep breeds, known for their large size and muscularity. Their long, lustrous wool is highly prized by hand spinners and weavers and their docile temperament makes them easy to handle on the farm. The Leicester, sometimes termed the \\"English Leicester\\" to differentiate it from the Border Leicester, is also an English breed of sheep, but it's actually one of the oldest breeds in existence. Also known as Leicester Longwool, this sheep breed was primarily developed for its meat and wool. Leicester sheep are medium to large sized with a strong, robust nature and are well known for their long, curly, lustrous fleece which is universally loved by crafters and artisans who enjoy spinning and dyeing. Corriedale sheep, on the other hand, originated in New Zealand and Australia as a dual-purpose breed that could thrive under a variety of climatic conditions. The breed was developed in the 1800s by crossing Merino and Lincoln sheep, aiming to combine the fine wool of the Merino with the size and meat quality of the Lincoln. Corriedales are one of the most populous breeds worldwide. They have a sturdy build and thick wool that protects them from harsh environments.  All three breeds are renowned for their wool quality. Their wool is widely used in various textile products like clothing, carpets, and furnishings. Both the Border Leicester and Corriedale are also used for meat production due to their good size and muscling. Their adaptability, efficient grazing and reproductive capabilities make these breeds important contributors to the international sheep industry. They all have unique characteristics that make them preferred breeds by both commercial farmers, for income, and smallholders and hobby farmers, for their manageable size and pleasant temperament."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Andy Samuel Griffith (June 1, 1926  - July 3, 2012) was an American actor, comedian, television producer, Southern gospel singer, and writer, whose career spanned seven decades of music and television. Known for his southern drawl, his characters with a folksy-friendly personality, and his gruff, gregarious voice, Griffith was a Tony Award nominee for two roles, and gained prominence in the starring role in director Elia Kazan's film A Face in the Crowd (1957) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of Andy Taylor in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968) and Ben Matlock in the legal drama Matlock (1986-1995). Griffith's early career was as a monologist, delivering long stories such as What It Was, Was Football, which is told from the point of view of a naive country preacher trying to figure out what was going on in a football game. The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.  Griffith starred in Ira Levin's one-hour teleplay version of No Time for Sergeants (March 1955) -- a story about a country boy in the United States Air Force -- on The United States Steel Hour, a television anthology series. He expanded that role in Ira Levin's full-length theatrical version of the same name (October 1955) on Broadway in New York City. The role earned him a \\"Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor\\" nomination at the 1956 Tony Awards, losing to Ed Begley. He did win the 1956 Theatre World Award, however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. \\"Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale\\" (his role in the play), wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. \\"All he has to do is walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face. If the armed forces cannot cope with Will Stockdale, neither can the audience resist Andy Griffith.\\"  Griffith later reprised his role for the film version (1958) of No Time for Sergeants; the film also featured Don Knotts, as a corporal in charge of manual-dexterity tests, marking the beginning of a lifelong association between Griffith and Knotts. No Time for Sergeants is considered the direct inspiration for the later television situation comedy Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.  His only other New York stage appearance was the titular role in the 1959 musical Destry Rides Again, co-starring Dolores Gray. The show, with a score by Harold Rome, ran for 472 performances and more than a year. Griffith was nominated for \\"Distinguished Musical Actor\\" at the 1960 Tony Awards, losing to Jackie Gleason.  He also portrayed a US Coast Guard sailor in the feature film Onionhead (1958); it was neither a critical nor a commercial success. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he have any other stage role?","output":"Yes, alongside his role in \\"No Time for Sergeants\\", Andy Griffith had another stage role as mentioned in the article, \\"His only other New York stage appearance was the titular role in the 1959 musical Destry Rides Again, co-starring Dolores Gray.\\""},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Boys of Paul Street is a 1969 American-Hungarian co-production film directed by Zoltán Fábri and based on the youth novel \\"The Paul Street Boys\\" (1906) by the Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnár.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Some Americans will soon be able to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3 percent, compared with the current minimum of 5 percent, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac say.      The new lending guidelines announced by the companies Monday are designed to help more low-income and first-time buyers afford homes. Millions of Americans lost their savings or no longer had the income needed to set aside money for a home in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. That has held down the sales of houses and condominiums and slowed the economic recovery.      The guidelines are designed to prevent the kind of reckless lending that fueled a housing bubble and eventually triggered the recession. Borrowers must have enough income to repay loans on a monthly basis for homes that would be their main residence. This guideline would be intended to limit financial speculation.      \\"These underwriting guidelines provide a responsible approach to improving access to credit while ensuring safe and sound lending practices,\\" Mel Watt, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said in a statement. The FHFA oversees Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government control since 2008 because of the housing bust.      Watt had announced in October that Fannie and Freddie had reached an agreement with major banks to expand lending. The FHFA declined Monday to say how many borrowers might benefit from having a 3 percent down payment.      The standard down payment for mortgages insured through Fannie and Freddie has been 20 percent. That would mean that a first-time buyer would need 41,600 in cash to purchase a median-priced home of 208,300, according to the National Association of Realtors. Just 29 percent of home purchases in October went to first-time buyers, compared with a historic average of 40 percent, the Realtors reported.      The new loans would be fixed-rate mortgages of up to 30 years for primary residences, though some policies vary between the companies.      Fannie could begin underwriting the loans before the end of the year. It said the loans would be geared toward first-time buyers, require mortgage insurance payments because of the low down payment and mandate that buyers receive complete a financial counseling program.      Freddie intends to begin offering its mortgages as early as March 2015, saying it would be an option for low- and moderate-income borrowers. It requires that borrowers earn less than an area's median income, in addition to paying insurance and receiving counseling. Monthly payments could not exceed 43 percent of the borrower's income.      Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about half of all U.S. mortgages, worth about 5 trillion. Along with other federal agencies, they back roughly 90 percent of new mortgages.      The two companies don't directly make loans to borrowers. They buy mortgages from lenders, package them as securities, guarantee them against default and sell them to investors. That helps make loans available.      The government took over Fannie and Freddie in September 2008, after a market meltdown compounded the losses caused by risky mortgages and threatened to shut down the entire housing sector. Combined, the firms received taxpayer aid totaling 187 billion, which has since been repaid as they have returned to profitability. ||||| Fannie Mae’s new My Community Mortgage program begins this week and is open only to first-time buyers with a minimum credit score of 620. Borrowers with Fannie-backed mortgages will be eligible to refinance with a limited amount of money that can be taken out.      Freddie Mac’s new Home Possible Advantage mortgages, which begin in March, will be available to both first-time and other qualified borrowers. In most cases, credit scores will be just one of several factors in determining a home buyer’s eligibility, a spokesman said. Refinancing, though with no cash-out, also will be available.      The programs are the latest efforts to promote homeownership after the collapse of the housing bubble, in hopes of reviving a housing industry that is still plagued by excessive foreclosures and struggling to overcome millions of owners still trapped in underwater mortgages.      Today, first-time home buyers — who are generally younger — account for just 29 percent of home sales, far below the historical rate of 40 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the third quarter of this year, the Census Bureau reported recently, the nation’s seasonally adjusted homeownership rate was 64.3 percent, the lowest level in two decades.      Photo      The government’s move was applauded by the mortgage insurance industry, which expects a business increase from the new programs, and advocates for low-income families.      “We wouldn’t be putting borrowers in these loans if we were worried about their performance through stressful times,” said Rohit Gupta, chief executive of Genworth’s United States Mortgage Insurance Business and co-chairman of the U.S. Mortgage Insurers, a trade association.      The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization that generally supports social programs, concluded: “Those who have criticized low-down-payment lending as excessively risky should know that if the past is a guide, only a narrow group of borrowers will receive these loans, and the overall impact on default rates is likely to be negligible.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Housing officials declined to estimate just how many people might take advantage of these new loans, but even supporters question the magnitude of the new programs.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Guy D. Cecala, chief executive and publisher of the newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance, estimated the effect would be modest, noting that first-time buyers who qualified for similar low down payment loans accounted for only 3 percent of Fannie-backed mortgages in 2013.      “It’s another tool in helping the housing market, but not a huge one,” Mr. Cecala said.      Since the borrowers must still be credit worthy, he explained, “this is not pushing the envelope.”      Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, also expressed doubt that this latest initiative would lure many new buyers, saying that the lack of demand and tight mortgage standards have been bigger hurdles than the size of the down payment.      Mark A. Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, was not as sanguine about the financial stability of the targeted borrowers. Given closing costs, he said, “You’re essentially underwater when you walk away from the table.”      “That is not a situation we should be trying to get people in,” he said.      To Andres Carbacho-Burgos, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, however, the danger of mortgage defaults generally comes from lax monitoring, not lower down payment requirements.      While sharing the view that the effect would be limited, Mr. Carbacho-Burgos said the program was nonetheless worth pursuing. “Anything that can be done to restart the first-time home buyer market is a good thing,” he said. ||||| In an effort to open up lending to more low-income and first time home buyers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced Monday that they will start backing mortgages with down payments of as little as 3% of the home's price.      But borrowers will still need to meet strict criteria first, the two government-backed mortgage giants said.      The new loans will only be doled out to those who buy private mortgage insurance, have a credit score of at least 620 and offer complete documentation of their income, assets and job status. And, to further mitigate risk, the agencies will require borrowers to receive home ownership counseling.      Both programs are for fixed-rate loans given to first time homebuyers and those seeking to refinance. Fannie will start backing the loans as soon as December 13, while Freddie will start offering them March 23.      Related: 10 hottest housing markets for 2015      The move should expand access to credit for first-time homebuyers, typically younger buyers who have not have had enough time to save a big lump sum.      Fannie and Freddie already back mortgages with as low as 5% down. And the Federal Housing Administration insures 3.5% loans.      Still, according to Mark Palim, who directs economic and strategic research at Fannie Mae, it's a welcome expansion of credit.      \\"It's not a radical departure from what we're doing now, but anything at the margins helps,\\" he said.      The 3% loans from Fannie and Freddie should also offer some advantages over the 3.5% down loans offered by FHA, according to Palim.      For example, the FHA loans require borrowers to pay for private mortgage insurance premiums for the entire term of the mortgage -- typically 30 years. That means adding an extra 1.35 percentage points to monthly mortgage rates. A loan carrying a 4% rate, for example, becomes a 5.35% mortgage.      Related Best cities for Millennial home buyers      In dollars, that's about an extra 80 a month for every 100,000 borrowed or 960 a year. That adds up to nearly 30,000 over the life of the loan.      Under Fannie and Freddie's programs, borrowers are permitted to cancel their private mortgage insurance premiums once the mortgage balance drops below 80% of the home's value -- either because they've made enough payments or the home's value has risen.      If home prices increase 5% a year for three or four years, for example, these borrowers may be able to cancel their insurance and save them tens of thousands of dollars over the next 26 or 27 years. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have announced that they will begin backing mortgages with down payments as low as 3% for low-income and first-time homebuyers in the United States.

The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night).  Question: \\"What man-made construction ended up creating jobs and also creating Lake Mead?\\" Answer: \\"Hoover Dam\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. The Hoover Dam, originally known as the Boulder Dam, was a man-made construction that ended up creating jobs and also creating Lake Mead. The dam's construction began in 1931 and was a significant factor in revitalizing the Las Vegas economy and providing water to the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Spice Girls are an English pop girl group formed in 1994. The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\"Scary Spice\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\"Sporty Spice\\"), Emma Bunton (\\"Baby Spice\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\"Ginger Spice\\"), and Victoria Beckham, nee Adams (\\"Posh Spice\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. The phrase \\"girl power\\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase itself had also appeared in a few songs by British girl groups and bands since at least 1987; most notably, it was the name of British pop duo Shampoo's 1996 single and album, later credited by Halliwell as the inspiration for the Spice Girls' mantra.  However, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with \\"Wannabe\\", that the concept of \\"girl power\\" exploded onto the common consciousness. The phrase was regularly uttered by all five members--although most closely associated with Halliwell--and was often delivered with a peace sign. The slogan also featured on official Spice Girls merchandise and on some of the outfits the group members wore. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women, and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females.  In all, the focused, consistent presentation of \\"girl power\\" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism--popularized as \\"girl power\\"--in the 1990s, with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. On the other hand, some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the Oxford English Dictionary. In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, \\"The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.\\"  The Spice Girls' debut single \\"Wannabe\\" has been hailed as an \\"iconic girl power anthem\\". In 2016, the United Nations' Global Goals \\"#WhatIReallyReallyWant\\" campaign filmed a global remake of the original music video for \\"Wannabe\\" to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which was launched on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian \\"viral sensation\\" Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world. In response to the remake, Beckham said, \\"How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls' girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?\\"  At the 43rd People's Choice Awards in January 2017, American actress Blake Lively dedicated her \\"Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress\\" award to \\"girl power\\" in her acceptance speech, and credited the Spice Girls, saying: \\"What was so neat about them was that they're all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.\\" What types of things made them so unique?","output":"The Spice Girls' uniqueness came from their focused and consistent presentation of \\"girl power,\\" which formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. Their message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents, and adult women, emphasizing the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females. Each of the five members had a distinct personality, and they promoted the idea that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive.

(CNN) -- Double amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius has moved a step closer to realizing his dream of participating in the Olympics after running the 'B' standard qualifying time for next year's Games in London.  The 24-year-old, who was born without fibulae in both legs, clocked 45.61 seconds to win the 400m race at the Provincial Championships in his home town of Pretoria in South Africa on Wednesday.  Dubbed the 'Blade Runner' because of his carbon fiber prosthetic limbs, Pistorius must now run 0.6 seconds faster to be granted automatic qualification. But his time could still be good enough to earn him a place in the South African team depending on the performance of other athletes.  After narrowly missing out on the time required for the Beijing Olympics, the Johannesburg-born athlete expressed his delight at the achievement on his Twitter page.  \\"One of the best nights of my life.

News article: TOKYO -- A supposedly deaf composer once lauded as Japan's Beethoven apologized Friday after confessing that he could partially hear and that he did not write his music himself.      \\"It is indeed the case that I have deceived people and for that I am extremely sorry,\\" Mamoru Samuragochi told a news conference in the Japanese capital, adding that he intends to live out the rest of his life repenting for his deception.      The 50-year-old stunned the music world last month when he admitted he did not compose his own music. A day later, Takashi Niigaki, a lecturer at a Tokyo music college, admitted to writing Samuragochi's compositions.      Shorn of his trademark shoulder hair and beard, the 50-year-old added that he was glad the truth had finally come out but said it was regrettable for classical music lovers.      \\"It's true that I will have to take responsibility and apologize to a large number of people,” Samuragochi said. \\"Regardless of that, I think that it's a good thing that this has come out into the open.\\"      KIMIMASA MAYAMA / EPA Mamoru Samuragochi held a news conference in Tokyo Friday to apologize for misleading his audience.      He had feared the truth would come out one day, he said.      \\"For classical music however and for those who love classical music, having them lose what they thought to be a rising hope, having them respond, 'What is this fake Samuragochi,' is something that is very regrettable,\\" he added.      Although Samuragochi said he had returned his disability certificate that once classified him as having a severe hearing loss -- and admitted to regaining some of his hearing three years ago -- he maintained that he still cannot make out conversations and sentences.      Today's questions from the media were translated to Samuragochi via a sign language interpreter.      First published March 7 2014, 3:33 AM ||||| TOKYO (Reuters) - A composer once known as the \\"Beethoven of Japan\\" said on Friday that tests had shown he was not legally deaf and apologized to people throughout the country for lying by using a ghost writer for his popular symphonies and other music.      Mamoru Samuragochi, a classical musician who became known as an inspirational genius for composing music despite losing his hearing, bowed deeply before a packed news conference, his first public appearance since the scandal broke last month.      \\"I have caused a great deal of trouble with my lies for everyone, including those people who bought my CDs and came to my concerts,\\" Samuragochi, 50, said, his trademark flowing hair now trimmed in a typical businessman's cut.      A statement distributed to reporters said hearing tests had shown that while Samuragochi's hearing was impaired, it did not meet the requirements for legal deafness.      \\"I can hear sounds, but the sounds are twisted,\\" he said. \\"Hearing conversations is extremely difficult and I still need an interpreter.\\"      German composer Ludwig van Beethoven began suffering hearing loss from about age 30 and withdrew from public performances while continuing to write music. He was almost totally deaf for the last decade of his life.      Samuragochi collaborated with part-time university professor Takashi Niigaki for 18 years to compose his music after suffering hearing loss.      He said on Friday that he and Niigaki would meet in a coffee shop in the Shinjuku entertainment district of western Tokyo and work out how Niigaki would compose the music. Niigaki, he said, kept negotiating for higher fees.      \\"I wrote out what I wanted and the general plans, then Niigaki wrote the music,\\" he said.      \\"If ultimately that means I defrauded people who bought my CDs, then yes, I did,\\" he said, biting his lip.      Samuragochi gained international fame for his \\"Hiroshima Symphony\\", a tribute to the victims of the 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city.      He also apologized to television stations and newspapers which had supported his career as well as figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, who used Samuragochi's music in his short program at the Sochi Winter Olympics just days after the scandal broke.      \\"I worried that it might have had a bad impact on his skating ... I felt a terrible sense of responsibility,\\" Samuragochi said, adding that he didn't watch the Olympics because it was too painful. Takahashi ultimately finished sixth.      \\"I know that it was wrong to use a ghost writer, but it is true that I wanted to use my music to bring light to people who were having tough times,\\" Samuragochi said.      The scandal has riveted Japan, with two television stations broadcasting live the first 30 minutes of the news conference, which went on for nearly three hours.      Music industry analysts say part of his popularity was the result of promotion by an industry eager to put a human face to classical music and retain a shrinking market share as Japan ages.

The man once lauded as \\"Japan's Beethoven\\" bowed repeatedly and apologized Friday at his first media appearance since... (Associated Press)      TOKYO (AP) — The man once lauded as \\"Japan's Beethoven\\" bowed repeatedly and apologized Friday at his first media appearance since it was revealed last month that his famed musical compositions were ghostwritten and he wasn't completely deaf.      Mamoru Samuragochi appeared clean-shaven and minus his trademark sunglasses and long hair, in what could be seen as a sign of remorse. He apologized for the troubles he had caused his fans, producers behind his works and others.      \\"I will speak the truth,\\" he told reporters, looking contrite in a dark jacket. \\"I will make this my last appearance on TV.\\"      He acknowledged he had worked with his collaborator Takashi Niigaki in secret for 18 years. Niigaki recently told a tabloid magazine he was the ghostwriter behind the works, including the \\"Hiroshima\\" symphony.      Samuragochi, 50, said his hearing had been recovering from about three years ago, but denied he was posturing as deaf, and said he still had hearing problems.      Olympian figure-skater Daisuke Takahashi used a Samuragochi tune at the Sochi games. The disclosure that Samuragochi might have been an impostor has been major news in Japan after he had been featured in mainstream Japanese TV shows. CD sales of music credited to him has surged since the scandal erupted.      Samuragochi had been celebrated as overcoming severe hearing disabilities to compose and arrange the classical works. He said that he still has problems making out words and needed a sign language interpreter during media interviews.      ___      Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Mamoru Samuragochi, once known as \\"Japan's Beethoven,\\" has apologized for deceiving people about his partial hearing and using a ghostwriter for his compositions.

Answer this question: what is the meaning of the book of exodus??","output":"The Book of Exodus is the second book in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament of the Christian Bible and is a central text in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. As part of the Pentateuch, the Book of Exodus is largely attributed to Moses, recounting the early experiences of the Israelites in their journey from slavery in Egypt to their eventual deliverance and covenant with God at Mount Sinai. This book can be best understood by analyzing its core themes and the overall meaning it conveys. 1. Liberation from slavery: One of the fundamental meanings and narratives of Exodus is the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. God hears their cries and sends Moses to Pharaoh to demand their release. This pivotal story illustrates the liberation from physical, mental, and spiritual oppression and sets the stage for the subsequent journey of the Israelites. 2. The power of the one true God: The ten plagues that befell Egypt and the hardening of Pharaoh's heart demonstrate God's supreme authority over ancient pagan deities. It also illustrates divine intervention as God's way of protecting and guiding His chosen people. The Exodus narrative signifies God's unfaltering commitment and love for the Israelites and serves as a reminder of God's power. 3. The covenant with God: Another central theme in the Book of Exodus is the establishment of the covenant between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai. The event illustrates the significance of obedience and adherence to a set of laws, as presented in the form of the Ten Commandments. Beyond specific rules, this theme emphasizes the Israelites' need to remain faithful to their divine covenant, maintain a close relationship with God, and abide by the moral and ethical standards established in their agreements. 4. The journey toward the Promised Land: The Book of Exodus recounts the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, a journey full of challenges, rebellions, and divine guidance. This theme emphasizes the importance of perseverance, trust in God, and the tested faith that emerged in the process. It isn't just about reaching a destination, but also about the transformation and growth of the Israelite nation. 5. The construction of the Tabernacle: A critical aspect of the Book of Exodus is the construction of the Tabernacle, a portable dwelling place for God's presence among the Israelites. The detailed instructions and descriptions serve as an illustration of God's desire to be among His people and the importance of strict obedience in following God's plans. In summary, the Book of Exodus is a rich and compelling narrative that serves multiple purposes within the broader context of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths. It presents a powerful account of liberation from oppression, showcases the significant role of divine intervention, and elucidates the importance of maintaining a covenant relationship with God. Moreover, it highlights the values of perseverance and faithfulness and explores the transformational journey towards a deeper understanding and relationship with the divine. Through the story of the Israelites, the Book of Exodus continues to resonate as an archetypal story of hope, redemption, and divine guidance, fostering faith and commitment among believers."},{"instruction":"Short general knowledge question: who did alicia keys have a baby with?

The phrase \\"enjoy on a certain level\\" indicates that the critic found aspects of the movie to be enjoyable, but it also suggests that this enjoyment may be limited to specific elements and may not encompass the entire movie-going experience. The positive aspect comes from the word \\"enjoy,\\" which implies that the critic had a favorable reaction to the film to some degree. They appreciated certain aspects or moments, even if they did not universally love the film. The term \\"certain level\\" inherently implies that their enjoyment was not without reservations or limitations.

They may have appreciated some aspects, such as acting, the storyline, or the visual effects, which contributed to their positive experience. Lastly, the question mark in \\"enjoy on a certain level?\\" could be interpreted as an invitation for the reader to consider their perspective when deciding whether the movie falls under the positive or negative category. This phrasing may encourage the reader to focus on their subjective taste and preferences when evaluating the review, as the critic acknowledges that their level of enjoyment might not align with every audience member.

One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Summarize the following: If you are buying bettas to breed, make sure to get them only from one specific, reputable breeder. This can help ensure the quality and success rate of your betta spawn.  Be aware that getting quality bettas to breed can be expensive. More expensive fish generally mean that a breeder has also used selective breeding techniques. Although this isn't a guarantee of successful breeding, it can ensure the health and quality of your fish and possible their spawn. Some elements to look for in a breeder include: accomplishments, longevity, experience, knowledge, professionalism, affiliation with betta organizations, availability, reputation, track record, cleanliness, reference.  Ask the breeder to let you know about the parentage of the bettas. If he can't answer the question, you may want to consider using another breeder that keeps tabs of his bettas' parentage. Find quality betta breeders through organizations such as the International Betta Congress. If you have friends or family that breed bettas or are familiar with them, you might ask them for suggestions, too. Figure out which bettas to get depending on what qualities you're hoping to highlight or breed out. You want to get the best quality stock you can afford and finding the right pair can help ensure health, beauty, and even your enjoyment.  Make sure that you and your breeder both have knowledge of your fish's genetics. Knowing which traits can be inherited is important for responsible breeding to prevent  generations of fish that follow from being unhealthy. Be aware that selective breeding is meant to bring out certain characteristics in a betta fish. For example, you may want to bring out black lace patterns in your betta. By choosing another betta with more distinctive lace patterns and mating it with your betta, you can bring out this particularly quality. You can apply this principle to color and fin size, too. Remember that if you're hoping to achieve a certain goal through your selective breeding, either with fin size or color, it can take a few years and cycles for these traits to fully appear.  You can either use hybridization or inbreeding for desired traits. Hybridization will bring out the best traits in two genetically different parents, and inbreeding crosses two similar parents for offspring that also have the similar traits. Betta breeding can be rough no matter what, but it's important to get fish that are approximately the same size. This helps prevent injury to one of the fish. Looking at the size of each betta can ensure healthy spawn and a healthy breeding process for each fish.  Be aware that a fish that is too small may be too young to breed. Aim to breed bettas that are four to twelve months old, which can help ensure that the sizes are proportionate as well as help prevent bad quality spawn. Detect sexual maturity in your betta by looking for males that build bubble nests and females that have a whitish egg spot on their underside. Females are also able to build bubble nests - don't let that fool you. Many people want to selectively breed their bettas for fin size and finnage. Looking at the fins for characteristics you want to bring out as well as for potential injury can help ensure that you get the qualities you hope to breed.  Check the caudal, or tail, fin for straightness and curvature. Good breeding stock bettas with have straighter caudal fins that are curved in opposite directions. Avoid bettas with caudal fins curved in the same direction. Look for ray branching or splitting on all of the bettas fins. The more branches or splits you have, the more supportive, larger, and beautiful finnage you will get. Make sure the betta has no traces of fin rot, which looks like ripped or fuzzy fins with red tips or near the tears. Bettas come in and exhibit a wide range of colors on their bodies. Find the color bettas you like as mates or for your betta as a mate and try to choose colors that work well together.  Be aware that bettas come in colors such as red, orange, yellow, turquoise, steel blue or royal blue. They can also have black or iridescent features. For example, you might find that breeding the blues with black lace features give your fish beautiful colors.  Ask the breeder if you are unsure of what can work best for your betta. Summary:","output":"When buying bettas for breeding, choose a reputable breeder to ensure quality and success. Quality bettas can be expensive, but selectively bred fish can improve the health and characteristics of the spawn. Consider the breeder's credentials and seek recommendations from organizations or personal contacts. Be knowledgeable about the bettas' genetics, and choose fish based on desired traits and compatibility. Breeding can involve hybridization or inbreeding, and aiming for bettas four to twelve months old can ensure successful spawns. Assess fins for quality and watch for signs of sexual maturity, as well as considering color compatibility. Consult with the breeder for guidance on the best combinations for desired results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the best way to: Make a tote bag out of old pants.","output":"To make a tote bag out of old pants, follow these step-by-step instructions. Each step is justified to ensure a faithful completion of the task. 1. Choose the right pants: Look for pants made of durable materials such as denim or canvas. This will ensure that the tote bag is strong and lasts longer. 2. Wash and dry the pants: Clean the pants thoroughly to remove any stains or dirt. This ensures you start with a clean and hygienic base for the tote bag. 3. Gather materials and tools: You will need a pair of scissors, a ruler or measuring tape, sewing pins, a sewing machine or a needle with strong thread, and an iron. These tools will help in cutting, measuring, and sewing the tote bag together. 4. Cut off the pant legs: Lay the pants flat on a table, and using the scissors, carefully cut off both pant legs, cutting as close to the crotch seam as possible. This creates two separate pant leg pieces to work with. 5. Measure and cut the pant legs: Measure the desired dimensions of the tote bag (e.g., 15 inches wide and 18 inches long), and mark these measurements on both pant leg pieces. Cut each pant leg to the desired size, ensuring that they are the same. These pieces will become the front and back of the tote bag. 6. Sew the bottom seam: With the right sides of the pant legs facing each other, align the bottom edges, and use pins to hold them in place. Sew a straight line across the aligned edges, leaving a seam allowance of about 1/2 inch. This step creates the bottom seam of the tote bag. 7. Iron the seams: To create a clean finish, press the seams open using an iron. This step ensures a neat appearance and helps the tote bag lay flat when in use. 8. Sew the side seams: Open the pant legs, and fold them so that the side edges align. Pin and sew the side seams, again leaving a seam allowance of about 1/2 inch. This step forms the main body of the tote bag. 9. Create the bag handles: Using the remaining fabric from the pant waist or any leftover pant leg material, cut two long strips, each approximately 3 inches wide and 20 inches long. Fold each strip in half lengthwise with the right sides facing each other and sew along the long edge, leaving a 1/4 inch seam allowance. Turn the strips right side out and iron them flat. These strips will become the handles of the tote bag. 10. Attach the handles: Measure and mark the desired handle placements on the inside top edge of the tote bag. Pin the handle ends to the marks with about 1 inch of each end inserted in the bag. Sew the handle ends to the top edge of the tote bag, securely stitching a square or rectangle shape around the handle ends to reinforce the attachment. This step ensures the handles are strong enough to support the weight of the tote bag. 11. Turn the bag right side out: Turn the finished tote bag right side out, and iron the seams and edges for a cleaner and more professional appearance. You now have a tote bag made out of old pants! The entire process is both eco-friendly and budget-friendly, as it repurposes old clothing into a new, useful item."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the villian character created by Kaufman? ?  Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \\"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\\"","output":"The first name of the villain character created by Kaufman is Tony.

Information:  - The micrometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: m) or micrometer (American spelling), also commonly known as a micron, is an SI derived unit of length equaling 1×10 of a metre (SI standard prefix \\"micro-\\" = 10); that is, one millionth of a metre (or one thousandth of a millimetre, 0.001 mm, or about 0.000039 inch). The symbol m is sometimes rendered as um if the symbol  cannot be used, or if the writer is not aware of the distinction.  - Radioactive waste is waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste is usually a by-product of nuclear power generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioactive waste is hazardous to most forms of life and the environment, and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.  - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.  - Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are applied to non-living objects to destroy microorganisms that are living on the objects . Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms , especially resistant bacterial spores ; it is less effective than sterilization , which is an extreme physical and / or chemical process that kills all types of life . Disinfectants are different from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics , which destroy microorganisms within the body , and antiseptics , which destroy microorganisms on living tissue . Disinfectants are also different from biocides -- the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life , not just microorganisms . Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with the metabolism . Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect . Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals , dental surgeries , kitchens , and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms . Bacterial endospores are most resistant to disinfectants , but some viruses and bacteria also possess some tolerance . In wastewater treatment , a disinfection step with chlorine , ultra-violet ( UV ) radiation or ozonation can be included as tertiary treatment to remove pathogens from wastewater , for example if it is to be reused to irrigate golf courses . An alternative term used in the sanitation sector for disinfection of waste streams , sewage sludge or fecal sludge is sanitisation or sanitization .  - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - A biocide is defined in the European legislation as a chemical substance or microorganism intended to destroy, deter, render harmless, or exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism by chemical or biological means. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses a slightly different definition for biocides as \\"a diverse group of poisonous substances including preservatives, insecticides, disinfectants, and pesticides used for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health or that cause damage to natural or manufactured products\\". When compared, the two definitions roughly imply the same, although the US EPA definition includes plant protection products and some veterinary medicines.  - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats.

Rebecca preferred food heated, while Katrina liked it cold, so","output":"Rebecca preferred food heated, while Katrina liked it cold, so their shared kitchen was always a fascinating blend of varying tastes, textures, and distinct culinary preferences. This curious juxtaposition of hot and cold not only reflected the sisters' individual personalities, but it also played a significant role in their bonding, as they'd often find innovative ways to satisfy their respective cravings while harmoniously enjoying mealtimes together. Rebecca cherished the warmth and comfort that steaming-hot dishes provided, especially during colder months or after a long, weary day at work. Her deep love for vibrant, spicy, and aromatic food stemmed from her time spent traveling through Southeast Asia, where she developed an affinity for flavorsome ingredients such as ginger, lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves. One of her signature dishes was a fragrant Thai red curry, teeming with tender chicken or succulent prawns and drenched in a flavorful coconut-infused sauce, served with a heaping mound of jasmine rice. Whenever Rebecca cooked, the scent of exotic spices lingered in the air, infiltrating every corner of their home and tantalizing their taste buds. Katrina, on the other hand, championed freshness and felt most nourished when indulging in chilled dishes or raw ingredients, which reminded her of the crisp Mediterranean breeze she experienced while vacationing in stunning Greek islands. Katrina's culinary inclinations tended towards brightly colored, nutrient-dense meals, such as bountiful Greek salads with plump, juicy tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, briny Kalamata olives, sharp red onions, and slightly tangy feta cheese drizzles with zesty vinaigrettes. Smoothie bowls laden with luscious fruits and adorned with elaborate designs of nuts, seeds, and berries were Katrina's idea of the quintessential breakfast, while sipping a cold gazpacho soup would satiate her hunger on a hot summer's eve. Despite these contrasting preferences, Rebecca and Katrina managed to find common ground, often concocting unique fusion meals that catered to both their affinities. For example, they'd prepare a spicy cold noodle salad, blending Rebecca's adoration for heat with Katrina's passion for refreshing dishes. Showered in a tangy, zippy sauce made of sesame oil, garlic, and chili paste, the noodles gained a fiery kick, while the julienned cucumbers and carrots appealed to Katrina's penchant for chilled, crunchy components. Another creation that epitomized their collaborative efforts was their much-lauded sushi nights. Rebecca would whip up scrumptious rolls with crispy tempura shrimp, avocado, and creamy spicy mayo, while Katrina would meticulously arrange delicate slices of melt-in-your-mouth sashimi or prepare nigiri with cucumber or avocado, thus culminating in an authentic Japanese feast that delighted their communal table. This harmonious merge of sizzling-hot, umami-rich tempura, and ice-cold, delicate raw fish showcased the sisters' willingness to combine their culinary strengths and broaden their gastronomic horizons. Thus, Rebecca and Katrina's kitchen turned into a melting pot of flavors, where dishes as diverse as piping-hot enchiladas or chilled ceviche could coexist, mirroring the sisters' unwavering love and acceptance for one another's distinctive inclinations. Their mealtimes served as a testament to the beauty of embracing diversity, creating a rich tapestry of gastronomic experiences and elevating food into a transcendent language that nourished their relationship and brought them closer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While both sentences convey a similar message about an aggressive and energetic entrepreneur who created a fortune and established the Crosbie-dynasty, there are a few subtle differences when it comes to the sequence and the significance of the events described. In the first sentence: \\"As an aggressive and energetic entrepreneur, he lost a fortune (which he created) and started the Crosbie dynasty.\\" Here, the emphasis is placed on the entrepreneur losing a fortune, which is mentioned before stating that he created it. The sentence then continues by stating that he started the Crosbie dynasty. One could interpret the sequence of events as the entrepreneur losing the fortune and then going on to start the Crosbie dynasty after this loss. In the second sentence: \\"An aggressive and energetic entrepreneur, he created a fortune (which he lost) and founded the Crosbie-dynasty.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the entrepreneur creating the fortune first. The loss of that fortune is written in parentheses, which suggests that it might be less crucial to the overall meaning of the sentence, unlike the first phrasing. Additionally, the verb \\"founded\\" is used instead of \\"started,\\" which again suggests the importance of establishing the dynasty. Despite the similarities in content, the two sentences convey different nuances. The first sentence emphasizes the loss of the fortune and how it potentially led to the entrepreneur establishing the Crosbie dynasty. On the other hand, the second sentence highlights the entrepreneur's fortune creation and focuses on the founding of the Crosbie dynasty afterward. The loss of fortune is less emphasized and might be considered a side note.

Step 1: Understand the given sentence and guidelines. The task is to translate the following Japanese sentence: 最終的に、労働党、進歩党、そしてニュージーランド・ファースト党のみがそれに投票した。 Translate this to Bahasa Indonesia while making sure to retain the same meaning. If there are any numbers in the sentence, they should be kept the same. Step 2: Break down the sentence into smaller parts. It's helpful to divide the Japanese sentence into smaller parts before translating it. In this case, we can break the sentence into the following parts: - 最終的に (finally) - 労働党, 進歩党, そしてニュージーランド・ファースト党 (Labour Party, Progress Party, and New Zealand First Party) - のみ (only) - がそれに投票した (voted for it) Step 3: Translate each part into Bahasa Indonesia. Translate each part of the Japanese sentence into their Bahasa Indonesia equivalents: - 最終的に -> akhirnya - 労働党, 進歩党, そしてニュージーランド・ファースト党 -> Partai Buruh, Partai Progresif, dan Partai New Zealand First - のみ -> hanya - がそれに投票した -> memilihnya Step 4: Combine the translated parts together. Now, combine the translated parts back into a single Bahasa Indonesia sentence: \\"Akhirnya, hanya Partai Buruh, Partai Progresif, dan Partai New Zealand First yang memilihnya.\\" In this sentence, there are no numbers, so we don't need to worry about keeping them the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses). Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials. What is the answer to this question: What can give glass a faint green tinge?","output":"Glass can acquire a faint green tinge due to the presence of iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities. In ordinary soda-lime glass, these impurities can be found at concentrations of up to 0.1 wt%.

Under pressure from Washington to do more, Nato expanded its operations from the north, west and Kabul to the south a month ago despite nations having only come up with about 85 per cent of military requests for troops and equipment. But alliance leaders acknowledged on Thursday that they had underestimated the strength of Taliban opposition and called on countries to fill remaining commitments amounting to 2,000 to 2,500 troops plus helicopters and transport aircraft. Germany, which leads Nato operations in the relatively quiet north, is seen under pressure to make reinforcements available despite vocal political opposition in Berlin to such a move. Nato commanders until recently insisted that caveats, long a bane of other Nato operations, were not an issue in Afghanistan. But the rising violence in Afghanistan appears to have prompted them to call for greater flexibility in how they can use troops.

Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces.

A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core.

This is a well-known investment strategy that is utilised by all levels of market participants including pension funds, insurance companies, traditional asset managers and individual investors.\\" “Labour hit pension funds back in 1997, and spent the last 13 years trying to recover its reputation,” said another source. “I’m surprised they seem to want to do this again.” In all, Labour plans to raise a total of £1.1bn from clamping down on tax avoidance, with the remaining £500m coming from closing the ‘Eurobonds’ loophole which allows large companies to move profits out of the UK – a loophole HM Revenue and Customs ruled against closing two years – and clamping down on so-called ‘umbrella companies.’ The remaining £1.4bn will come from the mansion tax and the tax on tobacco companies. Business big and small moved to rebuff Mr Miliband’s plans, with John Cridland, director general of the CBI questioning the Labour leader’s apparent lack of economic vision. “We heard very little about how to create the economic growth to deliver these ambitions and the crucial role of healthy and thriving businesses in creating prosperity for all.\\" John Longworth, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, concurred, saying “some elements of his speech are likely to be seen as short-term political expediency, and could create uncertainty for business which runs counter to the need for long-term strategic vision and investment.” Those likely to be the losers from Mr Miliband’s policies – which include a further hit on the profits of Britain’s banks – were also less than impressed. Rob Perrins, managing director of house builder Berkeley Group, branded the mansion tax as “misconceived.” \\"The way to grow our economy is to make it competitive and open. Don’t turn property into a liability and penalise the many Londoners who are asset rich but cash poor,” he warned. The tobacco lobby was also not amused, with the Tobacco Manufacturers Association branding the profits tax as “illogical.” Shares in Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco closed down 2.4pc and 2.05pc respectively. Summary:","output":"Ed Miliband, leader of the UK's opposition Labour party, recently announced that if his party wins the general election, he would attempt to raise £600m (925m) a year ending tax relief on certain shares bought by hedge funds. Miliband claims that the measure is intended to cut spending and provide more funding for the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Experts have, however, suggested that the proposal could lead to a reduction of around 50% in the number of tax reliefs on shares, for a wide range of institutions, not only hedge funds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One day, an old man came to a village. He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away.   On a moonless, cold night, Nian went to the village again.

This was a deliberate effort to start a conversation.\\" He added, \\"I didn't propose any additional spending.\\" Mike Bloomberg on the Bush tax cuts: Obama should \\"veto any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts.

While going there before this, quitting before this, and eating before this are possible actions, let's have a look at a more detailed and chronological order of the necessary actions and precautions Alex should consider during this process: 1. Acquire accurate information: Alex needs to gather the latest and most accurate information about the natural disaster, its magnitude, and the affected areas. This could mean following news updates, social media, and emergency bulletins. 2. Assess personal safety: Before making a decision, Alex should ensure his own wellbeing and that of his family, making sure that his immediate environment is secure and that he is not putting himself or others at risk by leaving. 3. Identify and research relevant organizations: Alex should identify rescue and relief organizations that have already been mobilized, which may include government agencies, NGOs, and local organizations. Researching their response activities, resources, and channels would help Alex choose the best way to get involved. 4. Acquire necessary training or skills: Depending on the type of assistance needed and the requirements of the organizations responding, Alex should try to acquire any critical training or skills (such as First Aid, crisis management, or lifeguard certification) if he lacks these. 5. Secure necessary resources and equipment: To be most effective, Alex would need to gather and prepare essential resources such as emergency supplies, communication devices, transportation, and personal protective equipment relevant to the specific disaster. 6. Obtain proper authorization: In some cases, it might be necessary for volunteers like Alex to obtain authorization or permits to access disaster-affected areas, adhering to the rules and protocols established by authorities and coordinate with the organizations involved. 7. Notify family and friends: Before embarking, Alex should inform his close ones about his intentions, the expected duration, and how they can contact him. This ensures his safety and helps to minimize worry on their part. 8. Make personal preparations: Alex must make any personal arrangements required before leaving, such as managing work or family responsibilities, making financial arrangements, and packing essentials. In your suggested answers, this is when Alex might choose to quit his job before this or eat before this to make sure personal matters are in order. 9. Coordinate with a chosen organization: Finally, Alex should reach out to the organization he wishes to volunteer with, discussing how and where his skills and resources can be best utilized. This may include coordinating his arrival time, location, and expectations in terms of the roles he will be performing. In summary, before providing hope to the people affected by the natural disaster, Alex should thoroughly prepare himself by gathering accurate information, assessing personal safety, identifying relevant organizations, acquiring necessary training and skills, securing resources, ensuring proper authorizations, notifying family and friends, making personal preparations, and coordinating with the chosen organization."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: What type of weapon did von Manteuffel and Karl Twesten use in their duel? Passage 1:Sabita Devi (1914–1965) was a Hindi film actress in Indian cinema. She is stated to be one of the \\"prominent\\" leading ladies of the \\"pioneering era\\" of Indian cinema along with Mehtab, Bibbo, Durga Khote, Gohar, Devika Rani and Seeta Devi. A Jewess by birth, she changed her name to find acceptability in Hindi cinema like the other Anglo-Indian and Jewish actresses of her time, Sulochana (Ruby Myers), Seeta Devi (Renee Smith), Madhuri (Beryl Claessen), and Manorama (Erin Daniels). After initially working with British Dominion Films Ltd., Calcutta, she shifted to Bombay and performed mainly in films produced by Sagar Movietone with her co-star in most films being Motilal. Some of the popular films with Motilal were Dr. Madhurika (1935) and Kulvadhu (1937) directed by Sarvottam Badami. Their first film together was Shaher Ka Jadoo (1934), which was also Motilal's debut film, and then Lagna Bandhan (1936) both directed by Kaliprasad Ghosh. She acted in Silver King (1935) with Motilal. It was an action film directed by C. M. Luhar, which became a \\"huge success\\".  Passage 2:Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1852, and colonel (and commanding officer of the 5th Uhlans) in 1853, Manteuffel was sent on important diplomatic missions to Vienna and St Petersburg. In 1857 he was promoted to major-general and chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet (the King's military advisers). He gave strong support to the Prince Regent's plans for the reorganization of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820–1870), a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Manteuffel insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to lieutenant-general for the coronation of William I on 18 October 1861 and saw active service in that rank in the Danish War of 1864, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the Hanoverian campaign, then in July succeeded Vogel in command of the Army of the Main.  Passage 3:Page attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991. He attended Interlochen Center for the Arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University.

Write some highlights for the following article: Last week, we gave you digital tips and tricks for surviving a layoff -- the first seven days, at least. Now, here we are again, an entire Wednesday later, prepared to help you gird your loins for the job search ahead. So, wipe the Cheeto dust from your fingers and peel yourself out of that body-shaped imprint you've made on your bed. Your bout in the ranks of the unemployed probably won't be short -- on average, unemployed workers have been jobless for 40 weeks, a number that hasn't changed much in the last six months. But of course, you should aim to make it as brief as possible. \\"The longer you're laid off, the harder it is to get back in the market,\\" says Nicole Williams, LinkedIn's connection director. Act fast to get the ball rolling before you forget what it feels like to wear real pants and chit-chat over a box of donuts (with other people, that is). One positive note: The whole ordeal might not be as miserable as you think (\\"funemployment,\\" anyone?). Last year, an Australian study found that unemployed folks were actually happier than the drones stuck in miserable jobs. Maybe this'll be the best thing that ever happened to you. (Cheerleader jump! Cheerleader jump! Rah! Rah!) Read on for a few social network to-dos to get you back in the rat race. Target your pleas. Last week we covered strategically letting your circles know about the change in employment status (in short: Be brief, be upbeat, and only tell those who could specifically help you). A similar principle is at play as you're seeking out potential business contacts to bug. \\"A mistake a lot of people make is just contacting everyone they can find with a generic note,\\" Williams says. A better approach: Figure out something (or someone) you have in common with the individual, and send a personalized note along with your Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn request. \\"You have to get them to be interested in your situation,\\" she adds, \\"because people are busy, and why should they worry about your career?\\" Stalk potential employers. Not literally, of course. But when job-searching online, most people tend to think about job boards such as Monster.com and Craigslist.com. While there's nothing wrong with keeping an eye out for appropriate openings (and plenty of people indeed find new gigs on such sites), massive job listings are often a slang word that rhymes with \\"duster-duck\\" -- meaning they're disorganized, crowded and teeming with humanity. Sometimes a job will be posted days after the hiring managers have made a decision, when corporate policy requires it. Months-old listings will mysteriously float to the top long after they've been filled. And in the journalism world, for example, a listing on industry tracker MediaBistro.com can yield hundreds of enthusiastic applications. Go ahead and wade in the morass of job aggregators, but we recommend taking a more targeted approach in the meantime. Brainstorm some corporations that should be dying to hire you, and figure out how you can keep dibs on them. \\"That way you'll be privy to any movement in jobs or anything they're doing industry-wise,\\" Williams says. If the company's striking out on a new project that matches your skills, you have an in to request an informational interview with a higher-up over there, for example. And if you note that someone with your dream job just departed for Company X, you can swoop in. Poke around their website for an RSS feed of company news and add it to your own feed reader (such as Google Reader) for easy stalk-age. Follow the company on LinkedIn (go to the company tab along the top, search, and follow) to see who's leaving (and who will, presumably, leave behind a vacancy), and what current employees are in your circle -- they're your goldmines in the \\"Whom do I address this cover letter to?\\" game. Downplay the layoff in your job apps. Here's the thing: If you're the right candidate, then you're the right candidate -- whether you're currently at another company or currently signing up for market research focus groups to pay the bills between rounds of job-searching. While there's no shame in having been let go (at this point, we all know upstanding employees who fell victim to the economy), your cover letter should shimmer with hireability, not with the grayish Braille of woe-is-me teardrops. Think of it this way: If you come across as defensive, insecure or bitter about the layoff, you'll raise all sorts of red flags in a hiring manager's mind. But if you're bursting with confidence and talent and good ideas (and, oh yeah, it comes up in the interview that you're looking for a new job because you don't have one but the job termination was circumstantial and, hey, here's a recommendation letter from your former boss), you seem like the kind of employee who always lands on his feet. And in this earthquake of an economy, a little catlike agility is a very good thing.","output":"Article Highlights: 1. LinkedIn's Connection Director, Nicole Williams, suggests acting fast when starting the job search after a layoff, as the longer one is laid off, the harder it is to re-enter the job market. 2.

Personalizing messages and finding common interests with potential contacts can help increase interest and engagement. 3. Actively follow and engage with targeted companies on professional networks like LinkedIn to keep tabs on job movement, industry news, and potential vacancies. 4. Keep mentions of the layoff brief when applying for jobs.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.

Amdoxovir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) undergoing research for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It was discovered by Raymond F. Schinazi (Emory University) and C.K. Chu (University of Georgia). It is being developed by RFS Pharma. Currently, it is in Phase II clinical studies. Can we infer the following? Amdoxovir will pass onto Phase III clinical studies.","output":"To infer whether Amdoxovir will pass onto Phase III clinical studies, we must approach this step-by-step and analyze the available information: Step 1: Understand the drug development process Clinical trials are typically conducted in four phases: 1. Phase I: Assessing safety and dosage 2. Phase II: Testing efficacy and side effects 3. Phase III: Confirming effectiveness, monitoring side effects, and comparing to commonly used treatments 4. Phase IV: Post-marketing monitoring of drug safety and effectiveness Step 2: Analyze Amdoxovir's current status Amdoxovir is currently in Phase II clinical studies. This phase primarily focuses on evaluating the drug's efficacy and side effects in a larger group of people, to determine if it should move to Phase III. Step 3: Consider factors influencing progression to Phase III There are several factors that may influence whether Amdoxovir will move to Phase III clinical studies, such as: 1. Study results: Positive results from the Phase II trial that show the drug is effective and relatively safe would support moving to Phase III. 2. Funding: Sufficient financial backing for further development. 3. Regulatory approval: Meeting regulatory body's criteria for progression to the next phase. 4. Drug development strategy: The decisions made by RFS Pharma and any potential partners or investors on pursuing the drug's development. Step 4: Conclusion Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively infer that Amdoxovir will pass onto Phase III clinical studies. The progression to Phase III will depend on the success of the Phase II studies and other factors such as funding, regulatory approval, and the drug development strategy of RFS Pharma. Further information on the outcomes of the ongoing Phase II trials and additional factors would be needed to make a more informed inference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Unsupervised domain adaptation has received significant attention in recent years. Most of existing works tackle the closed-set scenario, assuming that the source and target domains share the exactly same categories. In practice, nevertheless, a target domain often contains samples of classes unseen in source domain (i.e., unknown class). The extension of domain adaptation from closed-set to such open-set situation is not trivial since the target samples in unknown class are not expected to align with the source. In this paper, we address this problem by augmenting the state-of-the-art domain adaptation technique, Self-Ensembling, with category-agnostic clusters in target domain. Specifically, we present Self-Ensembling with Category-agnostic Clusters (SE-CC) --- a novel architecture that steers domain adaptation with the additional guidance of category-agnostic clusters that are specific to target domain. These clustering information provides domain-specific visual cues, facilitating the generalization of Self-Ensembling for both closed-set and open-set scenarios. Technically, clustering is firstly performed over all the unlabeled target samples to obtain the category-agnostic clusters, which reveal the underlying data space structure peculiar to target domain. A clustering branch is capitalized on to ensure that the learnt representation preserves such underlying structure by matching the estimated assignment distribution over clusters to the inherent cluster distribution for each target sample. Furthermore, SE-CC enhances the learnt representation with mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments are conducted on Office and VisDA datasets for both open-set and closed-set domain adaptation, and superior results are reported when comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches. Output:","output":"This study introduces Self-Ensembling with Category-agnostic Clusters (SE-CC), a novel architecture for domain adaptation that addresses open-set scenarios and improves performance on both closed-set and open-set domain adaptations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\",  answer the following question.

Read this: The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state. Which university is said to have started faculty governance?

However, Palestinians today took to the streets in a violent outburst after Israeli militants allegedly fired shots across the border.

Israel, on the other hand, is calling for a complete disarmament of Hamas and its allied militants to ensure the security of its citizens. The property damage in Gaza City is a stark reminder of the devastating impact this prolonged conflict has had on the lives of ordinary people. Thousands of homes, businesses, and public infrastructure have been destroyed, leaving many families displaced and struggling to rebuild their lives. With both sides accusing each other of violating the temporary ceasefire, the prospects for achieving a lasting peace remain slim. International diplomats are working tirelessly to broker a deal that would bring an end to the hostilities and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The United Nations, the United States, and other global powers are urging both parties to compromise and find a meaningful resolution. In the meantime, aid organizations, such as the Red Crescent and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), are trying to provide basic assistance and support to the affected civilians. Their efforts, however, are hampered by the ongoing violence, travel restrictions, and the overall scarcity of resources in the region. As the world watches in horror at the unfolding crisis, it becomes more apparent that diplomatic efforts must be intensified to bring about a just and lasting solution not only for Gaza but for the region as a whole. The human cost of the conflict is too great to be ignored, and the future stability of the Middle East depends on breaking the cycle of violence and addressing the underlying political, economic, and social issues that fuel the disputes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea.  - Scalpay ( Scottish Gaelic : Sgalpaigh ) is an island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland .  - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority.  - An oceanic climate (also known as marine, west coast and maritime) is the climate typical of west coasts in higher middle latitudes of continents, and generally features cool summers (relative to their latitude) and cool but not cold winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature, with the exception for transitional areas to continental and subarctic climates. Oceanic climates are defined as having a monthly mean temperature below in the warmest month, and above in the coldest month.   - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef.

The fighter jet is engaged by a Syrian surface-to-air missile battery and shot down. Among the widely scattered wreckage littering the barren desert below is an intact nuke, burrowed deep into the crater left by the crashing debris.Fast-forward 29 years to 2002. US President J. Robert Fowler (James Cromwell) and his national security team are at Mt. Weather, Virginia participating in a nuclear war drill. After the drill, the President dispatches CIA Director William Cabot (Morgan Freeman) on an inspection tour of Russian nuclear sites according to the terms of the START arms treaty.At CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, young analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) is part of a group watching current video of Russian President Zorkin and sarcastically commenting on his recent weight gain. Simultaneously, a shadowy Neo-Nazi group is meeting in Vienna. Their leader, Richard Dressler (Alan Bates) laments the impotence of modern Europe in the face of global dominance by the United States and Russia. On the Golan Heights, an Arab scrap metal dealer is excavating the Israeli plane crash site from 1973. He strikes a hard object a few feet below the ground and realizes it is some type of bomb.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Police confirm that Barry, a fashion photographer whose work appeared in Vogue and The Sunday Times Magazine, suffered a fatal fall from her fourth-floor flat in Paris’s 16th arrondissement.            Police are currently investigating the specific cause of death. It has been reported that Barry lived alone and that antidepressants were found in her flat. A24 writes that Barry “suffered from drug and alcohol problems, which later prompted her to found an addiction treatment centre outside Paris.”            After her parents separated in 1967, the year after she was born, Barry was reportedly raised by Birkin and her partner, the late French singer Serge Gainsbourg, to whom Birkin was a muse. Barry is survived by her mother, who lived several miles away from her, a 26-year-old son Roman de Kermadec, and her half-sisters Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Douillon, Birkin’s daughter with director Jacques Doillon.            Of Kate, Birkin has previously said, “My eldest daughter, Kate, looks most like me. She’s a photographer. She had a Polaroid camera in her hand from a young age and photographed her sisters all the time.” When asked by Vanity Fair about her greatest achievement, in the magazine’s September issue this year, Jane Birkin answered, “My three girls and, personally, lasting so long in this profession with limited talent.”            Related: The Proust Questionnaire: Jane Birkin       ||||| Photographer Kate Barry, the daughter of actress Jane Birkin - partner of late French singer Serge Gainsbourg - and composer John Barry, has died aged 46 after falling from her fourth floor Paris flat, police said Thursday.      Kate Barry, the photographer daughter of singer-actress Jane Birkin and James Bond film composer John Barry, has died after falling from her fourth floor Paris flat, police said Thursday.      The 46-year-old’s body was found beneath her flat in the city's wealthy 16th district on Wednesday evening.      She lived alone and anti-depressants were discovered inside her flat, which was locked from the inside, police said. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of death.      Barry was the daughter of British-born Birkin, best known as the muse and partner of late French singer Serge Gainsbourg, and British composer John Barry, famous for writing 11 James Bond movie themes including 'Goldfinger' and 'Diamonds Are Forever'.      Her parents separated in 1967, the year of Kate Barry's birth, and she was brought up until her teenage years by Birkin and Gainsbourg – at the time the most famous couple in France known as much for their bohemian and hedonistic lifestyle as for their work.      Barry had studied fashion but later turned to photography, something she had been interested in since childhood, starting out with Gainsbourg's Polaroid camera.      Her work has been featured in numerous magazines including British Vogue and the Sunday Times magazine, and were recently on exhibition in Paris.      “As a child, I was photographed a lot. That must have left an impression,” she told the French newspaper Liberation in 2012.      She also suffered from drug and alcohol problems, which later prompted her to found an addiction treatment centre outside Paris.      French Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti paid tribute to Barry in a statement Thursday, saying that her \\"loving and heartfelt thoughts\\" were with a \\"family we all love\\".      \\"Her fragility touched us,\\" Filippetti said, adding that Barry was an outstanding photographer whose \\"sense of light and composition was very pictorial\\".      Barry was also the half-sister of actresses Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Doillon.      She is survived by her son, Roman de Kermadec, 26.

Barry was a talented fashion photographer whose work appeared in publications such as Vogue and The Sunday Times Magazine. The specific cause of her death is currently under investigation by the police.

She is survived by her mother, her 26-year-old son Roman de Kermadec, and her half-sisters Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Douillon, Birkin’s daughter with director Jacques Doillon. Barry's upbringing around artistic individuals, like her mother and Gainsbourg, played a significant role in her interest in photography. She began pursuing photography from an early age, and her talent eventually led to her work being featured in prestigious magazines and exhibitions. Throughout her life, Barry struggled with drug and alcohol problems, which ultimately led her to establish an addiction treatment center outside of Paris. French Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti expressed her condolences to Barry's family and praised her abilities as a photographer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Children whose minds wander might have sharper brains, a research suggests. A study has found that people who appear to be often distracted   have more \\"working memory\\", giving them the ability to hold a lot of information in their heads and control it cleverly. Children at school need this type of memory on a daily basis for a variety of tasks, such as following teachers' instructions or remembering dictated   sentences. During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one simple task during which researchers kept asking if their minds were wandering. At the end, volunteers measured their working memory capacity   by their ability to remember a series of letters mixed with simple maths questions. Daniel Levinson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States, said that those with higher working memory capacity reported \\"more mind wandering during these simple tasks\\", but their performance did not _ . The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm former research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple thoughts at the same time. Dr Jonathan Smallwood, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Science in Leipzig, Germany, said, \\"What this study seems to suggest is that, when surroundings for the task aren't very difficult, people with additional working memory capacity use them effectively to think about other things besides what they're doing.\\" Working memory capacity is also associated with general measures of intelligence, such as reading comprehension and IQ scores. Dr Smallwood added: \\"Our results suggest the sorts of planning that people do quite often in daily life - when they are on the bus, when they are cycling to work, when they are in the shower - are probably supported by working memory.\\" Question: According to the study, working memory   _  . Options: A: prevents people from remembering dictated sentences B: causes people's minds to wander more easily C: allows people to consider more things at the same time D: leads to people's worse performance during work Answer:","output":"C: allows people to consider more things at the same time"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick your answer from: + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","output":"The premise, \\"Yes, he was!\\" is quite ambiguous as there is no clear indication about the subject or context. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"Yes, he was in the newspaper!\\" provides a clearer context, implying someone being featured in a newspaper. The relationship between the premise ('Yes, he was!') and the hypothesis, \\"Yes, he was in the newspaper!\\" cannot be directly inferred as it lacks contextual information. Given the limited information available, it is not possible to tell whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The ambiguous nature of the phrase \\"Yes, he was!\\" means that it could apply to numerous different scenarios and contexts. It could be concerning a person’s achievement, recognition, or appearance in any medium or location. It might relate to being in the newspaper, but it could also relate to being on television, taking part in an event, achieving a milestone, or something else entirely. In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need more information on the context and subject of the discussion. For example, if there was a dialogue or conversation where one person asks, \\"Was he in the newspaper today?\\" and the other person replies, \\"Yes, he was!\\" it would then be reasonable to say that the premise entails the hypothesis. However, without that specific context, it is impossible to determine whether the premise and hypothesis are connected. So, in this case, my answer would be that it is not possible to tell whether the premise entails the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Step 3: Analyze the options [I] dirt - Dirt is common in both desert and areas with rain, so it may not be the most accurate answer. [II] air - Air is available everywhere, and the amount of rainfall doesn't significantly affect its availability. [III] h2o - Since rain is water (H₂O), an area with rain has more water than a desert environment.

Context: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

This entire process is known as photosynthesis, which is essential for the growth and survival of plants and also helps sustain life on Earth, since oxygen is a byproduct of this process. Photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast, the chlorophyll molecules absorb sunlight and initiate a series of energy transfers through the electron transport chain. This energy is used to generate ATP and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), both of which are vital energy carriers for cells. The light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle, take place in the stroma of the chloroplast. During these reactions, the ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent reactions are used to fix carbon dioxide into an organic molecule, a process called carbon fixation. The fixed carbon is then used to create glucose and other sugar molecules through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Glucose serves as an energy source and a building block for plants. It can be used directly for energy or stored as starch for later use. Some of the glucose is used to generate other essential molecules, such as cellulose (a component of plant cell walls) and various proteins and lipids required for proper plant growth and development. As a byproduct of these reactions, oxygen is formed, which is released into the atmosphere through the plant's stomata. Oxygen is essential for maintaining life on Earth, as it serves as a primary component in the process of aerobic cellular respiration, which is how most organisms, including humans, generate the energy necessary for their survival and growth. Additionally, the release of oxygen into the atmosphere has had a significant impact on the evolution of life, contributing to the development of the Earth's atmosphere and enabling the emergence of more complex, oxygen-dependent organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: We Chat, the Chinese social media smartphone app, saw an increase in user numbers of 41 per cent year on year to 500m at the end of 2014, in a sign that parent company Tencent is extending  its reach for the mobile internet. Revenue grew 24 per cent to Rmb20.98billion, slightly higher than forecasts, driven mainly by online gaming revenues. It is unclear how much WeChat contributed to Tencent's revenues but the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it tries to adjust its business to be more suitable for mobile devices. \\"We extended our leadership in games and online media, and made breakthroughs in emerging platforms such as online security . . . and mobile payments,\\" Ma Huateng, Tencent chairman, said in a statement. WeChat is the second highest ranked app in China, behind QQ, Tencent's other chatting app, which claimed to have 815m registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, that figure is more than the total number of internet users in China, which the government puts at 640million. Tencent has been unwilling to earn money through WeChat by flooding it with advertising, which could reduce efforts to increase the user base. But this is expected to change. Some analysts predicted that advertising would be introduced on later this year. Early attempts to test ads on the service have not always gone smoothly. After a BMW ad was introduced on some users' feeds in January, many users complained of \\"discrimination\\" by Tencent's data mining algorithm. They said it unfairly considered them as not wealthy or successful enough to view the sought-after BMW ad. Options: A WeChat contributed most to Tencent's profits.

Does the word \\"give\\" mean the same thing in \\"I'm going to give my wife a necklace for her birthday.\\" and \\"He gives of his energies to the organization.\\"? Choose your answer from:  *different meanings.  *the same meaning.","output":"The word \\"give\\" in the two sentences provided has different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"I'm going to give my wife a necklace for her birthday,\\" the word \\"give\\" is used to denote the act of physically presenting or handing over an object, such as a gift, to someone. In this context, give is a concrete action, where one person is transferring the possession of an item or a gift to another person. This is a common usage of the word, and it is easy to visualize the action that is taking place. The focus is on the tangible object being given, in this case, a necklace. In the second sentence, \\"He gives of his energies to the organization,\\" the word \\"give\\" is used in a more abstract sense. Here, \\"give\\" refers to the act of dedicating or investing one's time, effort, or energy into something or someone. The focus in this context is on the intangible contribution that the person is making to the organization by exerting their energies in support of its goals and objectives. This usage of \\"give\\" implies a more figurative action, as it is not associated with a physical object or a literal transfer of possession. In summary, while the word \\"give\\" serves as a central verb in both sentences and is related to the idea of handing over or transferring something to someone else, it carries different meanings in each sentence. The first sentence refers to a concrete action of handing over a tangible object, while the second sentence conveys the abstract notion of dedicating one's energies or resources to a particular cause or entity. Therefore, the word \\"give\\" carries different meanings in these two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: The Redskins kicked off their 2015 regular season by hosting the Miami Dolphins. After a Kai Forbath field goal put the Redskins up 3-0, they got the ball back, and newly minted starting quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a deep pass to DeSean Jackson. The ball was overthrown, and Jackson sustained a hamstring injury while stretching out to attempt to catch it. Early in the second quarter, Cousins was intercepted by Miami cornerback Brent Grimes at the Redskins' 25-yard-line, continuing a trend from previous seasons of turnovers and ill-advised throws. Grimes returned the interception 11 yards to the 14-yard-line, but the Dolphins failed to score any points off of the turnover. Near the end of the first half, with Washington still nursing a 3-0 lead, Cousins tossed a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jordan Reed, putting the Redskins up 10-0. Miami scored right before halftime, with Ryan Tannehill throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to receiver Rishard Matthews with 27 seconds remaining. Washington led 10-7 entering halftime. Miami got the ball to begin the second half, and on 3rd and 7 from the Miami 45-yard-line, Tannehill threw deep down the right sideline to former Pro Bowl tight end Jordan Cameron for a gain of 27. However, on 3rd and 4 from the Redskins' 22-yard-line, inside of Miami kicker Andrew Franks' range, defensive end Jason Hatcher forced a Tannehill fumble that was bobbled all the way back to the Miami 40 and recovered by Redskins rookie outside linebacker Preston Smith. The Redskins did not capitalize, however, losing two yards on an Alfred Morris run and two short Cousins passes. On their next possession, Washington drove to the Miami 22-yard-line&#8212;easily inside Forbath's range&#8212;but three consecutive penalties pushed them back 24 yards and forced a punt, squandering a valuable chance to extend the lead. On the ensuing drive, Franks converted a 22-yard field goal attempt to tie the score at 10-10 entering the fourth quarter. The Redskins continued to have no success on offense, resulting in a punt to Dolphins receiver Jarvis Landry, who fielded the ball at the Miami 31-yard-line, broke a few tackles and burst into the clear for a 69-yard score and a 17-10 Dolphins lead. On 3rd and 13 from their own 29-yard-line, with a chance to cut into or tie the Dolphins' lead, Cousins threw to the endzone for Pierre Gar&#231;on, but the ball was intercepted by Miami cornerback Brice McCain, ending the Redskins attempt at a potential field goal to narrow the deficit. That ended up being Washington's best chance, as they could not score on any of their subsequent possessions. Miami scored 17 unanswered points and shut out the Redskins in the second half to win 17-10 and win their third straight season opener under coach Joe Philbin. Washington, by contrast, lost in Week 1 for the third consecutive season and for the second straight time under head coach Jay Gruden.

Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign Prospects Bet Big On Joy At a time like this, joy is an awfully strange thing to build a presidential campaign around. But here’s Jeb Bush, and he just can’t stop talking about that most delightful and fleeting of human emotions as he edges towards becoming the Republican frontrunner in 2016. It started months ago, when he began speculating in public over whether the country, and his own party, could handle a candidate with a “hopeful, optimistic message.” “In my case that means, can one do it joyfully?” he told The Today Show in April. He slipped from the spotlight, but never dropped the talking point. In November, he mentioned the “joy in my heart” when asked by the Wall Street Journal about a presidential run. Then on Monday, at a commencement address in the primary state of South Carolina, he implored students to reach for joy in all they did. “I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits,” he said, one day before announcing his formal intention to explore a campaign. “It’s a pretty pessimistic country right now.” That’s the bet of the third man named Bush to pursue the presidency in three decades. After a 13 years of relentlessly bad news and increasingly divisive politics, the former Sunshine State governor thinks the country might just be ready for some sunshine of its own. Joy will be his weapon against who accuse him of ideological weakness, hereditary entitlement or establishment blandness. If he ever does face Hillary Clinton in a general election campaign, he can repurpose the vibe to counter rival whose laugh has been so honed by political necessity as to echo in mechanical rhythms. Relentless and even irrational optimism, of course, is not a novel pose for a presidential contender, but it is hard to remember a candidate so committed to a psychological analysis of the political landscape this early in the cycle. To hear Bush tell it, the nation is “mopey,” beaten down by war, economic stagnation and the furious politics that accompany each. To Bush, the solutions are right in front of all of us, if only we can pop some Prozac and kick the blues: Reform the immigration system to flood the nation with brilliant entrepreneurs from a abroad, open the taps of domestic energy production, kick the K-12 education system in the rear and fix the tax, regulatory and entitlement nonsense that hangs like a weight around our future. “We are moping around like we are France,” he said on Dec. 1. “The crisis of opportunity is we are not seizing the moment. We are not aspiring to be young and dynamic again.” To his own party, the shrink’s critique has a neat corollary. “You don’t do well in bringing people together if you are carping, criticizing, turning around and saying you are not as good as me,” he said in an interview with Florida reporters broadcast on Sunday. That line of attack—which transfers the fight from ideology to feeling—could serve him well in what is certain to be a brutal primary against a monstrously unwieldy field of politicians far more conservative, religious and attuned to tapping the ever-evolving grassroots Id than him. It’s also a message that is likely to work against his most fearsome rival for the establishment crown, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose spirit animal is more carnivorous than cuddly. “He is going to be a very effective candidate if he runs, because he is going to talk about the future without backing down or pandering to the Tea Party side,” explains Charlie Black, a Republican lobbyist who’s long run in presidential politics started in 1976 on the Ronald Reagan campaign. The question for Bush is whether there are enough Republicans left, and partial to voting in early primary states, who will put the promise of glee before their deep feelings of grievance and need for reform. Bush last ran for public office in 2002, long before conservatives, libertarians and the Tea Party decided that his family’s tradition of big government conservatism was the problem, not the solution. As Bush has wisely observed, his best route victory in 2016 will require him to lose the debate stage policy argument in the primary while still finding a way to get more votes. That’s a tough circle to square if all you are working with are facts and figures. But joy exists outside the realm of what is. That’s why we all seek it out: To make something else of who we are. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Jeb Bush, who is part of the Bush family, wanted to be president in 2016. He thought that by talking about happiness and joy, he could get people to support him.

However, he faced challenges from other people who wanted to be president, and he needed to convince voters that his ideas for making things better were the right ones."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The increase covers both regulated fares, which includes season tickets, and unregulated fares, such as off-peak leisure tickets. The rise in regulated fares had already been capped at July's Retail Prices Index inflation rate of 1.9%. Unregulated fares face no cap. Campaigners said passengers would be disappointed by the increase. \\"Passengers will now want to see the industry's investment deliver a more reliable day-to-day railway,\\" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of the watchdog Transport Focus. \\"The government should consider setting rail fare rises around the Consumer Prices Index instead to bring rail fares into line with other recognised measures of inflation.\\" Lizzie Green, a London commuter, said: \\"Given that the trains are so irregular and the delays are so often it seems like a bit of a cheeky increase.\\" Some unregulated fares are likely to rise by considerably more than 2.3%. That far outstrips the inflation rate, which is currently running at 0.9%, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index. The pace of fare increases has slowed a little in recent years, but it follows a decade's worth of steeper rises which began in 2004. It's all because successive governments have changed the way they split the bill for running the service, so that passengers pay more and other taxpayers pay less. About 70% of the total network cost is met from ticket sales now. It used to be about 50%. Ministers are spending record amounts upgrading the service, which is creaking under huge demand for train travel that no-one saw coming. But it hasn't stopped punctuality levels falling well below target. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said the industry was working to simplify fares and improve services. \\"We understand how passengers feel when fares go up, and we know that in some places they haven't always got the service they pay for,\\" said Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group. \\"Around 97p in every pound passengers pay goes back into running and improving services.\\" The overall 2.3% increase covers fares in England and Wales and Scottish policy as expected at the moment. Northern Ireland is treated separately. Authorities in Scotland can set their own fare increases. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \\"No final decision has been taken on next year's fares in Scotland and we are looking at options before the end of the year.\\" She added that the government would consider a fare freeze if it could \\"enable us to reduce costs to passengers while still delivering our ambitious infrastructure programme\\". Meanwhile, more than 84,000 passengers on Southern Rail are to receive compensation for the disruption they have experienced during 2016. The government said the delays were caused by \\"Network Rail track failures, engineering works, unacceptably poor performance by the operator and the actions of the RMT union.\\" It has set aside Â£15m to pay commuters. Season ticket holders will be able to claim a month's compensation, directly into their bank account. To qualify, customers must have paid for at least 12 weeks of travel, between 24 April and 31 December 2016. From 11 December passengers on Southern Rail will additionally be able to claim compensation if their train is more than 15 minutes late.

Both imply that the original source of the narrative is a novel written by Robert Suhosky, and this novel has later been adapted into a different format, specifically a script or screenplay, by James Hardiman. The only difference between the two sentences is the choice of words: while one mentions 'script', the other uses 'screenplay'. However, in the context of cinema or theater, both terms are often used interchangeably. Here, it would be worthwhile to delve a bit more into the difference between the phrases 'turned into a script' and 'turned into a screenplay'. Despite being used interchangeable in many contexts, 'script' and 'screenplay' technically represent different concepts within the realm of film-making. A script typically represents the written text of a play, broadcast, or film including dialogues and directions, and can include various forms of media like television, radio, and theater. On the other hand, a screenplay is specifically the script of a movie that includes camera directions as well as stage directions and it is written specifically for producing a film.  However, these technical nuances do not make any significant difference to the meaning of the sentences you presented. In both instances, James Hardiman is portrayed as the person responsible for reformatting the content of Robert Suhosky's novel for a different medium, likely a film or play.

To clarify the reasons behind this answer, let's analyze both sentences separately: Sentence 1: \\"FOUR GENERATIONS OF MAINE FISHERMEN COULD BE WRONG\\" This sentence suggests a possibility that the fishermen from the past four generations may have been incorrect about something (this \\"something\\" is not specified). The use of the word \\"could\\" implies that it may or may not be true; it is uncertain whether they are indeed wrong. Sentence 2: \\"The fishermen have all been correct in the past four generations.\\" This sentence states that the fishermen in question have been right or accurate in whatever information or predictions they have made over the past four generations. It assumes that there has been a history of correctness among the fishermen and that their experiences and knowledge have been reliable. Now, when comparing these two sentences, they represent two conflicting statements. Sentence 1 questions the accuracy of the fishermen's knowledge, while sentence 2 expresses certainty in their correctness.

In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices. Answer:","output":"Macdonald."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If this is not an option, brainstorm other job opportunities that would offer similar rewards and challenges. If she did not enjoy her last job, talk about what it was that she didn't like. It's important to understand if she didn't like the specific company she was working for or if she didn't like the kind of work she was doing. If she didn't like the kind of work she was doing, she may need to pursue something completely different. If your wife has been out of work for an extended period of time, going back to the same kind of work that she used to do might not be the right fit for her anymore. Sit down with your wife and discuss what has changed for her since she last worked.  She may have discovered a new passion during her time away from the workforce. If this is the case, brainstorm different job opportunities that would allow her to pursue this passion. Your wife may also have different priorities now than she once did. For example, she may not be interested in returning to a job that requires constant travel if she wants to be able to spend more time with the family. If this is the case, brainstorm job opportunities that would utilize her skills, but would not require travel. If your wife needs help deciding what she wants to do, encourage her to see a career counselor. If your financial situation is urgent, your wife may not have the luxury of being able to wait around for the perfect job. If this is the case for your family, sit down with your wife and talk about the possibility of her taking a temporary job to help pay the bills. Make sure she understands that you want her to continue looking for her dream job while she is working at her temporary job. Be supportive if she dislikes what she is doing and help her seek out opportunities for a job that will be more fulfilling.

Based on the sentence \\"A young boy is kicking a soccer ball away from 3 opponents.\\", is the sentence \\"There are three opponents\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"There are three opponents\\" is a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence \\"A young boy is kicking a soccer ball away from 3 opponents.\\" In the original sentence, it is explicitly mentioned that there are three opponents from which the young boy is kicking the soccer ball away. The focus of the sentence is the young boy who is playing soccer, likely in a competitive or recreational context, but the presence of the three opponents is also a crucial part of the sentence, directly affecting the boy's actions in the scenario. Engaging in a detailed analysis of both the sentence and the scenario it describes can provide additional insight into why this particular sentence is true. 1. Narrative context: The sentence paints a vivid picture of a young boy skillfully handling a soccer ball, possibly during a soccer match or practice, while trying to evade or outmaneuver his opponents. The opponents' presence is crucial to the action and helps define the challenge or potential conflict in the narrative. 2. Semantic relation: The phrase \\"3 opponents\\" is central to understanding the argument or statement being made in the original sentence. Without this information, it would be difficult to discern whether the boy is playing alone, practicing, or participating in a game against other players. By acknowledging the presence of the opponents, we contextualize the boy's actions and the environment in which the scenario unfolds. 3. Quantitative aspect: The number \\"3\\" is a specific quantitative descriptor that is essential for understanding the situation in the original sentence. There are exactly three opponents in the scene, and this information denotes the exact number of adversaries the boy is contending with, giving the readers or listeners a better sense of the environment. In conclusion, based on the given sentence \\"A young boy is kicking a soccer ball away from 3 opponents,\\" the sentence \\"There are three opponents\\" is indeed a true sentence due to the direct mention and presence of the three opponents within the context. The presence of the opponents is relevant to the scene described, and the number \\"3\\" is essential for providing a precise understanding of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the passerby who accosted Gardstein and his accomplices??  Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him...

The fungus is edible , but due to possible confusion with toxic Amanita species is not recommended . Choices: (A). no; (B). yes;","output":"(A). No While the two sentences may seem quite similar, they have distinct differences in meaning. 1. The first sentence states:  \\"The mushroom is poisonous, but due to possible confusion with edible Amanita species is not recommended.\\" This sentence suggests that the mushroom in question is poisonous and not safe for consumption. Additionally, the sentence warns of its appearance, which can be confused with edible Amanita species. It is important to note that the primary concern here is the inherent poison-ness of the mushroom. The confusion with edible Amanita species further accentuates the risk, making it not recommended for consumption. 2. The second sentence states:  \\"The fungus is edible, but due to possible confusion with toxic Amanita species is not recommended.\\" In contrast, this sentence declares that the fungus is edible, which implies that consuming it is not inherently dangerous. However, the problem arises from the possible confusion with toxic Amanita species, which are not safe to eat. The concern here is the difficulty in differentiating between the edible fungus and the poisonous Amanita species. To avoid the risk of misidentification, it is not recommended for consumption, even though the fungus itself is edible. In summary, the difference in meaning between the two sentences lies in the inherent characteristics of the mushroom or fungus: the first sentence refers to a poisonous mushroom, while the second refers to an edible fungus. The concern regarding confusion with Amanita species is present in both sentences, but the primary difference is whether the mushroom or fungus is poisonous or edible. Therefore, the answer is (A). No, the sentences do not mean the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: \\"A little girl eating two cookies.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"the girl is not hungry and will refuse to eat anything\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise \\"A little girl eating two cookies\\" provides some information, but it is not sufficient to determine whether the given hypothesis \\"the girl is not hungry and will refuse to eat anything\\" is true.  In the premise, we see that the little girl is eating two cookies. This might lead to the assumption that she was hungry or simply desired the cookies. However, without further information, we cannot confirm or reject the hypothesis. The hypothesis proposes two statements: 1) the girl is not hungry, and 2) she will refuse to eat anything. These statements might not necessarily be connected. Even if someone is not hungry, they might still choose to eat something that they enjoy or due to other reasons, such as peer pressure, boredom, or habit. Conversely, a person can be hungry and still refuse to eat, possibly due to a dislike of the food options, a personal preference for eating at specific times, or even some sort of dietary restriction. In order to confirm or reject the hypothesis, we would require additional information and context about the little girl and her eating habits. This might include observations of her in various situations, interviews with her caretakers, or a detailed inquiry into her typical food intake and preferences. Only with more evidence and context can we accurately evaluate the truth of the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the hypothesis is true. The girl eating two cookies may reflect hunger or a simple desire for something sweet, but it does not directly support or refute the hypothesis that she is not hungry and will refuse to eat anything. Additional data and context would be necessary to make a more informed judgment about the hypothesis's accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hello little buddy! Let's talk about oxidation numbers! Question 1: The oxidation number of zinc is easy to figure out. Zinc is a metal and it usually likes to lose 2 electrons to become stable. So, for zinc, its oxidation number is +2. Picture it like zinc having 2 extra happiness points it wants to share with others. Question 2: Determining oxidation numbers for other elements can be a bit tricky, but I'll help you understand it. You see, some elements like to give away happiness points (electrons) and some like to take them.  Here are some simple rules for finding oxidation numbers: 1. For elements that are all alone (not with others), their oxidation number is 0. 2. For oxygen, it usually has an oxidation number of -2 because it likes to take 2 happiness points from others. 3. For hydrogen, it usually has an oxidation number of +1 because it likes to give away 1 happiness point. 4. The total oxidation numbers in a compound always equal to 0, or the charge of the compound if it's not neutral. Sometimes the oxidation number is the same for two different questions, but it depends on the element you're talking about. Zinc always has an oxidation number of +2, so in that case, the answer would be the same for both questions. But for other elements, you may need to follow the rules I just explained.

This will make it much easier to remove the ivy from the ground. Pull the sections apart from one another as you cut. Work carefully around plants and saplings you want to keep. If you're working on a hill, cut vertical lines from the top of the hill to the bottom to create sections that you can roll downhill. Lift the edge of one section of ivy and roll it forward on top of itself. Keep rolling the ivy forward until the entire section has been rolled up into a big log of ivy. Move the log to a separate area and continue rolling up sections until you've cleared the area. Mulching the ivy rolls is the best way to dispose of them and ensure they won't take root in the area again. English ivy is difficult to kill with herbicides alone because the plant's leaves contain a waxy barrier that is difficult for products to penetrate. Therefore, the most effective method is to combine manual removal with the use of a herbicide. Glyphosate is the chemical that works most effectively to kill English ivy.  Spray the area of ivy you wish to kill, but be careful the glyphosate doesn't reach other plants you want to keep. Herbicides are slow-acting, and must be reapplied every six weeks or so. If you have a patch of ivy you want to preserve, but you'd like to prevent it from spreading, you can use mulch to keep it contained. Simply cover the border of the ivy you want to keep with several inches (about 7 to 8 inches) of shredded or wood chip mulch. You will need to give this method some time; leave the mulch on the ivy for at least 2 seasons. You may need to add new mulch one or more times during a growing season. Another option is to trim the ivy back to contain it. Use a weed eater or edging tool to cut the vines along the border.","output":"In order to remove ivy effectively and efficiently, begin by cutting lines through the ivy at ground level, dividing it into large sections.

Question: What is the name of Jake's estranged brother? Movie plot title: Raging Bull Movie plot: In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the... Answer:","output":"Joey LaMotta"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: What Mexican mayor tried to crack down on crime immensely? Answer: Between 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \\"since most people are reluctant to report crime\\".  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: The Mexican mayor who tried to crack down on crime immensely is Marcelo Ebrard, who served as the Mayor of Mexico City from 2006 to 2012. Marcelo Ebrard is a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and took office with a strong commitment to combat the high crime rates within the city. During Ebrard's tenure, he implemented several strategies and policies to address crime, such as increasing the number of police officers, investing in technology to improve surveillance and communication systems, and modernizing the city's public transport system to make it safer and more reliable. One of his most notable projects was the creation of the Public Security Secretariat, which aimed at centralizing and streamlining the functions of the various police forces within Mexico City, making them more efficient and less prone to corruption. The new police force was provided with better equipment, including new patrol cars and firearms, and underwent extensive professional training to enhance their abilities. Ebrard also focused on addressing the root causes of crime by implementing social programs aimed at supporting vulnerable populations, such as the homeless and drug addicts. He invested in education, healthcare, and housing, which contributed to the reduction of socioeconomic disparities and provided opportunities to those who would otherwise be at risk of engaging in criminal activities. During his time in office, Marcelo Ebrard managed to reduce the city's crime rate substantially. According to a report by the Institut Mexicain de Compétitivité et Des Institutions, the crime rate in Mexico City dropped from 478 crimes per day in 2000 to 2004, to an average of 330 crimes per day from 2006 to 2012. Although it is important to note that the actual crime rate might have been higher due to underreporting, the downward trend in crime statistics is a direct result of Ebrard's efforts to bolster public security. While crime still remains an issue in Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard's efforts during his tenure as mayor highlighted the importance of addressing both the consequences and the root causes of crime. His comprehensive approach to public security serves as an example of how cities can effectively tackle crime and improve the quality of life for their citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment. We all say stupid shit sometimes; just laugh at yourself and enjoy the silly moment. According to the above context, answer the following question. Who made the personal critique to the girl? A:","output":"In the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned who made the personal critique to the girl. It is simply mentioned that someone within the group of students made the personal critique and referred to the girl's taste from growing up in a trailer park, forecasting a bleak design career for her at the Auto Trader. It is important to note that this type of personal attack was not the intended purpose of the open critique exercise, as it was meant to be focused on the improvement of artistic skills and preparation for the tough advertising world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The income gap between China's rural and urban residents  has continued to widen during the past few years in spite of rapidly rising rural incomes, Agricultural Minister Sun Zhengcai said here on Wednesday. The income ratio  between urban and rural residents was 3.28:1 in 2006, against 3.23:1 in 2003, said Sun in his report on the promotion of building a new countryside in 2007. Sun also said the net income of rural residents in different regions also varied widely. The income gap is only one of several problems in rural areas, according to Sun's report. While listing the achievements in rural areas in recent years, Sun believed that rural development still followed behind urban development. \\"We have bigger pressure to ensure the supply of major agricultural products such as grain,\\" he said. \\"China's urbanization  has been speeded up and more rural residents have gone to urban areas,\\" he said. \\"In this case, more agricultural producers become farm produce consumers, which created more pressure for supply,\\" he said. Another problem facing China's agricultural development is _ application of science and technology. \\"Only 30 percent of scientific and technological achievements have been applied to agricultural production, which is 40 percentage points lower than developed countries,\\" he said. Despite increased government spending in rural areas, the infrastructure  is still poor and easily hit by disasters. According to Sun, the government spent 431.8 billion yuan (59.15 billion) on agriculture, rural areas and farmers this year, an increase of 80.1 billion yuan over the previous year. China set aside 11.38 billion yuan to promote a new rural cooperative medical care system and 27.98 billion yuan to support the new compulsory education mechanism in rural area to ensure that all citizens shared the fruits of China's reform and opening-up, Sun said.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. What is probably true about Trump?

Paraphrasing typically involves rephrasing a statement or idea using different words or structure to maintain the original meaning but with some level of variation in the expression.

Nelson had one for a pet. II. Brian had one for a pet.","output":"Between the two given options, the sentence should end with option II, which is: \\"Rabbits are cute but Nelson was allergic, but not Brian, so Brian had one for a pet.\\" The sentence's structure implies that, although rabbits are cute, Nelson is unfortunately allergic to them, making it difficult for him to have one for a pet. However, Brian, who is not allergic, can more easily own a rabbit as a pet. Selecting option II makes logical sense within the context of the sentence because it highlights the difference between Nelson and Brian's situations with regards to rabbit ownership. Brian's lack of allergies enables him to have a rabbit as a pet without any health concerns. Option I, on the other hand, implies that despite Nelson's allergy, he still had a rabbit for a pet. While this scenario is not impossible, it does not follow the logical flow of the statement, as owning a rabbit would likely cause significant discomfort and health issues for Nelson. Therefore, option II is the more appropriate choice for finishing the sentence, as it aligns with the information provided and establishes a logical progression of events that take into account each individual's specific circumstances and relationship with rabbits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Piercing your lip will be painful, and the piercing may cause bleeding. The area may be tender, swollen, and bruised for several days afterward. Lip piercings can take anywhere from 6 to 10 weeks to heal fully, so be prepared for multiple daily cleanings during that time, plus regular upkeep after that. Cleaning your lip piercing is pretty straightforward, but it will require non-iodized salt, alcohol-free mouthwash, and a mild, fragrance-free soap. Pick up a new toothbrush as well—one with soft bristles—and replace your old one after getting your piercing. Before getting your lip pierced, know what to look for regarding infections. Symptoms include pus, green or yellow discharge, tingling or loss of feeling around the piercing site, fever, and excessive bleeding, pain, redness, and swelling. Leave the jewelry in if you suspect an infection, but seek medical attention immediately. Body jewelry often contains nickel, which is a common allergen for many people. Symptoms will likely appear within 12 to 48 hours, and can include itching and swelling, crusty or scaly blisters, and redness, rash, or dry skin.  Your lip piercing won’t heal properly if you are allergic to the jewelry, so go to the doctor immediately if you suspect an allergy. If you can’t wear necklaces, earrings, rings or bracelets containing nickel, you won’t be able to wear it in your lip, either. Look for jewelry labeled “surgical steel” or “nickel free.” In addition to nickel, some people may be allergic to copper or brass. These 3 base metals cause the majority of allergic reactions to jewelry.","output":"Lip piercings can be painful and cause bleeding, with tenderness, swelling, and bruising lasting for days. The healing process takes 6-10 weeks, requiring daily cleaning with specific products and a soft-bristle toothbrush. Be aware of infection symptoms like pus, discharge, fever, and excessive swelling, and seek medical attention if needed. Allergic reactions to metals like nickel, copper, and brass can occur, so opt for surgical steel or nickel-free jewelry.

Options：  A. ashtray  B. pocket  C. coin collection  D. slot machine  E. deposit box The answer is:","output":"C. coin collection The most suitable option to answer the question is \\"C. coin collection.\\" This option directly relates to the context of the question, involving a token and potential fraudulence. In a coin collection, tokens often represent items of numismatic value and can be collected based on various factors, including rarity, historical significance, and artistic merit.  In this scenario, it is possible for someone to attempt to introduce a fraudulent token into a coin collection to deceive others about its value or origins. Upon discovery of the fraudulence, the token would be removed from the collection to maintain the integrity of the other genuine tokens and coins. The other options, such as an ashtray, pocket, slot machine, and deposit box, do not provide the same direct relevancy to a fraudulent token. An ashtray would typically not contain a token, and a pocket is simply a place where someone might keep a token temporarily. A deposit box generally contains personal or valuable items but would not be an immediate context where a fraudulent token would be identified and removed. As for a slot machine, while it may use tokens, it does not determine whether a token is fraudulent or not.

Armed forces charities accused the left-wing newspaper of trying to politicise the tribute to those killed during the First World War. They sprang to the defence of the installation, called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, after the online article by a former Turner Prize judge described it as ‘trite, fake, and inward-looking’. An aerial view of the Tower of London showing the poppy installation called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red. The Guardian has provoked anger by publishing an article that labelled the artwork as a 'UKIP-style memorial' In a provocative critique, author Jonathan Jones wrote: ‘The crowds come to remember – but we should not be remembering only our own. It’s the inward-looking mood that lets Ukip thrive. But that’s probably an overinterpretation, because the spectacle of all these red poppies is emptier than that. ‘In spite of the mention of blood in its title, this is a deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial. Describing his preferred style of tribute, he wrote: ‘A meaningful mass memorial to this horror would not be dignified or pretty. It would be gory, vile and terrible to see. The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something.’ Social media users described the article as ridiculous, disrespectful and missing the point. In a provocative critique, former Turner Prize judge Jonathan Jones called it 'trite, fake and inward looking. And armed forces charities emphasised the way in which the artwork had caught the public’s imagination. Help for Heroes said it would not dignify an article that ‘tried to politicise a memorial’ with a response. A spokesman for armed forces charity SSAFA said: ‘The fact that hundreds of thousands of people have visited the installation to date, with many more expected as we head towards Remembrance, demonstrates how strongly the installation has resonated with the general public.’ A spokesman for the Historic Royal Palaces, which organised the memorial, said: ‘We have seen and read the article. It’s his opinion and we have nothing more to say about it. We’re just pleased with the way the public are responding to it – and that’s what’s more important to us. ‘We think it is incredibly evocative and we’ve seen people looking at it and being moved to tears just thinking about loved ones who died and the impact of war itself.’ Twitter user Jonny Wild wrote: ‘There are no words to express how disrespectful Jonathan Jones’ poppy article in the Guardian is – ridiculous piece of journalism.’ Journalist Ruth Green from Northern Ireland tweeted: ‘I saw the poppy installation last week. On so many levels Jonathan Jones has missed the point.’ But armed forces charities have emphasised they way in which the artwork has caught the public's imagination. Another user, tweeting under the name ‘Kemp1886’, said: ‘That Guardian article on the Poppy memorial is filth. Not remotely surprised though. No wonder circulation is so low.’ The article was published on what is thought to have been a record day for visitors at the memorial so far, with police brought in to help control the crowds. Visitors yesterday reported long queues to catch a glimpse of the memorial, but most were pleased to see so many keen to pay their respects. Sheila Bainbridge, 85, made the journey from Nottingham with her daughter, granddaughters and great-grandchildren. The President of the Women’s Section of the Royal British Legion in Radcliffe-on-Trent, whose late husband Sgt Laurie Bainbridge fought for the Royal Air Force on D-Day and helped liberate the Belsen concentration camp, said the sight was worth the wait. She said: ‘We don’t mind driving all the way down here and queuing to pay our respects.’ Undeterred by the crowds, her daughter Lynn Slater, 61, said: ‘It took us four hours to get here, we aren’t going to stop now.’ Visitor Angie Adriaanse, 65, from Wimbledon, told The Daily Mail: ‘I have never seen so many people.’ And one mum quipped: ‘I think the whole world has come today.’ Ray and Sue Smith, who travelled from Devizes, said it took them 30 minutes to get a good view. The couple said it was nice to see so many people take an interest, but Mr Smith, 68, said: ‘They are overwhelmed with crowds, they haven’t really planned how to cope.’ Millions of visitors have been to the installation including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Retired property developer Graham Barnes, 88, who travelled from Henley-on-Thames, said: ‘(The display) is staggering, very moving, and a wonderful way of commemorating the number killed in that war.’ And he said the crowd did not surprise him, adding: ‘We are a patriotic nation.’ Adela Everiss, 34, from Hillingdon, said she would be returning with her family early on Saturday to avoid the crowd, adding: ‘It is just too busy.’ Hayes man Alan Hammond, 82, said: ‘It is a bit chaotic.’ While his wife Jane, 81, added: ‘It is lovely, it really is, but you do have a job to see it.’ The millions of visitors to the installation include the Queen two weeks ago and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in August. Artist Mr Cummins, 37, yesterday revealed he had lost a finger making one of the poppies - which were sold for £25 each - when his hand was crushed by an industrial roller. The artwork – entitled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red - has been slowly filling the moat around the Tower since July with the help of 8,000 volunteers. It is expected to raise more than £11million for charity before it is taken down the day after Armistice Day on November 11, when the final poppy is planted.

In the context, Jan went to lunch without waiting for her friends. The question asks how her friends would feel in this situation. Now, I will go through the options to see which ones are incorrect. Option A: Individualistic and self-interested - This option describes Jan's behavior more than her friends' feelings. Hence, this is an incorrect answer. Option B: Left behind - This option correctly identifies the friends' feelings since Jan didn't wait for them. It's likely they'd feel left behind. Therefore, this is a correct answer. Option C: Independent and free - This option would be more applicable if her friends had chosen to go separate ways or had different plans. It doesn't describe their feelings accurately in this context. This is an incorrect answer. There are two incorrect answer options: A and C.

He really wanted to have them for his birthday. He sadly walked away and thought how to tell his mother about it. He knew she would give him anything he liked if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home at once, as he looked worried and his mother would notice  it. So he went to the park and sat on the grass. Then he saw a boy in a wheel chair   . He noticed that the boy moved the wheel with his hands. Tom looked at him carefully and was surprised to see the boy have no feet. He looked at his own feet. \\"It's much better to be without shoes than without feet, \\"he thought. There was no reason   for him to feel so sorry and sad.

They returned in 1999 after rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-building bombings that were blamed on the rebels . In 1999 , troops returned after rebel raids on a neighbouring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-house bombings in Russian cities that were blamed on the rebels . Choose your answer from: (A). no; (B). yes;","output":"(B). Yes, both sentences convey the same meaning, although with some slight differences in phrasing and structure. In both sentences, the central idea revolves around troops returning in 1999 due to two key events: rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region, and a series of deadly apartment bombings that were attributed to the rebels. The primary differences between the two sentences lie in the wording and the arrangement of the information presented, but the overall meaning remains consistent. Sentence 1: They returned in 1999 after rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-building bombings that were blamed on the rebels. Sentence 2: In 1999, troops returned after rebel raids on a neighbouring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-house bombings in Russian cities that were blamed on the rebels. Examining the similarities and differences in each element of the sentences will provide a clearer understanding of why their meanings are essentially the same: 1. Time of occurrence: Both sentences mention \\"1999\\" as the year in which the troops returned, establishing a common timeframe for the event. 2. Subject: Although Sentence 1 uses the pronoun \\"they,\\" it can be inferred from the context that it refers to the same subject as \\"troops\\" in Sentence 2. 3. Event 1: Both sentences describe \\"rebel raids on a neighboring/neighbouring Russian region.\\" The only difference here is the spelling of \\"neighboring/neighbouring,\\" which complies with the American/British spelling conventions, respectively. 4. Event 2: Both sentences mention \\"a series of deadly apartment-building/apartment-house bombings\\" being blamed on the rebels. The only difference in this part of the sentences is the slight variation in the naming of the location of the bombings - \\"apartment-building\\" versus \\"apartment-house\\". Additionally, Sentence 2 specifically mentions \\"in Russian cities,\\" but this information can also be inferred from Sentence 1 based on the context, considering that the bombings were blamed on the rebels who carried out raids on a Russian region. In conclusion, while there are some small variations in wording and structure, the overall meaning of the two sentences is the same, as both focus on troops returning in 1999 due to two main events: rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment bombings blamed on the rebels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Mary and Ann met after a long time. Mary was 70 and she was Ann's aunt. She had a number of health problems. Ann was 52 and quite healthy.  and a hint : Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Please answer this question : Which woman freed up more time for her hobbies? A:","output":"Mary Step 1: Identify the age of each person. Mary is 70 years old and Ann is 52 years old. Step 2: Determine when old age begins according to the hint. Old age begins in the mid-60s. Step 3: Compare each person's age to the beginning of old age. Mary is 70, which is past the mid-60s, so she is in her old age. Ann is 52, which is not yet in the mid-60s, so she is not in her old age yet. Step 4: Consider the information in the hint about old age and retirement. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies and other interests. Step 5: Determine which woman has freed up more time for hobbies based on their age and retirement status. Since Mary is over 65 and in her old age, it is more likely that she has retired, freeing up more time for hobbies and other interests than Ann, who is not yet in her old age.

Mr Temer's lawyers intend to file a lawsuit against Mr Batista on Monday. Mr Batista last month released a secret recording incriminating the president, a move that caused political uproar and led to calls for Mr Temer to step down.

He said that the terms of the deal made the billionaire \\"Brazil's most successful criminal ever\\". Mr Temer added that he would take \\"all appropriate actions\\" against Mr Batista. Under the plea bargain, Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley admitted to bribing almost 1,900 politicians in recent years. They were being investigated for their role in two corruption scandals. Joesley Batista gave prosecutors an audio tape - leaked to the press - where Mr Temer appears to condone bribing a witness. In it, Mr Temer appears to discuss making hush-money payments to silence politician Eduardo Cunha, who is currently in prison. Mr Temer has said the recording is genuine and was taken from a meeting in March but denies any wrongdoing. \\"I never authorised any payments for someone to be silent,\\" he said in a televised address. \\"I did not buy anyone's silence.

They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces.

He made maps of the coastlines of Australia and New Zealand. James Cook was born in England in 1728. His parents were poor farm workers. When James was 18, he found a job on a coastal ship. He worked on the ship until he was 27 years old, and then he joined the navy. He fought in Canada in a war against France, and he mapped some of the eastern coasts of Canada. In 1768, King George made him Captain  of a ship and sent him to the Pacific. He was gone for nearly three years. When he returned, he was regarded as a national hero. He started his third journey in 1776. On this trip he visited Hawaii. He was the first European to set foot on this beautiful island. Then he mapped the western coast of North America.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur. The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Seeds germinate in the crevices of the rock. Justification: In order for the natural process of weathering and erosion to occur, plant life must first establish itself in the rocky environment. This step-by-step process will look like this: 1. Seeds germinate in the crevices of the rock: Plant seeds find their way into small cracks and crevices within the rock surface. These seeds will grow into plant life, which initiates the process of breaking apart the rocks. 2. The plant roots begin to grow: As the plants continue to grow, their roots will start to expand and push against the rock. This puts pressure on the rock, causing it to break apart. 3. Break apart the rock: The expanding plant roots will crack and break apart the rock, causing fragmentation and exposing more of the rock's surface area. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Some plants produce organic acids, such as oxalic or citric acid, which can dissolve and break down the chemical bonds within the rock. This helps to weaken the rock and aids in the overall process of rock breakdown. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As the roots continue to grow and the rock is dissolved by plant acids, the rock will become weaker and more susceptible to breaking into smaller pieces. 6. Erosion starts to occur: Once the rock has been broken down into smaller pieces, natural forces such as wind, water, or even additional plant growth will move and disperse these rock fragments. This is the beginning of the erosion process."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about earl smith -lrb- 1910s outfielder -rrb-  can be gathered from the following bio?

He hasn't published a new book in years, even though his first four novels were well regarded in their time.A young, attractive grad student named Heather is writing her graduate thesis on him. She convinces him to take precious time away from his writing (which takes a few meetings of persuasion) to let her interview him. Heather is inspired by his writing and clearly takes a romantic interest in him.In addition, Leonard's daughter is grappling with starting a family without a husband while she falls in love again with a former boyfriend who does not want to have children.After Leonard warms to Heather over interviews about his writing, she becomes more flirtatious with him, even inviting him to lie down with her in his bed. She nods off to sleep, but the next morning they clearly have an unexpected comfort with each other.Heather hears from an editor that Leonard has not been entirely honest about the demise of his marriage, so she confronts him further about his personal life. He becomes upset about her discontent, but invites her to spend the night, and they share a passionate kiss.Thereafter, when Heather presents her first draft of the thesis to Leonard, he gives her the key to his apartment and invites her to visit whenever she likes. Suddenly she cools to his affections, which is more evident after she recoils when he kisses her.Leonard reads the thesis and gives her a thorough critique, which she appreciates despite the fact that he disagrees with much of what she has written. Soon thereafter, Leonard suffers a stroke, and Heather helps him to the hospital.After a month of recovery, Leonard seems happy to have Heather visit him again, yet when he reaches to touch her face he suddenly slaps her. Heather is overcome with emotion, seeming to know that she has done something wrong but does not deserve his condemnation.Leonard's daughter agrees to let her boyfriend help him to a doctor's visit, and on the walk back Leonard becomes sick...

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"No, the questions \\"What is the business of a business?\\" and \\"What is a business?\\" do not hold the same meaning. They intersect in a broad scope but examine distinctive aspects of the business concept. Let's start with the question, \\"What is a business?\\" A business can be understood as an organization or entity involved in commercial, industrial, or professional activities. These activities are usually aimed at generating income through the production of goods, the provision of services, or the selling of goods or services produced by others. Businesses can be for-profit entities or non-profit organizations. They are characterized by the risk and initiative taken by investors to earn profits in the economic marketplace. They can exist in many forms, from sole proprietorships to multinational corporations. The core components that characterize a business apart from its organizational structure include a business model, business process, and business strategy. The business model describes how the company generates its revenue, the business process details its day-to-day operations, and the business strategy outlines its approach to achieving its objectives and goals in the face of competition and market trends. Now, let's move to the question, \\"What is the business of a business?\\"  This question is often used metaphorically to mean, what is the core function or purpose of a business. It generally pertains to the specific niche or area that a business operates in or the kind of product or service it offers. The \\"business of a business\\" could refer to what distinguishes it from other businesses. For example, if the business is a bakery, the \\"business of the business\\" would be baked goods. In a broader, philosophical context, the phrase can be traced back to the American economist Milton Friedman's statement in the '70s that \\"The business of business is business\\" which suggests that a business's primary responsibility is towards its shareholders, and its main function is to generate profits. So, the latter question delves into the specific sector, product line, or service niche that a business operates in and possibly its philosophy or operational approach, while the former is concerned about defining what a business is, in general. Although they both touch on the subject of business, they are fundamentally asking about different aspects of it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, the two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but they present the information slightly differently. Both sentences discuss fiduciary duties of directors in Australia under general law. Let's break down each sentence: 1. \\"Directors have Fiduciary Duties under general law in Australia.\\" In this sentence, it is emphasized that directors have fiduciary duties, and these duties are highlighted by capitalizing \\"Fiduciary Duties\\". The sentence then clarifies that these duties apply under general law in the context of Australia. The focus here is primarily on 'fiduciary duties' and then specifies where these duties apply. 2. \\"Directors have fiduciary duties in Australia under general law.\\" This sentence places more focus on the context – in this case, Australia. It emphasizes that directors have fiduciary duties, which are regulated by the general law. The structure of this sentence puts more emphasis on Australia, highlighting the jurisdiction where these duties apply under general law. In summary, both sentences convey the message that directors in Australia have fiduciary duties under general law. The difference is merely in the sentence structure and emphasis.

His father's identity is currently unknown. Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather than his father was Merneptah. If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah.   - A sarcophagus (plural, sarcophagi) is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word \\"sarcophagus\\" comes from the Greek \\"sarx\\" meaning \\"flesh\\", and \\"phagein\\" meaning \\"to eat\\", hence \\"sarcophagus\\" means \\"flesh-eating\\"; from the phrase \\"lithos sarkophagos\\". Since \\"lithos\\" is Greek for \\"stone\\", \\"lithos sarcophagos\\" means, \\"flesh-eating stone\\". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to decompose the flesh of corpses trapped within it.  - Not to be confused with Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses II , and Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses III. The Egyptian prince Amenherkhepshef was the son of Ramesses VI and Queen Nubkhesbed . He lived in the Twentieth dynasty and was buried in the reused sarcophagus of Twosret , in the reused tomb of Chancellor Bay , KV13 , in the Valley of the Kings , on the west bank of the Nile , in Thebes , Egypt .  - Nubkhesbed (Gold and Lapis lazuli) was an ancient Egyptian queen of the 20th dynasty. She was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses VI and mother of Pharaoh Ramesses VII, Princess Iset (God's Wife of Amun) and Princes Amenherkhepshef and Panebenkemyt.  - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO).  - Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt who reigned from 1145 to 1137 BC and a son of Ramesses III by Iset Ta-Hemdjert. His royal tomb, KV9, is located near Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings.  - Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis Ta-Hemdjert, simply called Isis in her tomb, was an Ancient Egyptian queen of the twentieth dynasty; the Great Royal Wife of Ramesses III and the Royal Mother of Ramesses VI.  - Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun Ramesses VII (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the sixth pharaoh of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. He reigned from about 1136 to 1129 BC and was the son of Ramesses VI. Other dates for his reign are 1138-1131 BC. The Turin Accounting Papyrus 1907+1908 is dated to Year 7 III Shemu day 26 of his reign and has been reconstructed to show that 11 full years passed from Year 5 of Ramesses VI to Year 7 of his reign.  - Tomb KV13, located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, was cut and decorated for the burial of the noble Bay of the Nineteenth Dynasty. An ostraca published in the French Egyptological journal BIFAO in 2000 records that Chancellor Bay was executed by pharaoh Siptah. Consequently, Bay was never buried in his tomb.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The son of Kevin and Lynne, Carey was one of five children who grew up in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. His mother and father separated when Carey was aged six, with his mother taking four of the children to Adelaide, living in a homeless shelter. According to Carey's autobiography, his father was a violent man who had spent time at Mannus Correctional Centre and was troubled by alcoholism. A few months later, Kevin Carey retrieved the children from his estranged wife and they returned to Wagga Wagga. For some time, it was unclear whether Carey would return to AFL football, but after the end of the 2002 season and a 12-month absence from football, Carey was signed by the Adelaide Crows where he played for the next two seasons.  Age and injury plagued Carey in 2003 and prevented him from dominating as he once did. He did manage to earn a top ten finish in the club best and fairest and kicked the second most goals of any Crow for the year, despite missing eight games. The 2003 season was most memorable for Carey's fiery encounters with his former North Melbourne teammates Glenn Archer and Anthony Stevens in round 6. On that day he kicked four goals, including one of the goals of the year. Carey's best performance for 2003 once again came in the finals, an elimination final against West Coast, when he had the most kicks and marks afield and became the 14th player to kick 700 career goals in AFL/VFL history.  Carey played the first 11 games in 2004, after which he had taken the most contested marks at Adelaide, was 11 goals clear in the Crows' goal kicking and was coming second in the club best and fairest. Carey's best performance in the Adelaide colours came a week before his 33rd birthday, in round 8 of the 2004 season. He took 9 marks, had 17 disposals and kicked 6 goals, out of a team total of 12, in a heavy loss to Essendon. Two weeks later, Carey's fourth goal against Hawthorn was one of the goals of the year. Taking a contested mark on the wing, Carey played on, having three bounces and shrugging off a tackle as he ran inside the forward 50. He gave off a handball to teammate Tyson Edwards, who in turn gave the ball back to Carey deep in the forward pocket. Carey's left foot snap for goal was a highlight in a big win for the Crows. In round 12, Carey left the field early in the second quarter and was later forced to retire with a disc-related neck injury, marking the end of a career that spanned 16 seasons and 272 games and included 727 goals. Why did Carey leave the crows after a short time?","output":"Carey left the Adelaide Crows after a relatively short time due to a combination of factors, including age, injuries, and personal issues.  1. Age: Carey was already in his 30s when he joined the Adelaide Crows in 2003. He played for two seasons, and by the time he retired in 2004, he was 33 years old. At this age, many professional players begin to experience a decline in their performance, which could have contributed to his decision to leave the Crows. 2. Injuries: During his time with the Adelaide Crows, Carey struggled with injuries that prevented him from dominating the game like he had done in the past. In the 2003 season, missing eight games due to injuries significantly impacted his performance. In 2004, he was forced to retire mid-season due to a disc-related neck injury, having only played 11 games that season. Being prone to injuries might have accelerated his decision to end his career with the Crows. 3. Personal issues: Carey had a turbulent personal life, with various incidents impacting his career and public image. His struggles with relationships and personal issues, such as his affair with the wife of his then-best friend and teammate Anthony Stevens, had lasting effects on his career. These off-field issues could have also played a role in his decision to leave the Crows after a short time. In summary, Carey's departure from the Adelaide Crows was the result of a combination of age, ongoing injuries, and personal issues that culminated in his retirement in 2004, effectively ending a career that spanned 16 seasons, 272 games, and included 727 goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There's a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard O'Sullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne (playing a sheik). There's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore). Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there's a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school roué). The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl (future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that \\"Chinese birds are inscrutable, ain't they?!\\" The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. The end is striking, as Mayne's sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about. Stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks.","output":"The sentiment of this text would be considered 1).

During these seasons, the show drew on footage and elements from the Super Sentai series Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger, Gosei Sentai Dairanger, and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger. The Pink Ranger's costume from Zyuranger was used throughout those seasons alongside other Zyuranger costumes for the main Rangers. Amy Jo Johnson decided to leave the show in the middle of the third season. As a result, her character, Kimberly, decided to pursue a career in gymnastics and moved to Florida. She then passed on her Pink Power Ranger powers to Katherine Hillard, played by Catherine Sutherland. This marked the transition to a new Pink Power Ranger, although the original costume was still used.

One key to making your feelings clear is to realize that you most often can shorten them in a few words: hurt, glad, confused, excited, angry, and so on. In the same way, with a little thought you can probably describe very briefly any reasons you have for feeling a certain way. In addition to avoiding too long expressions, a second way to prevent confusion is to avoid  _ your feelings by saying \\"I'm a little unhappy\\" or \\"I'm pretty excited\\". Of course, not all feelings are strong ones. We do feel degrees of sadness and joy, for example, but some communicators have a tendency to downplay almost every feeling. Do you? A third danger to avoid is expressing feelings in an indirect or coded manner. This happened most often when the sender is uncomfortable about showing his or her feeling in question. Some codes are verbal ones, as when the sender hints more or less subtly at the message. For example, an indirect way to say \\"I'm feeling lonely\\" might be \\"I guess there isn't much happening this weekend, so if you're not busy, why don't you drop by?\\" Such a message is so indirect that chances are small that your real feeling will be recognized. For this reason, people who send coded messages stand less of a chance of having their feeling understood and their need met. Finally, you can express yourself clearly by making sure that both you and your partner understand that your feeling is centered in a specific set of environments rather than being indicative of the whole relationship.

Boston Tea Party The Indemnity Act of 1767, which gave the East India Company a refund of the duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies, expired in 1772. Parliament passed a new act in 1772 that reduced this refund, effectively leaving a 10% duty on tea imported into Britain. The act also restored the tea taxes within Britain that had been repealed in 1767, and left in place the three pence Townshend duty in the colonies. With this new tax burden driving up the price of British tea, sales plummeted. The company continued to import tea into Great Britain, however, amassing a huge surplus of product that no one would buy. For these and other reasons, by late 1772 the East India Company, one of Britain's most important commercial institutions, was in a serious financial crisis. The severe famine in Bengal from 1769 to 1773 had drastically reduced the revenue of the East India Company from India bringing the Company to the verge of bankruptcy and the Tea Act of 1773 was enacted to help the East India Company. Available choices: [i] no. [ii] yes. Is this statement correct \\"did the tea act increase the price of tea\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"did the tea act increase the price of tea\\" is not correct. The Tea Act of 1773 actually helped the East India Company by allowing them to sell their tea directly to the American colonies, without having to pay taxes in Britain. This made the tea less expensive for the colonists. However, the colonists were upset because they still had to pay the Townshend duty of three pence when they bought the tea, and they felt this was unfair taxation.

You can learn exercises to improve the strength and flexibility in your injured foot and help prevent further injury. Start with a few minutes of light exercise, such as walking or riding a stationary bike. This will loosen your muscles and get blood flowing. Stretching exercises are a key step to restoring flexibility and range of motion. Following your doctor or therapist's recommended exercises, stretch the muscles and tendons in the injured foot. If you feel any pain during stretching, consult your doctor. A good example of a stretch is the towel stretch. Sitting on the floor with one leg straightened, loop a towel around the ball of your foot. Hold on to the ends of the towel and pull the top of your foot towards you. You should feel the stretch in your calf and down into the heel. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and then rest for 30 seconds. Repeat the exercise 3 times. When done properly, strength exercises should help return the strength and endurance required for everyday activities to the injured foot. If you experience any pain during these exercises, consult your physical therapist or doctor. An example of a strength exercise is the marble pickup. Sit in a chair with both feet flat on the ground and put 20 marbles on the ground in front of you. Place a bowl near the marbles. Pick up the marbles one by one with your injured foot and place them into the bowl. You should feel the exercise on the top of your foot. It is important to keep up with your physical therapy to help you return to daily activities and reduce your chances of re-injury.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is there such thing as chairs for people with scoliosis? How is scoliosis and hip pain treated? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"1. Is there such a thing as chairs for people with scoliosis? Yes, there are chairs specifically designed for individuals with scoliosis and other spinal conditions. These ergonomic chairs are created with the intent to provide maximum support and comfort to the spine, particularly in the lumbar region, which is the area most affected by scoliosis. These chairs have specific features tailored to meet the needs of people with spinal curvature: a. Adjustable backrest: Chairs for scoliosis have adjustable backrests that can be inclined and reclined as per the individual's comfort. This helps maintain the natural curve of the spine and reduces pressure on the lumbar vertebrae. b. Lumbar support: Ergonomically designed chairs for scoliosis provide excellent lumbar support. They have cushions or contouring in the lumbar region to support the lower back, reducing strain on the muscles and ligaments. c. Seat depth and width: Chairs for people with scoliosis offer adjustable seat depth and width to ensure proper weight distribution, relieve pressure points, and prevent the development of additional spinal issues. d. Armrests: Adjustable and padded armrests in ergonomic chairs help maintain correct shoulder and arm positioning, reducing neck and upper back strain. e. Height adjustment: Chairs designed for scoliosis sufferers have adjustable seat heights, allowing individuals to maintain a healthy sitting posture and keep their feet flat on the ground. It is essential for individuals with scoliosis to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a physical therapist, orthopedic specialist, or chiropractor, to ensure proper selection and use of a chair to address their specific needs. 2. How is scoliosis and hip pain treated? Scoliosis and hip pain treatment involves a combination of different approaches, including conservative, non-surgical, and surgical methods. The treatment choice depends on factors such as the severity of the spinal curvature, the progression of the curve, and the age and overall health of the patient. Some of the approaches to treat scoliosis and hip pain include: a. Observation: For mild spinal curvature, observation alone may suffice. Regular check-ups would be required to ensure that the curve does not progress. b. Bracing: For patients who are still growing and have moderate spinal curves, wearing a brace prescribed by a healthcare professional may help prevent further curve progression. c. Physical therapy: Physical therapy and exercise programs designed for scoliosis may help improve posture, muscle strength, flexibility, and pain management. Core-strengthening exercises and stretching can be particularly beneficial. d. Pain management: Over-the-counter pain relievers (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) and prescription medications may be prescribed for pain relief. In some cases, injections like epidural steroids or nerve blocks may also be administered. e. Chiropractic care: Chiropractic adjustments or spinal manipulations could offer some relief and improve range of motion for some patients with scoliosis and hip pain. f. Alternative therapies: Some scoliosis patients might find relief through alternative therapies such as massage, acupuncture, or yoga. g. Surgery: In cases of severe spinal curvature or when other treatments have proven ineffective, surgery might be recommended. Spinal fusion surgery aims to stabilize the spine and prevent further curve progression. These treatment methods aim to manage symptoms, slow or halt the progression of the spinal curve, and improve overall quality of life. A multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including spinal specialists, physical therapists, and pain management specialists, typically collaborates to design the most effective treatment plan for each patient. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question specifically asks about the availability of chairs designed for individuals with scoliosis, while the second question focuses on the treatment approaches for scoliosis and hip pain. These two questions cover different aspects of managing and living with scoliosis and are independently significant."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in English, and your task is to translate it into Persian.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Prior to Planck's work, it had been assumed that the energy of a body could take on any value whatsoever – that it was a continuous variable. The Rayleigh–Jeans law makes close predictions for a narrow range of values at one limit of temperatures, but the results diverge more and more strongly as temperatures increase. To make Planck's law, which correctly predicts blackbody emissions, it was necessary to multiply the classical expression by a complex factor that involves h in both the numerator and the denominator. The influence of h in this complex factor would not disappear if it were set to zero or to any other value. Making an equation out of Planck's law that would reproduce the Rayleigh–Jeans law could not be done by changing the values of h, of the Boltzmann constant, or of any other constant or variable in the equation. In this case the picture given by classical physics is not duplicated by a range of results in the quantum picture. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What does Planck's law correctly predict?","output":"Alright, imagine you're at a campfire and you see the fire giving off light and heat. That light and heat are like blackbody emissions. Now, before Planck, scientists tried to understand this, but their ideas didn't work right for all the different temperatures.  Then, a smart scientist named Planck came up with a new idea, called Planck's law. Planck's law helps us understand how much light and heat come out from something hot, like the fire, at every color and temperature. And it works really well because it's based on tiny energy packets. So, to answer your question, Planck's law correctly predicts the amount of light and heat given off by hot things at different temperatures and colors."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

This translation might not provide the long and detailed answer you're looking for, so let me give you a detailed insight into the potential causes and considerations of this \\"malaise\\" in the Arab world, while presenting the German translations for each point. 1. Political instability (Politische Instabilität): The Arab world has been experiencing numerous political conflicts and uprisings, such as the Arab Spring, which raised hopes but also brought chaos and violence to many countries in the region. 2. Economic challenges (Wirtschaftliche Herausforderungen): Many Arab nations have economies that are reliant on oil production, and the fluctuations in oil prices have resulted in financial instability and slowed-down economic progress. 3. Social inequality (Soziale Ungleichheit): The Arab world is marked by high levels of income inequality and disparities in access to essential services like healthcare and education. This often results in political and social tensions. 4. Lack of personal freedom and civil liberties (Mangel an persönlicher Freiheit und bürgerlichen Freiheiten): Many Arab countries are led by autocratic or authoritarian governments, which often infringe on the rights and freedoms of their citizens. 5. Religious and cultural tensions (Religiöse und kulturelle Spannungen): The Arab world is marked by sectarian divisions, often manifested in conflicts between Sunni and Shia Muslims. This adds another layer of complexity to the already challenging political landscape. 6. Refugee crises (Flüchtlingskrisen): The conflicts in the Arab world have led to large-scale refugee crises, with many people fleeing from war-torn countries like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. This has put immense pressure on neighboring countries and the international community. 7. Terrorism and extremism (Terrorismus und Extremismus): Lastly, the Arab world has been facing the challenges of terrorism and extremism, often caused by the political and social circumstances mentioned above. This not only results in violence and instability but also shapes international perceptions and relations. By examining these points in detail, it is clear that the \\"malaise\\" in the Arab world cannot be attributed to a single factor.

Strengthen personal security: Lee should enhance his security measures, like being cautious about sharing personal information online, updating privacy settings on social media, changing locks, installing security cameras, or using a personal alarm system. Additionally, he should be extra cautious when he's out in public places and inform friends, family, and coworkers about the situation. 5. Engage a support network: Dealing with the emotional stress and psychological effects of being stalked can be challenging. Lee should reach out to friends, family, or a counselor for emotional support and guidance. There are also victim support services, such as hotlines and counseling centers, that can provide assistance. 6. Develop a safety plan: Lee should create a safety plan that outlines the steps to take in case the stalker escalates their behavior or becomes an imminent threat. This may include escape routes, a designated safe place to go to, and emergency contact numbers. 7. Stay informed about legal options: It's crucial for Lee to be knowledgeable about the stalking laws and victim protection measures available in his jurisdiction. This knowledge can help Lee understand his rights and navigate any legal processes related to the stalking incidents. In conclusion, merely ignoring the threats is not an appropriate response for Lee to ensure his safety and hold the stalker accountable. Instead, he should be proactive in taking the necessary steps to protect himself and seek legal assistance."},{"instruction":"Question: What is peculiar about the African girl?

Such a thing has just happened in a school in the UK. Nottingham East Academy, a school in the UK, has established a non-homework policy   recently. The school plans to give an extra lesson and provide more activities for students to do at school. So the students no longer need to do homework after class. When the school announced this policy , students , parents and teachers were all shocked. The school , Nottingham East Academy , is the country's largest school. It has a total of 3,570 students. Barry Day, the president of the school, thinks that homework is unnecessary and can easily cause argument both at home and at school. He once told the local newspaper ,\\" People give homework for children to do simply because they think it should be given.

Would \\"After a decade of post-revolution economic problems and living-standards decline, extensive reforms fostered economic recovery.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer to describe a particular aspect of Romania's history and economic situation. However, if you'd like to provide a more comprehensive response, you could expand on various dimensions such as geography, culture, and current state. Here's a more detailed answer: Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. It has a diverse landscape that includes the Carpathian Mountains, the Black Sea coastline, and the Danube Delta. Romania is known for its rich history, medieval castles (such as the famous Bran Castle, associated with the legend of Dracula), and vibrant cultural life, which combines Latin, Slavic, and Hungarian influences. After the 1989 revolution that ended communist rule, Romania faced a difficult period of economic decline, hyperinflation, and a drop in living standards, as mentioned in your original statement. However, through extensive reforms and support from international organizations, the country managed to recover and made significant progress during the first decade of the 21st century. In 2007, Romania joined the European Union, which further facilitated its economic growth and development. Romania's current economy is service and industry-based, with agriculture also playing an important role. It has a diverse culture, with traditions such as folk dance and music, wooden carving, and pottery being well-preserved. The official language is Romanian, a Romance language closely related to Italian, French, and Spanish. The majority of the population is Christian Orthodox, with small percentages of Catholics, Protestants, and other religious groups. In conclusion, to describe Romania comprehensively, it would be beneficial to provide information about its geography, history, economy, culture, and people, besides only focusing on a specific period of economic reforms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If Roy Hodgson had said he wanted to give Adam Lallana the chance to build on his eye-catching efforts against San Marino, we would have been none the wiser about Raheem Sterling’s fatigue. Every word the England manager says is scrutinised. I can see where Hodgson was coming from but an issue has been created that both men could have done without. Had Hodgson explained he wanted to use Sterling for an impact – which he had, by winning the decisive free-kick against Estonia – there would be no quarrel. Now, though, Sterling is in the spotlight and contending with questions such as ‘how can a 19-year-old be tired?’ but those who believe he has made a mistake saying he wasn’t in the right condition to play for England are not looking at the full picture. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson reveal Raheem Sterling was too tired to start. England's Raheem Sterling looks quite relaxed on the substitutes' bench during the first half against Estonia. Jordan Henderson makes way for Sterling in the 64th minute in Tallinn as England went on to beat Estonia 1-0. Sterling told England manager Roy Hodgson that he was not 100 per cent and that he was too tired to start. Of the players England used against Estonia, only Gary Cahill has played more minutes this season than Raheem Sterling. 1164 - Gary Cahill. 1079 - Raheem Sterling. 1064 - Jack Wilshere. 1035 - Jordan Henderson. 995 - Calum Chambers. 990 - Joe Hart. 990 - Leighton Baines. 919 - Phil Jagielka. 836 - Danny Welbeck. 758 - Wayne Rooney. 741 - Fabian Delph. 538 - Adam Lallana. It doesn’t matter whether you are 19 or 29, if you play nine games in a month, like Raheem did in September, it will leave a mark on you physically. So, in some respects, he has been brave to confront the issue and explain his concerns to Hodgson. Would I have ever done it? No. I feared if I missed a game, someone would come in and take my place. I also never wanted to give managers an excuse to leave me out, so there were times when I played in games I shouldn’t have done. Was it the right thing to do? No. Injuries are what I would mask but I remember a game at Bolton in September 2006 when I was shattered, having been to the World Cup in Germany. We lost 2-0, one of the goals came from a cross into the box. I tried to jump for a header but had nothing in my legs. Had I been right, I know I would have got my head to the ball first. As a central defender, you can find a way of getting through a game, you don’t have to operate at the rapier pace that Raheem moves with. His game is based around high intensity sprinting and he needs sharpness to go past opponents, with or without the ball. The England substitutes watch on as 19-year-old Sterling (second right) was rested from the starting line-up. 32 - Jagielka, Lambert. 29 - Baines. 28 - Rooney, Cahill. 27 - Hart. 26 - Lallana. 24 - Henderson, Delph. 23 - Welbeck. 22 - Wilshere. 21 - Oxlade-Chamberlain. 19 - Chambers, Sterling. We want Raheem to thrill us, to be an exciting figure for many years to come. We don’t want him to get to 25 and his best form be a thing of the past. If he is managed properly now and looks after himself, he won’t suffer burn out like another former Liverpool and England teenage prodigy. A few weeks ago, I spent some time with Sir Alex Ferguson. During our conversation, he remembered how, in 1997, Michael Owen and I had played at the Under-20 World Cup in Malaysia. Michael came back and went straight into Liverpool’s first team at the start of the season. By contrast, the United players in that England squad – Ronnie Wallwork and John Curtis – were both given a month off to recover but Michael was on a rapid upward curve and at the end of that campaign, he set the World Cup finals in France alight. Michael wanted to play in every game for club and country but, in October 1998, Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans – in their brief reign as Liverpool’s joint managers – decided to rest him for a UEFA Cup game against Valencia. Michael wasn’t happy and said in an interview “I’ll rest when I’m 40”. Former  Liverpool and Englad striker Michael Owen wanted to play every game for club and country. Sterling told Hodgson he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on Saturday evening. VIDEO Sterling defends England tiredness. That comment went down well with supporters and ex-players but was he right? No. Michael played far too much for Liverpool and England too early, never getting a summer off to recharge physically or mentally. Was it a coincidence that he suffered a serious hamstring injury in April 1999? Raheem is becoming like Michael, with stature and his pace and his importance to club and country at such an early stage of his career but there have been signs over the last few weeks that such a punishing spell is beginning to catch up with him. He may have only played two games at the World Cup but Sterling was training every day in stifling conditions, having just come off a season in which he had been a key figure in Liverpool’s title charge. After three weeks off, he then went to the USA for Liverpool’s pre-season tour. Don’t underestimate what an impact that schedule will have had on him, physically and mentally. Figures back that up. Between May 30, 2013 and October 13, 2013, Raheem had played 615 minutes of football. In the same period this year, that figure had shot up to 1682 minutes. Sterling may have only started two games at the 2014 World Cup but the England winger was in training daily. Sterling came on in the 64th minute but still received criticism from those on Twitter for his decision. Sterling, warming up during the first half, complained of feeling tired in training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Hodgson and Brendan Rodgers will talk about how to handle him going forward but, naturally, they are going to want to use him when they can as he is a match-winner. That’s why he played against Middlesbrough in the League Cup. Liverpool’s poor start in the league meant Rodgers needed his quality. Liverpool could not have afforded to be on the end of a giant-killing that night, so the plan would have been to get the game won and get Sterling off early. As it was, things never went to plan and he subjected to 120 minutes. Since then, his performances have been notably lacking sparkle. Sterling retweeted those criticising him online before writing: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human' His importance at Anfield is vital and that is why, at the end of last season, Rodgers called him “the best young player in Europe”. He was dazzling in that spell but that was a spell when Liverpool were only playing one game a week. This is the first time he has played consistently in games of this pressure and will take some adjustment. But If he is become one of the top players in the world, he will ultimately have to get used to an unrelenting schedule. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Defending has changed significantly in FIFA 12, and you are penalized much more for being overly-aggressive with your tackles. Use the new defensive situation to your advantage by getting in close and contesting the ball instead of going for the tackle. At the same time, you don't want to be too patient. Not putting enough pressure your opponent will allow them to move down the field easier, putting you on your heels. If you can spare a player without leaving another opponent too open, call in a second defender to help put the pressure on. You can use this to shut down pass lanes or force the defender to lose possession of the ball. Be careful when doing this, as it often leaves an opponent open for a pass. Make sure you are aware of where the opposing players are in the field and shut down any passing lanes. One of the most useful defensive formations in the game is 5-3-2, as it provides good coverage for your defenders. Another solid choice is the 5-2-2-1 formation as it packs the midfield with defenders. In FIFA 12, the key to successfully defending is by anticipating where the opponent is going to pass, and then shutting that pass down. This will be difficult at first, but after some time you'll start to be able to tell which direction a player is going to to based on their direction and speed.

Article: When we interviewed what the life was like more than 70 years ago, many old soldiers were full of tears in their eyes. They told us that they never forgot those days when they were in the army, during which they lived hard lives but spared no effort to fight against the enemies. Now in the year 2015 comes the first great parade  in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary  of the victory of the anti-fascist   war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion. In preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice. When a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland. The reporter asked, \\"The training is so hard but why does nobody give up?\\" \\"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor. I must try my best.\\" One of the participants  answered. In fact, everyone takes pride in taking part in this big parade because they want to show the spirit of Chinese army, the power of Chinese army, as well as the determination of keeping the world in peace. From the soldiers, we learned the power of dreams. If one has a dream, he will get over any difficulties that get in the way to make the dream come true. Question: Which of the following is True? Answer: A:","output":"The parade was to honour the 70th anniversary of the end of the anti-fascist war. B: The parade was not considered a great honour by the soldiers participating. C: The soldiers didn't have to train extensively for the parade. D: The parade was not attended by any international guests. Justification:  Looking at option A: The text specifies \\"September 3rd is the 70th anniversary of the victory of the anti-fascist war\\", which aligns with the content of this option, making it true.   Option B: The text directly contradicts this statement when one participant says, \\"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor.\\" Thus, this option is false. Option C: The text mentions that soldiers had to receive extremely strict training and they practiced for 10 hours a day, which contradicts this option. Therefore, this option is false. Option D: The text states \\"49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion\\" which contradicts this option. Thus, this option is also false. Therefore, based on the content of the provided article, the correct answer would be A: \\"The parade was to honour the 70th anniversary of the end of the anti-fascist war\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device The Clarets, who included Joey Barton for the first time since he re-joined the club, went close when Sam Vokes was put clear but saw his shot saved. The visitors had the better chances but keeper Nick Hope did well to tip a Jack Rodwell shot over the bar. And Burnley almost won it when James Tarkowski's header struck the post. Sunderland - 18th in the Premier League - will travel to Turf Moor for the replay on 17 or 18 January. Sunderland have averaged crowds of more than 40,000 in the league this season. Those that stayed away for this cup commitment did not miss a sudden injection of attacking flair. Black Cats' boss David Moyes will perhaps be less content with a replay than opposite number Sean Dyche, with his side unquestionably in a relegation scrap. No Premier League club has more players at the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Gabon but Moyes can draw some comfort from the fact his side are showing some signs of resilience. This stalemate followed a draw with high-flying Liverpool, and Sunderland have now avoided defeat in six of their last 11 games - form better than Burnley's. But a lack of creativity and guile is evident. Top-scorer Jermain Defoe barely saw sight of goal as those around him lacked inspiration. There were fleeting moments of promise, notably when Javier Manquillo broke through only for his pull-back to evade those in support. Dyche included Barton as one of six changes from Burnley's defeat at Manchester City. The midfielder, who could still face an FA ban for breaching betting rules, was solid as the usual away-day theme for the Clarets continued. Just three goals on the road this season has proven costly as they remain without a win away from Turf Moor in 2016-17. Andre Gray almost added to the haul early on but fired over and Tarkowski's powerful header in the second period was a fraction from earning the win. Dyche may be concerned about the lack of away-day firepower but he has the comfort of knowing only Tottenham and Chelsea have more home league wins in the campaign. Those home comforts could prove crucial as Burnley bid for a fourth round spot for just the second time in six seasons. Sunderland manager David Moyes: \\"A slog for everybody. It was a really poor game. Two teams probably not trying to go completely full out. It's disappointing we didn't get through but at least we are still in the hat. \\"I think with 10, 15 minutes to go, they were the better team and it looked as if they were going to score, so I think if you gave me it with 10, 15 to minutes to go, I might have said, 'Yes, I'll take it'.\\" Burnley manager Sean Dyche: \\"As the game wore on, we made three or four promising opportunities, but then two or three really golden chances and on another day I think we win the match. \\"A lot has been made of our away league form, but you can see that we want to take the game on and win games and that was evident today with the group.  I was really pleased with the mentality, particularly as the game wore on.\\" Match ends, Sunderland 0, Burnley 0. Second Half ends, Sunderland 0, Burnley 0. Attempt missed.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is pay used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? Pay a call. You'll pay for this!","output":"No, the term \\"pay\\" in these two sentences does not convey the same meaning. To better understand the context, let's analyze each sentence separately. 1. Pay a call: In this case, \\"pay\\" is used to indicate the act of making a visit – usually a formal or short visit – to someone's house, office, or other location. The term \\"pay a call\\" is often used to express the act of visiting someone to socialize, convey greetings, or fulfill a social obligation. The meaning of \\"pay\\" in this sentence is related to giving attention, time, or effort as a form of courtesy or acknowledgment towards the person being visited. 2. You'll pay for this! In this sentence, \\"pay\\" is used to imply punishment, revenge, or facing the consequences of certain actions. The speaker is making a threat, warning, or showing their disapproval towards someone's actions or behavior and vowing retribution in some way. Here, the meaning of \\"pay\\" is about facing negative consequences or suffering due to one's behavior. The implication is that the person being spoken to will be held responsible for their actions and will have to \\"pay the price,\\" in terms of potential damage, loss, or pain they may cause as a result. In summary, while \\"pay\\" is a common term used in both sentences, it should be noted that the context, as well as the intended meaning of the word, differs significantly between the two scenarios. In the first sentence, it denotes making a visit to someone, whereas in the second sentence, it conveys a threat of punishment or revenge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Accidental Deletion: This occurs when a user unintentionally removes a file or folder from their device, typically by using the \\"Delete\\" key or right-clicking and selecting \\"Delete.\\" This may result from not knowing the file's importance or mistakenly believing it to be a duplicate. 2. Permanent Deletion: In this situation, a user not only deletes a file or folder but also empties the Recycle Bin or Trash, making it more difficult to recover the lost data. This could occur when a user is trying to free up space on their device or believes that they no longer need the file. 3. Overwriting Files: This happens when a user saves a new file with the same name as an existing file, causing the original file to be replaced. Overwriting files can lead to the loss of earlier versions or critical data. 4. Malware or Virus Infection: Malicious software, such as viruses and malware, can cause files to be deleted, corrupted, or hidden. These programs can enter a user's device through downloads, email attachments, or unsafe websites. 5. Corrupt Files: A file can become corrupted due to various reasons, such as errors during transfer or storage, power outages, or issues with the file system. Corrupt files may become unreadable, inaccessible, or lost entirely. 6. Hard Disk Failure: A physical failure in the hard disk can lead to data loss. This can occur due to various reasons like wear and tear, exposure to heat or moisture, or manufacturing defects. 7. Formatting Errors: Accidentally formatting a storage device, such as a hard drive or USB stick, can result in the deletion of all data stored on the device. This can happen when a user mistakes the device for another one or believes that the formatting is necessary to rectify an error or issue. 8. System Crashes: A sudden system crash, power failure, or hardware malfunction can lead to unsaved data being lost. This situation is especially problematic if the device does not have an automatic backup or recovery feature in place. 9. Software Conflicts: Incompatibilities between programs, operating systems, or device drivers can cause files to be deleted or become inaccessible. These conflicts may arise due to an update or installation of new software. 10. Human Error: A user may unintentionally move, rename, or modify a file, subsequently causing it to be misplaced, overwritten, or damaged. This is a common scenario, especially in busy work environments with multiple users accessing shared files and folders.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), an expert chocolatier, drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), following the north wind. In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, \\"fifteen years after the War,\\" they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to eat the chocolate despite her condition. Having lost her husband, Caroline is overly protective of Luc and does not even want her son to play. Vianne also develops a friendship with a troubled woman, Josephine (Lena Olin), who is a victim of brutal beatings by her abusive husband Serge (Peter...","output":"In the movie Chocolat, Armande is played by Judi Dench."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges As the ice particles collide, they cause electrostatic charges to build up within the cloud. This process is known as charge separation. Step 3: The cloud becomes a thundercloud As the amount of electrostatic charges increases, the cloud transforms into a thundercloud, which is also known as a cumulonimbus cloud. Step 4: Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge The accumulation of electrostatic energy in the cloud results in the presence of a strong negative charge at the base of the thundercloud. Step 5: Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud Opposite charges attract, so the strong negative charge in the cloud attracts positive energy from the surrounding environment. Step 6: This positive energy gathers on the ground As a result of the attracted positive energy, an opposing positive charge begins to gather on the ground or objects on the ground (like trees, buildings, etc.) beneath the negatively charged base of the thundercloud. Final Step: Lightning occurs Once the electrical potential between the negative charge in the cloud and the positive charge on the ground reaches a critical threshold, a lightning discharge takes place.

Please answer the following question: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

Please answer the following question: This article: George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose two brothers died in 1823?, what is it ?

Add compost to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil..  (B). Add sugar to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil..","output":"To accomplish the goal of increasing the drainage of garden pots, the better option would be (A): Add compost to the soil to attract earthworms which create air holes in the soil. Below is a detailed explanation for both options: Option A: Add compost to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil 1. Compost enriches the soil: Compost serves as an organic matter that supplies essential nutrients for plants and improves soil fertility. When added to soil in garden pots, it ensures that the plants have a healthy growing environment. 2. Fosters microorganism development: Compost has the ability to increase the microbial population in the soil by providing necessary nutrients for their growth. In turn, these microorganisms help in breaking down nutrients into simpler forms that can be easily absorbed by the plant roots. 3. Attracts earthworms: Earthworms are naturally attracted to compost due its organic composition and the presence of microorganisms. Earthworms play a crucial role in the aeration of the soil as they create burrows and air holes, facilitating drainage. 4. Improves soil structure: The addition of compost to the soil improves soil structure by promoting aggregation of particles. This opens up pore spaces and allows water to drain and infiltrate more easily, which enhances the overall drainage capacity of the garden pots. Option B: Add sugar to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil 1. Sugar may attract earthworms to some extent: Earthworms are attracted to sugar as a source of food. However, the presence of earthworms in the garden pots does not solely rely on the addition of sugar. 2. Short-term impact: The addition of sugar to the soil may provide an initial boost of energy for earthworms and microorganisms. However, it is not a sustainable long-term solution, as it may cause an imbalance in the soil food web. 3. Potential problems: Adding sugar to the soil may create imbalances that can lead to the growth of harmful microbes, pests, and fungi. Moreover, excessively high sugar concentrations can result in osmotic stress and damage plant roots by drawing water out of them. 4. Limited effect on drainage: Even if sugar attracts earthworms that create air holes, it does little to improve the overall structure of the soil. Sugar does not directly contribute to soil aggregation, which is crucial in enhancing drainage capacity. In conclusion, it is more effective to add compost to the soil in garden pots to increase their drainage, as it not only attracts earthworms that create air holes but also enriches the soil, fosters microorganism development, and improves soil structure. On the other hand, adding sugar may temporarily attract earthworms but can lead to potential problems and has limited effects on drainage compared to compost."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer to the question about whether or not to validate the suggested answer \\"ANITA Mk VIII\\" as the first electronic handheld calculator, it is important to explore the history of electronic calculators and determine the accuracy of the given answer. The history of electronic calculators can be traced back to the early 1960s, with various models of mechanical and electronic devices being produced by different companies. They aimed to create a portable and convenient solution for individuals and businesses to perform calculations accurately and efficiently. The ANITA Mk VIII, manufactured by Bell Punch Company and marketed by their subsidiary Sumlock Comptometer, is often considered as the first electronic desktop calculator, rather than a handheld calculator. It was introduced in 1961 and used cold-cathode Nixie tubes to display the results. The ANITA Mk VIII was mainly designed for use on desktops due to its size and weight, making it less portable than handheld calculators that would come later. In 1967, Texas Instruments (TI) developed the Cal-Tech prototype, which was the first transistor-based handheld calculator. This prototype used integrated circuits developed by TI and a magnetic card reader for data input. However, it was not a commercially available product. The first commercially available electronic handheld calculator can be attributed to the Pocketronic, developed by Texas Instruments and released in 1970. The Pocketronic used a thermal printer for output and was a truly portable device compared to its desktop counterparts. It operated on battery power and was small enough to fit into a pocket or purse, weighing around 680 grams. Thus, considering the given information, the answer to the question should not be validated, as the ANITA Mk VIII is not the first electronic handheld calculator. Instead, the answer should be revised to the \\"Pocketronic\\" by Texas Instruments as the first commercially available electronic handheld calculator.

X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977, among the first wave of American punk. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D.J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical reception for their first four albums, the band was frustrated by its lack of wider mainstream success. Zoom had also stated that he would leave the band unless its next album was more successful. The band decided to change producers in search of a more accessible sound. Their fifth record, Ain't Love Grand!, was produced by pop metal producer Michael Wagener. It featured a drastic change in sound, especially in the polished and layered production, while the band's punk roots were little in evidence, replaced by a countrified version of hard rock. The change in production was intended to bring the band more chart success, but although it received more mainstream radio play than their earlier releases, it did not represent a commercial breakthrough. Zoom left the group shortly thereafter in 1986, the same year in which the feature-length documentary film, X: The Unheard Music, was released.  Zoom was initially replaced by Alvin, who had left the Blasters. The band then added a fifth member, guitarist Tony Gilkyson, formerly of the band Lone Justice. By the time the band released its sixth album, See How We Are, Alvin had already left the band, although he played on the record along with Gilkyson and wrote 4th of July for the band. Like Ain't Love Grand, the album's sound was far removed from the band's punk origins, yet featured a punchy, energetic, hard-rocking roots rock sound that in many ways represented a more natural progression from their earlier sound than the previous record had. After touring for the album, X released a live record of the tour, titled Live at the Whisky a Go-Go, and then went on an extended hiatus.  Back in 1984, X had released a cover version of \\"Wild Thing\\" as a non-album single. In 1989, the song was re-released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the hit film Major League. It later became a staple at sporting events, particularly baseball games, and was used by Japanese professional wrestler Atsushi Onita after he founded Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in 1989.

Answer based on context: Coming off an impressive home win over the Buccaneers, the Lions flew to Soldier Field for Round 2 of their NFC North duel with the Chicago Bears.  After a scoreless first quarter, Detroit jumped into the lead with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 26-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Lions increased its lead with RB Kevin Jones getting a 4-yard TD run, while Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears threatened Detroit's lead as QB Brian Griese completed a 20-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen for the only score of the period.  Fortuntaely, in the fourth quarter, the Lions held on to win as Hanson got a 20-yard field goal. Detroit's defense was a huge part of this victory, as they intercepted Griese four times, including three times in the endzone. With their first season-sweep over Chicago since 2004, the Lions improved to 5-2. As a result of their winless 2008 and 2-14 2009 seasons, this became the Lions' last win on the road until Week 15 of the 2010 season.

CHICAGO--A new study lends further evidence to a suspected link between abnormal breast growth in young boys--called prepubertal gynecomastia--and regular exposure to lavender or tea tree oil, by finding that key chemicals in these common plant-derived oils act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The study results will be presented Monday at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society's 100th annual meeting in Chicago.      Lavender and tea tree oil are among the so-called essential oils that have become popular in the United States as alternatives for medical treatment, personal hygiene and cleaning products, and aromatherapy. Various consumer products contain lavender and tea tree oil, including some soaps, lotions, shampoos, hair-styling products, cologne and laundry detergents.      \\"Our society deems essential oils as safe,\\" said study lead investigator J. Tyler Ramsey, a postbaccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of the National Institutes of Health. \\"However, they possess a diverse amount of chemicals and should be used with caution because some of these chemicals are potential endocrine disruptors.\\"      An endocrine-disrupting chemical is a chemical in the environment that interferes with hormones and their actions in the body.      Male gynecomastia occurring before puberty is relatively rare, but a growing amount of cases have been reported to coincide with topical exposure to lavender and tea tree oil, and the condition went away after the boys stopped using the oil-containing products, Ramsey said. Researchers at the NIEHS, including Kenneth Korach, Ph.D., a co-investigator for the new study, previously found laboratory evidence that lavender and tea tree oil have estrogenic (estrogen-like) properties and anti-androgenic (testosterone inhibiting-like) activities, meaning they compete or hinder the hormones that control male characteristics, which could affect puberty and growth.      Under Korach's direction, Ramsey and his NIEHS colleagues went a step further. From the hundreds of chemicals that comprise lavender and tea tree oil, they selected for analysis eight components that are common and mandated for inclusion in the oils. Four of the tested chemicals appear in both oils: eucalyptol, 4-terpineol, dipentene/limonene and alpha-terpineol. The others were in either oil: linalyl acetate, linalool, alpha-terpinene and gamma-terpinene. Using in vitro, or test tube, experiments, the researchers applied these chemicals to human cancer cells to measure changes of estrogen receptor- and androgen receptor-target genes and transcriptional activity.      All eight chemicals demonstrated varying estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic properties, with some showing high or little to no activity, the investigators reported. Ramsey said these changes were consistent with endogenous, or bodily, hormonal conditions that stimulate gynecomastia in prepubescent boys.      \\"Lavender oil and tea tree oil pose potential environmental health concerns and should be investigated further,\\" he said.      Of further concern, according to Ramsey, is that many of the chemicals they tested appear in at least 65 other essential oils. Essential oils are available without a prescription and are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Thus, the public should be aware of these findings and consider all evidence before deciding to use essential oils. The NIEHS Division of Intramural Research funded this study through its support of Korach.      The researchers will present their findings during a press conference at 10 a.m. Central on Saturday, March 17.

The Endocrine Society is the world's oldest and largest organization of scientists devoted to hormone research and physicians who care for people with hormone-related conditions. ||||| Young boys receiving regular exposure to essential oils such as lavender or tea tree oil could be at risk of a rare condition that makes their breast tissue swell abnormally, a new study suggests.      The findings, being presented this week, add further evidence that certain plant-derived oils contain chemicals capable of disrupting human hormones – a stark reminder that just because these extracts come from nature, they aren't necessarily good for us.      \\"Our society deems essential oils as safe,\\" says developmental biologist J. Tyler Ramsey from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).      \\"However, they possess a diverse amount of chemicals and should be used with caution because some of these chemicals are potential endocrine disruptors.\\"      Essential oils – meaning they contain the chemical 'essence' of plants, as opposed to being indispensable – are found in all sorts of consumer products, from soaps and lotions through to alternative medical treatments, aromatherapy oils, and cleaning products.      While they might be ubiquitous, there is concern in the research community that certain chemical components in these oils may be dangerous to human health, whether by being toxic, or by affecting how our bodies work.      NIEHS developmental biologist Kenneth Korach worked on a study that raised these fears a decade ago, finding that lavender and tea tree oil contain chemicals that mimic oestrogen and inhibit testosterone.      Those findings were the result of analysis of human cells exposed to the oils, but the research wasn't just conducted in the lab. It also considered the experience of three young boys aged four, seven, and ten, who all exhibited signs of prepubertal gynecomastia – a rare condition where males develop enlarged breast tissue.      In those cases, the swelling coincided with topical application of products that contained lavender and tea tree oils, but the effects went away after use of the essential oils ended.      Subsequent research on rats has cast doubt on this seeming oestrogenic potential of lavender oil, but now Korach and Ramsey have new evidence of why these essential oils could be harmful to boys after all.      In a new analysis, the researchers tested eight specific chemicals of the hundreds that appear in lavender or tea tree oil, testing them in the lab against human breast cancer cells.      The experiments revealed all eight of the chemicals tested classify as endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs), displaying varying levels of oestrogenic and/or anti-androgenic (testosterone-inhibiting) properties.      While some of the chemicals tested didn't actually have much of an effect, others did, and all were technically EDCs capable of contributing to the stimulation of mammary gland conditions in boys' bodies, the researchers say.      Even more alarmingly, the EDCs the team tested aren't contained to just lavender and tea tree oil – they're also present in at least 65 other essential oils currently on the market.      All up, these 67 extracts are contained in a huge range of products that don't require a prescription to buy, and which aren't regulated by the FDA, and the researchers warn it's important we learn more about the potential risks these oils may present.      But others explain that because of the limited amount of data we have so far on this rare phenomenon, we shouldn't jump to conclusions about the dangers of essential oils – especially since the latest findings haven't yet had a chance to be peer-reviewed by other experts.      While acknowledging that the new evidence seems to confirm why lavender and tea tree oil have this effect on young boys, paediatrician Ieuan Hughes from the University of Cambridge, who wasn't involved in the study, says there's still a lot we don't know.      \\"Not everyone exposing themselves to such oils has adverse effects, so it is possible there are particular individuals who may be more sensitive to the effects of the chemicals, or perhaps are using the products in excess,\\" Hughes told the BBC.      \\"There is a complex relationship between oestrogen, testosterone and other hormones in the body, that cannot be replicated in these experiments,\\" he added.      \\"Clearly, the longer-term effects of such exposure are unknown.\\"      The findings are being presented at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois, on Monday. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A recent study has found a potential link between prepubertal gynecomastia, a condition causing abnormal breast growth in young boys, and exposure to lavender and tea tree oil.

Answer:","output":"The review provided can be interpreted as predominantly positive with some neutral tones. The title \\"Like all the others\\" does not necessarily have a negative connotation, but it could imply some level of similarity or monotony in the range of Barron's books. However, the title alone is not enough to label the review as negative. The content of the review highlights Barron's strengths in producing quick reference books, emphasizing that their dictionaries and business notes are essential tools for both students and business professionals. The mention of Barron's as \\"outstanding\\" in their field is a clear sign of a positive review, as it indicates that the author appreciates the quality of their products. Additionally, describing these books as essential for gaining the \\"upper-hand\\" showcases the reviewer's belief in the effectiveness and usefulness of Barron's products in competitive environments. While the review appears mostly positive, the neutral tone lies in the title and the lack of information on any specific product. The broad generalization of Barron's range does not necessarily imply a fully positive endorsement of all their products, but rather an appreciation for the overall category they produce. There is also no indication of the reviewer's experience with any specific Barron's book, which could make their opinion less credible for someone seeking a review on an individual product. However, the overall message appears to praise Barron's abilities and expertise in their field. In conclusion, the review provided is not negative, but rather a combination of positive and slightly neutral tones with an emphasis on the brand's strengths in producing quick reference books. The neutrality lies primarily in the title and lack of specific product information, while the positivity is expressed through the appreciation of Barron's offerings as essential resources for students and business professionals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs.

Article: Not all bodies of water are so evidently alive as the Atlantic Ocean, an S-shaped body of water covering 33 million square miles. The Atlantic has, in a sense, replaced the Mediterranean as the inland sea of Western civilization. Unlike real inland seas, which seem strangely still, the Atlantic is rich in oceanic liveliness. It is perhaps not surprising that its vitality has been much written about by ancient poets. \\"Storm at Sea\\", a short poem written around 700, is generally regarded as one of mankind's earliest artistic representations of the Atlantic. When the wind is from the west All the waves that cannot rest To the east must thunder on Where the bright tree of the sun Is rooted in the ocean's breast. As the poem suggests, the Atlantic is never dead and dull. It is an ocean that moves, impressively and endlessly. It makes all kinds of noise--it is forever thundering, boiling, crashing, and whistling. It is easy to imagine the Atlantic trying to draw breath--perhaps not so noticeably out in mid-ocean, but where it meets land, its waters bathing up and down a sandy beach. It mimics  nearly perfectly the steady breathing of a living creature. It is filled with _ existences, too: unimaginable quantities of creatures, little and large alike, mix within its depths in a kind of oceanic harmony, giving to the waters a feeling of heartbeat, a kind of sub-ocean vitality. And it has a psychology. It has personalities: sometimes peaceful and pleasant, on rare occasions rough and wild; always it is strong and striking. Question: What is the purpose of using the poem \\"Storm at Sea\\" in the passage? - To describe the movement of the waves. - To show the strength of the storm. - To represent the power of the ocean. - To prove the vastness of the sea. The answer is:","output":"To represent the power of the ocean. The poem \\"Storm at Sea\\" is used in the passage to emphasize the power, vitality, and ceaseless motion of the Atlantic Ocean. By quoting the poem, the author highlights the ocean's enduring presence in literature and demonstrates its impact on human imagination. The poem serves as a metaphor for the ocean's energy, showing it as an ever-moving, always-changing, and powerful force that has captivated the minds of ancient poets and continues to be an important symbol in Western civilization."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.

She laughs at his advances, comparing him unfavorably with another man, and he severely beats her. Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenage boy who helps out on Lazarus' farm. She eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Will space be Africa's industry of future? \\"Techonomics\\" focuses on how technology is revolutionizing the way we live and do business. Looking at new business models and innovations, CNN explains and analyzes all aspects of this disruptive global shift. (CNN) -- In the sparse hinterland of Africa's southernmost nation plans are afoot to boldly take the continent where it has never gone before -- the deepest reaches of outer space. It's here, in South Africa's Karoo desert, that construction is scheduled to begin on the Square Kilometer Array, a cluster of 3,000 satellites working in tandem over a square kilometer area. This highly sensitive collective of dishes and antennas will combine to act as a giant radio telescope -- the biggest in the world when built, according to the SKA Organization -- probing the dark heart of space. An accompanying selection of array and aperture antennas, meanwhile, will provide continuous coverage of radio waves between 70 MhZ and 10 GhZ that penetrate the earth's atmosphere. A composite image of the MeerKAT and ASKAP satellites. (Credit: SKA) Scientists hope the project will shed further light on the mysteries posed by the likes of quasars, dark matter and black holes. According to Phil Diamond, Director-General of the SKA Organisation, the project could even enable scientists to \\"pick up signals from extraterrestrials\\" should they exist, although this isn't the projects primary objective. There's also the exciting possibility of capturing information on how the universe evolved in its earliest moments. For science, the prize is clearly huge. (There are) endless possibilities through innovation and new technologies which may be replicated on Earth.Dr Sandile Malinga, SANSA CEO A full budget for the SKA is yet to be confirmed but construction is slated to begin by 2018. Given the scale of the project, which has the backing of 11 member countries, some have even dubbed the SKA astronomy's version of the Large Hadron Collider. For South Africa and the wider African continent, there are also many ancillary benefits. While the SKA is headquartered in the UK with a smaller array of satellites based in Australia and the large array in South Africa, distant stations will also be set up in Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. The construction, observation and upkeep of these facilities will provide skilled jobs for local people. SKA South Africa project director Bernie Fanaroff, meanwhile, says that the telescope array will generate more data in a day than already exists on the entire internet. As such, new computer software and programs that can pinpoint relevant data and allow humans to interact with it in a simple and time-efficient manner are currently being developed. Given the increasing importance of \\"big data\\" collection and analysis across a host of contemporary industries, South Africa's government is taking a calculated risk that the technologies underpinning these systems will find further commercial use both in Africa and beyond. For the Rainbow Nation, these are clearly exciting and potentially lucrative developments to be a part of. What we don't want is vanity space programs.Calestous Juma, Harvard University \\"South Africa wants to move away from being resource heavy economy to bring young people into science and technology,\\" explains Fanaroff. \\"Building the SKA ... is a way of emphasizing and getting people to accept that science and tech is a key part of development.\\" This is a point of view that Dr Sandile Malinga, head of the South African National Space Agency, strongly concurs with. He points to successful SANSA programs currently underway -- including the development and launch of satellites that provide data used to inform government decisions on security, agriculture and environmental protection -- which prove the benefits of serious investment in a modern space program. SANSA is also in the process of developing the MeerKAT radio telescope, which will act as a precursor to the SKA, and the agency also gave help to NASA's Mars Curiosity Mission during launch. \\"(There are) endless possibilities through innovation and new technologies, which may be replicated on earth,\\" Malinga says. \\"The necessary knowledge and skills developed through such missions will open doors for our people to position themselves equally on the global space stage and even bring in external funding to our countries thus boosting the economies,\\" he adds. South Africa isn't the only African nation thinking along these lines. Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt have all established space and satellite programs with similar aims. Ghana, Uganda, Angola, Ethiopia and Kenya, meanwhile, have voiced their commitment to follow suit. Some observers question whether the underlying infrastructure to enable these ambitions to flourish in the long term is currently in place. Calestous Juma, a Harvard University professor and co-chair of the African Union's High-Level Panel on Science, Technology and Innovation, told CNN that while it is right that African nations invest in space technology they must do so in a thoughtful and strategic manner. He points to the importance of focusing on education and inspiring future generations to become scientists and engineers, to create valuable and highly skilled workforces. \\"What we don't want is vanity space programs,\\" Juma said. \\"As it stands, I think they are focusing more on the space programs and less on the education ... (space programs) have to be designed as a capability program otherwise the economic return will not be fully realized.\\" While this may be the case for some African nations, Fanaroff says that since 2005 South Africa has issued some 600 grants in their human capacity development program, covering \\"everything from research chairs down to artisan training.\\" We don't accept that South Africa has to remain on the edge of civilization.Bernie Fanaroff, Director, SKA South Africa project \\"We're putting a lot of young people through a pipeline where we're trying to take them into astronomy and physics or engineering in their first or second year of university and taking them all the way through to post-doctoral fellowships. That's starting to work quite well,\\" adds Fanaroff. Despite his concerns about infrastructure, Calestous Juma is enthusiastic about the broader aims of developing space programs on the continent. There are others, however, who say that African nations should focus more on providing for the basic needs of their populations than on the luxury of space investment. South Africa has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor globally, with millions living in shanty towns -- although earlier this year, the government reported that the population living in extreme poverty has dropped by 2.4 million since 2006. Egypt has been wracked by political instability and violence since former president of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak was forced to resign by protesters in 2011 and the subsequent overthrow in 2013 of President Mohamed Morsy in a military coup. And in Nigeria, some regions boast the unenviable record of having 60% of their population living in extreme poverty. Matthew Sinclair from the British Taxpayers Alliance body was quoted by the UK's Independent newspaper in 2013 asking why his country was sending money to provide development assistance to nations like Nigeria and South Africa when they are investing in space technologies. \\"If a foreign government has enough cash to invest in an ambitious space program, it should not expect to be receiving cash from the UK,\\" Sinclair said. The likes of Malinga and Fanaroff, however, have little time for these suggestions. \\"This is an argument we hear often and is largely as a result of the public not being able to make the link between the benefits of space investment against addressing society's needs,\\" Malinga says. \\"Africa has immense challenges with poverty, hunger and access to potable water which can all be diminished through investment in space\\" by providing valuable data that can make public policy more efficient, for example. On top of this, \\"innovations that arise from the 'out-of-the-box' thinking that space encourages will impact on growing local economies and create opportunities for Africans in the global market,\\" he adds. Fanaroff, however, is more withering in his riposte. \\"We don't accept that South Africa has to remain on the edge of civilization. That we don't accept, that's the old colonial way of thinking,\\" Fanaroff says. \\"For South Africa and Africa (this could be) the next great economic growth story,\\" he adds. \\"We will play a role in the future.\\" Read: Cooling the internet's appetite for power in Scandinavia Read: How your data is worth more than gold Read: Meet Basketball's Moneyball genius","output":"South Africa's Karoo desert is set to be the construction site of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), a cluster of 3,000 satellites that will work together to form the largest radio telescope in the world.

The potential benefits of the telescope are numerous, including providing skilled jobs for local people, helping scientists investigate mysteries in space, and encouraging technological innovation.

When Oscar is expelled from public school, Rose takes a job as a bio-hazard crime-scene cleaner to help pay for a private education, and brings Norah on board to help in her steadily growing business. As the sisters work to clean up the messes left behind by the chaotic lives of others, they must learn to reconcile their own differences and overcome a troubled past if they hope to prosper in their new found venture.

A:","output":"Title: Leaves More to Be Desired (2 out of 5 stars) Review: As a frequent user of various apps on the Android platform, I was initially excited to use the com.google.android.gms app, especially considering its association with Google. However, after several weeks of use, I must say that my experience has been quite underwhelming, leaving much more to be desired. While the app does offer a range of useful APIs and features such as Google Maps, Google Play Services, and Google Account integration, the overall experience has been far from smooth. One of the most glaring issues I've encountered is the app's occasional freezing and crashing. There have been multiple instances where I've had to force close the app, and sometimes even restart my device to fix the problem. This has been a constant source of frustration. Additionally, the app drains my device's battery considerably faster than I would like. Since installing the app, I've noticed that my phone doesn't last as long on a single charge, requiring me to keep a charger with me at all times. I believe this is due to the high background activity that the app generates even when not actively in use. Another drawback I've noticed is the constant need for app updates. While I understand the importance of keeping an app up-to-date, the frequency of updates seems excessive for this particular one. Coupled with the fairly large size of each update, it becomes a pain to have to frequently free up storage space and wait for the updates to download and install. On the positive side, I must commend Google for the integration of several vital services in this one app. For instance, I've come to depend on Google Maps API for location tracking and navigation purposes within other apps that I use. It's extremely convenient to have access to these functionalities without needing to juggle too many separate apps. However, the user interface could also be more intuitive and user-friendly. I often find myself struggling to locate specific settings and features within the app. The lack of in-depth tutorials or help documents amplifies this problem, leaving users like myself feeling lost at times. In conclusion, although the com.google.android.gms app offers a few useful integrated services and APIs, its inefficiencies compromise the overall experience. With frequent crashes, considerable battery drain, excessive updates, and a confusing user interface, it's challenging for me to give this app a higher rating. I hope that Google addresses these issues in future updates to improve the app's performance and the user experience it provides. For now, I can only offer a subpar 2 out of 5 stars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q: What is the movement of fluid out of the capillaries called?   A: Pick your answer from: (i) diffusion (ii) absorption (iii) osmosis (iv) filtration Answer:","output":"In order to determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option. (i) Diffusion: This is the passive movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration until equilibrium is reached. Although diffusion does occur within the capillaries, it doesn't specifically describe the movement of fluid out of capillaries. (ii) Absorption: This process involves the uptake of nutrients and substances into cells or tissues. While absorption occurs in the digestive system and may involve the capillary network, it doesn't specifically describe the movement of fluid out of capillaries. (iii) Osmosis: Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration. Osmosis contributes to the balance of fluid within the capillaries, but it mainly deals with water molecules and not the overall movement of the fluid. (iv) Filtration: Filtration refers to the movement of fluid through a semipermeable membrane as a result of differences in pressure. In the case of capillaries, fluid moves out of the capillary walls due to the hydrostatic pressure difference between the blood and the interstitial fluid. Based on this analysis, the movement of fluid out of the capillaries is best described by: Answer: (iv) filtration"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Chapel A:","output":"Title: The Whispering Chapel Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: Arlette, a young, skeptical journalist, moves to a sleepy European village called Esterbrook for a fresh start after a traumatic event in her hometown. One stormy night, she discovers a mysterious, forgotten chapel deep in the woods just outside the village. Forced to take shelter from the pouring rain inside, Arlette realizes that this chapel has been abandoned for years. However, she can't shake the feeling of a strange, almost supernatural presence in the air. As she returns to the village, she begins to investigate the history of the chapel, which leads her to uncover Esterbrook's dark past. She learns that the chapel was once a place of worship for a secret cult who believed that they could communicate with the spirits of the dead but was left abandoned after a series of unexplained deaths. Haunted by her findings, Arlette reluctantly decides to venture back to the chapel alone, intent on uncovering the truth behind the mysterious cult and the apocryphal stories surrounding it. Little does she know that she's about to become entangled in a web of deception, intrigue, and long-hidden secrets that would turn her world upside down. As Arlette starts uncovering the secrets behind the Whispering Chapel, she experiences inexplicable occurrences like whispers in the dead of night, dancing shadows along the stained-glass windows, and objects moving mysteriously. The villagers become suspicious and wary since Arlette's return, especially the rigid and ominous town priest, Father Donovan. Suspense builds as Arlette gradually realizes that some of Esterbrook's villagers are descendants of the cult members, and they would do anything to protect their ancestors' secrets. Furthermore, Father Donovan plays an instrumental role in the current malicious activities taking place in the chapel, determined to finish his ancestors' dark work. Arlette, overwhelmed by fear but fueled by her relentless pursuit of the truth, forms an alliance with a few trustworthy villagers who help her search for evidence to expose Father Donovan and the continued existence of the cult. Through the strength of their combined forces, they're able to gather undeniable proof of Father Donovan's nefarious activities, ultimately causing his downfall and bringing peace to the village once again. The film ends with Arlette standing in the chapel, now restored as a sanctuary for the villagers, knowing that she's not only managed to uncover the truth but has also put the troubled spirits of the Whispering Chapel to rest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does he respond practically and politically to the fact that the numbers he based his plans on at the Spending Review  have turned out to be wrong? And not just those numbers, but much of the case that he'd been building in the year before feels, well, misplaced, now - that we were on our way \\"out of the red and back into the black\\", he had \\"fixed the roof\\" while the sun was shining, whichever Osborne metaphor you want to choose. As my colleague Kamal Ahmed's written here, the backdrop is different. So first, George Osborne is going to have to fess up - the pages and pages of numbers the independent Office for Budget Responsibility provided as the basis of his sums won't add up anymore. We know too - as he told me a few weeks ago - that means extra government cuts are likely, probably an additional £4bn billion a year by 2020. So more cuts are on the way, on top of six years of spending reductions that have hit some families extremely hard. But the government's announcement today on academy schools, and the fact the chancellor, not the education secretary, is making it, suggests something else too. Numbers 10 and 11 are determined to make us believe they are interested in much more than just sorting out the books - they're not just cutters, but reformers too. Even though those plans will cause strong complaint, they are part of George Osborne and David Cameron's plans to achieve more than just close the gap between what the government spends and takes from all of us in taxes - although they know that's proving hard enough. And while the numbers are certainly worse than Number 11 had hoped, and the catchily-titled \\"downward revisions\\" will grab many of the headlines, George Osborne's political brain may tell him that economic changes have not knocked the (notoriously unreliable) predictions so far off course that it is worth any enormous deviation from his overall strategy. So the chancellor, albeit in rather more sombre tones, is likely to echo his previous audacious claims that a Conservative government that is making significant cuts to state spending is composed of \\"the mainstream representatives of the working people\\". He has been doing the job for six years now, and knows the dangers of a Budget that goes wrong, and one that goes with a bang. But with the Conservatives' ambitions, and his own, in mind, he is unlikely to miss the opportunity to make that case again. Despite the shadow chancellor's new credo that aligns his hypothetical plans for tax and spend closely to those of Labour's recent past, even before George Osborne is on his feet John McDonnell is demanding that he stop the cuts. One of the quirks of Budget day is that it will be for Jeremy Corbyn, not Mr McDonnell, to make that case, responding to Mr Osborne. That is a tall order for any opposition leader. For Jeremy Corbyn, who enjoys huge support from the party's membership but not much from those sitting on the benches behind him, it is a huge ask. But the opposition that really troubles Mr Osborne right now is those on his own benches. He'll be more interested in how they, and the public, respond - and if he's not the \\"lucky chancellor\\" any more, what they'll be calling him by the end of today. What is a summary of this text?","output":"This text is about George Osborne, a person who helps make important decisions about money for the country. The numbers he used in his plans turned out to be wrong, which may lead to extra cuts of around £4 billion a year by 2020. He and his friend David Cameron want to do more than just fix the money problems. They want to make big changes like making all schools into academies, which some people don't like. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of another group, wants Osborne to stop making cuts. Osborne is interested in what people on his team and regular people think about his plans. So, in short, this text is about a man named George Osborne who made some money plans that turned out to be wrong, and now he has to figure out what to do next, while his friends and opponents watch closely to see what he does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Until 1964 it was known as the Army Council.  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.  - The Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO) was a very senior British military position, usually held by a serving general. The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for all British artillery, engineers, fortifications, military supplies, transport, field hospitals and much else, and was not subordinate to the commander-in chief of the British military.

Hint: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Given the context: How would you describe Aubrey? A:","output":"Aubrey can be described as someone who has strong feelings for Skylar. This is evident from the given context where Aubrey gently grabs Skylar's face after the movie is over. The action seems intimate and caring, showcasing that Aubrey is emotionally invested in their relationship. This choice of action demonstrates a level of care and gentleness towards Skylar, which can be interpreted as a sign of deep affection. The fact that they chose to engage in such a tender gesture at a public place like a movie theater highlights their comfort and trust in each other. Moreover, the specific timing of the gesture, which happened right after a movie, suggests that Aubrey and Skylar might have shared a meaningful experience together while watching the film. The movie could have evoked strong emotions within them, bringing them closer and solidifying their connection. It is not accurate to describe Aubrey as being \\"careful\\" or \\"rude\\" based on the given context. The term \\"careful\\" generally implies a level of caution or wariness when dealing with a particular situation. However, Aubrey's action appears spontaneous, genuine, and driven by emotions rather than careful deliberation. Furthermore, the term \\"rude\\" is completely in contrast with the tender gesture Aubrey made, as the action was gentle and did not seem to have caused any negative feelings or discomfort for Skylar. In conclusion, based on the given context, Aubrey can be described as someone with feelings for Skylar, as their actions reflect a deep level of affection and emotional connection. Their tender gesture after the movie demonstrates the strength of their bond and suggests that they trust and care for each other deeply."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example Schadenfreude, are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules. It is thus historically variable and open to change. Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain, Sweden and Australia.

Deadly blast targets security forces in Turkey’s Kurdish region At least six people were killed and 23 were injured Thursday, March 31, when an explosion hit a police vehicle in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir. (AP) A deadly explosion Thursday targeted security forces in Turkey’s mainly Kurdish region, killing at least six people in the latest violence to hit the country amid a string of suicide blasts and other attacks, reports said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility following the explosion in Diyarbakir, the main city in Turkey’s predominately Kurdish southeastern region. But the area has been the scene of increasing clashes between Turkish forces and Kurdish separatists, who have stepped up a decades-long fight for greater autonomy. [Pentagon, State Department order families of personnel to leave Turkey] At least six people were killed and 23 were injured in the blast, which went off near a small bus carrying police special forces, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported. The Associated Press, citing security sources, said all the fatalities were among security personnel. The blast came two days after the United States announced it would withdraw nearly all family members of U.S. troops and diplomats from its facilities in Turkey, citing security concerns linked to the U.S.-led battles against the Islamic State in neighboring Syria. [Turkey strikes back against Kurdish group] On March 13, a car bomb killed 37 people in the capital, Ankara, in an attack claimed by a breakaway Kurdish rebel faction. Less than a week later, a Turkish man with suspected ties to the Islamic State set off a suicide blast in Istanbul, killing four foreign tourists, including two Israeli Americans. It was the sixth major suicide bombing in Turkey in eight months. A shadowy Kurdish group called the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons has asserted responsibility for two major suicide attacks in Ankara this year, including the one this month. The faction is thought to be an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which has waged an insurgency in Turkey since the 1980s. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States. After the latest Ankara attack, Turkish warplanes waged airstrikes against Kurdish militant strongholds in northern Iraq, a staging ground for cross-border operations by the rebels. In Washington, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met with Vice President Biden and other officials before attending a nuclear security summit.

Given the question: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

Which tribe was less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs? The answer is:","output":"The Momu tribe. Step 1: Understand the question The question asks which tribe, Ana or Momu, was less affected by the disrupted ocean food webs due to ozone depletion. Step 2: Identify the location of the ozone depletion The information provided states that ozone depletion has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. This means that the area around Antarctica is more affected by the higher levels of UV radiation and its consequences, such as disruption of ocean food webs. Step 3: Determine the locations of the tribes The Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, and the Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. Step 4: Compare the locations of the tribes to the area of ozone depletion Since the Ana tribe lives closer to the ozone hole over Antarctica, they are more likely to be affected by the disrupted ocean food webs resulting from ozone depletion. On the other hand, the Momu tribe, located thousands of miles away from the ozone hole near the North Pole, would be less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs. Conclusion: The Momu tribe in Northern Alaska near the North Pole is less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs due to ozone depletion compared to the Ana tribe living near the South Pole in Antarctica."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which fruit retained their quality longer apples or pears?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] The answer to this question is:","output":"Apples retained their quality longer than pears.  Step-by-step justification: 1. Since Mary decided to candy her fruit (apples included) and Ann decided to eat her fruit fresh (pears included), we need to compare the quality of candied apples to fresh pears. 2. According to the hint, the process of candying fruit allows it to retain its quality for a year. 3. Fresh fruit, like pears, generally has a shorter shelf life compared to candied fruit. A fresh pear's shelf life can range from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the ripeness and storage conditions. This is significantly less than a year. 4. Therefore, comparing the shelf life of candied apples (which can retain quality for a year) to fresh pears (that lasts only a few days to a couple of weeks), apples retain their quality longer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is, in fact, a genuine wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult, life altering choices that will likely re-define who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come. Jim McKay's writing/direction is graceful and uncluttered. There is no sappy, gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden solutions in this film. What we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. Much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. It would be easy - and, of course, blatantly obtuse - to dismiss, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional. In fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting. One would have to be completely \\"out of touch\\" with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Likewise, the supporting cast, particularly Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film. Our Song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age. What is the sentiment of this review?

For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Movie title: Suspect Zero Movie plot: FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) has been put on leave for 6 months, demoted, and reassigned to Albuquerque, because he violated the civil rights of a serial killer, Raymond Starkey. Starkey was living in Mexico at the time, when Mackelway brought him back to America in the trunk of his car. Starkey was eventually set free upon the world. Mackelway arrives in Albuquerque, and his first case is the murder of a traveling salesman, Harold Speck, who has a zero mark on his body. The FBI was called to the scene, because the body was in a car located just across the state line. Soon afterwards, he investigates two other murders. Raymond Starkey was the third victim. All the victims had the same zero mark on their body.At first, the murders looked random, and then Mackelway begins to connect the dots. The victims are all serial killers, and someone is going around killing them. He gets a lead that Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) may have some connection to the murders, and he begins to track down O'Ryan. He finds out that O'Ryan was once an FBI agent with special skills, trained to use 'remote viewing' to see what the serial killer sees. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) A:","output":"Raymond Starkey, as depicted in the synopsis of the film \\"Suspect Zero\\", is a character who is a serial killer. Though not much is explicitly described about his character in the synopsis, it is implied that Starkey's case is pivotal to the overall plot of the film. In particular, his case plays a key role in the main character’s, FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway's, backstory. At the start of the film, we learn that Mackelway has been put on leave for six months, demoted and reassigned to Albuquerque due to his extrajudicial actions taken against Starkey. According to the narrative, Mackelway captured Starkey, who was residing in Mexico at that time, and clandestinely brought him back to the United States by confining him to the trunk of his car. However, this violation of Starkey's rights resulted in his release. In Albuquerque, Mackelway embarks on his first case, which involves investigating a murder with a strange signature - a zero mark on the body. This mark also appears on subsequent victims, one of whom is Raymond Starkey himself. Hence, Starkey serves a dual role in this movie’s storyline - firstly, as the spark that ignites the main plot and character development of Agent Mackelway, and secondly, as one of the victims that contribute to the mystery surrounding the serial murders. As the plot progresses, it is revealed that the victims are themselves serial killers, suggesting a vigilante killer is on the loose. The hunt for the killer guides Mackelway to Benjamin O'Ryan, a former FBI agent with a unique skill set. His skills in 'remote viewing', which were used to witness the events from a serial killer’s perspective, could potentially have some association with the murders. To summarize, Raymond Starkey is a pivotal character in the plot of the movie. His role, though seemingly secondary, adds depth to Mackelway's character and propels the story forward. His involvement as a victim throws light on the unique modus operandi of the supposed vigilante killer while contributing significantly to the enigma and suspense of the narrative. Based on this information, the film seems to have an intense and intriguing storyline capable of catching and keeping the audience's attention. However, the decision to invest in it should also take into account factors such as the budget, director, cast, and market conditions amongst other considerations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To make a base for paper mache, you can","output":"follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials To make the base for paper mache, you'll need some essential materials: - A form to create the shape of your base (e.g., a balloon, chicken wire, cardboard, or a plastic object) - Newspaper or other types of paper - Masking tape - Scissors or a cutting tool Justification: Having all essential materials on hand makes the process easier and helps maintain the intended shape of the base. Step 2: Prepare the form Depending on the form chosen, prepare it to make it ready for the paper mache. For instance:  - Inflate the balloon to the desired size, and tie a knot at the end - Mold the chicken wire or cardboard to the desired shape and secure with masking tape Justification: Using the right form and preparing it helps in achieving the desired shape for the base. Also, it provides sufficient support for the layers of paper mache that will be added later. Step 3: Cut up the paper Take the newspaper or paper of choice and cut or tear it into strips. The strips should be about 1-2 inches wide and can vary in length depending on the object's size. Justification: Cutting or tearing the paper into strips makes it easier to apply to the base form and allows for better adhesion when using the paper mache paste. Step 4: Create the paper mache paste In a mixing bowl, combine the following ingredients: - 1 cup of water - 1 cup of flour - Possibly, some white glue (optional for added strength) Mix the ingredients together until a smooth and slightly thick consistency is achieved. Adjust the proportions if needed. Justification: The paper mache paste acts as the binder and glue for the paper strips, helping them adhere and harden to the base. Step 5: Apply paper mache to the base Dip each paper strip into the paper mache paste completely, then use your fingers to remove excess paste as you pull the strip out. Lay the coated strip onto the base form, smoothing it out as you go. Apply the paper strips in different directions to create a stronger structure. Repeat with more strips until the entire base form is covered in a layer of paper mache. Justification: Applying the paper mache paste to the base strengthens it and assists in creating the desired shape. Step 6: Let the paper mache layer dry Allow the base form to dry completely before adding more layers or proceeding with decorating. Drying time can vary depending on the climate and the thickness of the paper mache layer, so patience is key. Justification: Letting each layer dry before applying more ensures that the base is strong and holds its shape. Step 7 (optional): Repeat steps 5 and 6 If a more sturdy base is desired, repeat steps 5 (applying paper mache) and 6 (drying it), creating additional layers on the base form. Generally, 3-4 layers are enough for most projects. Allow adequate drying time between each layer. Justification: Multiple layers of paper mache ensure a stronger base and better support for the final project. Allowing each layer to dry before the next prevents uneven drying and potential warping or weakening of the base. After the final layer has dried, you have successfully created a base for your paper mache project!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: What can I do for my chronic constipation? I strongly recommend you consult a gastroenterologist. Chronic constipation is the most common digestive complaint and is associated with significant economic costs. For most people it is a mild inconvenience. For a few it can be a serious problem. Most with this malady would do better by simply eating the recommended five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day, drinking at least 60 ounces of water per day and getting some exercise, even walking. Some with more severe and chronic constipation would benefit from additional fiber in the diet. We often suggest Metamucil or fiber bars. Let me give you an idea of how constipation is addressed after those interventions have not solved the problem. First, there are varied meanings to the term constipation and the physician would have to find out just what the patient means. Some people will complain of stool being too hard, too small, or that having a bowel movement is too difficult or occurs infrequently. These are clues. Several years ago, a committee of gastroenterologists came together to create a definition and criteria for constipation. The result is called the Rome III Criteria. It helps us approach this problem in a more rigorous and scientific way. In essence, constipation is when stool does not move through the colon or anorectum -- the distal portion of the digestive tract, including the entire anal canal -- in an ordered way. The colon or large bowel is a long tube, 4 to 6 feet in length in most adults. There are muscles in the colonic wall. These muscles contract in an ordered way to propel the waste matter. There can be dysfunction caused by a motor disorder, meaning that the muscles of the colon walls do not propel food adequately, the stool is too hard or there is a physical obstruction of the large bowel. A nerve problem or neurogenic disorder may prevent the muscles from contracting in an ordered sequence. Common causes of neurogenic bowel disease in adults include diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Spinal cord injury can also cause constipation. Non-neurogenic causes of bowel muscle dysfunction include low thyroid dysfunction, pituitary failure or low serum potassium. High blood calcium levels, which can result from an overactive parathyroid or several cancers, can also be a non-neurogenic cause of constipation. Certain muscle diseases such as myotonic dystrophy occasionally cause constipation. Drugs that can cause constipation include analgesics, especially opiate pain medicine, cold medicines such as antihistamines, antidepressants and anti-pschycotics. Iron supplements can also cause constipation. Several anti-hypertensive drugs are famous for causing constipation through dehydrating and hardening stool and interfering with nerve conduction to bowel wall muscle. A physician will review known diagnoses and the drugs a patient is taking. Blood studies to assess electrolytes and thyroid function are commonly done. If there is any suspicion of a partial bowel obstruction from a developmental defect, a prior abdominal surgery, a polyp or a colon cancer, a scoping procedure to evaluate the colon and possibly a barium X-ray study of the bowel will be done.","output":"The article discusses chronic constipation, the most common digestive complaint, and its causes and possible treatments.

Given the question: -  Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin - Electricity is produced.  What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process is pulverizing the coal into fine powder. This is an essential step in the coal combustion process for power generation, as it greatly increases the surface area of the coal, allowing it to burn more efficiently and completely. By grinding the coal into a fine powder, it can be more easily mixed with hot air and distributed evenly throughout the boiler combustion chamber. This not only ensures a more efficient and controlled burn but also reduces the amount of harmful air pollutants that are released during the combustion process, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  In a typical coal-fired power plant, coal is transported to the facility and stored in large coal storage facilities or silos. When it's needed for power generation, the coal is fed into a pulverizer, which is a large grinding mill that uses steel balls or large rollers to crush the coal into a fine powder. The pulverizer is equipped with a classifier that separates the larger particles from the fine powder. The larger particles are returned to the grinding area for further pulverization, while the fine powder is carried by air to the next stage of the process. This process of pulverizing the coal is crucial for ensuring better combustion, as a fine powder can more easily mix with the hot air that is forced into the boiler. The increased surface area also means the coal ignites faster and burns more completely, reducing the amount of wasted fuel and improving overall efficiency. Moreover, by ensuring a consistent size of the coal particles, it helps maintain steady combustion conditions inside the boiler, resulting in a more stable and reliable power output.  In conclusion, the first step in this coal combustion process for electricity production is pulverizing the coal into fine powder. This essential step helps enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and effectiveness of the power generation process by providing a consistent and uniform fuel source for the subsequent combustion stages."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article with the title: \\"RBI fights inflation but Indian consumers don't feel the benefits\\" Article:","output":"Title: RBI Fights Inflation but Indian Consumers Don't Feel the Benefits Introduction: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been continuously implementing monetary policies to battle inflation. However, Indian consumers don't seem to be reaping the benefits of these efforts. In theory, when inflation is controlled effectively, it should reflect positively on the lives of the people by making essential goods and services more affordable. Despite the RBI's best efforts, this does not appear to be the case in India. Let's analyze the reasons why the RBI's efforts are not reaching the consumers. Step 1: Understand RBI's inflation-fighting measures The main tool used by the RBI to combat inflation is adjusting the repo rate, which is the rate at which banks borrow from the central bank. When inflation is on the rise, the RBI increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for banks to borrow money. In turn, banks raise interest rates on loans, resulting in less borrowing by individuals and businesses. This curbs excessive spending and demand, helping to control inflation. Conversely, the RBI lowers the repo rate when inflation is within the desired range, making it cheaper to borrow money and thereby stimulating spending. Step 2: Analyze the impact of RBI's measures on loan interest rates RBI's actions to combat inflation have both a direct and indirect impact on loan interest rates. While increased repo rates lead to higher loan interest rates, decreased repo rates should ideally result in lower interest rates. This change should help borrowers, who would be more inclined to take out loans with favorable interest rates and invest in businesses or make purchases. Step 3: Examine the disconnect between RBI's measures and consumers' experiences Despite the RBI's efforts to fight inflation, Indian consumers are still struggling due to several reasons, such as: 1. Ineffective transmission of rate cuts: When the RBI lowers the repo rate, banks should ideally pass on the benefits to customers. However, banks sometimes retain a part of these rate cuts to protect their profit margins, resulting in a slow and partial transmission of rate cuts to consumers. 2. High levels of non-performing assets (NPAs): Indian banks have a massive burden of NPAs, which discourages them from aggressively lowering interest rates and passing on the benefits to consumers even when the RBI lowers the repo rate. 3. Structural issues in the economy: While the RBI's mandates are critical in controlling inflation, there are structural issues in the Indian economy, such as supply-side constraints, that contribute to inflation and can't be addressed by monetary policy alone. 4. Temporary inflationary pressures: Inflation may be driven by temporary factors like oil price fluctuations, weather disruptions affecting agriculture, and specific fiscal policies. These factors are beyond the control of the RBI and are less responsive to changes in the repo rate. Conclusion: The RBI's efforts to fight inflation are commendable, but for the Indian consumer to truly experience the benefits, there needs to be a more effective transmission of rate cuts to consumers and a focused approach to addressing structural issues in the economy. Additionally, measures should be adopted to tackle the banks' burden of NPAs, enabling the benefits of the RBI's policies to flow more smoothly to the consumers. Only then will the fight against inflation have a more tangible impact on the lives of Indian consumers."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Robert Mills Delaney composed only one song throughout his lifetime.","output":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that Robert Mills Delaney composed only one song throughout his lifetime based on the given information. The information provided highlights Delaney's best-known work, the 1928 choral symphony John Brown's Song. However, this does not imply that this was the only song he composed during his career. As a composer, it is highly likely that Delaney had a more diverse and extensive body of work. His studies with prominent figures such as Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger in Paris would have provided him with valuable knowledge and experience in the field of composition. It's reasonable to assume that during his career, he would have composed numerous other pieces, exploring different genres, styles, and forms of music. Moreover, considering the time span from his birth in 1903 to his death in 1956, Delaney had ample time to build a rich musical repertoire. Turning our attention to established composers in general, it is a rare occurrence for them to have composed only one song or piece throughout their entire careers. Composers tend to create various musical pieces over time and continue to develop their skills and techniques, thus contributing to their growth in the world of music. Similarly, it is improbable that Delaney composed merely one song in his lifetime. In conclusion, while the information presented focuses on Delaney's most prominent composition, the choral symphony John Brown's Song, we cannot assume that this was his sole contribution to the world of music. It's important to recognize that composers typically produce many compositions over their careers, and further research on Delaney's works would provide a more accurate representation of his musical legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Available options: (i). coral reefs (ii). rainforest plants (iii). ocean phytoplankton (iv). continental grasslands Answer:","output":"Answer: (iii). Ocean Phytoplankton Although each of these ecosystems contributes to the production of oxygen on Earth, it is ocean phytoplankton that provides most of the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. Phytoplankton are microscopic marine plants that play a vital role in maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide on our planet. They perform photosynthesis, similar to terrestrial plants, where they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into oxygen and organic matter. Here is a brief overview of each option and its contribution to Earth's oxygen production: (i) Coral reefs: Coral reefs are unique marine ecosystems characterized by the presence of coral polyps, which are tiny, soft-bodied organisms. These polyps consist of photosynthesizing algae called zooxanthellae embedded within their tissues. Although corals do contribute to the oxygen production in the marine environment, their contribution is relatively small compared to that of phytoplankton. (ii) Rainforest plants: Rainforests are one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, supporting countless plant, animal, and fungal species. These dense forests house numerous trees and plants that produce oxygen through photosynthesis, contributing to approximately 28% of the world's oxygen turnover. However, even with their tremendous biodiversity and productivity, ocean phytoplankton still produce a larger share of Earth's oxygen. (iii) Ocean Phytoplankton: Phytoplankton are the primary producers in the marine environment and are responsible for generating about 50-80% of the oxygen produced on Earth. These tiny, single-celled photosynthetic organisms drift in the sunlit waters of the upper ocean and harness sunlight to produce oxygen and nutrients essential to marine food webs. The great abundance and wide distribution of phytoplankton render them the dominant contributor to Earth's oxygen supply. (iv) Continental Grasslands: Grasslands cover almost a quarter of Earth's land surface and are home to various grass species that carry out photosynthesis. Due to their extensive land coverage, grasslands contribute to the global oxygen production and carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, compared to ocean phytoplankton, grasslands' contribution to the Earth's oxygen supply is notably smaller. In conclusion, while all these ecosystems play an essential part in producing the oxygen we breathe, it is ocean phytoplankton that provides most of the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, they serve as the foundation of marine food webs, sustaining both small and large marine organisms, making them a critical component of the global ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Klopp had watched powerless as Liverpool collapsed like a house of cards from a lead and a position of superiority to lose 3-1 to Sevilla, squandering the chance of Champions League football next season in the process. \\"This team will be a bit different next season, it is clear,\\" said Klopp. \\"We will do something with transfers.\\" Klopp's personality, allied to Liverpool's history and ambition, will always attract players - but life will be infinitely more difficult in a fiercely competitive summer market without the magnet that the Champions League, or indeed European football of any sort, provides. So what will Klopp need to change - and maintain - after Liverpool lost their second final of the season following the Capital One Cup defeat by Manchester City? The manner in which Liverpool's performance fell off a cliff once Kevin Gameiro equalised for Sevilla 17 seconds after the break, cancelling out Daniel Sturridge's brilliant opener, was alarming and Klopp was clearly taken aback. \\"We lost faith in our style of play,\\" said the German. \\"We changed from passing simple and quick to slow and complicated and lost our formation.\\" This was a damning indictment but a painful truth. Yes, Gameiro's equaliser was a psychological blow but Liverpool still had virtually the entire second half to put matters right. Instead, they visibly wilted and fell apart in key areas of the field. They were overrun in midfield and exposed in defence. Their body language sagged. It was a desperate sight as Sevilla tore them to shreds. The Spaniards are a very fine side who have now won the Europa League three seasons in succession but they are not Barcelona. Manchester City beat them 3-1 in their own stadium in this season's Champions League. Klopp has managed his resources with this final in mind and Liverpool have shown incredible reserves of mental strength in this competition - notably when scoring three goals in the last 20 minutes to beat Borussia Dortmund at Anfield - but here they were weak and shrunk ominously at the first sign of adversity. The difference was that they were inspired by a fervent Anfield atmosphere against Dortmund. In Basel, Liverpool's performance, and simply the way they looked mentally shot from the moment Sevilla equalised, gave their supporters no hope. There were no Liverpool leaders on the night and certainly no sense they were about to mount a comeback of Dortmund proportions. This time the final whistle was a mercy. Even Klopp's old tricks carried an air of desperation. He exhorted Liverpool's fans to inspire their team as they sank but it looked the act of a manager who knew the game was up. What were Liverpool's players doing to inspire their fans? He might have been better exhorting them. When Klopp goes shopping this summer he must prioritise strong characters and find a leader who will stop what happened in Basel happening again on the big occasion. Liverpool have conceded 19 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season. They are third in this list behind Chelsea (21) and Tottenham (20) - a statistic that adds weight to the argument that Klopp's team is a fragile one. Klopp will search for better players this summer. He must also find mentally tougher ones. When it comes to the case for changes, exhibit A in Basel was left-back Alberto Moreno. It was the second time the Spaniard has played a significant part in a Sevilla Europa League win, having been part of the side who lifted the trophy against Benfica in 2014. Moreno's hopeless performance brought criticism raining down on him, with BBC Sport analyst Mark Lawrenson in Basel saying simply: \\"He cannot defend.\\" He will surely be replaced and there needs to be much greater pressure placed on goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who was hardly culpable here but has had another unconvincing season. Klopp is being heavily linked with 22-year-old Mainz keeper Loris Karius in a £5m deal but a more experienced candidate may be preferable. Klopp has tried to address one issue in central defence with the signing of Joel Matip from Schalke but there are other holes he needs to plug. Dejan Lovren has had a good season despite being disappointing in Basel - while 35-year-old Kolo Toure was Liverpool's best player against Sevilla but will it be enough to earn the Ivorian a new contract? Martin Skrtel is another who is surplus to requirements and past his best at 31, while Mamadou Sakho faces an uncertain future following a failed drugs test. So this area is a matter of urgency for Klopp, while in midfield Joe Allen and Lucas Leiva may yet find themselves surplus to requirements. Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze has been touted as a possible marquee signing but would the man who scored Germany's World Cup final winner against Argentina in Rio in 2014 be prepared to forgo Champions League football, no matter how close his relationship with Klopp after their time at Borussia Dortmund? Udinese's young Poland midfield Piotr Zielinski is widely expected to join Liverpool in a £10m deal, but where is the strong leader Liverpool need? Jordan Henderson is captain and was only substitute in Basel after injury, but it is clear this Liverpool team lacks mental steel and needs a figure of authority they can rally around on the field. And what of Christian Benteke? There is undoubtedly a fine striker inside Benteke waiting to get out but his £32.5m move to Liverpool from Aston Villa last summer looks increasingly like the wrong man to the wrong club at the wrong time. He was Klopp's last resort in Basel, thrown on with seven minutes left and the game effectively gone having seen fellow Belgian Divock Origi turned to first despite not having played since sustaining an ankle injury against Everton at Anfield on 17 April. Benteke did not suit the passing style of the man who bought him, Brendan Rodgers, and he does not suit Klopp's intense and energetic pressing style either. If Liverpool can recoup £20m-plus, perhaps from West Ham, then Benteke's stay at Liverpool will surely end. Even the effervescent Klopp looked desperately low in Switzerland and Liverpool were a badly beaten and bedraggled side when the final whistle put them out of their misery. This is hardly a club in crisis, however, and Liverpool can look to the future with a hefty measure of optimism. The chief reason to be cheerful is Klopp himself. He has taken Liverpool to two cup finals this season, without any real adjustments to his squad, and galvanised the club. He wanted to turn \\"doubters into believers\\" and even this disappointment will not dent faith in the German, who was one of Europe's most sought-after coaches when Liverpool appointed him in September. The 48-year-old has the passion and charisma, plus the coaching ability, that Liverpool's fans and players can thrive on. His big game players were totally marginalised in Basel. Philippe Coutinho barely touched the ball while the disappointing Roberto Firmino was substituted. The Brazilian duo, though, have shown enough this season to offer excitement for next term. And in attack Daniel Sturridge, the great enigma, scored a goal of rare brilliance, curving an effort with the outside of his left foot into the far corner of Sevilla's net to give Liverpool the lead and what turned out to be false hope. If Klopp can keep Sturridge fit and in the right frame of mind, Liverpool will have arguably England's most naturally talented striker. Roy Hodgson may yet be the beneficiary of Klopp's work with Sturridge at Euro 2016 in France. Klopp will also see his options increased next season by the return fitness of striker Danny Ings and young defender Joe Gomez, who both created such an excellent impression before both succumbing to serious knee injuries. So, as Klopp will have been stressing to Liverpool's players, this is not all doom and gloom. What does cast a cloud is that Liverpool need serious reinforcements and a disappointing defeat here that leaves them without Champions League and Europa League football next season will make it more difficult to secure the right men. Media playback is not supported on this device What is a summary of this text?","output":"Liverpool's loss to Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final highlighted many deficiencies in the team, prompting manager Jürgen Klopp to look for solutions through transfers in the summer. The 3-1 collapse exposed key areas that needed urgent improvement, such as bolstering the defense and midfield departments. Left-back Alberto Moreno was heavily criticized for his poor performance, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's unconvincing season also signaled a need for change. Klopp's pursuit of better and mentally-tougher players led to the signing of Joel Matip from Schalke, though further changes were necessary. Bayern Munich's Mario Götze was mentioned as a potential marquee signing, but his willingness to forgo Champions League football was questioned. Liverpool's squad was also lacking a strong leader to provide mental steel and authority. Meanwhile, Christian Benteke's future at the club seemed uncertain, with a £20m-plus recoup potentially coming from West Ham. Despite the disappointing defeat in the final, Liverpool could maintain some optimism with Klopp at the helm. His charisma and coaching abilities helped the team reach two cup finals in the 2015-2016 season without significant squad adjustments. Key players like Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, and Daniel Sturridge offered excitement for the next term. Additionally, the return of injured striker Danny Ings and young defender Joe Gomez could strengthen Liverpool's options. However, securing the right reinforcements without Champions League and Europa League football would pose a major challenge for the club."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  and the situation: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, legal name Le Sony'r Ra; May 22, 1914 - May 30, 1993) was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, \\"cosmic\\" philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led \\"The Arkestra\\", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. Born and raised in Alabama, Blount eventually became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun) and developing a complex persona and mythology that would make him a pioneer of Afrofuturism: he claimed he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, and throughout his life he consistently denied any ties to his prior identity. Sun Ra soon left college because, he claimed, he had a visionary experience as a college student that had a major, long-term influence on him. In 1936 or 1937, in the midst of deep religious concentration, Sun Ra claimed that a bright light appeared around him, and, as he later said:  My whole body changed into something else. I could see through myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [a] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [attending college] because there was going to be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak [through music], and the world would listen. That's what they told me.  Sun Ra said that this experience occurred in 1936 or 1937. According to Szwed, the musician's closest associates cannot date the story any earlier than 1952. (Sun Ra also said that the incident happened when he was living in Chicago, where he did not settle until the late 1940s). Sun Ra discussed the vision, with no substantive variation, to the end of his life. His trip to Saturn allegedly occurred a full decade before flying saucers entered public consciousness with the 1947 encounter of Kenneth Arnold. It was earlier than other public accounts: about 15 years before George Adamski wrote about contact with benevolent beings; and almost 20 years before the 1961 case of Barney and Betty Hill, who recounted sinister UFO abductions. Szwed says that, \\"even if this story is revisionist autobiography... Sonny was pulling together several strains of his life. He was both prophesizing his future and explaining his past with a single act of personal mythology.\\" What happened at the stage?","output":"At the stage, Sun Ra was with the beings from Saturn who had little antennas on their ears and eyes. They talked to him and told him to stop going to college because there would be big problems in schools and the world would be very messy. They said that he would speak through his music, and the whole world would listen.

Write an article with the title: \\"Walmart's Doug McMillon to replace Mike Duke as chief executive\\"","output":"Title: Walmart's Doug McMillon to replace Mike Duke as chief executive Introduction Step 1: Introduce the topic by mentioning the key news - Doug McMillon replacing Mike Duke. Reasoning: Readers need to know the main subject of the article in the first few sentences, allowing them to decide whether to continue reading or not. In a major announcement, retail giant Walmart has confirmed that Doug McMillon will be taking the reins from the outgoing Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mike Duke. This significant change in leadership is expected to herald a new era for the company, with McMillon bringing his own distinct vision to the role. Background on Doug McMillon Step 2: Provide relevant background information on Doug McMillon. Reasoning: Readers need context on who McMillon is and why his appointment is noteworthy. Fifty-three-year-old McMillon is no stranger to Walmart, having started his career with the company more than three decades ago as an hourly summer associate. Climbing the corporate ladder through various management positions and international assignments, McMillon was eventually appointed as the head of Walmart's international division in 2009. This gave him oversight of the retailer's operations in 26 countries, hugely influencing his preparations for the top job. Mike Duke's Tenure  Step 3: Briefly discuss Mike Duke's tenure as the CEO. Reasoning: A reference to the outgoing CEO provides a clear contrast and highlights the changes that might be expected under the new leadership. Mike Duke's time as Walmart's CEO was marked by global expansion and growth in e-commerce, though the company also faced several challenges, including labor disputes and scrutiny over their business practices. Under Dukes leadership, Walmart expanded its operations further into Asia and Africa, which helped cement its position as a dominant player in the retail industry. The Transition Plan  Step 4: Discuss the transition plan and timeline for the change in leadership. Reasoning: To give readers an idea of how and when the change will be implemented. Walmart has announced that the transition in leadership will be effective from February 1, 2023, allowing for a smooth handover process between Duke and McMillon. During this period, McMillon will work closely with the board of directors and the leadership team to ensure a seamless transfer of responsibilities. McMillon's Challenges and Vision  Step 5: Enumerate the challenges and vision that McMillon will face as the new CEO. Reasoning: This provides insight into the company's future direction and explores how McMillon's appointment may impact the organization. As the new CEO, McMillon will be tasked with navigating various challenges, including increased competition from e-commerce companies like Amazon, addressing environmental concerns and supply chain management, and maintaining good labor relations amidst a changing workforce landscape. McMillon's success will largely depend on his ability to bring a fresh perspective to Walmart's operations and continue to innovate in a rapidly evolving retail space.

Josip Broz Tito: On 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by Milovan Đilas and Tito about \\"self-management\\" (samoupravljanje): a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced profit sharing and workplace democracy in previously state-run enterprises which then became the direct social ownership of the employees. On 13 January 1953, they established that the law on self-management was the basis of the entire social order in Yugoslavia. Tito also succeeded Ivan Ribar as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalization of relations between two nations. Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologized for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration. Tito visited the USSR in 1956, which signaled to the world that animosity between Yugoslavia and USSR was easing. However, the relationship between the USSR and Yugoslavia would reach another low in the late 1960s. Commenting on the crisis, Tito concluded that: Please answer a question about this article.

Nearby, farmer Gene Green also spies the object, and believing it to be Halley's Comet, he ventures into the woods to find the impact site. He instead stumbles upon a large circus tent-like structure, and he and his dog are abruptly captured by mysterious clown-like aliens, the \\"Klowns\\". Shortly thereafter, Mike and Debbie arrive to investigate for themselves. Entering the structure, they discover a complex interior with elevators and various bizarre rooms. They soon find a gelatinized Green encased in a cotton candy-like cocoon and are spotted by a klown, who shoots popcorn at them from a large gun. The couple flees, pursued by a group of klowns and a balloon animal dog that comes to life. Narrowly escaping, Mike and Debbie travel to the police station to report the incident to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson, and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney. The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then travel to the lovers' lane, only to find all the cars abandoned and covered in a cotton candy-like substance.

In May 1948, following the British withdrawal, King Farouk sent the Egyptian army into Palestine, with Nasser serving in the 6th Infantry Battalion. During the war, he wrote of the Egyptian army's unpreparedness, saying \\"our soldiers were dashed against fortifications\\". Nasser was deputy commander of the Egyptian forces that secured the Faluja pocket. On 12 July, he was lightly wounded in the fighting. By August, his brigade was surrounded by the Israeli Army. Appeals for help from Jordan's Arab Legion went unheeded, but the brigade refused to surrender. Negotiations between Israel and Egypt finally resulted in the ceding of Faluja to Israel. According to veteran journalist Eric Margolis, the defenders of Faluja, \\"including young army officer Gamal Abdel Nasser, became national heroes\\" for enduring Israeli bombardment while isolated from their command. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How badly was Nasser wounded?","output":"It is not possible to provide a precise measurement of the severity of Gamal Abdel Nasser's injury sustained in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Group (mathematics): A group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements. The number of elements is called the order of the group. An important class is the symmetric groups SN, the groups of permutations of N letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters S3 is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ABC, i.e. contains the elements ABC, ACB, ..., up to CBA, in total 6 (or 3 factorial) elements. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group SN for a suitable integer N (Cayley's theorem). Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S3 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Please answer a question about this article.

For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

Alternately add flour mixture and milk ( starting and ending with the flour mixture ) , while mixing on low speed . Continue to mix until smooth . Pour into prepared pans . Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center of cake comes out clean . Answer the following question: What would happen if the cake was put in the oven for 50 minutes ?","output":"If the cake was put in the oven for 50 minutes instead of the recommended 30 to 35 minutes, the following would likely happen: 1. Overbaking: The extended baking time would result in an overbaked cake, which could lead to a dry and crumbly texture. This is because the excess heat would evaporate more moisture from the cake than intended. 2. Browning or burning: The cake might also brown or burn on the outside, making it unappealing to eat. The high temperatures could cause the sugars and proteins in the cake to overreact and produce unpleasant flavors. 3. Possibly uneven baking: Because the cake is expected to be done within 30 to 35 minutes, the additional time in the oven might cause the cake to be overbaked on the edges and possibly still slightly underbaked in the center, leading to an uneven outcome. 4. Risk of the cake sinking: As the cake bakes longer than intended, the structure of the cake may weaken, causing it to possibly sink in the center once it's removed from the oven. To avoid these problems, it's essential to follow the recommended baking time and check for doneness using a cake tester or toothpick during the suggested time window."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The state highway runs 5.38 mi from MD 155 in Hopewell Village north to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Darlington. MD 161 connects Havre de Grace with Susquehanna State Park and northeastern Harford County. The state highway was mostly constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the text. \\"The state highway was mostly constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\\" Step 2: Compare the information from the sentence to the text. The sentence states, \\"Construction of Maryland Route 161 was done in 1933.\\" The text states, \\"The state highway was mostly constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\\" Step 3: Evaluate if the sentence is true based on the information from the text.  Since the text states that MD 161 was mostly constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, it is possible that some construction took place in 1933. However, the text does not specifically confirm that the construction was completed in 1933. Conclusion: Based on the available information, it cannot be definitively determined if the sentence is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is it right that males are more sexual than females? Do men want sex more than women? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"These two questions, while addressing similar aspects of gender and sexual desire or behavior, are not quite the same and each requires a nuanced examination. The subject is complex and involves biological, psychological, and societal factors. 1. \\"Is it right that males are more sexual than females?\\" This question seems to be asking about the inherent nature of male and female sexuality. Often, the question hinges on societal ideas of men being more 'sexual' beings than women. That said, sexual desire and behavior vary from person to person, regardless of sex and gender, and it's not accurate to say that one gender is \\"more sexual” than the other. Biologically, it's argued that men might possess a higher sex drive due to factors such as testosterone levels; however, this doesn't necessarily mean that men are more \\"sexual.” Women, too, have libido-determining hormones, and recent studies have suggested that women's sexual desires might be more complex than previously thought.  From a societal standpoint, there are cultural norms and taboos that tend to suppress women's sexuality more than men's. Men may feel more social pressure to brag about or exaggerate their sexual desires and history, while women might feel more pressure to downplay theirs.  There are exceptions and outliers in both genders, however. It's essential to note that many factors can affect an individual's sexuality, including age, stress levels, religion, personal beliefs, mental health, relationships, and life circumstances.  2. \\"Do men want sex more than women?\\" This question is a little more specific, but still broad, as it asks directly about the desire for sex. Various research over time shows that men, on average, report thinking about sex more frequently than women and may express a desire for a higher number of sexual partners and more frequent sexual encounters. However, this doesn't mean that every man wants sex more than every woman - one must always consider individual differences. Moreover, it also could be influenced by social expectations, as discussed earlier. Women may under-report their sexual desires due to societal expectations or perceptions. An important point to bring in here is that women's desire is often responsive rather than spontaneous, as per some research. This means women may not initiate or actively seek out sex as often as men do but might be just as into the act once it starts.  Overall, these studies merely indicate trends and averages; they don't uniformly apply to all men or women. In conclusion, while there can be typical patterns in the sexual behaviors or desires of males and females due to both biological and societal factors, these don't define or limit the range of individual's sexual behavior or interest. Therefore, each question is approaching the topic from a slightly different angle - one is more focused on sexual nature in general, and the other is more directed towards the desire for sex. They are connected but not exactly the same. Remember, sexuality is deeply personal and varies significantly from person to person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Environmentalists split over green group's fracking industry ties In 2012, when Ohio’s Senate passed a controversial hydraulic fracturing bill that was supported by the oil and gas industry, environmental groups lined up against it, saying it would endanger public health. But during hearings on the bill, it gained one seemingly unlikely supporter: the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), one of the nation’s largest green groups. The bill supported renewable energy development but it also contained several items other environmental groups said were giveaways to the industry: It allowed fracking companies to keep private the chemicals they used in fracking, changed the required distance for contamination testing around a well from 300 feet to 1,500 feet, and prevented doctors from sharing information that might be considered trade secrets, even if it was in the interest of public health. Matt Watson, one of EDF’s policy analysts, said at the hearing, “We would like to commend the General Assembly and the governor for the thoughtful approach that has been put forward.” The group’s support for the bill highlighted a growing divide in the environmental movement, especially when it comes to natural gas. As fracking has expanded to dozens of states across the country, environmentalists have essentially been split into two camps: those who believe the process must be stopped at all costs, and those who believe drilling is inevitable, and so it’s better to work with industry on making it safer for the environment. But a new report critical of that latter group suggests that at least in some cases, environmental organizations’ work with the industry may cross ethical lines, and at worst become tacit support of industry-backed positions. The new report, released by Buffalo-based non-profit Public Accountability Initiative, focuses on one group called the Center for Sustainable Shale Development, which is a partnership between gas drilling companies, environmental groups and other nonprofits. CSSD’s mission is to promote safe drilling of shale — the kind of rock that fracking breaks up — in the Appalachian Basin. The group doesn’t try to hide its industry connections, and the names of the environmental groups that support it are clearly listed on the center’s website. But PAI’s report posits that the group is less a way for environmentalists to influence the oil and gas industry than it is a way for the industry to promote its agenda with the stamp of approval of green groups like EDF. Among the report’s findings: the group’s executive director, Susan Packard LeGros, is a former oil industry lawyer who worked with oil, gas and chemical companies. One of the group’s board members, Jared Cohon, also worked at a similar group called the Center for Indoor Air Research, which was found to have strong ties to tobacco companies. And one of the group’s new supporters, the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, was started by a titan of the oil and gas industry. “[Environmental groups] are pouring money into calming fears and calming objections,” said Vera Scroggins, a prominent anti-fracking activist in Pennsylvania. “They’re basically promoting something that’s been created by the industry.” The new report comes a year after PAI originally looked into CSSD. That report found similar evidence of other CSSD members and supporters being linked to the oil and gas industry in ways not disclosed by CSSD. Since that report, three non-profits dropped out of CSSD, including the Heinz Endowments, the William Penn Foundation, and the Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future. “We disagree with the position suggested by the organization’s name that fracking can be made environmentally ‘sustainable,’ and given the pace of shale development we do not believe that the goals of protecting environmental and public health are best served at this point by standards that are voluntary and unenforceable,” Heinz Endowments said in a statement. Several groups, including EDF, the Clean Air Task Force, the Group Against Smog and Pollution, and the Pennsylvania Environmental Council are still participating in CSSD. Supporters of the groups say it’s important to not let perfection become the enemy of progress. “If unconventional shale gas development is going to proceed, it needs to be done with strong and enforceable regulation and it needs to adapt so it can get better and better,” said Davitt Woodwell, the president of the Pennsylvania Environmental Council. “For us, the only way to do that is to understand what the industry is doing and how they operate so you can put forward strong proposals.” Woodwell says whether you support fracking or don’t, it’s important to face reality and work to make an already-existing process better. But PAI’s executive director Kevin Connor says the working-in-tandem approach does more harm for the environmental movement than good. “They put a friendly face on the dirty work that these industries do,” Connor said. Regardless of whether collaboration is beneficial or detrimental, some say it’s inevitable. Michael Yaziji, a professor at Switzerland-based business school IMD, and co-author of a book about the partnerships and conflicts between non-profits and corporations, says in a world where green groups are competing for resources and volunteers, it makes sense that they use different tactics to stand out: Some promise to make progress by working with an industry, while others build their credibility among donors and supporters by taking a strong stance against it. “The NGOs are almost like an industry,” Yaziji said. “They serve their stakeholders — their funders and their constituents. So they have to ask, ‘what differentiates us from the competition?’” Yaziji says the dynamic is nothing new: Cement giant LaFarge collaborated with the World Wildlife Fund on CO2 reduction initiatives for 13 years, until 2013. Oil and gas giant Shell has partnered with several organizations, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But with fracking so prominent in today’s news, and expanding so rapidly across the U.S., it seems the collaborations are being met with more anger and passion than ever before. “The whole premise of [this kind of collaboration] is that we can just nicely ask these companies to not pollute us, and that’s never going to work,” said Alison Auciello, an organizer for Food and Water Watch in Ohio. “They’re kind of standing directly in the way of what we’re doing.” Summary:","output":"Camps within the environmentalist community are divided over the fracking industry, which many believe is inevitable and requires assistance to make it safer for the environment. In 2012, a hydraulic fracturing bill was passed in Ohio, which enabled renewable energy development but also allowed fracking companies to maintain privacy over the chemicals they used and prevented doctors from sharing trade secrets relating to public health. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), one of the largest green groups in the US, supported the bill. Critics argue that the fracking industry should be stopped altogether, however, some environmentalist groups work with the industry to ensure the best possible solution is found."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. This show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between \\"Pushing Daisies\\" style and anyone else's was not a steal. (Yes, I've seen \\"Amelie.\\" \\"Pushing Daisies\\" is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original.) Rather, there are too few shows on TV that have this kind of quirky charm. The greatest similarity is to \\"Dead Like Me\\" but \\"P.D\\" comes by that similarity honestly: Bryan Fuller created both shows. (Both shows involve an \\"undead\\" young woman, For example.) This show never stopped being funny and charming, and it was always odd, yet was consistently humane.I must say a word about the conventions of on-going story lines. some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the death of Chuck's father without consequences of any kind. First of all, this must be a new definition of \\"without consequences of any kind\\" because, in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of Chuck's father, he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done. Further, about a dozen episodes into the series, Ned finally did confess to Chuck that he had caused her father's death with his gift. Now, there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life, so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance. In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck, who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon.But this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas. I remember when David Caruso's character on \\"NYPD Blue\\" did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it--for a whole year--then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job (and left the show). The point is, viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode, and is not caught in that episode, that he has gotten away with it. There is always next week--and maybe even next year.","output":"Based on the content of the review, it seems to have a positive tone.

Read this article and answer this question Following their victory over the Patriots, the Steelers remained at home the next week for their second match-up of the season against division rivals the Baltimore Ravens.  The Ravens scored first with an 18-yard field goal by kicker Billy Cundiff, the only points scored in the first quarter by either team.  Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham answered with a 36-yard field goal early in the second quarter, and a 30-yard field goal near the end, but both of these were quickly matched by Baltimore's Cundiff with a 43-yard and 51-yard field goal, respectively, giving Baltimore a 9-6 lead at halftime.  The Ravens then increased their lead in the third quarter when Ray Rice scored the first touchdown of the game on a 4-yard run.  The Steelers rallied hard in the fourth quarter, with running back Rashard Mendenhall making a 1-yard run to score a touchdown, and then taking the lead for the first time in the game when quarterback Ben Roethlisberger made a successful 25-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace in the endzone for a second touchdown.  On their final drive of the game, the Steelers were ready to potentially increase their lead with a 47-yard field goal kick by Shaun Suisham, but a 5-yard delay of game penalty put them out of field goal range and they were instead forced to punt the ball to the Ravens.  The Ravens then began a 92-yard drive, culminating in a 26-yard touchdown pass by quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Torrey Smith in the endzone with just 8 seconds remaining, giving them the game.

What if I tell you that we can make them even more yummy and crunchy? Today, we will talk about a special and tasty combination of French fries, bacon, and chilli! This fantastic dish is called Bacon and Chilli Fries. It's very easy to make, and you can have it as a snack or even share it with your friends during a playdate. Let me tell you how we can create this amazing treat! First, let's talk about French fries. They are long, thin pieces of potatoes that are fried in oil. Usually, people eat French fries with a little bit of salt, and sometimes with ketchup. But, we are going to make them even better by adding some bacon and chilli. Have you ever tasted bacon? Bacon is a type of meat that comes from a pig. It's really tasty and a little bit salty. When you cook bacon, it becomes crispy and crunchy. To make our Bacon and Chilli Fries, we need to cook the bacon first. Ask an adult to help you with this step because cooking bacon needs some heat, and we don't want you to get hurt. Once the bacon is cooked, we need to break it into small pieces. Sprinkle these pieces of fried bacon over the top of your French fries. Now your fries are getting some of that delicious crunch!

I get home home exhausted but willing to watch the kids I mean they r old enough it isnt much to ask. Plus it is almost dinner time.  She then gathers up her purse and claims she needs to get some craft crap for our daughter. Then tells me to make dinner. At this point I take stock of the apartment and clothes are everywhere. My son's room has a pile of clean clothes on the floor, she left them. The dishes haven't been done. Basically it is not a shit show but it is working on it.  I said screw it made dinner and did the dishes. (Still haven't slept yet) she gets home and I let her have it. She claims I am being an ass cause I am gone.

Plot title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Meganâs inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before itâs found. Getting the intranet (no Internet is available) to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school.

My question: what are the psychological tests?","output":"The movie \\"Bad Kids Go to Hell\\" doesn't specify the exact psychological tests that Dr. Day conducts on the students. It's described that he examines their personalities and triggers their demeanors to understand their individual characters better, and he records each session. Psychological testing can include various tests that study the individual's behavior, intelligence, personality traits, certain skills, or specific clinical issues. The notion of 'triggering their demeanors' suggests that Dr. Day might be employing projective tests, situational tests, or other forms of behavioral observation to elicit reactions from the students that reveal more about their psychological states. However, the specific tests used by Dr. Day in the movie are not given in the plot description, and would likely be visible through the specific scenes in the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert in northern England late Monday, killing over a dozen people and injuring dozens in what police say they are treating as a terrorist attack. (AP... (Associated Press)      MANCHESTER, England (AP) — An explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert attended by thousands of young music fans in northern England, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens in what police said Tuesday was being treated as a terrorist attack.      Greater Manchester Police said 19 people were confirmed dead after the explosion at Manchester Arena. Northwest Ambulance Service said 59 injured people had been taken to hospitals, and a number of \\"walking wounded\\" were treated at the scene.      Police cars, bomb-disposal units and 60 ambulances raced to the scene as the scale of the carnage became clear.      \\"We are currently treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise,\\" said Ian Hopkins, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police.      There was panic after the explosion, which struck around 10:30 p.m. (2130GMT) Monday night as Grande was ending the concert, part of her Dangerous Woman Tour.      Grande, who was not injured, tweeted hours later: \\"Broken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don't have words.\\"      Manchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended.      One witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said \\"Thank you, Manchester,\\" before leaving the stage.      The incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another.      Taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down.      City officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident.      Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for.      Jenny Brewster said she was leaving the concert with her 11-year-old daughter when the blast hit.      \\"As I turned around, boom, one loud noise,\\" she told Sky News. \\"A gentleman said 'run!' so we ran.\\"      Outside, she said, \\"you could smell the burning.\\"      Britain's terrorist threat level stands at \\"severe,\\" the second-highest rung on a five-point scale, meaning an attack is highly likely.      There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Online, supporters of the extremist Islamic State group, which holds territory in Iraq's Mosul and around its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, celebrated the blast.      One wrote: \\"May they taste what the weak people in Mosul and (Raqqa) experience from their being bombed and burned,\\" according to the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group.      If the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005.      \\"A huge bomb-like bang went off that hugely panicked everyone and we were all trying to flee the arena,\\" said concertgoer Majid Khan, 22. \\"It was one bang and essentially everyone from the other side of the arena where the bang was heard from suddenly came running towards us as they were trying to exit.\\"      Added Oliver Jones, 17: \\"The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena and people started to run.\\"      Video from inside the arena showed concertgoers screaming as they made their way out amid a sea of pink balloons.      British Prime Minister Theresa May said the government was working to establish \\"the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack.\\"      May is due to chair a meeting of the government's COBRA emergency committee later Tuesday. She and other candidates suspended campaigning for Britain's June 8 election after the blast.      Police advised the public to avoid the area around the Manchester Arena, and the train station near the arena, Victoria Station, was evacuated and all trains canceled.      The Dangerous Woman tour is the third concert tour by 23-year-old Grande and supports her third studio album, \\"Dangerous Woman.\\"      Grande's role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon's high school sitcom \\"Victorious\\" propelled her to teen idol status, starting in 2010.      The tour began in Phoenix, Arizona, in February. After Manchester, Grande was to perform at venues in Europe, including Belgium, Poland, Germany, Switzerland and France, with concerts in Latin America and Asia to follow.      Pop concerts and nightclubs have been a terrorism target before. Almost 90 people were killed by gunmen inspired by the extremist Islamic State group at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris during a performance by Eagles of Death Metal in November 2015.      In Turkey, 39 people died when a gunman attacked New Year's revelers at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul.      There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

News article: President Trump’s new attorney Rudy Giuliani said Thursday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should “close” Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe – a call that comes amid GOP pressure on Capitol Hill to find out whether the investigation has gone beyond its original mandate.      Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, criticized Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in several interviews this week.      “The basis of the case is dead,” Giuliani said on “Fox & Friends” Thursday, claiming the push to uncover collusion with the Russians has turned up no evidence. “Sessions should step in and close it.”      Such a move would seem unlikely. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation due to campaign involvement. Rosenstein stepped in, and appointed Mueller to lead his own probe.      But Giuliani stressed, in a separate interview with Fox News' \\"Hannity\\" on Wednesday, that Sessions and Rosenstein should end Mueller’s investigation “in the interest of justice.”      “There’s been too much government misconduct,” Giuliani said on “Hannity.” “The crimes now have all been committed by the government and their agents.”      Giuliani’s comments come amid pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill urging the Justice Department to release the full “scope memo,” which outlines the original scope of the investigation when Mueller was named.      The Justice Department made public through a court filing a redacted version of the memo, while explaining to Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N.C., that the full, unredacted version could not be shared because it pertains to an ongoing criminal investigation.      Still, members are pushing to find out whether his team is probing matters outside that original scope laid out by Rosenstein.      “On May 17, 2017, I issued an order entitled ‘Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters,’ appointing you to serve as Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice,” Rosenstein wrote to Mueller in the scope memo.      The order states that Mueller is authorized to conduct an investigation “confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony” before the House Intelligence Committee on March 20, 2017, including “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” and “any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation.”      Rosenstein then includes a more extensive list with a “more specific description” of Mueller’s “authority,” but that portion has been heavily redacted.      The unredacted details only outline allegations against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for allegedly committing “a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials” or “arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government.”      The rest of the scope memo is blacked out.      Rosenstein, meanwhile, warned earlier this week that the Justice Department is \\"not going to be extorted\\" after members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus drafted articles of impeachment against him. The articles apparently were drafted as a \\"last resort\\" in lawmakers' fight for documents.      \\"I can tell you there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time and I think they should understand by now: The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,\\" Rosenstein said. \\"We’re going to do what is required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job.\\"      Giuliani made his latest comments as he discussed in depth the 130,000 payment Trump attorney Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016 to stay silent about accusations of an affair with Trump. Giuliani now says Trump reimbursed that money, but did not know at the time what it was for. Trump disputes the Daniels allegations.      Last month, following the FBI’s raid of Cohen’s personal properties, and the revelation that it was referred by Mueller’s office, a spokesman for the special counsel referred Fox News to the U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Title 28, Section 600.4 regarding “additional jurisdiction.”      That section indicates Mueller could expand the scope with DOJ consent.      “If in the course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specific in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the court of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction, or assign them elsewhere,” the code reads.      Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report. ||||| CLOSE The former New York Mayor, who recently joined Trump's legal team, directly contradicted the president's claim that he had no knowledge of Michael Cohen's decision to pay Stormy Daniels 130,000. USA TODAY      President Trump and Rudy Giuliani in 2016 (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)      WASHINGTON — President Trump's new lawyer is casting renewed doubt on whether Trump will sit down with Special Counsel Robert Mueller about the Russia investigation.      Attorney and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said in various interviews on Fox News that the president should not be under oath, in part because of concern that prosecutors may try to lay a perjury trap for the president.      \\"What they’re really trying to do is trap him into perjury, and we’re not suckers,” Giuliani said Thursday on the Fox & Friends morning program.      Giuliani also questioned the need for Trump's testimony, claiming a lack of evidence that Trump had anything to do with Russians who sought to influence the 2016 election with email hacks and fake news.      “This silly deposition is about a case in which he supposedly colluded with the Russians but there’s no evidence,” Giuliani said.      The Mueller investigation has yielded indictments of more than a dozen Russians as well as former Trump associates.      Appearing on Wednesday night with Fox host Sean Hannity, Giuliani said that right now \\"the odds are he wouldn't be interviewed\\" by Mueller, but \\"I don't close my mind to it.\\"      More: Trump could face more legal trouble after confirming he repaid Michael Cohen, watchdogs say      More: Can Robert Mueller subpoena Donald Trump? Only the Supreme Court would know for sure      More: Ty Cobb's departure means Donald Trump's legal team has almost completely turned over      More: Donald Trump acknowledges Stormy Daniels payment, denies affair or use of campaign money      The Mueller and Trump teams have been negotiating for more than four months on possible Trump testimony. Mueller has raised the prospect of a presidential subpoena if Trump refuses to testify, but Giuliani says the special counsel lacks the authority to enforce such a subpoena.      While most of the coverage of Giuliani's recent television interviews concerned a 130,000 Trump payment to former adult actress Stormy Daniels, the president's attorney also had has new things to say about the Mueller investigation and fired FBI Director James Comey.      When Trump fired Comey last year, he and aides said it was because of the way the former FBI director handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the election. Trump later said it had something to do with the Russia investigation.      On Fox, Giuliani said Trump also fired Comey because he refused to say publicly that Trump was not a target in the Russia investigation.      The attorney also called for an interview to last only two to three hours, saying that was the limit President Bill Clinton had when he testified in the Ken Starr/Monica Lewinsky case.      \\"I would like to get, one, not under oath,\\" Giuliani told Hannity. \\"I want a videotape, not videotaped, but audiotapes, I want to make sure they don't misrepresent his answers.\\"      Giuliani's comments reflect a more aggressive attitude by Trump legal team in the wake of a personnel shakeups.      Private attorney John Dowd left the team in March, and White House attorney Ty Cobb announced this week he will be retiring soon. Both had urged a more conciliatory approach to the special counsel.      On Fox & Friends, Giuliani said the odds of an interview became longer after the FBI raided the home and office of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. He also blamed Mueller's office for the public revelation of a list of questions it wants to ask of Trump, though there is no evidence the Special Counsel's office leaked the document.      \\"Now, we are going to have some convincing to do,\\" Giuliani said. \\"They’re going to have to convince us they’re going to be objective and they are not out to get us.”      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rkSzHl ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"President Trump’s new attorney Rudy Giuliani has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to close Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into potential Russian collusion in the 2016 US election.

A passenger jet was forced to make an emergency landing after a mysterious mid-air collision with a 'foreign object' at 26,000ft severely dented its nose cone. The front of the Air China Boeing 757 had been pushed in and scratches and scraped paintwork  were clearly visible when it landed. The plane was climbing over China when a large bang was heard from the front of aircraft. Pictures of the Air China jet show the  damage the mysterious mid-air collision caused to its nose cone after. The pilot said the aircraft was struggling to perform and he immediately called air traffic controllers, according to reports. He was then allowed him to return to the airport. Experts said investigations into the suspected crash have raised suspicions that the aircraft was hit by a 'foreign object'. However, they do not believe it was caused by a bird strike as no blood or feathers were visible on the dented nose cone. The damage was only spotted when the plane, which was travelling from Chengdu to Guangzhou, safely landed. The dented nose cone has caused speculation online that the aircraft hit a UFO as it flew over China. The pictures have prompted online speculation that it was caused by a UFO or a drone strike. Other theories posted on the Aviation Herald include pressure from rapidly heated and expanded air. Former government UFO investigator Nick Pope told The Sun that an examination of the nose cone should reveal what hit it. He said traces of whatever collided with the aircraft should be visible. However, he questioned whether the 'secretive' Chinese would reveal the cause. Mr Pope told The Sun: 'Cases like this show that whatever people believe about UFOs, there are serious air safety issues here. 'MoD and CAA files contain dozens of reports of near misses between UFOs and commercial aircraft. 'It's only a matter of time before there's a catastrophe.' The Air China Boeing 757 (similar to the one pictured) was forced to make an emergency landing. No one was hurt in the mysterious incident. Last week, it emerged that three passenger jet pilots saw UFOs. above Britain's Scientology headquarters on their approach to Gatwick. Airport. A report revealed that they each saw 'two flat, silver discs', with some flying within 100ft. Air traffic control then spotted six UFOs on their radars before they suddenly disappeared. The encounter, which was probed by the UK Airprox Board, happened on December 30 just before 9am over the Scientology headquarters in East Grinstead, Sussex. Highlights:","output":"1.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Shrine Context: The film starts with a man tied to a ceremonial table. Another man then kills him with a sledgehammer to the face. A journalist, Carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing. Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling or too busy to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric's luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric's journal.

Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric's journal. Although English is taught in the villages' school, not all the villagers know how (or are willing) to speak it. They see a man named Henryk butchering a pig then find a girl named Lidia picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl reacts at the sight of Eric in the picture but is hesitant to answer. Before she even can, Henryk calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village.

Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night).

News article: Mets media relations staffer Shannon Forde dead at 44 Shannon Forde was thin and tired, her fight against cancer raging. But this was the World Series and the Mets, the team she worked for and adored, had just lost. So she walked around a subdued clubhouse, patting disappointed players on the back, offering solace. For a while, she sat and talked with Matt Harvey, his arm around her. That was Shannon Dalton Forde. Forde, a beloved part of the Mets for more than two decades, died Friday night at 44 after a long battle with breast cancer, the team said. Her title with the Mets was senior director in the media relations department and the Mets called her a “pioneer for women in baseball public relations.” But she was so much more than that, too. WILLIE RANDOLPH 'HEARTBROKEN' BY DEATH OF SHANNON FORDE \\"Shannon was an absolute inspiration to everyone in this organization, including me, and I told her so,” GM Sandy Alderson, who is undergoing cancer treatment himself, said Friday night, via the Mets. “She was courageous in her fight and never let her illness claim her spirit. “That spirit will remain with the Mets, in our memories and in our hearts.\\" “She fought, fought and fought,” added manager Terry Collins. “She came to work as long as she could. She loved her job and loved the Mets. I have so much admiration for the way she conducted herself the last several years.” Forde was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer in August of 2012, but waged a dignified fight against the disease with the help of her husband, John, and two young children, Nicholas and Kendall. There were plenty of others who showed love for her, too — David Wright and Harvey stood up holding signs with her name on them during the Stand Up to Cancer ceremony at the 2013 All-Star Game. “Shannon was with me my whole career with the Mets,” Wright said. “She helped me so much when I was a rookie. She worked hard to assist my foundation and helped me get acclimated to New York.” Harvey’s never forgotten how, toward the end of his first season in the majors, Forde made him a memory book filled with newspaper stories chronicling all his starts, everything he’d gone through. Harvey knew Forde at that point, but not that well. She loved to laugh with a group of old school friends who dubbed themselves the “Dirty Dozen.” They’d sometimes call Shannon “Pam” — map spelled backward — because she possessed a remarkable sense of direction. WRIGHT ON SHANNON FORDE: 'SHE ALWAYS LEFT YOU WITH A SMILE' A fundraising dinner to help Shannon’s fight back in 2012 drew more than 1,100 people, including Alderson, Collins and stars such as David Cone, Harvey and Darryl Strawberry. Forde, a graduate of St. John’s University, started working for the Mets in 1994. It won’t ever be the same around the team again. “Shannon was a very unique person,” said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon. “I was fortunate to see her a few weeks ago at the rehab facility and had a great time laughing and visiting with her for over an hour. My condolences to her husband, John, two children, Nicholas and Kendall and the Dalton and Forde families. “Citi Field won’t be the same without her contagious smile and genuine personality.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article include: 1. Shannon Dalton Forde, a beloved part of the Mets organization for over two decades, passed away at the age of 44 after a long battle with Stage IV breast cancer, as confirmed by the team. 2. Forde held the title of senior director in the media relations department with the Mets, where she was considered a pioneer for women in baseball public relations. 3. Throughout her career and especially during her fight against breast cancer, Forde received overwhelming support, encouragement, and admiration from her colleagues, including Mets GM Sandy Alderson, manager Terry Collins, and players David Wright and Matt Harvey. 4. Forde was highly involved in charitable and philanthropic activities, such as Wright's foundation, and was well-known for her contagious smile, genuine personality, and strong work ethic. The untimely passing of Shannon Forde is a significant loss for the Mets organization and the sports media industry, as she made a lasting impact through her dedication and positive spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror.  William's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor, who may have encouraged William's hopes for the throne. Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson. The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford, but Harold defeated and killed him at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Within days, William landed in southern England. Harold marched south to confront him, leaving a significant portion of his army in the north. Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings; William's force defeated Harold, who was killed in the engagement.  Although William's main rivals were gone, he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, which may or may not have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government. Answer this series of questions: 1. Who was the leader? 2. Did he have a nickname? 3. Who was his dad? 4. Did he have a dad-like figure? 5. When did Ed die? 6. Did the leader fight with one of Ed's  relatives? 7. Who? 8.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who would complete a 20 yard touchdown pass for Buffalo?","output":"Title: A Deep Dive into Buffalo's Options for a 20-Yard Touchdown Pass Introduction The city of Buffalo is no stranger to passionate football play and exhilarating gridiron action. Over the years, the Buffalo Bills have had their share of trials and triumphs in their quest for victory. One of the franchise's most exciting moments on the field is a 20-yard touchdown pass. With misdirection, speed, excellent ball placement, and on-point quarterbacking, putting points on the board becomes a sight to savour for the fans. This article will explore the potential offensive playmakers who would complete a crucial 20-yard touchdown pass for the Buffalo Bills. Josh Allen – The Franchise Quarterback A centerpiece of the team's resurgence in recent years has been quarterback Josh Allen. Drafted seventh overall in the 2018 NFL Draft, Allen possesses a unique combination of athletic ability, precision, and arm strength. His 6-foot 5-inch frame and rocket arm have made him a fearsome opponent for defenses who struggle to contain his dual-threat ability. With Allen at the helm, a 20-yard touchdown pass is more than attainable, as he can employ his keen eye for spotting open receivers downfield and drive home the throw with velocity and touch. Allen's skill set makes him the most likely candidate to lead the charge in completing a 20-yard touchdown pass for Buffalo. Stefon Diggs – The Explosive, Elite Wide Receiver When it comes to the receiving end of that potential 20-yard touchdown pass, one name immediately jumps to the forefront: Stefon Diggs. Acquired from the Minnesota Vikings prior to the 2020 season, Diggs has made an instant impact on the Buffalo offense. In his first year with the team, he led the league in both receptions (127) and receiving yards (1,535), transforming the Bills' aerial attack into one of the most prolific in the NFL. Diggs' smooth route running, physicality against cornerbacks, and separation skills enable him to excel at pulling in long touchdown passes. With Diggs running a downfield route and Allen throwing the ball, a 20-yard touchdown pass becomes more than just a possibility—it becomes an expectation. Cole Beasley - The Reliable Slot Machine In addition to Diggs, another key player in the Buffalo receiving corps is the versatile Cole Beasley. Known for his quickness and route savvy, Beasley thrives on finding soft spots in the opponents' defensive coverage and providing Allen with a reliable check-down option. However, the 5-foot 8-inch receiver can also surprise defenses with his sneaky speed and ability to break long gains after the catch. With a creative play design, Beasley could shake off defenders and find himself in the end zone, completing the 20-yard touchdown pass from Allen. Gabriel Davis - The Up-and-Coming Speedster Despite being just a rookie, Gabriel Davis has shown flashes of greatness in his first season. The young receiver's physical size (6-foot 2-inch, 216 lbs.) and blazing top-end speed have positioned him as a deep threat and red zone target. Allen has already connected with Davis on several long touchdown passes, showcasing the promising chemistry between the quarterback and the emerging talent. Like Diggs, Davis specializes in breaking away from defenders and putting himself in prime position for scoring big plays. A 20-yard touchdown pass involving Gabriel Davis is not only achievable but likely as he continues to develop and build rapport with Allen. Conclusion The Buffalo Bills have seen their offensive prowess drastically improve in recent years, with a potent passing attack driven by a franchise quarterback and a slew of talented wide receivers. Four key players stand out in the Bills' equation for a successful 20-yard touchdown pass: quarterback Josh Allen, top wide receiver Stefon Diggs, dependable slot man Cole Beasley, and rising star Gabriel Davis. With these playmakers on the field, Buffalo continues to dazzle fans and provide moments of high-flying football excitement. No matter who ultimately catches the touchdown pass, the future looks bright for the Buffalo Bills and their electrifying offense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims.

Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \\"Halo\\"'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and singles \\"Diva\\", \\"Ego\\", \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Video Phone\\". The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \\"first major dance craze\\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \\"You Belong with Me\\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am... World Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing 119.5 million.

Given the question: I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Now, I have a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  Answer this question please: Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","output":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm.  There are several factors at play that contribute to this conclusion. First, let's consider the differences in their farming practices as they pertain to fertilizer use. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes and, as a result, has significantly increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. On the other hand, Kenny grows tomatoes, which are not currently in season, so his use of fertilizer is low. When there is heavy rainfall, as mentioned in the given situation, rain dissolves the fertilizer in the soil and runoff carries it away. This runoff eventually ends up in bodies of water, including the ponds located downstream from Bobby and Kenny's farms. Since Bobby is using a significantly higher amount of fertilizer compared to Kenny, it is expected that the runoff from Bobby's farm will contain a greater concentration of nitrogen (a key component of most fertilizers). The presence of nitrogen in the water acts as a fertilizer, promoting the growth of algae. When there is an overabundance of nitrogen, it can lead to uncontrollable algae growth, which consumes carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die off, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume oxygen during the decomposition process. This, in turn, depletes the oxygen in the water and creates dead zones where little to no aquatic life can survive due to the lack of oxygen. In this situation, the higher concentration of nitrogen-rich runoff from Bobby's farm will contribute to a larger algal bloom in the ponds downstream. This will ultimately lead to more oxygen being consumed by decomposers as they break down the dead algae, resulting in a greater depletion of oxygen levels in the ponds near Bobby's farm. Meanwhile, Kenny's low use of fertilizer, combined with the fact that his tomatoes are not in season, will result in less nitrogen runoff and, consequently, a smaller impact on the oxygen levels in the ponds near his farm. In conclusion, due to the difference in fertilizer usage and the impact of nitrogen runoff on algal growth and oxygen depletion, Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm compared to Bobby."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: A 20-year-old Missouri man has been arrested in last week's shooting of two St. Louis County police officers, county officials announced Sunday. Jeffrey Williams was arrested Saturday night and is charged with two counts of assault in the first degree, three counts of armed criminal action and firing a weapon from a vehicle, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said during the afternoon press conference. McCulloch said Williams was “out there earlier that evening as part of the demonstration” and told police that he fired shots at someone he had a dispute with, and hit the officers, who he alleges were not his intended target. \\"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,\\" McCulloch said, adding that there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of firing from. But several activists who've been involved in the protests since the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer told The Associated Press they were not familiar with Williams. Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated. She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters — who also hadn't heard of him. Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement. \\"This is a fear tactic,\\" she said. \\"We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before.\\" John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, \\"I don't know him. I've never seen him.\\" McCulloch said Williams’ story of a dispute with another person -- including that he did not target the police -- is still part of the investigation, which is ongoing. McCulloch said the .40-caliber handgun that matches the shell casings recovered at the scene of the officers’ shootings was found in Williams’ residence, which police searched after obtaining a warrant based on information received from the public. Williams, who is being held on 300,000 cash bond, had a warrant out on him because he is on probation for receiving stolen property and has failed to appear to his parole officer for the past seven months, McCulloch said. Williams is scheduled to appear in county court in Clayton Monday morning. St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he didn't know whether Williams had an attorney or when he'd appear in court. A message left at the St. Louis County Justice Center was not immediately returned. Tips from the public were key in leading police to Williams, and McCulloch urged anyone with information to contact local law enforcement with further information. The officers -- a 41-year-old St. Louis County officer and a 32-year-old officer from Webster Groves -- were shot Thursday as protests were winding down following the resignation of Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. Jackson was the sixth city official to leave office following a Justice Department review of the city's law enforcement practices. Both wounded officers were released from the hospital Thursday, and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- who called the attack an ambush -- said they could have been killed. The St. Louis County officer was shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet exiting through his back. The officer from Webster Groves was shot in the right cheek, just below the eye. The bullet became lodged behind his ear. The shots were believed to come from a handgun across the street from the police department. The gunman may have fired from up to 120 yards away, a distance longer than a football field. But with a line of roughly 20 officers standing in front of the building, the shooter did not have to be particularly accurate to hit two of them, Belmar said. Belmar said Friday detectives were working around the clock to crack that case. The department's top priority, he said, was to continue \\"a tempo of service and protection and relationships\\" that ensure Ferguson does not \\"have a regression from all that we've done since last fall.\\" The gunfire drew instant, broad condemnation from activists. Dozens of protesters gathered again Thursday night in Ferguson, expressing sympathy for the wounded officers and praying for peace during a candlelight vigil. \\"We cannot afford these kinds of incidents happening. That gets us absolutely nowhere,\\" said St. Louis activist John Gaskin III. He called the gunfire \\"disgraceful and cowardly\\" and said people \\"need to be working for reforms and justice, not revenge.\\" Robinson said the wounding of the officers \\"definitely set us back.\\" But he believes protesters can regain what they lost. \\"Even last night as we protested, police were very gracious to us,\\" he said Friday. \\"That shows a lot of trust to us.\\" Gaskin said protesters should take stock in the Ferguson house cleaning they helped achieve. \\"Although the work is not nearly done,\\" he said, \\"this is a time for practitioners of democracy to pat themselves on the back for significant change.\\" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Sunday that the arrest \\"sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated\\" and praised \\"significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department.\\" President Obama condemned the shooting of the officers, saying that though the city's law enforcement practices were \\"oppressive and objectionable,\\" there was \\"no excuse\\" for violence. Obama made the remarks during a taped appearance on ABC's \\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\\" Thursday. Brown's family issued a statement Thursday condemning the shooting. \\"We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement,\\" the statement read. \\"It cannot and will not be tolerated.\\" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the City Council issued a joint statement saying they support \\"peaceful protesting\\" but \\"will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying actions.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 'Pansexual' rises on National Coming Out Day On National Coming Out Day 2015, it appeared that more people came out on Twitter and Instagram as pansexual or bisexual than as lesbian or transgender, a Vocativ analysis showed. Vocativ used our technology to analyze more than 329,597 Twitter and Instagram posts from October 11 about National Coming Out Day, revealing that more than 3,600 of them — including retweets — mentioned the word \\"pansexual.\\" The term was posted more than \\"lesbian\\" or \\"transgender\\" combined. Pansexual, which means someone who's experience of attraction is not limited by biological sex or gender identity, is one of the fastest growing queer identities used by youth online, especially among American teens and girls. On Sunday, many others identified themselves online as bisexual, with an estimated 1,431 Twitter and Instagram posts mentioning the term. Among 43,369 posts about National Coming Out Day that specifically included \\"I\\" and \\"I am,\\" \\"bisexual\\" was the second most-posted descriptor after the all encompassing \\"gay.\\" \\"Pansexual\\" followed. That doesn't necessarily mean that lesbian or transgender people are less prominent in queer networks. It does, however, indicate that a growing number of young people who could have previously been overlooked in queer representation because they also date members of the opposite sex are now using social media to broadcast their queerness and celebrate the diversity of queer sexuality. Several hundred posts from National Coming Out Day also used the hashtag #questioning, with young people sharing that they are exploring their own gender identity. Many others posted #transisbeautiful, which was among the post popular hashtags on Sunday. The post \\"Pansexual\\" Rises On National Coming Out Day appeared first on Vocativ.
