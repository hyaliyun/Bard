Turkish is a member of the Turkic language family; it has been the official language of Turkey since 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk established the Republic of Turkey and initiated a language reform to replace many Arabic and Persian-origin words with words derived from ancient Turkish roots. The sentence you provided translates to: \\"Tadic visited the monastery again on Thursday, January 7. [Getty Images]\\" Turkish is a unique language with various special characteristics. For instance, it has vowel harmony, which means that vowels within a word must harmonize with each other in terms of certain features, like frontness or roundness. Turkish is also an agglutinative language, which denotes that it attaches various suffixes to a root word to express grammatical relationships between words. Unlike English, Turkish has a Subject-Object-Verb word order, and uses postpositions instead of prepositions. Furthermore, Turkish has a rich literature and incorporates various dialects spoken across Turkey and in several other countries where Turkish-speaking communities reside, including Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, and Iraq, among others. It is also one of the recognized minority languages in several countries. Turkish language has been influenced by various other languages over the centuries, including Persian, Arabic, French, Italian and English. However, with the language revolution in the 1930s, the Turkish Language Institution has made great efforts to purify the Turkish language and substitute foreign words with old or newly coined Turkish ones. Despite its perceived complexity due to agglutination and grammatical rules, Turkish is an interesting and rewarding language to learn for its unique structure, rich history, and the broad geographic span of its speakers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time. What was the term of office for a priest in Rome?","output":"In ancient Rome, once a priest was elected by the collegia, they held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine.

You also want to make sure sexual desires in a relationship are mutually fulfilled. Talk to your partner about alternatives to penetrative sex.  Kissing can be a very sexually stimulating, especially if you kiss your partner on sensitive areas like the neck and the ears. If your partner is not ready to have sex, you can both gain some sexual pleasure from simple kissing.  You can also touch your partner in sexually sensitive areas. The breasts, the penis, and the clitoris are all very sensitive body parts. If your partner is open to it, you may enjoy sexual touching instead of actual intercourse. Oral sex can also be a pleasurable activity for you and your partner. However, keep in mind if your partner is abstinent due to moral or religious, reasons he or she may consider oral sex a form of sex.  Mutual masturbation is another alternative to sex. This is where you and your partner masturbate together. This can be an arousing form of sex play that does not involve physical contact with your partner.  There are a variety of forms of sexual contact and sex play you can engage in without having penetrative sex. The best way to figure out what works for you and your partner is to discuss and explore your options together. Many couples find watching porn or reading erotica together an intimate, arousing experience. This can also help you get a sense of what your partner finds arousing. If you have sex at some point in the future, it can be helpful to know what turns your partner on. Talk to your partner about watching pornography or reading erotica together. You can feel intimate with your partner as the two of you can explore your sexual desires together. Keep in mind not everyone is comfortable watching pornography or reading erotica. Remember to be respectful if your partner does not want to participate in this activity. Physical contact is not the only route to intimacy. Becoming emotionally intimate is very important in a successful relationship. Talking, listening, enjoying one another's company, and sharing thoughts and feelings can help establish emotional intimacy.  Talk to your partner. Engage in activities like long walks, long phone calls, and late night conversations. Go out to a coffee shop for a few hours and simply converse. Be willing to be vulnerable and share with your partner. Meet your partner's emotional needs. If your partner needs to talk to you after a hard day, try to give him or her your full attention. Provide comfort when necessary. Sometimes, it can be hard to figure out how to best comfort someone. People respond differently to different kinds of feedback and comfort. It can be helpful to ask your partner something like, \\"What can I do to make you feel better right now?\\" Emotional intimacy takes time to establish. The best way to be emotionally intimate is to simply spend a lot of time together. Make time to talk to your partner every day. Summary:","output":"In a romantic relationship, physical intimacy is important but not the only route to closeness. If your partner is a virgin or not ready for penetrative sex, you can explore alternatives like kissing, touching sensitive areas, oral sex, and mutual masturbation.

There is a minor grammatical variation between \\"on\\" in the first sentence and \\"in\\" in the second, but in the context of political districts, both \\"on\\" and \\"in\\" are generally understood to mean that the subject (Riverside) is physically located within the described district. Therefore, the two sentences essentially mean the same thing. The second sentence seems to utilize a more preferred style in English context, however, the message conveyed in both cases is essentially identical."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Native Hawaiians (Hawaiian: kanaka \`oiwi, kanaka maoli, and Hawai\`i maoli) are the aboriginal Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands or their descendants. Native Hawaiians trace their ancestry back to the original Polynesian settlers of Hawaii. According to the U.S. Census Bureau report for 2000, there are 401,000 people who identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone or in combination with one or more other races or Pacific Islander groups. 141,000 people identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone. Context: Another important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawai\`i State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawai\`i political stars Benjamin J. Cayetano, John D. Waihee III, and Jeremy Harris enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\`i in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park).  Besides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai\`i used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawai\`i, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the Territory of Hawai\`i in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawai\`i as public lands in 1959.  OHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawai\`i through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. Rice v. Cayetano--suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections--reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawai\`i, regardless of ethnicity. Question: what did it do?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Office of Hawaiian Affairs, or OHA, was created to help native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general by making their lives better. They were given control of some important lands that belonged to the Hawaiian Kingdom long ago. OHA is like a helpful team with nine members who are chosen by the people living in Hawaii. They make decisions and plans to support native Hawaiians. Before, only native Hawaiians could choose or be part of this team, but in 2000, the big court in the United States said that everyone living in Hawaii should be able to vote for the team members or join the team, no matter where they come from. This made the Office of Hawaiian Affairs more open to all the people in Hawaii."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

News article: Review: 2017 Ford Escape Ford’s best-selling model, save for the mighty F-Series pickup, is the Escape, a compact 5-passenger crossover SUV. People have really come to like crossovers, and thanks to smart strategizing on Ford’s part, people have really come to like the Escape, too. Now, with the crossover market expected to become even more popular over the next few years, Ford gives the Escape a comprehensive update for 2017. Styling modifications accompany new interior components, a revised infotainment system, additional driver assistance and safety technology options, and new turbocharged engines with fuel saving automatic stop/start technology. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. In advance of the 2017 Escape’s arrival in dealerships, Ford gave me a chance to experience the Escape’s updates and upgrades during an early drive on the roads in and around sunny Malibu, California. Ford continues to offer the 2017 Escape in base S, mid-grade SE, and top-dog Titanium trim levels, each donning new front and rear styling that make the SUV more attractive and more like other Ford models. Stern new headlamps give the Escape a decidedly more determined gaze, while a new hexagonal grille evokes its big brother, the Edge. In back, a new tailgate design enhances the Escape’s width, and blocky new taillights feature LED illumination. New for 2017, a Sport Appearance package for SE models dresses the exterior up even more. It includes smoked-appearance lighting and gloss black trim for the mirror caps, grille details, and 19-inch aluminum wheels. Inside, versions with the Sport Appearance package are “sportified” with more aggressive front seat bolsters and unique cloth and leather upholstery with white stitching. READ ABOUT OTHER FOR MODELS IN OUR BUYERS GUIDE HERE. Regardless of trim, however, all 2017 Escapes benefit from a relocated shift lever and a new electronic parking brake, which in turn clears space for new cup holders and additional storage areas for phones and oversized sunglasses. Ford says a new center armrest now provides room for arms of more shapes and sizes while accommodating more stuff under its two-tier lid. And gratefully, the outgoing model’s dowdy four-spoke steering wheel is replaced by a nicely contoured, three-spoke design that feels as good as it looks. Higher-spec Escape models feature Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system, with its eight-inch touchscreen blessed with bright, clear graphics much like those of new Windows devices. This system debuted in last year’s Escape, complete with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone projection technology. For 2017, Ford upgrades the Escape’s Sync 3 with a new FordPass with Sync Connect smartphone app. Through the new app, owners can remotely lock or unlock the vehicle; locate the SUV in a parking lot; check fuel, fluid, and battery levels; and remotely start the engine to pre-heat the cabin in winter or pre-cool the interior in summer. The app also locates nearby Ford dealerships come service time, and if vehicle questions arise or roadside assistance is needed, users may tap a button to chat with a live human being via phone call, text, or email. In the Escape, Sync 3’s touchscreen remains a bit of a reach for short-armed folks, but compared to the old MyFord Touch system its pinch-to-zoom functionality, keyboard-style character input, and vastly clearer interface make the effort worthwhile. Should you prefer to keep your hands on the wheel, Ford also claims to have improved the voice recognition system, which is said to better comprehend spoken commands. Ford continues to offer a 168-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine in the base Escape S model, which is merely adequate. There is plenty to like, however, in the new turbocharged, 179-horsepower 1.5-liter four-cylinder that serves as the standard-issue powerplant for SE and Titanium models. Extremely quiet and always smooth, this tasty turbo attains freeway speeds with a brisk surge of torque, and even with three adults aboard, it handled mountain grades without trouble. With that said, spending another 1,295 installs the Escape’s revised turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. With a brawny 245 horsepower and 275 lb.-ft. of torque, as well as a new twin-scroll turbocharger that nearly eliminates turbo lag, the updated 2.0-liter whisks the Escape to speed swiftly and effortlessly while suffering a mere 1-mpg gas mileage penalty in combined driving. Both turbocharged motors are equipped with a new engine stop/start system, which shuts the engine off while the Escape is idling in traffic or at an intersection in order to get better gas mileage. Because it proves utterly shudder-free in operation, owners may choose never to deactivate it, though they could if they wanted to. Even more seamless is the Escape’s “Intelligent 4WD” system (a 1,795 add-on to either turbo engine) that can send up to 100 percent of the engine’s torque to the front or rear wheels as needed. Aware that most four-wheel-drive crossovers are ultimately “soft-roaders” at best, I summoned the bravery to trek a ways off-road after some roadside photography. To my surprise (and relief) the Escape handled the trail with no problem. Back on the twisty two-lane roads that snake through the mountains near Malibu, the Escape handled most corners with composure, though the steering exhibited an unnatural rubbery feel when exiting tighter turns, as if it was self-centered by Bowflex home gym equipment. This characteristic remains preferable to numb steering that you can turn with one finger, but the relatively high steering effort seemed at odds with the Escape’s other, more fluid controls. Few typical customers will find the Escape’s steering a deal-breaker. Indeed, they may find its velvety ride quality and church-like quietness a dealmaker. Piling on some freeway miles allowed me to try the Escape’s available electronic driving aids, including its active cruise control system and its customizable lane departure warning and lane keeping system, which can simply warn of lane departure via steering wheel vibration, or add gentle counter-steering inputs to bring the vehicle back toward the middle of the lane. Fortunately, I did not find occasion to test the new driver fatigue monitor or the forward collision warning system, which includes brake support but not automatic emergency braking. Another nifty option is the Escape’s enhanced park assist system, which not only ensures bump-free maneuvering into parallel and perpendicular spaces, but also can help extract the Escape from tight parking in the event you’ve gotten boxed in. GET THE LATEST FORD NEWS AND REVIEWS HERE. Pricing for the 2017 Ford Escape starts at 24,495 for the front-wheel-drive S model. I can’t imagine that the S will satisfy many customers when the SE model brings much more equipment, a smooth turbo engine, and more for just 25,995. The loaded Titanium model starts at 29,950, and climbs to 38,315 when fully equipped. That’s not cheap, but Ford believes that the swelling compact crossover SUV segment will produce a few buyers wanting an Escape with “the works.” For everyone else, it’s good to know that there’s plenty of comfort, space, style, and turbocharged performance to be had for less than 30,000. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"Sure little buddy, I'm glad you're curious about the news! This article is about the 2017 Ford Escape which is a type of car called an SUV (stands for Sports Utility Vehicle) and it's sort of like a mix between a car and a truck - big enough to carry a lot of stuff, but still easy to drive.  Ford made a lot of changes to the Escape in 2017. They made the outside look different with a new, bigger front grill and also fancier tail lights at the back. They also changed the inside of the car. They moved some things around like the gear shift lever and the parking brake to make more room for cup holders and little storage areas for things like phones and sunglasses. The car has a special computer screen that helps you control stuff like music and maps. It even works with a phone app that lets you do things like lock and unlock the car, or find it in a parking lot.  The basic model has a pretty good engine, but if you want, you can get a bigger, stronger one that has a turbocharger - that's a part that uses exhaust gas to make the engine more powerful. The car also comes with an \\"Intelligent 4WD\\" system that helps it drive better on tough roads. There are some cool safety features too, like a system to help you park perfectly, and a system to warn you if you are getting sleepy while driving. The price for the 2017 Ford Escape starts from 24,495, but if you want all the extra nice things, it could go up to 38,315. This might seem really expensive, but since a lot of people seem to like this type of car, Ford thinks some people might be willing to pay for it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Maccagnan’s 1st big Jets risk is damning of Bryce Petty Welcome to Phase 37 of the Jets’ endless, often-futile search for a franchise quarterback. With the 20th pick of the second round and the 51st pick overall in the NFL draft on Friday night, the Jets selected Penn State’s Christian Hackenberg, making him the 37th quarterback in a checkered team history that has not included many good ones at the most important position the field. Maybe the Jets were reaching for a little bit of mojo when they had Chad Pennington, one of the best quarterbacks in their history, announce the pick in Chicago. But, unless you believe Hackenberg will be ready to step in immediately as the starter — and you should not — the Jets now lead the league in backup quarterbacks on their roster. They have three of them, including two projects who are not yet ready for NFL prime time, and no starter. With 2015 starter Ryan Fitzpatrick still locked in a contract squabble with the Jets, Geno Smith, Bryce Petty and Hackenberg are the quarterbacks on their current roster. Jets general manager Mike Maccagnan called Hackenberg “a prospect we’re excited about,’’ adding, “We think he has lot of potential and upside.’’ The drafting of Hackenberg does not affect the Fitzpatrick situation. The Jets still want him back. They need him. But he needs them, too, because no team is knocking down his door with a 15 million offer to have him start in 2016. But the drafting of Hackenberg is a damning indictment of both Smith, their second-round pick in 2013, and Petty, whom they drafted in the fourth round last year. It’s not fair and too soon to rip this move, because the potential for Hackenberg is obvious based on his physical skills and the fact he has played three years at a big-time program. But this is the first controversial move of the Maccagnan era, with most of the maneuvers he has made to date somewhat conventional and conservative by comparison. This one raises eyebrows in that a valuable second-round pick was spent on a player who has little to no chance of helping the team in 2016. Speaking to reporters on a conference call shortly after the pick, Hackenberg sounded humbled at being chosen after his well-documented struggles of the last two seasons in Happy Valley. “It’s a new opportunity and a new environment,’’ Hackenberg said in what was probably the most telling statement he made, referring to finally extricating himself from the negative atmosphere Penn State had become in his final two seasons, which included NCAA sanctions and a head coaching change. “I’m super grateful.’’ Jets fans will be the grateful ones if Hackenberg works out eventually, because no team has had more instability at the quarterback position across its history than the Jets. Hackenberg is the 11th quarterback the Jets have drafted since 2000 and the ninth in the past 10 years. The Jets have had 11 different starting quarterbacks since 2000. Other than Mark Sanchez (2009-2012), none has held the job for more than two consecutive seasons. Hackenberg comes to the Jets as damaged goods of sorts — psychologically damaged. Based on his declining numbers in his three seasons at Penn State, negativity and questions persisted. In three years at Penn State, Hackenberg’s completion percentage worsened each season with his 53.5 percent last season the lowest of his career, raising questions about his accuracy. He, too, was sacked 82 times over the last two seasons, raising questions about his mobility. His best year was as a freshman in 2013, when he threw for 2,995 yards with 20 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. “He needs to be rebuilt,” ESPN analyst Todd McShay said on a recent conference call. “He’s just got to regain his confidence,’’ former NFL coach and current ESPN analyst Jon Gruden said before the draft. “I’m just really looking forward to getting better with this opportunity,” Hackenberg said. “A lot of hours have gone into this. This is just the beginning.” Hopefully it is not the beginning of the end of yet another failed attempt by the Jets searching for that elusive franchise quarterback. Summary:","output":"The New York Jets picked Christian Hackenberg, a quarterback from Penn State, in the NFL draft. Some people say this is a risky choice for the Jets, but they hope Hackenberg will do well because the team needs a really good quarterback. Christian Hackenberg is excited for the opportunity and wants to work hard to get better. Jets fans are also hoping that he will be a great player for the team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km). The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige.

Salmon fillets (skin-on or skin-off, according to your preference) 2. Olive oil 3. Lemon juice (freshly squeezed from 1-2 lemons) 4. Salt 5. Pepper 6. Minced garlic (2-3 cloves) 7. Fresh herbs (such as dill or parsley), finely chopped 8. Optional: additional seasonings like honey, soy sauce, or Dijon mustard depending on your desired flavor profile Step 2: Prepare the marinade In a mixing bowl, combine olive oil (around ¼ cup), lemon juice, salt (approximately 1 teaspoon or to your taste), pepper (about ½ teaspoon or to your taste), minced garlic, and your chosen fresh herbs. Mix well. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. If using additional seasonings, add them now and mix well. Step 3: Coat salmon fillets in marinade Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the fillets, making sure they are completely coated. Turn the fillets in the marinade to ensure even coverage. Step 4: Marinate the salmon Seal the plastic bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the marinating salmon for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours. During marination, the fillets absorb the flavors, making them tastier. Marinating for longer than 2 hours is not recommended, as the acid in the lemon juice can start to break down the fish's texture. Step 5: Prepare for baking While the salmon is marinating, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper for easy cleanup. Step 6: Bake the salmon Remove the marinated salmon fillets from the refrigerator and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The internal temperature of the salmon should reach 145°F (63°C). Step 7: Serve Serve the easy baked salmon with your favorite side dishes, such as steamed vegetables, rice, or potatoes.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  Would darker squirrels have greater or smaller chance of survival than lighter squirrels? A:","output":"In Mike's cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction, darker-coated squirrels would have a greater chance of survival than lighter squirrels. The development of different coat colors in squirrels can be attributed to a combination of factors, including natural selection and genetic variation. Darker coats are more suitable in cold environments for two main reasons: 1. Thermoregulation: Darker coats tend to absorb more sunlight and retain more heat, helping the squirrel stay warmer in cold temperatures. This is related to the principle that dark colors absorb more light and convert it into thermal energy. This means that the dark-coated squirrels would be better suited to survive in the cold environment, as they would have an advantage in staying warm. 2. Camouflage: In areas with less predator-prey interaction, the primary reasons behind the different coat colors tend to be related to camouflage. While this may not be as critical a factor in Mike's city, the darker-coated squirrels could still have some advantage in areas with snow, where their dark coats would contrast less against dark tree trunks than lighter coats. This could slightly decrease the chances of them being detected by potential predators like birds of prey. As darker squirrels have a greater chance of survival, natural selection will favor these individuals, and they will be more likely to reproduce and pass on their darker coat genes to future generations. Over time, darker squirrels may become more common in the population due to this survival advantage. However, genetic variation within the population will still lead to the occasional lighter-coated squirrel, maintaining the existence of both colors in Mike's city."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - feeling good - anger - revelation - being fired - tardiness  The answer is \\"feeling good\\" because A:","output":"Going to work on an average day generally tends to induce feelings of accomplishment, productivity, and fulfillment, especially if you enjoy your job and tasks you perform. This leads to a \\"feeling good\\" sensation, as your brain is not only stimulated by meaningful activities, but there are also a sense of purpose and a routine that can have a positive psychological impact. This doesn't mean that work is always enjoyable and without stress, but on an average day, the predominant feeling is typically one of satisfaction or contentment. Now looking at the other options: - Anger is generally not the predominant feeling that one associates with going to work on an average day. While stressful or challenging situations may arise, anger is typically not the default emotion experienced daily. - Revelation implies a significant discovery or insight, which also doesn't usually coincide with everyday work experience. While you may occasionally have moments of revelation at work, they are not a consistent daily occurrence. - \\"Being fired\\" is more of an event or situation rather than a feeling. Also, it's not typical to feel like being fired on an average day at work. - Tardiness refers to being late. While some people may be late to work on occasion, it's not a feeling that would typically characterize an entire day of work, especially for those who adhere to their schedules.

Q: Passage: The Patriots' home opener was a rematch from the 2006 divisional playoffs, against the Chargers on Sunday Night Football. For the second consecutive week, the game began with a touchdown on the Patriots' first series: this time, Brady hit Watson for a 7-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. On the first play of the ensuing Chargers possession, their first, linebacker Rosevelt Colvin intercepted a Philip Rivers pass, but it did not translate into points for the Patriots as Gostkowski then missed a 41-yard field goal attempt on the Patriots' resulting series. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots capped off a 10-play, 75-yard drive with a 23-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 14-0. Colvin then added a sack and forced fumble to his game statistics, as he strip-sacked Rivers after the Chargers reached the Patriots' 34-yard line and defensive lineman Vince Wilfork recovered the fumble for the Patriots' second forced turnover of the game. On the Patriots' next drive, which spanned into the second quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by linebacker Shawne Merriman at the Chargers' 29-yard line, but Brady recovered his own fumble to retain possession for the Patriots. Six plays later, a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 17-0. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots were pushed back to their 10-yard line after another Merriman sack of Brady. The Patriots would punt back to the Chargers, but on a 3rd-and-1 from the Patriots' 37-yard line, Rivers was intercepted by linebacker Adalius Thomas, who returned it 65&#160;yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24-0 lead. The Chargers were unable to get past midfield on their next drive and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line with just under three minutes to play in the first half. A 25-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Chargers safety Marlon McCree would help the Patriots reach the Chargers' 26-yard line, but Brady was intercepted by safety Clinton Hart at the Chargers' 10-yard line. The Chargers then ran one play to end the half. Receiving the kickoff to begin the second half, the Chargers embarked on a 16-play, 72-yard drive, reaching Patriots territory on a 22-yard third down reception by tight end Antonio Gates. Ten plays later, fullback Lorenzo Neal caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to put the Chargers on the scoreboard at 24-7. The Patriots responded by going 75&#160;yards on seven plays, taking a 31-7 lead on a 24-yard Moss touchdown reception, his second of the night. Three plays later, Rivers was intercepted by Patriots safety James Sanders at the Patriots' 38-yard line, but the play was nullified by a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Hobbs. Rivers completions of 19&#160;yards to wide receiver Malcom Floyd and 12&#160;yards to running back Michael Turner helped put the Chargers in the Patriots' red zone, where Rivers completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Gates on the second play of the fourth quarter to cut the Patriots' lead to 31-14.. On the ensuing kickoff, Chargers wide receiver Kassim Osgood forced a fumble of Hobbs after a 31-yard return that was recovered by Chargers cornerback Quentin Jammer at the Patriots' 31-yard line. However, Rivers was sacked twice for losses of 10&#160;yards each on the next two plays, the second of which was a strip-sack by Colvin that was recovered by offensive lineman Kris Dielman; the Chargers punted on 4th-and-30. Starting from their own 9-yard line with more than 13&#160;minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots did not surrender the ball back to the Chargers until there was less than four minutes left in the fourth quarter. This 15-play, 91-yard drive culminated in a 3-yard touchdown run by running back Sammy Morris, extending the Patriots' lead to 38-14. The Chargers could not convert a first down on their next possession, giving the ball back to the Patriots to end the game as they improved to 2-0. Question: How many times was Rivers intercepted?

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Input: Question: How old was Friedrich Hasenöhrl the year that Herzfeld returned to Vienna, and was granted his doctorate? Passage 1:Vondey was the professor of systematic theology at Regent University School of Divinity (Virginia Beach, VA, USA) until 2015, where he also founded and directed the Regent Center for Renewal Studies. Vondey’s Ph.D. from Marquette University is in systematic theology and ethics, and he also has a M.Div. from the Pentecostal Theological Seminary (Cleveland, Tennessee), and M.A. from University of Marburg, Germany. After completing his doctoral dissertation on the work on the Holy Spirit by Roman Catholic theologian, Heribert Mühlen, he went on to author several books on Pentecostalism and Pentecostal theology. He is a member of the steering committee of the European Research Network on Global Pentecostalism, associate editor of the journal, PentecoStudies, and co-editor of the monograph series, CHARIS: Christianity & Renewal - Interdisciplinary Studies (Palgrave Macmillan) and Systematic Pentecostal and Charismatic Theology (Bloomsbury T&T Clark). He organized the ecumenical studies group of the Society for Pentecostal Studies in 2001 and served as its chair until 2005. A classically trained systematic theologian, Vondey is considered a renewal theologian whose work addresses concerns of pneumatology, ecclesiology, ecumenical theology, and the intersection of theology and science. Perhaps his most popular work is his ecclesiology, People of Bread, while his most controversial work is Beyond Pentecostalism: The Crisis of Global Christianity and the Renewal of the Theological Agenda (Eerdmans, 2010). His book, Pentecostal Theology: Living the Full Gospel, proposes a systematic and constructive Pentecostal theology on the historical motif of the full gospel, and received the Pneuma Book Award of the Society for Pentecostal Studies in 2018. He is the editor of the Journal of the European Pentecostal Theological Association since 2019.  Passage 2:In 1902, when Herzfeld was 10 years old, he was enrolled in the private Gymnasium Schottengymnasium, which was run by the Benedictine Order of the Roman Catholic Church and had its name derived from the fact that the founders came from Scotland. He attended this school until 1910, when he began attending the University of Vienna to study physics and chemistry. In 1912, he took courses at the University of Zurich and the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH). It was in Zurich he met Otto Stern, who was at the ETH; Herzfeld later credited conversations with Stern for his deeper understanding of thermodynamics. In 1913, he went to study at the University of Göttingen, after which Herzfeld returned to Vienna, and was granted his doctorate in 1914, under Friedrich Hasenöhrl, who had become Director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics, upon the suicide of Ludwig Boltzmann in 1906.  Passage 3:In the opening season of Chilean Primera División, Herrera scored on his debut in a 2–0 win over Audax Italiano on 29 January 2012. After 3 games without scoring, Herrera scored a brace in a 2–2 draw against Club Deportivo Universidad Católica on 26 February 2012 and scored in the next game on 3 March 2012 in a 3–1 win over C.D. Palestino which followed by the next game on 10 March 2012 in a 3–1 loss against CD Huachipato. On 24 March 2012, Herrera scored twice and setting up a goal for Fernando Cordero in a 5–2 win over Deportes La Serena.

First, we should combine the constants. 184145 - 119297 = 64848 So now the equation becomes: 0 = 1544*z + 64848 Step 2: Isolate z Next, we need to isolate z. We can do this by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. 0 - 64848 = 1544*z - 64848 + 64848 So now the equation becomes: -64848 = 1544*z Step 3: Solve for z Now, we need to solve for z. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z, which is 1544. -64848 ÷ 1544 = 1544*z ÷ 1544 z = -42 Step 4: Check the solution Finally, let's substitute the value of z back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. 0 = 1544*(-42) + 184145 - 119297 0 = -64848 + 184145 - 119297 0 = 0 The solution satisfies the equation, so the correct value of z is -42."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By formally recognizing the act of genocide as a crime, involves the undergoing prosecution that begins with not only seeing genocide as outrageous past any moral standpoint but also may be a legal liability within international relations. When genocide is looked at in a general aspect it is viewed as the deliberate killing of a certain group. Yet is commonly seen to escape the process of trial and prosecution due to the fact that genocide is more often than not committed by the officials in power of a state or area. In 1648 before the term genocide had been coined, the Peace of Westphalia was established to protect ethnic, national, racial and in some instances religious groups. During the 19th century humanitarian intervention was needed due to the fact of conflict and justification of some of the actions executed by the military.

Plot title: The Flowers of War Movie plot: An American mortician, John Miller (Bale), arrives in Nanjing in order to bury the foreign head priest of a convent for Catholic girls, just after the city was bombed and invaded by the Japanese forces. A short time after his arrival at the convent, a group of flamboyant prostitutes from the local red-light district find their way to the compound looking for shelter, as foreigners and foreign institutions seem to be left alone by the marauding Japanese soldiers. While the prostitutes hide out in the cellar, Miller struggles with and finally gives in to his feelings of responsibility to protect the teenage schoolgirls, and poses as the convent's priest when the compound is repeatedly visited by Japanese soldiers looking for girls to rape. With the help of Chinese collaborator Mr. Meng (Kefan), who is the father of one of the girls, he starts to repair the convent's truck in case there should be an opportunity to bring the girls out of Nanjing.Japanese Colonel Hasegawa (Watabe) finally promises to protect the convent by placing guards in front of the gate, and requests that the girls sing a choral for him. After the performance, he hands Miller an official invitation for the girls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for their safety (especially since the guards' main concern seems to be not letting any of the girls leave the compound), Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is not a request, but an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the girls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar looking for her cat), totalling 13.Induced by their de-facto leader Yu Mo (Ni), the prostitutes decide to protect the girls by meeting the Japanese on their behalf.

Question: \\"What might have supported the arches?\\"  Context: \\"From the early 12th century, French builders developed the Gothic style, marked by the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The arches in Gothic architecture, specifically in churches and cathedrals during the early 12th to 16th centuries, might have been supported by the following elements: Step 1: Identify the key supporting elements for Gothic arches In the context provided, the Gothic style incorporated rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and stained glass windows. To understand what supported the arches in this style of architecture, I'll focus on these key elements. Step 2: Understand the role of rib vaults Rib vaults are interwoven arches that create a framework for the ceiling of Gothic structures. The rib vaults transfer the weight of the ceiling down to the walls and, ultimately, to the ground. By providing an arched structure, they supported the side arches of halls and aisles in churches and cathedrals. Step 3: Incorporate the function of pointed arches Pointed arches are a signature feature of Gothic architecture, displaying a soaring vertical aesthetic and potentially creating a sense of spiritual ascension. The pointed arch shape inherently distributes the force more effectively, allowing additional support for the walls and preventing lateral stress. Step 4: Assess the significance of flying buttresses Flying buttresses are external, arched support structures that counterbalance the outward force exerted by the rib vaults and other ceiling components. They allow for thinner walls, larger windows, and enhanced overall stability. These buttresses transfer the structural load from the arches to solid, supporting piers and played a key role in supporting the arches and overall structure of churches and cathedrals. Step 5: Consider the impact of stained glass windows Although stained glass windows are not a direct support for arches, the increase in window size and use of thinner walls enabled by the other supporting elements allowed for the expansive incorporation of stained glass in Gothic architecture. Stained glass windows contributed to the distinct aesthetic of the buildings and showcased a combination of liturgical and narrative scenes. In conclusion, the support for the arches in Gothic architecture was mainly provided by rib vaults, pointed arches, and flying buttresses, which worked together to create a sophisticated load-bearing system. Additionally, stained glass windows played a role in the overall aesthetic of the structure and allowed for expansive storytelling through visual means."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson.  and the situation: Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water.  Answer the following question: In which case the solute would be less soluble, case C or case D?","output":"In the given situation, Keith conducted five tests to study the solubility of different substances. The key distinction between test C and test D is the solute's state and the temperature. In test C, Keith used a gaseous solute in a solvent at room temperature, while in test D, he used the same gaseous solute but increased the temperature.  As described in the background information, the solubility of solid and liquid solutes generally increases with temperature. However, for gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. This behavior is due to the fact that when the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of gas molecules also increases, causing them to escape from the solvent more easily. As a result, the solubility of the gaseous solute decreases. Therefore, in the given situation, the solute will be less soluble in test D compared to test C. This is because test D involves a gaseous solute with an increased temperature, whereas test C has the gaseous solute at room temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This article: For at least 10,000 years, a variety of indigenous peoples populated the Willamette Valley. These included the Kalapuya, the Chinook, and the Clackamas. The territory of the Clackamas encompassed the northeastern portion of the basin, including the Clackamas River (with which their name is shared). Although it is unclear exactly when, the territory of the Chinook once extended across the northern part of the watershed, through the Columbia River valley. Indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley were further divided into groups including the Kalapuyan-speaking Yamhill and Atfalati (Tualatin) (both Northern Kalapuya), Central Kalapuya like the Santiam, Muddy Creek (Chemapho), Long Tom (Chelamela), Calapooia (Tsankupi), Marys River (Chepenafa) and Luckiamute, and the Yoncalla or Southern Kalapuya, as well other tribes such as the Chuchsney-Tufti, Siuslaw and Molala. The name Willamette is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation of the name of a Clackamas Native American village. However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar, so the name may also be derived from Kalapuya dialects. Around the year 1850, the Kalapuya numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; there may have been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both the north and the south side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley.

There's a lost hiker in the mountains near the edge of town. Your task: find the missing person; provide emergency medical treatment, if necessary; and be prepared to operate 48 hours on your own with only the supplies you carry. Sounds like some kind of film's plot? Not if you're a member of the Arapahoe teen rescue patrol in the suburbs of Denver. About 25 teen guys and girls are active members of this search, rescue and emergency organization, and they know firsthand that you don't have to be an adult to save lives. These 9th-through-12th graders are the real deal when it comes to emergency services. In fact, they're the only teen-commanded patrol in the nation. Sure they have adult advisers to turn to if necessary, but in the field it's a teen patrol officer calling the shots -- sometimes even giving direction to adults. Members are trained in rock-high-angle,swift-water and avalanche rescue  , winter and alpine operation , wilderness life support and emergency care, among other skills. They also regularly ride along with the local fire and police departments, providing support such as security details and evidence searching.

Article: Babies who watch TV are more likely to show late learning development and language at 14 months, especially if they are watching programs aimed at adults and older children, according to a new study, which would probably surprise those parents who leave their babies in front of a TV set. Babies who watched 60 minutes of TV daily had developmental scores a third lower at 14 months than babies who were watching less TV. Although their developmental scores were still in the normal range, the difference may have been due to the fact that when children and parents are watching TV, they are missing the talking, playing and other communications that are important to learning and development. This new study, which appeared in the Aechives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, followed 259 lower-income families in New York, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language at home. Other studies of higher-income families have also come to the same conclusion: TV watching is not only non-educational, but it seems to slow down babies' development. But what about \\"good\\" TV, like Sesame Street? The researchers didn't find any difference when compared to non-educational programs designed for small children, like Spongebob SquarePants. Earlier research by some of the same scientists, most of whom are at New York University School of Medicine's Bellevue Hospital Centre, has found that parents whose children watch non-educational TV programs like Spongebob SquarePants spend less time reading to their children or teaching them. At this point, parents reading this will probably be astonished. TV is so often a parent's good friend, keeping children happily occupied so that the adults can cook dinner, answer the phone, or take a shower. But, clearly, this electronic babysitter is not an educational aid. It is best to make sure the babies are fast asleep if you have to watch TV.

The setting is intimate with comfortable and simplistic decor and live piano entertainment.  When we arrived to check in with our reservation there was no one to seat us for a couple of minutes.  This is a big no-no to me.  I think someone should always be manning that front area.  But once we were greeted it was service with a smile from there on out.    Our server gave us space and time to look over the menu while never leaving us alone for too long.   I ordered the four cheese ravioli and, although the sauce and ravioli were delectable, I ended up not being fulfilled.  I admit, I'm not one of those \\"I'll have a salad and a diet coke\\" kind of girls, so I may not be the best judge of this, but I felt my portion was too small and I was actually still hungry afterwards.  The ravioli are not large and there were 6 of them.  As far as fine dining goes, the prices were not horrible but, for the price of the dish, I hoped to be satiated at the end of the meal.

There are four key elements that contribute to this sentiment: 1) ':-(': This emoticon represents a sad face, with the colon symbolizing the eyes, the hyphen being the nose, and the open parenthesis character denoting a downturned mouth. The sad face allows audiences to instantly grasp that the tweet expresses a negative emotion. 2) 'tears': This term reinforces the melancholy expressed by the emoticon, suggesting that the individual may have been shedding tears or feeling intensely emotional when posting this information. The word \\"tears\\" elicits imagery of someone physically crying, adding a layer of vulnerability and emotional intensity to the tweet. 3) The short link (http://plurk.com/p/xt61h): Although the URL itself does not provide any explicit indication of the subject matter or the nature of the emotion being conveyed, the inclusion of a link in the tweet adds an element of curiosity and encourages users to click on the link to understand the context of the sorrowful sentiment. It's possible that the short link leads to a webpage, image, video, or further information detailing the reason behind the sadness. 4) The brevity of the tweet: The concise nature of the tweet, which only includes an emoticon, a word, and a link, intensifies the emotional impact. This brevity could prompt various interpretations - the individual may not have had the words to accurately articulate their feelings, or the succinctness of the tweet might have been intentional to evoke a stronger emotional response from their followers. In summary, the tweet embodies a sentiment of sadness, disappointment, or frustration. The use of the sad face emoticon, the mention of tears, and the inclusion of a mysterious link alongside the tweet's brevity contribute to a complex emotional landscape that leaves readers intrigued and empathetic towards the individual who posted this message."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please add spaces between words: Oncebackinspiritlife,soulsrealizethattheyhadfallenintothatspellstillanothertimeandonceagaintheychoosetobreakreligion’sholdwhennexttheyincarnate.","output":"Once back in spirit life, souls realize that they had fallen into that spell still another time, and once again they choose to break religion's hold when next they incarnate.  When souls return to the spirit world after having lived their physical lives on Earth, they often evaluate their experiences, decisions, and actions. Through reflection and analysis, these souls identify patterns and cycles that they may have been trapped in during their lifetimes. One such spell that they might recognize is the hold that religion can have on their beliefs, judgments, and actions.  Religion has long been an essential part of human society, offering guidance, solace, and a way to understand the world and find a sense of purpose. However, religion can sometimes have a restrictive hold on people, imposing dogmas or doctrines that can limit a person's ability to think freely, experience life fully, or grow spiritually. These constraints might lead a soul to adopt beliefs and behaviors that may not be in their best interest or align with their true nature. Upon realizing that they have succumbed to the spell of religion during their incarnate life, some souls may decide to break free from its hold in their next lifetime. This choice may manifest in several ways, such as: 1. Choosing to be born into a family with different religious beliefs, or in an environment where religion plays a less prominent role, allowing them to explore alternative perspectives and spiritual paths. 2. Making conscious efforts to question and challenge their beliefs as they grow up, in order to develop a more expansive understanding of themselves, others, and the world. 3. Encouraging openness and non-judgment, both in themselves and others, by embracing a more spiritual and inclusive approach to life, rather than adhering strictly to religious doctrine. 4. Focusing on the development of their own inner wisdom and intuition, rather than relying solely on external sources of guidance, such as religious texts or authority figures. 5. Seeking out like-minded individuals or communities who share a similar desire for spiritual growth and personal transformation, thereby creating a supportive network that can help further their quest for self-discovery and enlightenment. In summary, when souls return to the spirit life after a physical incarnation on Earth, they can recognize the impact religion has had on their lives and the potential limitations it has imposed on their spiritual growth. As a result, they may choose to distance themselves from these constraints in their next lifetime, embarking on a new path that allows for greater personal freedom, exploration, and growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who gave herself a manicure? Options:  A. London  B. The narrator  C.

Cal pitcher pulls off a near-impossible trick shot Trick shots are wildly entertaining and provide endless \\"How did he just do that?\\" moments. However, most trick shots are repeatable and have been done once or twice before. That probably doesn't hold true with this ridiculous throw by Cal-Berkley pitcher Ryan Mason. While having fun during Friday's loss to Stanford, Mason and his bullpen buddies had a bit of fun trying to pull off the unthinkable. His teammate threw a tube in the air, which somehow fell perfectly with the opening facing Mason. The right-hander then rifled a pitch through the tube and against the wall behind it. How he did it, no one knows. Take another look, frame by frame. Even watching it in super slow-mo, it's hard to fathom not only how the cylinder fell to the ground perfectly, but how Mason fired the pitch through the tube.

This is by far the worst movie ever made. I truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. So apparently, it's supposed to be bad on purpose; However, if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo, you'll see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. The actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to Crimson Tide but come closer to The Marine. The crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are awful. The story is C-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered B-movie caliber. The dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty, but is crap like everything else. Rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. Plus, the techno score is annoying... not because it's techno, but because it's NON-STOP. That's right, the music plays in the background THE WHOLE TIME, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I don't care what the disclaimer claims, I don't buy it.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose spores breed on the bread happens, how will it affect MORE mold forming on bread.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Let's examine the process of mold development in relation to the perturbation hypothesis: Process: 1. A mold spore floats through the air. 2. The spore lands on a piece of bread. 3. The spore grows hyphae (branches) into the bread and absorbs nutrients. 4. The mold forms a colony. 5. Sporangiophores (structures that produce spores) grow upward. 6. The mold releases new spores, which can cause further mold growth on the bread or other surfaces. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose spores breed on the bread. How will this affect more mold forming on the bread? Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? When the mold spores breed on the bread, this means that new mold spores are produced in the sporangiophores that grow from the mold colony. This will inevitably affect further mold growth on the bread because it increases the likelihood of more spores finding new locations to land, germinate, and form additional colonies on the bread. The perturbation hypothesis does have direct effects on the process of mold growth on the bread. The production of new mold spores directly contributes to an increased spread of mold on the bread as they can germinate and start new colonies on the same piece or other surfaces. The presence of more spores and colonies can cause the bread to spoil faster, potentially leading to quicker decomposition and inedibility. In summary, the process of mold spores breeding on the bread will directly affect more mold formation on the bread by increasing the chances of new mold colonies developing. This process will accelerate the spoilage of the bread and can have negative consequences for its consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The suit isn’t frivolous, however, legal experts say. They contend the case could offer the first rulings on tricky questions about how far the rights of the copyright holder extend in creations that are, after all, on someone else’s body. They are questions likely to crop up more often as it becomes more common for actors or athletes to have tattoos and as tattoo designs become more sophisticated.      Warner Brothers responded on Friday in a brief to Judge Catherine D. Perry, stating that any delay in releasing the film would have huge economic costs. It also argued that there was no legal precedent for Mr. Whitmill’s assertion of copyright, saying he had put forward a “radical claim that he is entitled, under the Copyright Act, to control the use of a tattoo that he created on the face of another human being.”      Copyright and trademark law can be hard to understand intuitively — for example, the idea that you can “own” a photograph or a letter, but not own the right to reproduce its content. The example of a tattoo, where “ownership” means having it become part of your body, actually does little to clear up the matter.      The wrinkle in the “Hangover” lawsuit is that Mr. Whitmill has taken pains to leave Mr. Tyson out of it. “This case is not about Mike Tyson, Mike Tyson’s likeness, or Mike Tyson’s right to use or control his identity,” the complaint says. “This case is about Warner Bros. appropriation of Mr. Whitmill’s art and Warner Bros. unauthorized use of that art, separate and apart from Mr. Tyson.”      “One of the things that the copyright law gives you as an artist is control over your work — and he lost control here,” said Michael A. Kahn, the lawyer who is representing Mr. Whitmill. The complaint includes a photograph of the tattoo being inked and a statement from Mr. Tyson agreeing that “all artwork, sketches and drawings related to my tattoo and any photographs of my tattoo are property” of Mr. Whitmill’s business.      If a tattoo clearly violates copyright — say, exactly reproduces a Keith Haring drawing or an Annie Leibovitz photograph without permission — could a court order it removed?      Photo      The case gets more serious, according to Christopher A. Harkins, an expert on copyright and patents who has written the definitive law review article on the subject, when someone tries to profit from the copying — by, for instance, selling photographs of the infringing tattoos.      “I don’t see a court forcing someone to remove it, or wear a burqa, but they may not allow me to profit from that work that I had tattooed on my body,” he said, adding that it would be very unlikely that this action could delay “The Hangover Part II” from being released.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The range of material that individuals and businesses are seeking to get copyright protection for has only been expanding, often at the insistence of movie studios. Mattel has gone to court to assert the copyright of the face of its Barbie doll; fashion companies have been lobbying Congress to pass a law to protect unique, nontrivial new designs. And trademark, which is governed by different laws and is much more contextual, has been used by athletes and coaches to get a measure of control over terms like “three-peat” or “Revis Island.”      In 2005, Rasheed Wallace and Nike were sued by a tattoo artist, Matthew Reed, over a commercial that outlined a tattoo as he discussed why he had it created; the case was settled. David Beckham and his favorite tattooist, Louis Molloy, had a public dispute that year over his plan to highlight them in an advertisement. The feud culminated in an interview with Mr. Molloy in The Daily Mirror that ran under the headline “I Own Beck’s Tattoo .. and I’ll Sue.”      “It is such a nascent area,” Mr. Harkins said, “and courts are always struggling to keep up with technology. I don’t think Rasheed Wallace ever thought about copyright infringement.”      Warner Brothers in its brief also invoked the “fair use” defense for “Hangover Part II,” namely the right to parody what has become a well-known tattoo since it first appeared on Mr. Tyson’s face in February 2003.      “That’s the real question: the copyright act balances the copyright owners’ rights and not stifling the creativity of the owners — it would stifle creativity to not be able to make a parody,” Mr. Harkins said.      Issues like how central the tattoo is to the plot, how much of the film it is in and whether it is shown in a non-parody context were the kind of factors a judge would consider when determining if “fair use” was in play, he said.      With so many factors in play, and the motivator of ever-rising legal fees, Mr. Harkins said, “it will be settled out of court, as most of them are.”      Mr. Whitmill declined to be interviewed, but Mr. Reed, the tattooist who sued Rasheed Wallace and Nike, spoke from his shop in Portland, Ore.      While he would not comment on his case directly, he explained that one could think of the process as a collaboration between the tattooer and the tattooed, “owned by both people, based on the trust that is used to create it.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “It’s there for everyone to enjoy,” Mr. Reed added, “but if you think you are going to make money from it, you should get the artist’s permission.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The article discusses Liam Neeson's cameo being cut from \\"Hangover 2\\" and the release of the full trailer for the highly anticipated sequel.

LED grow lights vary in color depending on the intended use. It is known from the study of photomorphogenesis that green, red, far-red and blue light spectra have an effect on root formation, plant growth, and flowering, but there are not enough scientific studies or field-tested trials using LED grow lights to recommended specific color ratios for optimal plant growth under LED grow lights. It has been shown that many plants will grow normally if given both red and blue light. However, many studies indicate that red and blue light only provides the most cost efficient method of growth, plant growth is still better under light supplemented with green. Is it true that can led lights be used for growing plants?","output":"Yes, LED lights can be used for growing plants. LED grow lights have become increasingly popular for indoor gardening due to their energy efficiency and ability to provide a customizable spectrum of light. These lights can be tailored to deliver specific wavelengths of light that are beneficial for plant growth, such as blue, red, and green light spectra.  Here is a step-by-step process to justify the effectiveness of LED grow lights for plants: 1. Energy Efficiency: LED lights consume less energy than traditional lighting sources like fluorescent and high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps. This makes them more cost-effective for long-term plant growth and maintenance. 2. Customizable Light Spectrum: LED grow lights can be designed to emit specific wavelengths of light that positively influence plant growth, such as blue light for vegetative growth, red light for flowering, and green light for overall plant health. This allows growers to optimize the light spectrum for their particular plant species or growth stage. 3. Photomorphogenesis: The study of how plants respond to different light wavelengths provides a basis for understanding the effects of LED grow lights on plant growth. As you mentioned, green, red, far-red, and blue light spectra influence plant growth, and LED lights can be tailored to provide the necessary wavelengths. 4. Research Support: While there may be limited scientific studies specifically focusing on LED grow lights, many studies do indicate that plants grow well with a combination of red and blue light. Supplementing these with green light can improve overall plant growth. 5. Practical Applications: Many indoor gardeners and commercial growers have successfully used LED grow lights to grow a variety of plants, proving their effectiveness in real-world applications. In conclusion, LED grow lights can indeed be used for growing plants, and they offer numerous advantages, including energy efficiency and the ability to customize the light spectrum. With continued research and practical implementations, LED grow lights could become an even more effective tool for optimizing plant growth and health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - The Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Sir Alec Guinness (2 April 1914  5 August 2000) was an English actor.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years passed between the first and second Goryeo-Khitan Wars?","output":"Title: Unraveling the Timeline: The Years Between the First and Second Goryeo-Khitan Wars Introduction The Goryeo-Khitan Wars were a series of conflicts that took place on the Korean Peninsula in the 10th and 11th centuries between the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea and the Khitan Liao Dynasty of China. These wars are remarkably significant in the history of Korea and China due to the impact they had on the political and cultural landscape of both countries. However, a common question raised by historians is the number of years that passed between the first and second Goryeo-Khitan Wars. It is vital to accurately apprehend the timeline of these war events in order to better understand the implications it left on the histories of these two Asian powers. The First Goryeo-Khitan War In order to deduce the number of years between the first and second wars, it is essential to begin with knowing when the first Goryeo-Khitan War took place. The Khitan Liao Dynasty began expanding its territories during the early 10th century and aimed to dominate the Korean Peninsula by conquering the Goryeo Dynasty. The first Goryeo-Khitan War occurred in the year 993 when the Khitan Liao Dynasty launched a massive invasion of the Goryeo Dynasty, led by the Khitan general Xiao Sunning (Hsiao Sun-ning). The decisive Battle of Gwiju took place in November of that year, where the Goryeo forces led by General Gang Gam-chan implemented an effective military strategy that led to the victory of Goryeo. The Khitan army, severely weakened and defeated, retreated from the Korean Peninsula, consequently ending the first Goryeo-Khitan War. Due to Goryeo's diplomatic engagement with the Song Dynasty of China, this victory helped in maintaining the political stability of the region. The Second Goryeo-Khitan War The second Goryeo-Khitan War began around the year 1010, following the assassination of Goryeo's King Mokjong by the military general Gang Jo. The power vacuum that was created consequently triggered internal conflicts within the Goryeo Dynasty, and sensing an opportunity, the Khitan Liao Dynasty, led by Emperor Shengzong, decided to invade the Korean Peninsula once again. On July 17, 1010, Liao forces invaded the Goryeo capital, Kaesong, taking advantage of the unstable political situation within Goryeo. Although the Liao army was able to capture the Goryeo King Hyeonjong, they could not subdue Goryeo completely since the Goryeo forces were determinedly resisting the invasion. Ultimately, after a prolonged military campaign and due to Goryeo's strong resistance, the Liao Empire sued for peace with the Goryeo Dynasty in 1018, leading to the conclusion of the second Goryeo-Khitan War. Calculating the Years Between the Wars Now that we have established the approximate beginning years of both the first and second Goryeo-Khitan Wars, it is possible to calculate the number of years that passed between them. Given that the first Goryeo-Khitan War took place in 993, and the second war began in 1010, the number of years that elapsed between the two wars is as follows: 1010 - 993 = 17 years Conclusion In conclusion, approximately 17 years passed between the end of the first Goryeo-Khitan War and the beginning of the second Goryeo-Khitan War. Understanding the timeline of these historical events is crucial when studying the significant implications that these conflicts had on the political and cultural development of both the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea and the Khitan Liao Dynasty of China during this period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the age of 30, aware of the desperate medical needs of Africans, he decided to become a doctor and devote the rest of his life to direct service in Africa. In 1913, at the age of 38, Dr.Schweitzer and his wife, Helene, opened a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon- then a province of French Equatorial Africa.Not even serious setbacks of World War I, part of which he and Helene spent as prisoners of war in France,  _ him from continuing commitment to his job. In 1915,troubled daily by the vast numbers of suffering patients coming to his hospital for help, he experienced as a revelation the idea of \\"Reverence  for Life\\" as the elementary and universal principle of ethics that he had been seeking for so long. By stressing the interdependence and unity of all life, he was a forerunner of the environmental and animal welfare movements - Rachel Carson dedicated Silent Spring to him. In 1952, at the age of 77, Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the last twelve years of his life, his speeches and writings emphasized the dangers of atmospheric nuclear test explosions and the suicidal nuclear arms race between the superpowers.  After retiring as a practicing doctor, Albert Schweitzer continued to oversee the hospital until his death at the age of 90. To the end, his one frustration was that he had not succeeded in convincing the world to abolish nuclear weapons. He and his wife are buried on the Hospital grounds in Lambarene.

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year.  In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date.  In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts.  Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured.  Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did it have a hit single?","output":"Yes, Journey had a hit single.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What is a reason that the use of computers became more widely used?\\"  Context: \\"In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. \\"Wireless\\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"One of the primary reasons that the use of computers became more widely used can be attributed to the emergence and rapid expansion of computer networking, particularly the development of the Internet. This phenomenon greatly enhanced the capabilities of individual computers by enabling them to connect with others, access shared resources, and communicate more efficiently. There are several factors that contributed to this widespread adoption, some of which include the evolution of computing technology, the growth of user-friendly applications, and the advancement of affordable networking infrastructure. Firstly, advancements in computing technology played a vital role in the proliferation of computers. Over time, computers have evolved to become more powerful, efficient, and affordable, allowing a broader range of users to access and utilize them. This democratization of technology significantly increased the potential user base, which in turn stimulated the demand for computer networking, as users sought to capitalize on the inherent benefits of interconnected systems. Secondly, the development of user-friendly applications such as e-mail and the World Wide Web further contributed to the widespread adoption of computers. These applications simplified complex tasks and made them accessible to a larger user base, allowing individuals to communicate more efficiently and access vast amounts of information with ease. The growth of these applications, in turn, reinforced the need for robust computer networks, as they required reliable and efficient means of transferring data between users and systems. Additionally, the introduction of inexpensive and fast networking technologies, such as Ethernet and ADSL, made it more feasible for a greater number of users to access and participate in computer networks. These technologies significantly reduced the costs associated with setting up and maintaining networks, and they also provided faster data transfer rates, making networking an even more attractive proposition for users. Another important factor that contributed to the increased use of computers was the rise of \\"wireless\\" networking, which enabled network connectivity without the need for physical cables. This development greatly expanded the scope of computer networking by allowing users to remain connected even in mobile computing environments. The utilization of mobile phone networks for wireless networking has ensured that networking continues to grow more ubiquitous as mobile devices become increasingly prevalent in everyday life.

This indicates that as species evolve to better fit their environment, they develop unique traits and skills, allowing them to specialize in certain areas. Step 2: Analyze Fact 2 - Animals and plants evolve together, adapting to environmental conditions. This suggests that both animals and plants participate in the process of evolution and adaptation, constantly adjusting to their surroundings in a harmonious relationship. Step 3: Combine the facts - Given that both animals and plants evolve together and adapt to their environment, and that specialization occurs in competing species, it is reasonable to conclude that as animals and plants evolve together to face environmental conditions, the outcome is specialization.

The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.  Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\\" According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about the Senate position in Alabama? Options:  A. The position has fluctuated throughout the years between Democratic and Republican candidates.  B.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that gave Jules Massenet his first piano lessons?  Massenet was born at Montaud, then an outlying hamlet and now a part of the city of Saint-Étienne, in the Loire. He was the youngest of the four children of Alexis Massenet (1788–1863) and his second wife Eléonore-Adelaïde née Royer de Marancour (1809–1875); the elder children were Julie, Léon and Edmond. Massenet senior was a prosperous ironmonger; his wife was a talented amateur musician who gave Jules his first piano lessons. By early 1848 the family had moved to Paris, where they settled in a flat in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Massenet was educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and, from either 1851 or 1853, the Paris Conservatoire. According to his colourful but unreliable memoirs, Massenet auditioned in October 1851, when he was nine, before a judging panel comprising Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas and Michele Carafa, and was admitted at once. His biographer Demar Irvine dates the audition and admission as January 1853. Both sources agree that Massenet continued his general education at the lycée in tandem with his musical studies. Ambroise Thomas, my beloved master, came towards me and said, \\"Embrace Berlioz, you owe him a great deal for your prize.\\" \\"The prize,\\" I cried, bewildered, my face shining with joy. \\"I have the prize!!!\\" I was deeply moved and I embraced Berlioz, then my master, and finally Monsieur Auber. Monsieur Auber comforted me. Did I need comforting? Then he said to Berlioz pointing to me, \\"He'll go far, the young rascal, when he's had less experience!\\" The prize brought a well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds of which was spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was dominated by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falguière and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter's, and closely studied the works of the great German masters, from...

Pick what speaks to you, or what interests you, and dive in. For example, if you're really interested in meditation, choose pieces on mindfulness and breathing.  Some popular classic texts include The Way of the Bodhisattva by Shantideva, The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh, and On the Path to Enlightenment by Matthieu Ricard. If there's a Buddhist center or community near you, ask one of the teachers for recommendations on what to read first. You can find Buddhist texts and books online or at a bookstore or library. These 3 stages of studying Buddha’s teachings, which are known as dharma, are hearing, contemplating, and meditating. First, read, or “hear,” the text. Then think about what it means and make sure you understand it. Finally, meditate on the teaching to let it fully soak in.  Set aside time each day to spend reading and absorbing the material. Studying the teachings consistently will help you absorb it all better. Pick one phrase or mantra from your teaching that day to use in your meditation. Think of these truths like the core pillars of Buddhism. They outline how to recognize and let go of pain throughout your life. If you don’t understand the Four Noble Truths, you won’t be able to be free of suffering or reach nirvana. The 4th truth contains the Noble Eightfold Path, which is a Buddhist set of principles detailing 8 steps to spiritual awakening. Learning from someone who knows a lot about the religion can help deepen your own knowledge and understanding of Buddhism. Ask the Buddhist temple or center in your area to find out if there are any teachers who would be interested in taking on a new student.  You can even find a teacher who is already a Buddha to act as a mentor and role model. If you know a Buddhist who is very experienced or knowledgeable, consider asking them to become your teacher. Say something like, “I really want to become a Buddha but I need extra help. Would you be willing to tutor me?” Another option is to take a group class at a local community college or meditation center. There are also online courses led by Buddhist gurus you can sign up for.

There is no ongoing or new investigation.\\"      HOUSTON -- New accusations against Adrian Peterson come from another mother who has another four-year-old son of Peterson, and also involve Peterson striking his boy as a form of discipline.      Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin responded with the following statement:      The allegation of another investigation into Adrian Peterson is simply not true. This is not a new allegation, it's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago and nothing came of it. An adult witness adamantly insists Adrian did nothing inappropriate with his son. There is no ongoing or new investigation.      Earlier Monday, a top law enforcement official confirmed knowledge of the allegations by the mother of Peterson's son back in June 2013. Photos, which the KHOU I-Team obtained from a source, show a head wound to a boy identified as Peterson's four year old son. It is a wound that weeks later, left a scar above his right eye.      Sources claim it allegedly happened while the boy, who lives out of state, was visiting Peterson at his gated home in The Woodlands.      The source provided a string of text messages allegedly exchanged between the Peterson and the boy's mother. They contain numerous grammatical errors:      Mother : \\"What happened to his head?      Peterson: \\"Hit his head on the Carseat\\".      Mother \\"How does this happen, he got a whoopin in the car\\"      Peterson: \\"Yep\\"      Mother: \\"Why?'      Peterson: \\"I felt so bad. But he did it his self.\\"      The text messages go on to show Peterson saying he was disciplining his son for cussing to a sibling. Also in the text messages, the mother asks \\"What did you hit him with?\\"      Peterson never answers directly but writes \\"be still n (and) take ya (your) whopping, he would have saved the scare (scar). \\"He's aight (all right).\\"      The exchange continued:      Mother: \\"I'm real sensitive about my baby and him being hit.\\"      Peterson: \\"You tripping if you want him, come get him. I'm not about to be getting questioned down like you (you're) CPS.\\"      Sources confirm to the I-Team that the mother did file a report with Child Protective Services, but CPS declined to discuss the its investigation.      Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin said the woman is shopping around false allegations. Meantime, the website TMZ quotes sources close to the investigation, saying the CPS case went nowhere because the injuries were accidental and that the boy struck his head on a car seat.      Peterson's first court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 8.

VPC      Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has been accused of injuring a second son. (Photo: Bruce Kluckhohn, USA TODAY Sports)      HOUSTON — Photos and text messages obtained by the I-Team reveal another incident in which Adrian Peterson is accused of injuring another son while disciplining the boy.      The 4-year-old is by a different mother than the alleged victim in the Montgomery County case, in which Peterson is charged with felony injury to a child. In that case, Peterson admits to repeatedly striking the boy with a tree branch or \\"switch,\\" but has maintained he did not intend to harm the child, and was using his judgment as a parent to discipline his son.      DATABASE: NFL player arrests from 2000-present      The latest incident allegedly occurred last June, while the boy, who lives out of state, was visiting Peterson at his gated home in Spring. A photo, allegedly texted by Peterson to the boy's mother, shows a head wound to the boy covered by two bandages. Other photos, allegedly taken weeks later, reveal a scar over his right eye.      The text messages also describe an exchange about what happened. They contain numerous misspellings and shorthand:      Mother: \\"What happened to his head?\\"      Peterson: \\"Hit his head on the Carseat.\\"      Mother: \\"How does that happen, he got a whoopin in the car.\\"      Peterson: \\"Yep.\\"      Mother: \\"Why?\\"      Peterson: \\"I felt so bad. But he did it his self.\\"      The text messages go on to show Peterson saying he was disciplining his son for cussing to a sibling.      \\"It's absolutely criminal,\\" said Randy Burton, a former chief prosecutor of family crimes in Harris County, and founder of the advocacy group Justice for Children. \\"You break the skin, you have bleeding, much less permanent scars, that is a crime.\\"      But no charges were ever filed. Sources confirm the mother filed a report with Child Protective Services, but the outcome of any CPS investigation is unclear.      So is the method of the delivering the wound, according to the text messages.      Mother: \\"What did you hit him with?\\"      Peter never directly answered, but later replied: \\"Be still n take ya whooping he would have saved the scare (scar). He aight (all right)\\"      \\"This is very damaging information,\\" Burton said.      Damaging, Burton said, because prosecutors in Montgomery County can use it as evidence in the felony case against Peterson.      \\"To prove intent, that it was not an accident, and to show that it was a course of conduct,\\" Burton said. \\"It wasn't a one-off.\\"      Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin said that Peterson had done nothing wrong.      \\"The allegation of another investigation into Adrian Peterson is simply not true,\\" Hardin said in a statement. \\"This is not a new allegation, it's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago and nothing came of it.

Firstly, the piece introduces the basic '<marquee>' HTML tag. The 'marquee' tag is utilized in HTML to make text or image move across the screen, typically from right to left or vice versa. This tag can be used to grab the viewer's attention or make the webpage more interactive. Then, the article includes a type of marquee with changed attributes: '<marquee style=\\"height:20;width:200\\" scrollamount=\\"200\\">'. Here, all three attributes 'style', 'height', 'width' and 'scrollamount' are presented. The 'style' attribute permits the user to apply CSS styles to the HTML elements. Inside the 'style' attribute, 'height' and 'width' are defined to set the dimensions of the marquee. The 'scrollamount' attribute adjusts the speed of the marquee; the value signifies how much distance the text or image traverses at a time (in pixels) -- the higher the number, the faster it moves. The third type of marquee mentioned in the article is even more customized: '<marquee style=\\"height:20;width:200\\" scrollamount=\\"200\\" scrolldelay=\\"500\\">'. In addition to 'style', 'height', 'width' and 'scrollamount', it introduces an attribute called 'scrolldelay'. The 'scrolldelay' attribute determines how much delay there is between each jump of the text or image, measured in milliseconds. So, just as with 'scrollamount', the higher the ‘scrolldelay’ value is, the faster the marquee moves. Lastly, it describes a full application of the marquee in action with its message text: '<marquee style=\\"height:20;width:200\\" scrollamount=\\"200\\" scrolldelay=\\"500\\">Blinky Text!</marquee>'. Here, 'Blinky Text!' is the message that's being scrolled across the screen using the previously explained attributes. In conclusion, this article primarily covers how to create different types of marquees in HTML and how to adjust their dimensions, speed, and delay by altering specific attributes. Consequently providing the technical know-how to create eye-catching moving elements to enhance webpage interactivity and visual appeal. Please note that, while informative, the 'marquee' tag is not supported in HTML5 and is considered obsolete in modern web design practices."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The answer to the question: Who was banished? is inside the article: Somewhere in the 17th century, after attacking and boarding one of the Kingdom of Monterria's ships, the pirate Robert the Terrible captures the Prince Alexander and sends his men in search of Princess Eloise.

Summary:","output":"The article is discussing a method for preserving egg yolks by covering them with water and noting that this method extends their usability but they should still be consumed within 2 days.  This method involves first carefully separating the yolks from the egg whites, ensuring not to break them in the process. Once separated, the yolks are gently placed in a shallow dish or container. The container must be big enough to comfortably fit all the yolks without them overlapping or being squished. The next step is to pour water into the container. The water should be clean, preferably filtered or distilled. The egg yolks must be completely covered with water, which helps to prevent them from drying out. The water also forms a barrier that prevents bacteria or other potential contaminates from reaching the eggs, thus aiding in their preservation. Once they're submerged in the water, the container should be carefully covered. This could be done with a tight-fitting lid or some form of plastic wrap. It's important to make sure the yolks are fully covered and the container is completely sealed to help ensure the yolks are properly preserved. After covering, the egg yolks should be placed in the fridge for storage. The consistent, cool temperature of the fridge helps to slow down bacterial growth, once again aiding in the preservation of the yolks. It's also interesting to note that this article explains why the yolks should be used within 2 days. Even with this method of preservation, egg yolks are a perishable food item and aren't meant to be stored for long periods. By the 2 day mark, the quality of the yolks may begin to degrade. They might lose their fresh flavor or start to give off an unpleasant smell. Using them within the two-day window ensures you're getting the best quality and taste from the yolks. In conclusion, the article provides readers with a simple, quick method for preserving egg yolks, ensuring they're kept fresh for as long as possible. However, it also stresses the importance of using these preserved yolks within 2 days to guarantee their quality and freshness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Dragonheart Context: An English knight, Bowen (Dennis Quaid), mentors a Saxon prince, Einon (Lee Oakes), in the Old Code, the ideals of chivalry in the hope that he will become a better king than his tyrannical father Freyne (Peter Hric). When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer. Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite), a monk and aspiring poet, observes Bowen slaying a dragon and follows him to record his exploits. Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, however the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation. Unknown to Bowen, Draco is the dragon who shared his heart with Einon, and through this connection, any pain inflicted upon one is also felt by the other. Meanwhile, Kara, seeking revenge on Einon for murdering her father, is imprisoned after a failed assassination attempt. Einon recognizes her as the one responsible for his near-death and attempts to seduce her and make her his queen. Disgusted by what her son has become, Aislinn helps Kara escape. Kara... A:","output":"In this particular context of the movie \\"Dragonheart\\", there is no direct reference to someone attempting to kill Draco during the night. The main characters who encounter Draco in the story, as given in the context, are the English knight Bowen and the adult Einon. There are various interactions and confrontations between Draco and Bowen and between Draco and Einon due to Draco's shared heart with Einon. Bowen initially seeks vengeance upon dragons, including Draco, under belief that Einon's wickedness is due to the dragon's heart. However, after realizing Draco is the last of his kind, Bowen forms a partnership with Draco to stage dragonslayings for local villagers, naming Draco after a constellation. The strength of Bowen's resentment towards Draco for Einon's tyrannical rule could have led him to planning to kill Draco, but there is no explicit mention of him attempting to kill Draco during the night in the provided context. On the other hand, Einon, who has half of Draco's heart, experiences the same pain as Draco due to their shared heart. This connection makes Einon potentially vulnerable, suggesting he or someone connected to him might have reasons to harm Draco in order to protect Einon. Surprisingly, despite Einon's tyranny and deceit, the story does not describe him attempting to harm Draco either.  Kara and Aislinn, despite their dislike and disillusionment with Einon, don't have their sights on Draco, and their motivations are more driven by revenge against Einon and not Draco.

Which milk would not require added lactic acid bacteria, bottle B or bottle C?  Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk.  Hint: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Answer:","output":"Bottle C milk would not require added lactic acid bacteria. This is because Bottle C is raw milk, which can naturally produce curds when it is left to sour. In contrast, Bottle B milk is pasteurized and would require adding lactic acid bacteria to initiate the curdling process for making curds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The deposited sediments gradually accumulate, building up the delta and giving it the characteristic triangular or fan-shaped appearance. The process of sediment deposition in a delta is influenced by several factors, including the flow rate of the river, the size and type of sediments, and the slope or depth of the receiving body of water. As the river slows down, its ability to carry larger sediments decreases, causing them to be deposited first. Smaller sediments are then dropped progressively as the river loses more energy, leading to the formation of a distinct sequence of sediment layers within the delta. Deltas are dynamic landforms that can change in response to alterations in the river's discharge or the receiving water body's conditions. They provide essential habitats for diverse species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Moreover, they play significant roles in filtering pollutants from the river water before it enters the larger body of water. In summary, a delta is a triangular or fan-shaped landform resulting from sediment deposition when a river or stream empties into a larger body of still water. This process is influenced by the flow rate, sediment size and type, and slope of the receiving water body. Deltas are important ecosystems and contribute to water purification as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries. Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century. The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, joining in World War I to achieve this ambition on the side of Germany and the Central Powers. While the Empire was able to largely hold its own during the conflict, it was struggling with internal dissent, especially with the Arab Revolt in its Arabian holdings. Starting before the war, but growing increasingly common and violent during it, major atrocities were committed by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians and Pontic Greeks. The Empire's defeat and the occupation of part of its territory by the Allied Powers in the aftermath of World War I resulted in the emergence of a new state, Turkey, in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland following the Turkish War of Independence, as well as the founding of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. What is the answer to this question: What led to the decline of the Ottoman empire?","output":"The decline of the Ottoman Empire was a result of a myriad of factors that occurred over a long period of time. Firstly, the empire experienced a series of military setbacks against European powers in the later centuries of its existence. These losses eroded the geographical extent of the empire and weakened its political and military power. This failure against the European powers revealed the empire's inability to keep up with the rapid advancements in military technology and strategy in the continent, making it increasingly vulnerable to attacks and invasions. Secondly, the Ottoman Empire's decision to ally itself with Germany and the Central Powers during the early 20th century and entering World War I was a pivotal point in its decline. The empire sought to recover its lost territories through this alliance, however, even though it was largely able to hold its own during the conflict, this came at the cost of increased internal dissent.  Among the most significant of these internal conflicts was the Arab Revolt in its Arabian holdings. The Arab people, seeking to carve out their own homelands from the empire's territories in the Arabian peninsula, rose against the Ottoman rule. This revolt greatly drained the empire's already strained resources and diverted its attention from the global conflict, thereby weakening it further. Additionally, the atrocities committed by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians, and Pontic Greeks during this period fuelled more dissent and ultimately led to its downfall. Lastly, the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the subsequent occupation of part of its territory by the Allied Powers sealed its fate. This situation didn't just result in the loss of further territory, but also the empire's prestige and influence. Following the Turkish War of Independence, a new state, Turkey, emerged in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, a major blow to the now defunct empire. Furthermore, the modern Balkan and Middle East states formed after partitions of the Ottoman Empire, symbolizing the final end of its rule. In conclusion, the decline of the Ottoman Empire resulted from military setbacks against European powers, internal dissent, strategic errors during World War I, and its aftermath. The empire's inability to maintain its territories and keep its population unified broke down its political and military might, leading to its eventual dissolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: In 1344, Momchil, the independent Bulgarian ruler of the Rhodope and Aegean regions, whose army grew to 2,000 men, took an important role in the Byzantine civil war. While at first he supported John Kantakouzenos, from the spring of 1344 Momchil reneged, provoked by the aggression of the Ottoman allies. In June he defeated the Ottoman fleet near the Portogalos bay. According to sources, at night the Bulgarian ruler sent boats to burn the anchored Ottoman ships and soon after he defeated the army of Kantakouzenos at Mosynopolis. Probably the first local ruler to become aware of the impending Ottoman threat, Momchil unsuccessfully pleaded with the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium for help. Even though his troops continued the resistance in the Eastern Rhodopes, in May 1345 the Turks led by Umur Beg marched from Asia Minor and devastated Bulgarian territories driving away people and livestock. Soon after, on 7 July 1345, Ottoman forces under Umur Beg defeated Momchil's army in the battle of Peritor near his capital Xanthi. Sources attest that the independent ruler perished in the battle without leaving asuccessor, and with little political will or leadership left to counter the Ottoman invasion. When did the war with the Momchis end?","output":"The war with Momchil ended after his defeat and death in the battle of Peritor on July 7, 1345.

Summarize: Disulfiram is most commonly known by the original brand name, Antabuse®. Some people may confuse the way disulfiram works to help people quit drinking, with the way the newer medications work. The mechanisms of the available agents are different in each case.  Disulfiram has been used effectively for more than 60 years to help people stop drinking. Disulfiram works by inhibiting one of the enzymes involved in the breakdown and elimination of alcohol by-products from the body. Build up of these by-products occurs if you were to drink after taking disulfiram, resulting in very unpleasant feeling that has been likened to a bad hangover. You may experience symptoms like nausea and vomiting, flushing, sweating, and heart palpitations.  Taking disulfiram often involves the help of a close friend or family member to monitor the daily dosing of the medication as the medication will be cleared from the body and therefore not effective within about two to three days from the last dose. Compliance with treatment is important to ensure that the drug remains in their system at all times. Having someone to monitor compliance prevents the person from stopping the doses on their own, then going back to drinking alcohol. Using disulfiram requires a commitment to abstinence.  Be aware of safety issues with disulfiram. Serious problems associated with disulfiram involve the dangerous reaction that can occur if you consume alcohol while taking this drug. Topical products that contain alcohol can also trigger that unwanted reaction. The alcohol warning is extended to other drugs that contain alcohol such as some cough syrups and tonics. Disulfiram should not be used in people that are taking metronidazole, or paraldehyde.  Disulfiram is not to be used in people with severe heart disease, psychotic disorders, certain allergies to ingredients found in pesticides, and in people that are exposed to alcohol based chemicals in their work. Naltrexone comes in an oral dosing form, which is given once a day, and an extended-release injectable form, given once a month. There is no physical reaction or sickness if you drink alcohol while receiving naltrexone.  The people that do the best with naltrexone are those that are trying to achieve abstinence. Not everyone is ready, especially at first, to make that commitment. That’s ok.  Naltrexone works by blocking receptors in your brain that are involved in the rewarding, and positive, feelings that happen when you drink. Because it works in the reward center of the brain, naltrexone can also help to reduce cravings.  Research with the oral dosing form of naltrexone has shown an overall reduction in the risk of relapse during the first 3 months of therapy by about 36%. Plus, about 25% of people taking the injectable form of naltrexone experienced fewer heavy drinking days.  Use naltrexone safely. Naltrexone relies on your liver to metabolize the drug into other forms, and to keep your blood level of the drug in a safe range. If you have any liver problems, or signs of liver problems (such as swelling in your legs, bloated abdomen, or intense nausea) while you are taking naltrexone, contact your doctor immediately.  Avoid opiates while taking naltrexone, as naltrexone works by blocking the same receptors that opiates bind to. A serious complication can occur if naltrexone is used when there are opiates, or opiate derivatives in your system. The reaction can be severe if any opiates linger in your system as you begin naltrexone therapy.  Expect your doctor to perform blood work in order to proceed safely. Taking naltrexone while opiates are in your system can induce a sudden, and sometimes severe, situation of opiate withdrawal. Medical attention is warranted if this should occur. Completely avoid opiates during your therapy with naltrexone. Acamprosate, currently marketed under the brand name of Campral®, works in a different way. Again, there is no physical reaction that happens if you drink while taking acamprosate.  Acamprosate is dosed orally, and given 3 times every day. The drug works in your brain by acting on the receptors that cause the uncomfortable symptoms when you are trying to stop drinking.  Some of the symptoms acamprosate can help to minimize include insomnia, anxiety and jitteriness, restlessness, and feeling generally unhappy with life.  Studies show that acamprosate may be especially helpful in people that have been drinking for a long time. Plus, the people that did the best with this drug were those that wanted to reach a goal of abstinence. As many as 36% of people taking acamprosate were able to maintain their abstinence for at least 6 months.  Know more about taking acamprosate safely. Avoid using this drug if you have severe kidney problems. Acamprosate depends on your kidney function to remove the drug from your system with routine use. You should not take acamprosate if you have serious kidney disease.  Do not take acamprosate if you have certain allergies. People that are allergic to sodium sulfite or sulfite containing products should not take acamprosate. Sulfite sensitivity is more common in people with asthma. Sulfites are found in a variety of foods.  Some examples include prepared food products such as dried fruit, canned fruits or vegetables, some shellfish, and foods made with potatoes, like instant mashed potatoes. Let your doctor know if you have food allergies that may include sulfites.  Watch for feelings of depression or suicidal thoughts. Let your doctor know immediately if you develop feelings of depression or suicide once you start taking acamprosate. These feelings have been reported with this drug, and warrant medical attention if they should develop. Topiramate has shown very promising results in clinical studies; however the drug is not yet approved for use in the treatment of alcohol disorders by the FDA. That means that your doctor can prescribe topiramate for you as an off-label use.  Topiramate is given in oral doses, with the dosing gradually titrated upward to reach the desired results. This drug works by manipulating chemicals involved with the reward center in the brain. This helps to reduce alcohol use, and to reduce associated cravings.  The clinical research studies included people that were still drinking alcohol at the time they were started on the drug. Participants were continuing to show improvement as the 14 week studies came to an end.  Overall, topiramate increased the number of days some people were able to remain alcohol-free, and decreased the number of heavy drinking days for others. While comparative results are not available, the study results suggest that topiramate may be more effective than either naltrexone or acamprosate.  Take topiramate safely. One of the more serious complications caused by the use of topiramate involves your eyes. If left unattended, changes in your vision can lead to potentially permanent damage. Any visual changes should be immediately reported to your doctor.  Be aware of cognitive changes that can occur. Some people report problems with confusion and alertness when taking topiramate. In many cases, these symptoms can be addressed by adjusting the dose.  Pay attention to feeling depressed or having thoughts of suicide. These feelings can possibly develop when taking topiramate. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop these thoughts or feelings.  It is very important that you do not stop taking topiramate altogether. The amount of topiramate in your blood needs to be gradually lowered in order to avoid serious side effects such as seizures. Consult with your doctor before stopping this medication; she can help you taper the dose gradually to prevent unwanted effects.","output":"In summary, Disulfiram, Naltrexone, Acamprosate, and Topiramate are various medications with distinct mechanisms for helping individuals quit drinking alcohol, as they target different aspects of alcohol dependence. Disulfiram, known as the original Antabuse, works by inhibiting an enzyme essential for the breakdown of alcohol by-products, making the individual feel unpleasant side effects akin to a bad hangover. It requires a commitment to abstinence and needs close monitoring by a close friend or family for medication compliance. Naltrexone, available in oral and injectable forms, works by blocking receptors in the brain responsible for rewarding and positive feelings associated with alcohol, reducing cravings and the risk of relapse. It is vital to ensure no liver problems are present when receiving naltrexone and avoiding opiates simultaneously. Acamprosate, marketed as Campral, acts on the brain receptors that cause discomfort during alcohol withdrawal, helping to ease symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, and restlessness. It seems to be especially helpful for long-term drinkers and requires avoiding use with severe kidney problems or allergies to sodium sulfite. Lastly, Topiramate, though not yet approved by the FDA for treating alcohol disorders, has shown promise in clinical studies and can be prescribed off-label. It manipulates chemicals in the brain's reward center, reducing alcohol use and associated cravings. Taking topiramate safely involves monitoring for eye complications, cognitive changes, and depressive or suicidal thoughts, and should be tapered gradually under medical supervision if stopped. In conclusion, each medication offers a unique mechanism for aiding alcohol abstinence and recovery, with varying degrees of effectiveness. It is crucial to take these medications safely, understand their potential side effects, and consult with a medical professional to determine the most appropriate option for each individual."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As far as Mongolian BBQ places go, YC's is pretty damn good if you pick the right combination of sauces.  Basically, you can get a bowl for 10.75 or you can pay an extra dollar and get all you can eat. It really depends how you feel. You can try different varieties of sauces and just get small portions throughout or you can pack it into one bowl and hope that you pick the right sauce that you like.  I got the all you can eat because... it's only a dollar more. I ended up getting only two bowls worth, but I honestly don't miss that dollar.   They offer a variety of meats - beef, chicken, pork and fish. I was really disappointed that they didn't have lamb because most places I've been to do. They also have a good amount of vegetables. I usually add bean sprouts, celery, spinach, onions (lots and lots of onions), mushrooms and scallions. Sauces - LOOK AT THE BOARD. I guess some people miss it, but they give you a good number of combinations you can do to make the type of sauce you want. Curry, orange, thai, sweet and sour, mongolian, etc etc. I got the X-pao which basically is a mongolian sauce with a kick. I added some hot chili oil to put in some more, but I like spicy food. I really liked the X-pao, definite recommendation.  On the side, they offer some rice, soup and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. Drinks and dessert (ice cream) come with the meal.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Now, I have a new situation: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable.

It would mean that a the price of bottle of wine, would rise by 10p. Pints of low-strength beer would go up by 2p and continental lager by 3p. Proposal put forward by right-wing think tank Centre for Social Justice.","output":"Title: Bridging the Gap to Rehabilitation: A New Tax on Alcohol for A Renewed Fight Against Addiction Alcohol addiction has long plagued society, causing devastating effects on both individuals and their communities. With rehabilitation programs often overlooked or underfunded, the time has come to explore new ideas to fight this addiction and offer help for alcoholics. A recent proposal from the Centre for Social Justice, a right-wing think tank, suggests a potential solution: introducing a 1p per unit surcharge on alcoholic beverages to fund rehabilitation programs for those suffering from alcoholism. The surcharge aims to raise revenue for alcohol addiction treatments from the very source of the problem. By adding a minimal cost to each unit of alcohol, the proposal seeks to generate funds for rehabilitation without significantly affecting the pockets of responsible drinkers. With the price of a bottle of wine increasing by just 10p, pints of low-strength beer by 2p, and continental lager by 3p, consumers are unlikely to be deterred by this slight price increase. While the financial burden on individual consumers may be minimal, the cumulative effect would lead to a significant pool of funds directed towards addressing alcohol addiction and offering effective rehabilitation for those in need. The proposal is underpinned by the notion that the cost of alcohol should reflect the societal and personal harm caused by its excessive consumption. With alcohol-related issues costing the NHS billions of pounds annually, and alcohol addiction affecting millions of lives, a surcharge could be a step towards mitigating the wider costs of alcohol abuse. By directly linking the cost of alcohol with the funding for rehabilitation, the proposal highlights the interdependence between these two aspects of societal concern and operates on the principle of fairness and responsibility. While critics argue that this surcharge may inhibit the freedom of consumers and punish responsible drinkers, proponents emphasize that the minimal increase in cost will not directly impact their drinking habits. The focus instead should be on the greater good, and the potential to give back to society and assist those afflicted by addiction. For many, the small change in alcohol prices will be a negligible cost in comparison to the benefits of improved rehabilitation programs and enhanced support for individuals struggling with alcoholism. Furthermore, the revenue generated from the surcharge can be directed towards the betterment of existing rehabilitation facilities, the expansion of support networks, and education about alcohol addiction. By boosting their funding, these rehabilitation centers could trade limited resources and capacities for the means to reach out to more individuals in need. For countless alcoholics, the chance to access effective rehabilitation and support systems is a crucial lifeline, and the funding from the surcharge could transform countless lives. As we continue to wage the battle against alcohol addiction and its impacts, innovative proposals like the Centre for Social Justice's 1p per unit surcharge harbor the potential to ignite change and offer hope for those struggling. With a minimal impact on the average consumer and a projected significant positive impact on rehabilitation programs, the proposal provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between society and the individuals facing addiction. By taking a simple step towards a small financial trade-off, we can potentially change the landscape of alcohol addiction treatment, enabling recovery and creating a more supportive environment for those in need. A future where alcohol serves as a source of both enjoyment and active care for those who suffer from its abuse may be closer than we think."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: With seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\"Lilla stjärna\\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958. The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the Säg det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\"expert\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\"Augustin\\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967. The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976,... contains an answer for the question: What event was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network in the early years?, what is it ?

The broadcast of this event through the Nordvision network allowed neighboring countries to view and enjoy the competition, strengthening regional ties and sharing in the excitement of selecting a representative for the prestigious Eurovision Song Contest."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They know they have their weaknesses, yet they don't blame themselves when they fail. Whatever happens, they have choice in the matter. They believe their dance with each sacred moment of life is a gift and that storms are a natural part of life which can bring the rain needed for emotional and spiritual growth. Victims and creators live in the same physical world and deal with many of the same physical realities, yet their experience of life is worlds apart.

Question: I have a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  But I can use this background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  What is an answer for this question: Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B? Answer:","output":"Crop B would need more number of chemicals. Step 1: Understand the problem The problem statement mentions that crop A is herbicide tolerant, while crop B is not. The goal is to determine which crop would require more chemicals. Step 2: Consider the information about herbicides and weed management The background information given explains that herbicides are used to control weeds, but the lack of cost-effective herbicides that do not harm crops is a problem. Multiple applications of herbicides are often needed to control various weeds, and at times, they are used preventively. Mechanical or hand weeding is also employed to control weeds. Step 3: Determine the benefit of herbicide tolerant crops The text mentions that herbicide-tolerant crops could greatly benefit farmers by potentially reducing the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, increasing crop yield due to better weed management and less harm to the crops. Step 4: Compare crop A and crop B in terms of chemical usage Crop A is herbicide tolerant, which means it can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without causing harm to the crop. Therefore, it would likely require fewer chemicals compared to crop B, as the use of herbicides can be more targeted and efficient. On the other hand, crop B is not herbicide tolerant, which likely means that using herbicides on it could cause damage to the crop itself. Consequently, farmers might have to resort to a combination of different chemicals, herbicides, and other weed control methods (such as hand weeding) for crop B, which could increase the overall number of chemicals used. Conclusion: Crop B would need more number of chemicals compared to crop A due to its lack of herbicide tolerance, potentially necessitating the use of a variety of chemicals and weed management techniques."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

Write the answer: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 for the invention of holography?","output":"The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 was awarded to Dennis Gabor for his invention of holography. Dennis Gabor was a British-Hungarian physicist who made a significant contribution to the field of optical physics. Gabor was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1900. He obtained his doctorate in engineering from the Technische Hochschule in Berlin in 1927. After the takeover of Nazi Germany, as he was of Jewish origin, Gabor migrated to England in 1933 where he became a British citizen in 1946. He developed a key interest in electron optics and worked extensively on it, which led him to eventually invent holography. The term \\"holography\\" was derived from the Greek words, \\"holos\\" meaning \\"whole\\" and \\"grafo\\" meaning \\"writing\\". Holography is a technique that creates three-dimensional image using light. The idea was based on a concept to improve electron microscopy by correcting the chromatic aberration by reconstructing images from a light source preserving both, its amplitude and phase information, rather than just the amplitude as in normal photopgraphy. However, due to technological restrictions during the 1940s, Gabor wasn't able to construct an actual holograph because he couldn't locate a light source of a singular wavelength needed to create a consistent image. It wasn't until the development and availability of lasers in the 1960s when holography could be properly realized and applied. Lasers, with their ability to produce a pure, single color (monochromatic) and highly intense light, were the missing component needed to produce effective holograms. This visibility of the holography technique has led to its wide use today in various fields like medicine, art, data storage and even entertainment. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences recognised Gabor's pioneering work in holography, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971. He dedicated his later years of life in studying the social implications of technological advancement on society. Dennis Gabor passed away in 1979, leaving behind a significant legacy in the field of Physics and technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The case highlights the strength of the victim in coming forward and the ongoing efforts by law enforcement to bring such offenders to justice, even after several decades. Background of the Case: The story begins in the 1970s when the unnamed man, now labeled as a \\"perverted\\" individual, began grooming a young boy for his own sexual gratification. The process involved manipulation, gaining the trust of the victim, and ultimately exploiting the vulnerability of the child. (Step 1: Providing details on how the man groomed the child highlights the severity of his actions.) Over several years, the abuse continued, leaving a lasting impact on the victim. Tormented by the memories of the maltreatment, the boy was unable to seek help or disclose the horrors he faced to anyone, fearing imminent backlash and blame. (Step 2: Addressing the long-lasting effects of such trauma on the victim while emphasizing the difficulty faced by children in speaking up about their abuse.) The Courage to Speak Out: It wasn't until recent years that the victim mustered the courage to come forward and report his abuser to the authorities. The investigation that followed led to the arrest of the perpetrator, and through the collection of evidence and testimonies, the truth emerged. (Step 3: Describing the victim's journey towards speaking up and seeking justice showcases the individual's courage and determination.) The Verdict and Sentencing: After a lengthy trial, the court handed down a 22-year prison sentence to the abuser, a just consequence for the years of manipulation and exploitation he inflicted upon his victim. The man's actions were deemed \\"perverted\\" due to the predatory nature of grooming a child for such heinous acts. (Step 4: Explaining the court's decision to sentence the offender to a long prison term, emphasizing the gravity of the crime committed.) The Broader Impact: While this case may be far from unique, it serves as an essential reminder of the need to constantly pursue justice and raise awareness about child sexual abuse. The bravery of the victim sets an example for other survivors, who may still be grappling with the pain of their own past abuse. (Step 5: Placing the case within a broader context and pointing out the significance of talking about such issues will encourage other survivors to seek help and justice.) Conclusion: The sentencing of the \\"perverted\\" man to 22 years behind bars marks a victory for the survivor and a sign of the commitment by the law enforcement to hold these offenders accountable. As a society, we must work towards creating a safe environment that encourages survivors to speak up, supports their healing, and ensures such heinous acts do not go unanswered. (Step 6: Ending the article by emphasizing the implications of the case and its importance in promoting justice and giving a voice to the survivors.)"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Conservation of mass. Yes or no? Answer: In special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved, the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important, since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e. those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment. Question: What implication(s) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans? Answer:","output":"The Law of Conservation of Matter, also known as the Conservation of Mass, states that the total amount of matter in a closed system remains constant over time, regardless of the processes occurring within the system. This fundamental principle suggests that matter can neither be created nor destroyed, only converted from one form to another. The law of conservation of matter has several implications for humans, as it governs various natural processes and human activities, including the following: 1. Environmental Balance: The conservation of mass plays a crucial role in maintaining an equilibrium within ecosystems. As matter cycles through different environmental processes, such as the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle, it ensures the sustainability of life on Earth. Human activities that disrupt these natural cycles, such as deforestation, pollution, and excessive resource consumption, can lead to imbalances that threaten the health and well-being of ecosystems and inhabitants. 2. Resource Management: Understanding the conservation of matter helps us better manage our planet's finite resources. Since matter cannot be created or destroyed, conserving limited resources by reducing waste, recycling materials, and embracing sustainable practices is essential for preserving Earth's precious resources for future generations. 3. Energy Efficiency: The conservation of mass is closely related to the Conservation of Energy, which posits that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. As energy and mass are interchangeable, harnessing the power of efficient energy conversion processes enables us to maximize the output derived from a given input, promoting energy efficiency and reducing waste. 4. Scientific and Technological Advancements: Grasping the principles of mass conservation underpins numerous scientific applications and technological advancements. For instance, the concept forms the basis for understanding chemical reactions, balancing chemical equations, and predicting the outcomes of reactions. This insight has informed fields such as chemistry, engineering, materials science, and pharmaceutical development, allowing for innovations that improve human lives daily. 5. Safety in Industrial Processes: A thorough understanding of the conservation of mass ensures that engineers and scientists properly design and monitor industrial processes. Accurately accounting for all reactants, products, and waste materials in an industrial process reduces the risk of dangers such as explosions and harmful by-products, safeguarding human health and the environment. 6. Space Exploration and Astrophysics: The law of conservation of matter is fundamental to our understanding of celestial bodies and cosmic events. In special relativity, mass-energy equivalence becomes an essential aspect of comprehending phenomena such as black holes, supernovae, and the big bang theory, which hold relevance for humankind's pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the universe. In summary, the Law of Conservation of Matter has significant implications for humans, not only in terms of environmental sustainability and resource management but also in fostering advancements in various scientific and technological domains. Understanding the fundamental principle of conservation of mass is crucial for appreciating the natural world, promoting safety in industrial processes, and contributing to the body of knowledge concerning the cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: why is francis disheveled? Movie title: The Keys of the Kingdom Movie plot: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help...

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Electric devices, such as lights and household appliances, change electric current to other forms of energy. For example, an electric stove changes electric current to thermal energy. Other common devices, such as mobile phones and computers, use electric current for another purpose: to encode information. A message encoded this way is called an electronic signal , and the use of electric current for this purpose is called electronics .

Q: An electric stove changes electric current to what form of energy?   A: Answer:","output":"An electric stove changes electric current to thermal energy. Thermal energy, also known as heat energy, is the energy generated by the movement of particles in a substance. In an electric stove, the electric current flows through a heating element, such as a coil or a ceramic plate, causing the particles within the element to move faster and generate heat. This heat is then transferred to the cookware placed on the stove, allowing the food inside the cookware to be cooked or heated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Socialization is a term used by sociologists, social psychologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and educationalists to refer to the lifelong process of inheriting and disseminating norms, customs, values and ideologies, providing an individual with the skills and habits necessary for participating within their own society. Socialization is thus \\"the means by which social and cultural continuity are attained\\".  - An anthropologist is a person engaged in the practice of anthropology. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.  - Specific developmental disorders are disorders in which development is delayed in one specific area or areas , and in which basically all other areas of development are not affected . Specific developmental disorders are as opposed to pervasive developmental disorders that are characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication .  - The diagnostic category pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), as opposed to specific developmental disorders (SDD), refers to a group of five disorders characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication. The pervasive developmental disorders are pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), which includes atypical autism and is the most common; autism, the best-known, now understood to be part of a spectrum; Asperger syndrome; Rett syndrome; and childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD).  - A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else. A natural sign bears a causal relation to its objectfor instance, thunder is a sign of storm, or medical symptoms signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a language, as well as bodily gestures, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular meanings. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, road signs, etc., collectively known as signage) generally inform or instruct using written text, symbols, pictures or a combination of these.  - A society is a group of people involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social grouping sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members. In the social sciences, a larger society often evinces stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups.  - Rett syndrome (RTT), originally termed cerebroatrophic hyperammonemia, is a rare genetic postnatal neurological disorder of the grey matter of the brain that almost exclusively affects females but has also been found in male patients. The clinical features include small hands and feet and a deceleration of the rate of head growth (including microcephaly in some). Repetitive stereotyped hand movements, such as wringing and/or repeatedly putting hands into the mouth, are also noted.  - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.    'specific developmental disorder' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'subclass of'?  Choices: - anthropology  - communication  - constituent  - culture  - group  - interaction  - language  - latin  - neurological disorder  - people  - person  - practice  - process  - road  - sign  - signage  - socialization  - society  - study  - subject  - term  - territory","output":"The term \\"specific developmental disorder\\" is related to the object entity \\"neurological disorder\\" through the relation of 'subclass of'.

Q: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck.

I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

Alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points, so some of them are solids at room temperature.  If Milo removes carbon atoms from his alkane while working in his science lab, what happens to the melting point of that alkane increases or decreases? The answer to this question is:","output":"If Milo removes carbon atoms from his alkane while working in his science lab, the melting point of that alkane will decrease. Step 1: Understand the relationship between the number of carbon atoms and melting points in alkanes. In general, alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points. Step 2: Consider the action being performed. In this case, Milo is removing carbon atoms from the alkane. This implies that the alkane will now have fewer carbon atoms than before. Step 3: Apply the relationship established in Step 1 to the action performed in Step 2. Since the alkane now has fewer carbon atoms, its melting point should decrease according to the established relationship. Step 4: Conclude that the melting point of the alkane will decrease after Milo removes carbon atoms from it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The author appears disappointed and unhappy with the follow-up film they are discussing and disapproves of the shift in style or quality from the original. This negativity and criticism are evident in several aspects of the sentence. Firstly, the author states that there is \\"no excuse\\" for the change, which suggests that the reasons, explanations, or justifications for the alterations in the film are either inadequate or nonexistent. The phrase \\"no excuse\\" conveys a sense of disapproval and frustration, showing that the author is not accepting or excusing the shift in quality or style. Secondly, the author describes the original film as \\"delightful\\" and \\"well-crafted,\\" which are positive adjectives that communicate enjoyment, satisfaction, and appreciation for the filmmaking and storytelling. By contrasting these positive descriptions with the negative description of the follow-up film, the author further emphasizes their negative sentiment and highlights the disappointment they feel. The follow-up film is referred to as a \\"computer-generated cold fish.\\" The phrase \\"cold fish\\" is an idiom that means an unemotional or unresponsive person, but in this context, it is being used as a metaphor to describe the film's perceived lack of warmth, emotional depth, and engagement. The metaphor implies that the film is dull, uninspired, and fails to captivate the audience in the same way as the original. Additionally, the author's choice to label the film as \\"computer-generated\\" hints at dissatisfaction with the implementation of computer graphics or technology in the filmmaking process. The author might be suggesting that the reliance on computer-generated imagery (CGI) or other technical elements negatively impacted the movie's storytelling, emotional depth, or overall quality. This aspect of the statement further contributes to the negative sentiment expressed about the follow-up film. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as negative and critical. The author expresses disappointment, disapproval, and frustration with the follow-up film, emphasizing its perceived shortcomings compared to the delightful and well-crafted original family film. The statement's language and metaphors highlight the author's negative impressions and emotions, suggesting that they believe the sequel does not live up to the standards of its predecessor."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn has the backing of the UK's biggest union, Unite, among several others. A Unite spokesman said: \\"Unite has formally nominated Jeremy Corbyn. It follows Unite's recent policy conference, where members representing all the union's industrial sectors and regions, along with the union's executive council, declared overwhelming support for Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership contest.\\" Other unions supporting the Labour leader include the: Mr Smith said it was \\"a great honour\\" to receive GMB's nomination - which comes on top of support from the Community Union, Musicians Union and shopworkers' union USDAW, the fourth largest. He said: \\"I look forward to working with the GMB, its members and all in the labour movement to tackle inequality, invest in strong public services, and for Britain to have trade union and workers' rights that are the envy of the world.\\" And he told the BBC he thought the nomination was \\"a real vote of endorsement of me, and it's a real shot in the arm for my campaign\\".

On the other hand, Corbyn has the backing of the UK's largest union, Unite, along with several others.

FBI agent Denise Stemen said in an affidavit that Lowe's alerted the FBI recently that intruders had broken into its computer at company headquarters in North Carolina, altered its computer programs and illegally intercepted credit card transactions. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Non-authorized personnel illegally entered into computer networks.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it can be concluded that non-authorized personnel illegally entered into computer networks. The paragraph explicitly mentions the intrusion into Lowe's computer system at their company headquarters in North Carolina, which resulted in the alteration of computer programs and the illegal interception of credit card transactions. The details in the paragraph bring to light several aspects that allow us to draw this conclusion: 1. FBI's involvement: FBI agent Denise Stemen is mentioned in the context of the situation, which indicates that the matter is being treated with the utmost seriousness as it involves federal law enforcement. The FBI typically investigates instances of cybercrime and unauthorized access, suggesting that non-authorized personnel were indeed involved. 2. Intrusion into Lowe's computer system: The paragraph states that intruders had broken into the company's computer system, which implies unauthorized access to a protected and private network. This indicates that non-authorized personnel gained entry into the computer network. 3. Alteration of computer programs: The paragraph also mentions that the intruders altered the company's computer programs. Unauthorized tampering with software or computer systems is a malicious act, further evidencing the involvement of non-authorized personnel. 4. Illegal interception of credit card transactions: Lastly, the paragraph highlights that the intruders intercepted credit card transactions illegally. The unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive information, such as financial transactions, are clear indicators that non-authorized personnel were involved in this cyber attack. Taking all these details into account, we can reasonably conclude that the situation detailed in the paragraph involves non-authorized personnel illegally entering into computer networks. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the FBI is involved in the investigation, and the severity of the cyber attack, including unauthorized access to a corporate computer network, the tampering of computer programs, and the illegal interception of credit card transactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Virginia Tech football falls to Boise State, 33-30, on late touchdown And just like he feared, that youth came back to haunt Virginia Tech as it fell to Boise State, 33-30, in front of a sellout crowd of 86,587. After Virginia Tech climbed out from a 17-0 first-quarter hole to take a late 30-26 lead, Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore connected with wide receiver Austin Pettis on a 13-yard touchdown reception as sophomore linebacker Jeron Gouveia-Winslow gave chase with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining for the game-winning score. It capped a 56-yard drive that took all of 38 seconds. \\"We kind of get down and that changes the whole complexion,\\" said Beamer, who has lost three straight season openers. \\"It was a lot of young guys making young guy mistakes.\\" To begin the first quarter, senior quarterback Tyrod Taylor fumbled the snap on the second play from scrimmage, and the ball was kicked by center Beau Warren, allowing the Broncos to recover on Virginia Tech's 31-yard-line. The Hokies' defense, which featured seven new starters, held its ground and forced Boise State to settle for a 44-yard field goal from place kicker Kyle Brotzman. After losing 11 yards on its next offensive possession, Virginia Tech suffered another miscue. This time the culprit was special teams, usually the Hokies' strong suit. On the ensuing punt, Pettis came through unmarked around the edge to block senior Brian Saunders's kick, and the Broncos took over on Virginia Tech's 12-yard-line. Two plays later, Pettis gave Boise State a 10-0 lead with 9:48 remaining in the first quarter when he caught an eight-yard touchdown pass from Moore. Boise State got more help from the Hokies' special teams before the first quarter was over. After Virginia Tech's Steven Friday sacked Moore for a nine-yard loss, forcing a Boise State punt from midfield, sophomore wide receiver D.J. Coles ran into Brotzman on the punt and then committed a personal foul on the return. Boise State regained possession at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and promptly marched to the end zone, capping off the drive when tight end Tommy Gallarda made a spectacular one-handed touchdown catch to give the Broncos a 17-0 lead heading into the second quarter. \\"They had everything going their way to start the game,\\" said cornerback Rashad Carmichael. \\"We tried to stay calm . . . but they're a good team.\\" Less than four minutes into the second quarter, running back Ryan Williams cut the deficit to 17-7 when he rumbled into the end zone on a one-yard run that was set up by a 34-yard pass from Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin on the previous play.

Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Browns, the Ravens flew to Bill Walsh Field at Monster Park for an interconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers. Baltimore would even go up against the QB that helped them win Super Bowl XXXV, Trent Dilfer, because QB Alex Smith was out with a separated shoulder. After a scoreless first quarter, the Ravens got the first punch with kicker Matt Stover getting a 26-yard and a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Stover gave Baltimore a 49-yard field goal. However, the 49ers threatened with Dilfer completing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A 16 year-old Australian schoolgirl is hoping to achieve a sailing feat that is so tough it has brought many experienced men and women to the brink of death. Sixteen-year-old Jessica Watson of Australia plans to sail solo around the world Jessica Watson, of Mooloolaba, Queensland, plans to set out on a solo round-the-world sailing mission in November -- and hopes to become the youngest person to ever sail non-stop around the world alone. But with the impending weeks of solitary confinement, freeze-dried foods, changing conditions and threat of injury, illness or death -- why would she want to do it? On his daily blog,","output":"Watson's father documents her progress, providing updates on her location, weather conditions, and mental and physical state. Supporters and fellow sailors follow the blog, cheering her on from afar. As the weeks pass, Watson encounters numerous challenges, including a significant storm that tests her resolve and skills. However, she perseveres, drawing upon her knowledge, tenacity, and passion for sailing. Throughout her journey, Watson stays in touch with her family and friends via satellite phone and email. They offer her encouragement and advice, helping her cope with the loneliness and isolation. Surprisingly, Watson also develops a friendship with a fellow solo sailor who is also attempting the same feat, albeit from a different starting point.

Article: Scientists in Israel have discovered a new way to test for water pollution by \\"listening\\" to what the plants growing in water have to say. By shining a laser beam   on the tiny pieces of _ floating in the water,the researchers said they hear sound waves that tell them the type and amount of contamination   in the water. \\"It is a red light,telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water,\\" said Zvy Dubinsky,an aquatic biologist at Israel's Bar Ilan University.\\"Algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality.\\"\\"The secret,\\" he said,\\"is to measure the rate of photosynthesis   in the algae,meaning the plant's ability to transform light into energy.\\" During photosynthesis,plants also release oxygen into the air. Dubinsky's technique is easy to perform because of the overabundance of algae in the planet's water.Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from algae.A prototype tester that occupies about one square meter of a laboratory desktop,shoots a laser beam at water samples to stimulate photosynthesis in the algae.But not all of the laser's heat is used.Depending on the condition of the algae and the rate of photosynthesis,some of the heat is shot back into the water,creating sound waves,Dubinsky said.With a special underwater microphone,researchers are able to analyze the strength of the sound waves and determine the health of the algae and the condition of the surrounding water. \\"Algae suffering from lead poisoning,like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants,will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins,\\" said researcher Yulia Pinchasov.She said that testing algae photosynthesis can determine water quality more accurately and easily than laborintensive methods now used like chemical and radioactive carbon testing.

His marriage to Deanna (Melissa George) is deteriorating, and his daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) suffers from diabetes, requiring expensive medication. Charles's story is being written down by an unidentified man in a prison cell. On a commuter train, Charles encounters an alluring woman named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston). She is a married financial adviser. The two show each other photographs of their respective daughters and begin to talk. A mutual attraction develops, and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed manâlater identified as Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel)âbursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda agree not to report the crime, as they do not want their spouses to learn of the affair. Shortly after, Charles is blackmailed by LaRoche, who threatens to kill his family if he does not pay 20,000, which Charles promptly pays. A month later, the attacker calls again, this time demanding 100,000. Charles explains his situation to Winston (RZA), an ex-con who works as a repairman in his building and whom Charles had earlier befriended. Winston offers to scare off LaRoche for ten percent of the payout. Charles agrees and embezzles the money from his company. He and Winston travel to the meeting location specified by LaRoche, intending to get the drop on him. However, before they can act, Winston is shot and killed. LaRoche appears and takes the money, leaving Charles to dispose of the body. Afterwards, Charles is questioned by detective Franklin Church (Giancarlo Esposito) about Winston's murder.

Given the question: Given the below context:  In Sweden, juries are uncommon; the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges (nämndemän). However, the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court (tingsrätt) when accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If a person is accused of e.g. libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors. This applies also in civil (tort) cases under the fundamental laws. A majority of at least six jurors must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime. If it does not, the defendant is acquitted or, in a civil case, held not liable. If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed, this finding is not legally binding for the court; thus, the court (three judges) can still acquit the defendant or find him/her not liable. A jury acquittal may not be overruled after appeal. In Swedish civil process, the \\"English rule\\" applies to court costs. Earlier, a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could, when deciding on the matter of such costs, set aside the English rule, and instead use the American rule, that each party bears its own expense of litigation. This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6.2. of the European Convention on Human Rights, by the Supreme Court of Sweden, in 2012.

As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling.

The passage is presented from the point of view of a character known as Dingo, who is in a complex relationship with Julie and has a strained past with his ex-wife Darby, who has stolen a box from him. This box holds significant sentimental values for him as it was hand-carved by his father prior to his death. However, the content of the box is not explicitly conveyed in the text. We know the box is essential to Dingo and that it carries high sentimental worth for him due to its association with his father. This triggers an inference that it might contain something linked to his family or their shared past. Yet, there are no specifics about what the box contains. Therefore, due to a lack of precise and certain information in the text extract, we are left to speculate on the box's contents. The available options \\"Dingo's old photos,\\" \\"His mother's letters,\\" and \\"Some toys\\" are purely speculative in nature and aren't validated by the passage provided. Consequently, without any substantive details provided in the narrative, the correct answer to \\"What was in the box?\\" is \\"not enough information\\".

Martha used apricot instead of peach to make her jam because her teacher told her the  Pick from: -- peach was healthier for her. -- apricot was healthier for her.","output":"Martha used apricot instead of peach to make her jam because her teacher told her the apricot was healthier for her. This decision, although quite a change to her original plan, turned out to be a delightful surprise that led her to discover new flavors and health benefits. When Martha first heard about the difference in nutritional value between peaches and apricots, she was intrigued. Her teacher explained that although both fruits are packed with vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, apricots generally possess more essential nutrients and a higher concentration of these nutrients than peaches. For starters, apricots tend to have a higher content of Vitamin A, an essential vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy vision, skin, and immune system. Vitamin A is also known to be an antioxidant, which can help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Peaches do contain Vitamin A as well, but apricots are a more abundant source. Furthermore, Martha learned that apricots contain more Vitamin C than peaches. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that helps maintain healthy skin, bones, and teeth, and also supports the immune system. Additionally, Vitamin C is an antioxidant and plays a role in the absorption of plant-based iron, which can be especially important for vegetarians or those on a plant-based diet. Another advantage of using apricots in her jam was the presence of higher amounts of potassium. Potassium is a crucial mineral that aids in fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve signals. This mineral also helps reduce blood pressure and protect against stroke by assisting in the relaxation of blood vessels. Convinced by these health benefits, Martha decided to give her apricot jam recipe a try, and she was not disappointed. She found that not only was the apricot jam more nutritious than the original peach jam she had planned to make, but it also had a unique and delightful flavor. The natural sweetness of apricots, combined with their slightly tangy aftertaste, created a rich and textured jam that perfectly complemented her morning toast. Even though she enjoyed the taste of peach jam, replacing it with apricot turned out to be a delightful and healthy change for Martha. In addition to the taste, Martha was pleasantly surprised by the golden-orange hue of her apricot jam, which gave it a vibrant, warm appearance. This bright color resulted from the presence of carotenoids, the pigments responsible for the color of many fruits and vegetables, which also possess antioxidant properties. In summary, Martha's decision to use apricots instead of peaches for her jam was a wise one. Not only did she enjoy discovering a new, delicious flavor and vibrant appearance, but she also benefited from the increased nutritional value that apricots offer. By heeding her teacher's advice, Martha unlocked the door to a healthier and more satisfying jam-making experience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

Choices:  - viruses  - vaccines  - parasites  - pathogens  A: A:","output":"The phagocytes that are part of the body's second line of defense attack any pathogens that they encounter. This is a crucial and effective way for our immune system to protect us from harmful foreign invaders. Phagocytes are a group of immune cells that have the ability to engulf and destroy any unwanted particles, like dead or damaged cells, and more importantly, pathogens that may cause harm to the body. Pathogens are disease-causing organisms, which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. When a pathogen enters the body, it can invade the host’s tissues, and the immune system will deploy various defensive mechanisms to eliminate the threat. Phagocytes are one of the key components of the innate immune response, acting as the body's second line of defense. The first line of defense includes physical and chemical barriers such as the skin, mucous membranes, and saliva, which try to prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place. Once a pathogen invades the body, the innate immune response is activated to eliminate or prevent further spread of the pathogen. Phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, are among the first responders in this process. They detect and recognize foreign substances by using specific receptors on their cell surface to bind to the pathogen or to molecules released by the pathogen. Once a phagocyte has bound to a pathogen, it engulfs the pathogen and internalizes it within a structure called the phagosome. This phagosome then fuses with a lysosome, an organelle containing digestive enzymes, which breaks down and destroys the pathogen. Choices given were: - Viruses: Viruses are a type of pathogen that can cause infections in the host organism. They reproduce by entering a host cell and hijacking the cell's machinery to replicate their genetic material. - Vaccines: Vaccines are not a target for phagocytes. They are substances that help prevent disease by stimulating an immune response to a specific pathogen, usually through the introduction of a weakened or inactivated form of the pathogen or its components. - Parasites: Parasites are organisms that live in or on a host organism and derive nutrients from it, often causing harm to the host. Parasites are a type of pathogen, and therefore, can be targeted by phagocytes during an immune response. - Pathogens: Pathogens include all organisms capable of causing disease in a host organism, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. As mentioned before, phagocytes play a crucial role in attacking and eliminating these pathogens. In conclusion, phagocytes act as a vital part of the body's second line of defense by specifically recognizing and attacking pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, keeping the host organism healthy and protected from diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and... According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of this story, Pres. Moon probably:","output":"After the end of this story, President Moon probably continued his pursuit of diplomacy, working closely with the United States and other regional partners to find a peaceful solution to the North Korea nuclear issue while adhering to economic sanctions in place. He likely aimed for inter-Korean reconciliation with denuclearization as a key condition for peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The next time you eat a piece of chocolate, be sure to enjoy it, because according to two of the world's largest chocolate makers--Mars Inc and Barry Callebaut, the treat may soon be in short supply. The problem? We are consuming the candy at a faster pace than farmers can grow cocoa. The manufacturers say that in 2013, people consumed 70,000 tons more cocoa than was produced. Experts say that this is the worst supply-demand imbalance they have experienced in more than 50 years. Parts of the reason for the condition is the large reduction in supply, caused by a continuous drought in the west African countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa is produced. Additionally, a certain disease known as frosty pod has destroyed 30 to 40 percent of global cocoa production. As a result, many farmers have turned to more profitable and easier grown crops like corn. This means that even if conditions improve, cocoa production may never get back to normal. Meanwhile, the world is only getting hungrier for chocolate. The biggest increase in demand is from the residents of emerging market countries like India. Though their consumption is nowhere close to the amount European devour, their newly acquired amount for the treat , is making a huge dent  in an already tight market. There is also the growing desire for dark chocolate, which contains more than 70 percent cocoa compared to normal chocolates. Experts believe that if consumption continue at this pace, cocoa deficits   could swell to one million tons by 2020 and to an even more worrisome, two million tons, by 2030. Not surprisingly, cocoa prices have risen by 60% since 2012, a cost that manufacturers have offset by raising the prices of everyone's favorite candy. As the situation worsens, the price of chocolate can only rise--so be sure to enjoy piece of the sweet treat, like it is your last! It is hard to raise cocoa production probably because_. A) The weather is changeable in the west Africa B) A certain disease spread around the world C) Many farmers don't grow any longer D) It is impossible for conditions to be improved The answer to this question is:","output":"C) Many farmers don't grow any longer I can conclude this answer based on the following information from the text: 1. There is a continuous drought in the west African countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana, which affects the production of cocoa. 2.

Frozen canals, rivers and lakes have transformed the Netherlands into one enormous ice-rink. Sports shops have sold out of skates, bike suppliers are swapping their cycles for sledges and all over the country people are having their blades sharpened ready to take advantage of the ice generated by exceptionally cold winter. \\"It's in our genes. We've been skating for centuries,\\" explains Bert van Voorbergen, who runs an online skating museum in the town of Almere. \\"Every year when frost comes, there's something indescribable released inside. As soon as there is ice, everyone is the same, everyone is equal. Maybe that's why we love it so much.\\" What stirred most excitement in the Netherlands was the chance that this year, for the first time since 1997, it might be cold enough to hold the ice race to end all ice races: the \\"Elfstedentocht\\" or Eleven Cities Race - the biggest competition held on natural ice in the world. It covers 200km (124 miles) of land, features 16,000 skaters and can attract more than two million spectators. The nation was buzzing, Dutch media covering every twist and turn in a story that filled much of the main evening news broadcasts on national TV. A tweet from Olympic speed-skating Gold medallist Mark Tuitert summed up the sentiments of skaters across the country who say they've been struck by \\"Elfstedentocht fever\\". Bike shop owner Martin de Vries told me he was in school when it was last held 15 years ago. \\"We didn't have internet then, only radio, and everywhere you went everyone was tuned in to the race. It was crazy, everyone rushing home to try and catch it on TV. Or if you were lucky enough to get tickets, of course, you'd be up there cheering on the skaters.\\" But on Wednesday night came the news millions had been dreading - the organisers announced: \\"It's not on.\\" For the Elfstedentocht to go ahead, the temperatures must stay below freezing and for the past few days in Leeuwarden my thermometer's mercury has been bobbing around the -3C mark. But it is also essential that the ice remains thick so as not to crack under the pressure of 16,000 skaters. The Frisian Eleven Cities Association - set up to measure the ice and monitor the conditions - says it needs 15cm (6in) of ice covering the entire track before they can say those mythical words \\"it's on\\". At the moment some parts of the route have only half the depth required. Every year the \\"will-they-won't-they\\" speculation surrounding this legendary race starts to swirl around towns, villages and all over the media at the first signs of a frost. The race tradition began in 1909. The last contest was won by a turnip farmer. And this year the Netherlands recorded its lowest temperatures in 27 years. Preparations have been underway for days. A team of eager volunteers - assisted by a small army of soldiers based near the Friesland route - has been helping to shovel away the snow to give the ice the best possible hope of staying strong. But in the end it seems their best efforts were in vain. After the decision, the association's \\"ice master\\" Jan Oostenbrug urged skaters not to despair and instead get out on the ice and skate their disappointment away. There is a small chance the race will still go ahead later in the season. But with a thaw forecast for Sunday, hopes are fading like the frost. Many are resigning themselves to the cold hard fact that they may have to wait another year before Elfstendentocht fever strikes again. However, skaters have been turning up in their hundreds in the village of Giethoorn, just outside Friesland, to race on a shorter course that runs for more than 25km between villages and does not have the same stringent regulations as the official Eleven Cities race. Although the skaters are still holding out hope that the main contest can go ahead, for now they are making the most of the freezing conditions. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The text describes how the unusually cold winter in the Netherlands has frozen canals, rivers, and lakes, turning the country into a giant ice rink. Sports shops have sold out of ice skates and bike suppliers have begun selling sleds to keep up with the demand for winter activities. The Dutch have a centuries-long love for ice skating, and the cold weather led to excitement about the possibility of the \\"Elfstedentocht\\" or Eleven Cities Race taking place for the first time since 1997. The race, held on natural ice, covers 200km and attracts 16,000 skaters and over two million spectators. Unfortunately, the race was not held due to ice not being thick enough in some parts of the route. Nevertheless, many skaters took advantage of the freezing conditions and skated on shorter courses in the village of Giethoorn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How to add a rustic look to wooden furniture?","output":"Adding a rustic look to wooden furniture can be a rewarding DIY project, as it allows you to add character to your furniture while also connecting with the natural elements. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to help you achieve this goal: 1. Choose the furniture piece: Start by selecting the wooden furniture piece that you want to give a rustic makeover. Some ideal options for rustic transformations are wooden tables, chairs, shelves, cabinets and benches. 2. Gather materials: You'll need a few essential materials and tools for this project. These include sandpaper (with varying grits, from 80 to 220), wood stain/paint (choose a color that gives a weathered look), paintbrushes, clean rags, polyurethane finish (clear matte or satin finish), and protective gear (gloves, a mask and goggles). 3. Prep the furniture: Clean the furniture piece thoroughly, removing any dust, grime, or residue. The surface needs to be free of any dirt or grease. 4. Sand the furniture: Use sandpaper to remove the glossy protective finish or any paint on the wooden surface. Start with the lower grit (80-100) sandpaper and work your way up to medium (150-180) and fine (200-220) grits, ensuring you're achieving a smooth surface. Sand in the direction of the wood grain to avoid scratches. 5. Apply the wood stain/paint: After sanding, wipe the furniture piece down with a damp cloth to remove any dust particles. Next, put on your gloves and apply the wood stain or paint using a paintbrush or rag. Start with a thin coat and let it dry as per the manufacturer's instructions. You can add additional coats for a deeper color and intense rustic look. 6. Distressing the furniture (optional): If you want the furniture to have a more worn-out appearance, you can distress it further. Using a combination of coarse sandpaper or a wire brush, gently scrape away paint or stain on the edges, corners, and other areas where natural wear would occur. Take care not to overdo this step, as too much distressing might make the furniture look unrealistic. 7. Apply polyurethane finish: Once the wood stain/paint is completely dry, apply a clear polyurethane finish to seal and protect the furniture. Choose a matte or satin finish for a more authentic rustic appearance. Apply the finish in thin, even coats, allowing each coat to dry based on the manufacturer's instructions. Usually, two to three coats work best. 8. Reassemble the furniture (if needed): If you had to disassemble any parts of the furniture before starting the project, reassemble them once the polyurethane finish is dry. 9. Add rustic accents (optional): Complement your rustic wooden furniture with accessories such as antique knobs, handles, or decorative hardware to enhance the overall look. 10. Enjoy your rustic furniture piece: Your transformed wooden furniture is now ready to be displayed and used in your home, adding warmth and charm to your living space. Remember that the key to achieving a successful rustic look is patience and attention to detail. Take your time with each step, and don't hesitate to experiment with different wood stains, paints, and distressing techniques to create the perfect rustic piece of furniture."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Sentence from a movie review: try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the preceding movie review, it appears that the movie was viewed negatively. The reviewer suggests that the filmmakers attempted to create characters out of the obvious cliches, which generally refers to overused or tired character tropes that audiences may have seen many times before. Such an attempt might be seen as an effort to subvert or reimagine these cliches in a fresh, innovative way, but, unfortunately, in this particular film, the reviewer finds that the creators failed to achieve this goal effectively. Additionally, the reviewer states that the cliched characters end up being used as \\"punching bags\\" in the movie. This expression implies that these characters might have been treated poorly or made to endure some form of punishment, or rather, they have been reduced to simple entities that exist solely for other characters to take out their frustrations on. The use of this term suggests that the movie didn't offer much depth or complexity to these characters, and instead, merely relied on their cliched aspects without developing them further or providing any meaningful context. Overall, the statement in the review likely indicates disappointment and dissatisfaction with the movie's approach to character development and storytelling. The mention of cliches being used to create characters and the lack of successful execution in doing so, combined with the portrayal of these characters as \\"punching bags,\\" presents a negative impression of the film. In conclusion, the movie was not seen positively based on this particular review, as the criticism suggests that it failed to rise above cliches and lacked depth or nuance in its portrayal of characters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

The question is essentially asking for a clarification or explanation of the meaning or concept of \\"alternative\\" within the context of today's world. The word \\"anymore\\" suggests that the term \\"alternative\\" might have undergone some changes in meaning or usage over time. In our modern society, the concept of \\"alternative\\" has indeed evolved from its initial interpretation. In general, \\"alternative\\" refers to something that is not part of the mainstream or conventional choices, offering a different approach or perspective. It can be applied to various areas such as music, fashion, culture, politics, and lifestyle. However, as trends and preferences change, so does the idea of what constitutes an alternative option. The term \\"alternative\\" was commonly used during the 1980s and 1990s to describe subcultures and forms of expression that deviated from the mainstream standards. For instance, alternative rock music was a genre that represented a break from the dominant pop and rock sound and lyrics of that era. Similarly, alternative fashion was a way for individuals to assert their unique styles, often through clothing pieces, accessories, and hairstyles that deviated from the norm. With the rise of the internet and digital media, the sharing of ideas, products, and perspectives has accelerated, making it harder to define what is considered mainstream or alternative. Today, subcultures and niche interests tend to blend together more seamlessly, and the boundaries that once separated them have become blurred. Because of this, what once might have been considered alternative might now seem more mainstream, while the idea of being alternative has become more fluid and subjective. In summary, the question is asking about the description of the term \\"alternative\\" and how its meaning might have changed or evolved overtime. The concept of alternative has become more complex due to the rapid exchange of ideas and the blending of cultures and subcultures in today's digital world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Detailed Instructions: This task is about classifying the similarity of two sentences. The sentences can be classified as (a) SIMILAR - similar to each other, and (b) DISSIMILAR - not similar to each other. Sentences that have the same RDF relationship in terms of [subject, predicate, object] are similar to each other. The input is a list of two sentences and the output is either SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR. Q: ['A Glastonbury Romance, which has 1174 pages, is in print and has the OCLC number 76798317 and the ISBN number 0-7156-3648-0.', 'The printed copy of A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages, an OCLC number of 76798317 and an ISBN number of -7156-3648-0.'] A:","output":"SIMILAR Part #1 : Understanding the Concept of Similarity Usage: Similarity in the context of this task relates to sentences that have the same RDF (Resource Description Framework) relationship in terms of [subject, predicate, object]. For instance, in the sentences  \\"A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages\\" and \\"The printed copy of A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages\\", the subject is \\"A Glastonbury Romance\\", the predicate is \\"has\\", and the object is \\"1174 pages\\". Despite different phrasing, the fundamental relationship remains the same, making the sentences similar. Part #2 : Classifying Similar Sentences Usage: If the sentences share the same subject, predicate, and object, they are deemed similar. Using the same example as above, \\"A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages\\" and \\"The printed copy of A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages\\" share the same subject, predicate, and object, making them similar. Hence, the output for this would be \\"SIMILAR\\". Part #3 : Classifying Dissimilar Sentences Usage: Contrarily, if the sentences do not share the same RDF relationships, they are classified as dissimilar. For example, \\"A Glastonbury Romance, which has 1174 pages, is in print.\\" and \\"The sun shines brightly in the sky.\\" have totally different subject, predicate, and object relationships and hence are deemed dissimilar. The output in this case would be \\"DISSIMILAR\\". Part #4 : Processing the Input and Output Usage: Here, the task is to take an input of two sentences and determine whether they're similar or dissimilar according to their RDF relationships. The output is either \\"SIMILAR\\" or \\"DISSIMILAR\\". So, for an input of ['A Glastonbury Romance, which has 1174 pages, is in print and has the OCLC number 76798317 and the ISBN number 0-7156-3648-0.', 'The printed copy of A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages, an OCLC number of 76798317 and an ISBN number of -7156-3648-0.'], both sentences share the same subjects, predicates, and objects despite different phrasing, making them similar and hence the output is \\"SIMILAR\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(II) no.","output":"(I) Yes, the statement \\"The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both Les Nabis and the Symbolists (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms\\" contains the correct answer to \\"Which technique did the Impressionists use to make their subjects simple forms?\\" To provide an expanded explanation, let's break down the provided statement with more context. The Impressionists, who were a group of 19th-century French painters, influenced the art world by deviating from the traditional rules of academic painting. Through innovative techniques and approaches to representing reality, they were able to create a new language in the world of art. One of the critical techniques they used to simplify their subjects was the \\"double point of view.\\" This method allowed them to display multiple perspectives within a single composition and showed the complexity of the world by combining different angles. They used the technique to blur the distinctions between subjects and create an overall sense of unity in their paintings. This allowed for deeper openness to interpretation, moving away from traditional realism into a more contemporary, suggestive style. Moreover, the Impressionists significantly impacted and influenced other art movements, such as Les Nabis and Symbolists. The artists from these later movements, who themselves admired Paul Cézanne (an influential artist associated with Post-Impressionism), took these techniques further. They \\"flattened the picture plane,\\" which means that they reduced the sense of depth in their paintings by eliminating the normal conventions that defined perspective. This was achieved by breaking down the subjects present in their works into essential shapes, lines, and patterns. The result was a composition consisting of simpler geometric forms. This simplification enabled the artists to focus on other aspects of their work, such as color, emotions, and atmosphere. In conclusion, the statement accurately reflects the technique employed by Impressionists to create simplicity in their subjects, which is their usage of a \\"double point of view\\" that allowed for multiple perspectives to be represented. Additionally, the statement also highlights the influence of Impressionism on later art movements and their own methods to produce similar simplification of forms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Inside the brains of human subjects, they pinpointed the unique imprints of two visual memories that were triggered by the same word. Then they watched as repeatedly recalling one of the images caused the second, interfering memory to vanish. The study is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The results suggest that our brains actively delete memories that might distract us from the task at hand. \\"People are used to thinking of forgetting as something passive,\\" said lead author Dr Maria Wimber from the University of Birmingham. \\"Our research reveals that people are more engaged than they realise in shaping what they remember of their lives.\\" Dr Wimber performed the study with colleagues from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge. She told the BBC the implications of the new findings were not as simple as a \\"one in, one out\\" policy for memory storage. \\"It's not that we're pushing something out of our head every time we're putting something new in. \\"The brain seems to think that the things we use frequently are the things that are really valuable to us. So it's trying to keep things clear - to make sure that we can access those important things really easily, and push out of the way those things that are competing or interfering.\\" The idea that frequently recalling something can cause us to forget closely related memories is not new; Dr Wimber explained that it had \\"been around since the 1990s\\". But never before had scientists managed to confirm that this was the result of an active suppression of the interfering memory, rather than just a passive deterioration. What made the discovery possible was identifying reliable indicators that her subjects were recalling a given picture, inside their visual cortex. She did this by getting them to do a number of \\"boring\\" tasks in the brain scanner, before the memory trials even began. This might involve looking at a picture of Marilyn Monroe, or Albert Einstein, many times over. \\"We show people visual pictures of these memories over and over again - and we can sample the prototypical brain response to those pictures,\\" Dr Wimber explained. This allowed the researchers to discover what was distinctive about the \\"Monroe\\" pattern compared to the \\"Einstein\\" one. Then, by triggering them both with the same, unrelated word (eg \\"sand\\") but only asking for one to be remembered, they were able to watch, say, the Monroe trace persist while Einstein withered and faded. Dr Wimber hopes the findings could prove useful in psychology, where erasing specific memories is sometimes exactly what patients need. \\"Forgetting is often viewed as a negative thing, but of course, it can be incredibly useful when trying to overcome a negative memory from our past,\\" she said. \\"So there are opportunities for this to be applied in areas to really help people.\\" Dr Hugo Spiers, a senior lecturer in behavioural neuroscience at University College London, told BBC News the research was exciting and elegantly done. \\"This is an example of good brain imaging research,\\" he said. \\"The results go beyond simply revealing that a brain region is involved in memory: they provide insights into the mechanisms used by the brain to achieve this.\\" The work also impressed Dr Eva Feredoes, who studies memory mechanisms at the University of Reading. She said the finding could even prove useful for tackling memory loss in dementia. \\"We know that memories compete with each other at different stages while they are being remembered and when they are retrieved, with the losers of the competition forgotten from memory,\\" Dr Feredoes said. \\"Solving this complex 'competition' could pave the way for new research into new treatments in diseases that affect memory, such as dementia. Importantly, there are now several techniques to improve brain function. Combined with these results, we have viable mechanisms and brain areas to target with these techniques.\\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.

This is because the two use different muscles and different parts of the brain. But what exactly happens? What makes a real smile look “real”?  During a genuine smile, there is voluntary and involuntary contraction of two muscles: the zygomatic major and the orbicularis oculi, which raise the corners of your mouth and the areas around your cheeks and eyes, respectively. A forced smile only uses mouth muscles, however, because we cannot voluntarily contract the orbicularis oculi. This is why some people say a real smile uses the whole face, especially the eyes. Real smiles engage separates part of the brain, as well. While a forced smile uses the motor cortex, the real deal engages the limbic system, or the brain's emotional center. Like the rest of your body, your facial muscles will get better at their job if you exercise them often. They can be strengthened and toned through use, making it easier for you to flash your smile. Facial exercises and smiling can also make you look healthier and younger.  For a simple exercise, try a plain smile. Stretch the corners of your mouth laterally and hold for 10 seconds. Then, part your lips slightly and hold another 10 seconds. Repeat, even expanding your smile if you want.  Try this exercise to erase fine lines around your mouth: pucker your lips and suck in your cheeks, then try to smile. Hold this pose until the muscles start to tire. Do it once a day. Another exercise is the “silly rabbit.” For this one, smile as widely as possible without parting your lips. Then, try to wiggle your nose back and forth. This will engage the cheek muscles. Hold for 10 seconds and repeat. As said, a real smile does not just use the mouth and lips. It also engages the upper face, causing small crinkles around our eyes. In fact, this is probably the strongest give-away between a fake smile (using only the mouth and teeth) and a full, genuine one. A natural smile should light up your entire face.  Remember to lift your cheek muscles when smiling. Your eye brows may also be engaged and slightly raised. Try practicing in front of a mirror. As an added aid, cover your mouth so that only your eyes and eyebrows are visible. You should be able to “see” the smile only from your eyes. If you worry about fine lines around your eyes, consider ways to reduce the wrinkles other than keeping a strictly neutral expression. Smoking, lack of sleep, and exposure to the sun are much bigger culprits than smiles. Cut them out of your routine. You shouldn't have to sacrifice smiling. Flashing your smile in front of a mirror is a great way to practice. It will help you to discover what your natural smile looks and feels like, but also how to control it and use it to best advantage.  As children we're often taught to say “cheese!” for photos. Actually, “cheese” isn't great for a natural smile. Sounds that end with “ah” like mocha or yoga are much better at opening your mouth while slightly raising your cheekbones, looking more natural. Practice!  Pay attention to angles. Your face and smile might look better at certain angles than others. Experiment in the mirror. Find your best side. Then, use that angle in real interactions.  Some fashion models also use the following trick: touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth, just behind the front teeth. The movement should open your jaw very slightly and better define its lines when you smile.

To do this, subtract 3450 from both sides of the equation: -990*o = -11400 - 3450 Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation: -11400 - 3450 = -14850 So the equation becomes: -990*o = -14850 Step 4: Finally, to isolate the variable 'o,' divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'o', which is -990: -990*o/-990 = -14850/-990 o = 15 Thus, the value of 'o' in the given equation is 15."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: House of Wax Movie plot: Professor Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is a talented wax figure sculptor with a wax museum in 1890s New York City. He specializes in historical figures, featuring sculptures of John Wilkes Booth, Joan of Arc, and one of Marie Antoinette, which he considers his masterpiece. When his business partner Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) demands more sensational exhibits to increase profits, Jarrod refuses. Jarrod then gives a private tour to renowned art critic Sidney Wallace. Wallace, deeply impressed with Jarrod's sculptures, agrees to buy Burke out, but will not be able to do so until after he returns from a continental trip. That same night, Burke deliberately sets the museum on fire, intending to claim the insurance money. In the process, he fights off Jarrod, who is desperately attempting to save his precious sculptures. Burke splashes kerosene over Jarrod's body and leaves him to die in the fire. Miraculously, Jarrod survives, but with severe injuries including crippled hands. He builds a new House of Wax with help from deaf-mute sculptor Igor (Charles Bronson) and another assistant named Leon Averill. Jarrod now concedes to popular taste and includes a \\"Chamber of Horrors\\" that showcases both historical crimes and recent events, such as the apparent suicide of his former business partner Burke. In reality, Burke was murdered by a cloaked, disfigured killer who then staged the death as a suicide. Burke's fiancÃ©e, Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones), is murdered soon afterward. Her body mysteriously disappears from the morgue. Cathyâs friend Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) visits the museum and is troubled by the strong resemblance of the Joan of Arc figure to her dead friend. Jarrod explains he used photographs of Cathy when he made the sculpture. Unsatisfied, Sue returns after hours and uncovers the horrifying truth behind the House of Wax: many of the figures are wax-coated corpses, including Cathy and Burke.

Review: Funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to Romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and \\"Whoopee\\" filled 2 hour MTV video. Frantic editing, pop-video camera work, \\"cool\\" music blah blah blah Actually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster)... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in the \\"who will die next\\" stakes and a total cash in on the Dawn Of The Dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity... Don't remakes of classics get on your nerves? Can they REALLY not come up with something original? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy) are totally missing. This is an action flick, plain and simple. The faster the better.

Watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get The Godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable Pop director is at the moment, and Star Wars remade, with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds...

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No, the answer you found is not directly related to the question asked. The question is about the split of phone numbers into two groups, 3 digits and then 4 digits, not about local area code dialing. Allow me to provide a detailed answer to the question: How did phone numbers get split into 3, then 4 digits? The current phone numbering system in the United States and Canada, called the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), was established in 1947. This plan divides the ten-digit phone numbers into three parts: a three-digit area code (NPA), a three-digit central office/exchange code (NXX), and four-digit line or station code. The three-digit area code allows for a more straightforward identification of regional locations. The following three-digit central office/exchange code denotes a local calling area or specific local telephone company office within an area code. The four-digit line or station code represents the unique number assigned to a specific telephone line within that central office. The reason for this structure is to manage the numbering resources effectively and facilitate the routing of calls among different regions, allowing for more efficient organization and easier long-distance connections. It was needed as the telephone system expanded and the number of connected users grew, requiring a more established and organized numbering system. So, the split of phone numbers into 3 and then 4-digit groups is a part of the North American Numbering Plan, which facilitates easier call routing and organization across different regions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...  I am facing a new situation today: Danny owned two parcels of land. parcel A had a soil with high salinity levels, while parcel B had a rich and healthy soil.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which parcel had plants with lower chances of surviving stressful conditions?

We have this problem: -1636 = -107*s + 9928 - 2255 First, we need to combine the numbers that are not attached to the letter \\"s\\". So, we add 9928 and subtract 2255 from it.

So, let's subtract 7673 from both sides of the equation: -1636 - 7673 = -107*s -9319 = -107*s Now, we just have one more step to find the treasure!

Article: By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin, who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin (1969) and Led Zeppelin II (1969), and Deep Purple, who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, In Rock (1970). Also significant was Black Sabbath's Paranoid (1970), which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror. All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath's lead into territory that was often \\"darker and more menacing\\", hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music.

However, continued activation of stellate cells during chronic liver damage causes excessive matrix deposition and the formation of pathological scar tissue leading to fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. The importance of sustained stellate cell activation for this pathological process is well recognized, and several signalling pathways that can promote stellate cell activation have been identified, such as the TGFβ-, PDGF-, and LPS-dependent pathways. However, the mechanisms that trigger and drive the early steps in activation are not well understood.     METHODS AND RESULTS We identified the Hippo pathway and its effector YAP as a key pathway that controls stellate cell activation. YAP is a transcriptional co-activator and we found that it drives the earliest changes in gene expression during stellate cell activation. Activation of stellate cells in vivo by CCl4 administration to mice or activation in vitro caused rapid activation of YAP as revealed by its nuclear translocation and by the induction of YAP target genes. YAP was also activated in stellate cells of human fibrotic livers as evidenced by its nuclear localization. Importantly, knockdown of YAP expression or pharmacological inhibition of YAP prevented hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro and pharmacological inhibition of YAP impeded fibrogenesis in mice.     CONCLUSIONS YAP activation is a critical driver of hepatic stellate cell activation and inhibition of YAP presents a novel approach for the treatment of liver fibrosis.","output":"Title: \\"YAP Activation: A Critical Driver of Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation and Potential Therapeutic Target for Liver Fibrosis\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"After analyzing the given product review, it appears that the reviewer is expressing mixed opinions on the product, which in this case is the work of the googlepoet Matthea Harvey. The review offers both flattering and unflattering remarks; however, we will dissect these elements to provide a more in-depth understanding of its overall tone. On the one hand, the review describes Matthea Harvey as a \\"googlepoet\\" and goes on to praise her work, stating that she is \\"plexes beyond your solar plexuses.\\" This statement is overtly flattering and demonstrates admiration for Harvey's poetic prowess. The use of \\"plexes beyond your solar plexuses\\" is a creative expression that implies her work is incredibly intricate and capable of eliciting strong emotional reactions. Conversely, the review also contains some unflattering comments, albeit not directed at Matthea Harvey's work itself. The reviewer explicitly calls out Joe Sallivan and Pete Dumpsey, referring to them as \\"heartbreaking wrecks of staggering meanness\\" and demanding that they \\"stop reviewing books\\" and \\"stop reading.\\" These remarks are undoubtedly unflattering but are not aimed at Harvey's poetry. The negative comments are instead directed towards other presumed reviewers or critics, implying that they might not fully appreciate or understand Harvey's artistic brilliance. In summary, this review presents Matthea Harvey's work in a primarily flattering light while simultaneously expressing strong disapproval towards other reviewers or critics. The negative comments are not targeted at the product itself but rather at those who the reviewer perceives as failing to appreciate the value of Harvey's work. From this analysis, one could infer that the reviewer is a staunch supporter of Matthea Harvey and wishes to see her work receive the positive recognition it deserves."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: Speaking is profoundly human: More of the human brain is devoted to speech than any other activity. People can have an IQ of 50, or a brain that is only one-third the normal size and have difficulties with many simple tasks, but they can speak. Humans are so tuned to words that from about the age of 18 months, children learn about eight to 10 new words a day, a rate that continues until adolescence. Humans love to speak: When two hearing people encounter each other, they will speak, despite having other means of communication such as gesturing or drawing. Even when people speak different languages or come from different cultures, they will try to find common words and phrases. One-day-old infants can distinguish speech from any other sounds and 4-day-olds can distinguish between their native language and other languages. Even in the womb, a fetus can distinguish her or his mother's voice from all other female voices. Adults can distinguish speech sounds at twice the rate of any other sounds, aided by special hair cells in the outer right ear. See also: Florida anthropologist explains 'baby talk' origins. Among all animals, only humans have the necessary breathing apparatus and musculature to be able to speak: despite the \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" no primate could speak like a person, even if their brains grew. Even human ancestors such as the Neanderthal could not possibly speak: speech is a new and remarkably impressive ability. So, there is nothing so human as speech -- at least until modern technologies came along. Through striking advances in a computer's ability to understand and produce speech, it is common to use your telephone to make airline reservations, answer questions and search the Web. Because of the shrinking size and increasing speed of computers, it is also possible to speak directly to your automobile. From putting up with the car intoning, \\"Your door is ajar,\\" we have moved to navigation systems that can tell you where to find a latte and car interfaces that understand spoken commands and even allow drivers to dictate e-mails, texts and make phone calls. What could be more simple and natural than talking, even to a technology? And speaking to cars seems particularly desirable. We don't have to take our eyes from the road or our hands from the wheel to select buttons or make choices: Why not let our mouths and our ears do all the work? Unfortunately, it's not so simple or so desirable. Recent research by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, conducted by David Strayer at the University of Utah, finds that the new technology can be so distracting it impairs the ability to drive. Studies found that while driving, our attention becomes overloaded by speaking. It basically takes our minds, if not our eyes, off the road. Here are three reasons why talking while driving is so distracting, and not as safe and effective as you might think:. People like to picture who they are talking with. When you speak with someone face-to-face, you \\"hear lips and see voices\\": Your brain automatically and easily focuses on the person. When you speak on the telephone, you use brainpower to create a mental image of the person you are talking with: The less you know the person, the more mental workload it takes. When you talk to a car, use a phone in a car or dictate a text message, your brain has to do a great deal of work to picture with whom you are communicating. When you're thinking that hard, it's very difficult to pay attention to the road. That's why talking on a cell phone -- hands free or not -- is much more dangerous than talking to a passenger. The need to imagine steals from attention to the road. See also: Is hands-free driving just as dangerous? People want to be understood. Although people love to speak, there are few more frustrating things than someone not listening. Listeners puts a great deal of energy into showing that they are listening: They nod their head, say \\"uh huh,\\" open their eyes and change their posture. People are built to expect these signals of attention, but cars refuse to provide them. As a result, drivers become overly concerned with whether the car understands or is even listening, and their attention is again drawn away from the road. In addition, the voice of the car does not have the rich vocal cues that indicate engagement and emotion, providing further evidence that the car isn't understanding. Cars are not native speakers. When you encounter someone who isn't facile in your language, you have to put a great deal of time into selecting the right words, avoiding idioms and speaking slowly and clearly. Speech is no longer an easy and natural means of communication in these instances. While it is remarkable that cars can understand something that took billions of years of human evolution, the typical car recognition rate of 85% to 95% makes it a mediocre second-language speaker. As a result, speech becomes effortful and demanding, stealing attention from the road. Because of these problems, my laboratory and laboratories around the world are trying to find ways to support the driver in creating mental images, in showing that the car wants to understand and enabling the car to understand at levels equal to or even better than a person. And soon cars will be driving themselves, so that people can ignore the road and multitask their way to fighting for attention from each other, just as they do outside the car. Watch: The self-driving car changes everything. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clifford Nass. Highlights:","output":"1. The human brain is profoundly attuned to speech, allowing for rapid language acquisition and high levels of comprehension. 2. Advances in computer speech technology have made it possible for cars to understand and respond to spoken commands. 3. However, recent research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety shows that engaging with voice-activated systems while driving can be distracting and impair the ability to drive safely. 4. Three reasons that contribute to the distraction include: the need to mentally picture the conversation partner, the desire to receive confirmation of being understood, and the effort required to communicate effectively with non-native speakers or imperfect speech recognition systems. 5. Scientists are working on solutions to mitigate these issues, while the development of self-driving cars may eventually remove the need for drivers to focus on the road while interacting with technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the following question: Title: Shows the talent Review: Talk about a hard to find cd. Over it is a great band(besides thier latest release) and this is some good, raw, fast melodic punk music...the way it should be. Only thing is the second half of the cd(from the Ready Series) is just to raw sounding for me. I only listen to the first 5 songs(re-released from Hindsight is 2020) which are stupidly good. THis really shows where Over it came from and were the groundworks for great albums like \\"Timing...\\" and \\"Silverstrand\\". Truly is a hidden gem Is this product review negative? pick from the following. (A). Yes; (B). No; Answer:","output":"(B). No; This product review is not negative. The reviewer, despite some criticism about the second half of the CD, focuses primarily on the positive aspects of the band and their music. They describe the CD as a 'hard to find' item, implying that it's worth the effort to seek it out. More importantly, they express their admiration for the first five songs which they describe as 'stupidly good,' highlighting their appreciation and satisfaction with this portion of the music. They also refer to the overall band as 'great' and reference other albums that they consider 'great,' indicating favorable sentiment toward their music in general. They categorize the music as 'raw,' 'fast,' 'melodic punk,' which may point to their genre preference and why they value Over It's music. Though 'raw' is used later to highlight why they don't prefer the second half of the CD, within context, it seems more of a personal preference than an objective condemnation. The reviewer concludes by noting that this product is a 'hidden gem' and provides insight into the band's progression, implying that they value the CD for its ability to shed light on the band's musical journey and evolution. This signals that despite some personal reservations, the product has essential value for anyone interested in the band's history. Thus, few criticisms aside, the review leans towards positivity overall."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Female hamsters sometimes eat their own babies if they get stressed out. It is very important to keep the environment as calm as possible. Though you might be eager to play with the babies, give the mother space and peace for their safety. At first, the babies will look pink and hairless. They are born with their eyes closed. While you do not want to disturb her, you do still need to make sure she has everything she needs in her cage. For the first week and a half to two weeks or so, discretely refill the mother's food bowl and water bottle. You do not need to provide the babies with anything at this point. They will get everything they need from nursing. Scatter small portions of broccoli, grated carrot, wheat germ, or tofu in their nest for them to eat. The mother will also store food in her cheek pouches, and bring it back to the nest to feed her babies. A week after birth, they will start to grow fur. You should just be able to tell what colors they are. The \\"pups\\" will also start making little noises at this age. One or two adventurous babies may leave the nest, but do not worry if the mother picks them up in her mouth and puts them back. Enough time should have passed now to allow the mother settle into her new role, so you can give the cage a much-needed cleaning. It is also your first opportunity to handle the babies, which is an important step in socializing them to humans. By handling them at two weeks, you make them more comfortable with human interactions.  Get your hands \\"dirty\\" with the scent of the used litter before touching the babies. This prevents the mother from rejecting or attacking them later.  Move the hamsters into another cage one by one. When cleaning the cage, avoid completely destroying the nest. Hamsters will usually have a “toilet” area in the cage. Concentrate your cleaning there, and leave the nest more or less intact. If the nest is soaked or filthy, however, go ahead and replace it with fresh materials. While cleaning the cage, make a few changes to transition them into adulthood. Add a second food bowl to the cage. The mother's water bottle will be too high for the babies, so place a second one at a lower position. You could also place a raised platform under the mother's bottle so the babies can reach it. Do not lower the mother's water bottle to the babies' height because then the mother will not be able to reach it. At this age, the babies should have all their fur and be running about independently. Though they were born with closed eyes and ears, they should be starting to open up now. This can be a tricky process. Look at the distance between each hamster's anus and genital opening. The distance on a male will be longer than the distance on a female. By four weeks, the males' testicles should also be noticeable, as should the nipples on the females' bellies. Hamsters have a lot of loose skin, and you can hold them by the scruff of their necks or by the loose skin down their backs.  Be careful not to drop them, and be ready to return them to the cage, if you start to lose your grip. Not all hamsters mature at the same rate, so you have to make sure you gendered them correctly. For a few days after you separate them into male and female cages, keep checking gender every day. You might notice testicles one day that you did not see before in a cage of baby “females.” If so, switch the baby to the correct cage. If you are unsure about the sex of your babies, take them to your vet or an experienced hamster breeder for help. You want to avoid accidental breeding of siblings. Place your hand in the cage so they can smell it, and let them climb up into your palm if they want to. You can also scoop them up with a small cup and start gently petting them on the back. The babies will be ready for their new homes 35 days their birth. Do not wait too long to start looking for people to purchase your hamsters, because the 35 days goes by fast. Keep your customers updated as the hamsters approach 35 days old, so they can prepare their own homes. Make sure you send them off to reliable homes, with families that will love them. Provide the new owners with information on hamsters and the hamster's care to this point. You want the babies to have the best new start you can provide. If you keep any of the babies, know that Syrians are highly territorial. When they reach two to three months of age, separate all hamsters into their own cages.","output":"Hamsters are little animals that can have babies. Sometimes, mommy hamsters get stressed and might eat their babies, so we need to be very careful and give them space. Baby hamsters are born pink and without hair. They drink milk from their mom and don't need any food from us at first. Later, they will start growing fur, and we can handle them carefully so they get used to us. After a while, we will need to figure out if they are boys or girls, so we can separate them and find them new homes. The new owners should be people who will love and care for the hamsters. If we keep any of them, we need to give them their own little home when they grow up because they like to have their own space."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A:","output":"To remove odor from a litter box, follow these steps: 1. Preparation: Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies, such as a trash bag, litter scoop, paper towels, cleaning solution, and fresh litter. 2. Dispose of the old litter: Put on gloves to protect your hands and place a trash bag near the litter box. Using the litter scoop, remove all the clumps and waste from the litter box, placing them into the trash bag. Once all the waste is removed, tie the trash bag securely and discard it in an outdoor trash can. 3. Clean the litter box: With the waste removed, it's now time to thoroughly clean the litter box. Pour the remaining litter into the trash bag, ensuring the litter box is empty. Wipe down the inside and outside of the litter box with paper towels to remove any residue. 4. Disinfect the litter box: Fill a bucket with a mixture of water and a pet-safe cleaning solution. Using a sponge or cloth, scrub the inside and outside of the litter box with the cleaning solution, making sure to reach even the corners and edges. This will help to remove bacteria and any lingering odor. 5. Rinse and dry: Rinse the litter box thoroughly with water to remove any residue from the cleaning solution. It's essential to eliminate any remaining cleaning solution as it may be harmful to your pet. Use a clean, dry towel or paper towels to dry the litter box completely. 6. Replace with fresh litter: Once the litter box is clean and dry, fill it with a fresh layer of litter (2-3 inches deep is usually a good amount). Evenly distribute the litter across the bottom of the box to provide a clean and comfortable surface for your pet. 7. Regular maintenance: To keep the litter box odor-free, scoop out waste and clumps daily and replace the litter regularly (about once a week). Additionally, consider using an odor control litter, placing a litter box deodorizer nearby, or adding a carbon filter to the litter box hood (if applicable) to help minimize the smell. By following these steps, you should be able to effectively remove the odor from a litter box and keep it clean for your pet."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Alexander II's death caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.  Question: \\"How many years passed between the fruition of the Duma and the beginning of the construction of the Church of the Savior on Blood?\\" Answer: \\"One year\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

This means that there were actually 22 years between the beginning of the construction of the Church of the Savior on Blood and the fruition of the Duma, not just one. So, if you think of it like ages, it's like saying a baby was born (the church started being built), and then a grown-up person of 22 (the Duma was realized).

Onetime Chicago Bears football coach Mike Ditka has not been in charge of an NFL team for 17 years, but the business of being “Iron Mike” has never stopped booming. He’s the tough-as-nails head football coach who’s always ready to shill for any product within arm’s distance or play himself in a Will Ferrell movie. When on ESPN, he is forever armed with a sharp rant and is perhaps their only talent—other than maybe Chis Berman—who can pass gas on live television and make it come off as lovable. That’s just Ditka being Ditka. Ad Policy      But there is another side to Mike Ditka. He’s the guy who was accused of sending players back into games with concussions. He’s the guy who was described this way by former Bears safety Dave Duerson: “Mike was not one who gave a damn about the players or their injuries when he was coaching.” Duerson later took his own life, and in death was diagnosed the brain disease CTE.      Ditka is the guy who berated his own Bears players for not crossing a picket line when the NFLPA was on strike in 1987. He’s the guy today who—after a lifetime of supporting right-wing candidates—shills for another dubious product: Donald Trump.      And now, true to form, he’s coming out against Colin Kaepernick’s anthem protests. On Friday, he said on the Shan & RJ radio show, “I think it’s a problem. Anybody who disrespects this country and the flag. If they don’t like the country they don’t like our flag, get the hell out. My choice is, I like this country, I respect our flag, and I don’t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on,” Ditka said. “I see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity. Now, if they don’t want to look for them then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work. If you don’t work, that’s a different problem.”      Mike Ditka, as mentioned, is a Trump endorser—and he is parroting the candidate who in August said that Kaepernick should “maybe should find another country to live in.” Trump undoubtedly knows that this kind of statement is a racist dog whistle, that when you tell someone who is descended from the enslaved people that built the United States to shut up or find another country, you are telling them—in classic KKK fashion—to “go back to Africa.” This is as true today as it was when a member of Congress said it to singer and civil-rights icon Paul Robeson, and Robeson’s response is still the correct one. He said:      Because my father was a slave, and my people died to build this country, and I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you. And no Fascist-minded people will drive me from it.      Whether Ditka is aware that “find another country” is racist is unclear, but there is absolutely nothing in his history that would allow for him to get the benefit of the doubt. Ready to Fight Back? Sign Up For Take Action Now      Ditka’s comments share similarities in content and tone with not only Trump but also another elderly ex-coach who likes playing a tough guy on television: disgraced former Indiana University basketball coach Bob “The General” Knight. These braying bullies have appointed themselves as the arbiters of patriotism. Yet when Trump, Ditka, and Knight had the chance to serve in Vietnam, they didn’t. They used whatever means were at their disposal—deferments, foot injuries, coaching Army basketball—to get out of it. Their lives mattered.      I have no problem with anyone who didn’t serve in that horrific war. My great hero is Muhammad Ali, who resisted the draft in Vietnam. But these guys act like they’re George Patton when they’re not even George W. Bush.      It’s galling that, in Ditka’s mind, Trump’s trashing of this country is somehow patriotic, yet Kaepernick’s critiques justify his exile. It is galling that Ditka is blissfully unaware that there are legions of black former players who feel that he didn’t respect their health, their minds, or their humanity. Now his critique of Kaepernick feels like another chapter in a life of degrading black people who do more than just say, “Yes, Coach.”      There has been a call for Mike Ditka to be fired from ESPN for his comments. I don’t agree, partially because there is no more nauseating thought than “First Amendment martyr Mike Ditka.” He shouldn’t be fired, but he should be debated. He should have to spew his views not in the confederate confines of talk radio but to the face of ESPN colleagues Herman Edwards or Charles Woodson or Bomani Jones or Jemele Hill. Make him say that to the face of someone who has had to live while being black in this country, someone unafraid to push back. I suspect that Ditka would respond to this the way bullies always respond when challenged. When bigoted bullies are armed only with their rancid ideas, they never stand their ground. ||||| Mike Ditka is not only the former Head Coach of the World Champion Chicago Bears, but he’s also a cigar aficionado, steak house proprietor, AND something of an expert on U.S. race relations over the past century.      At least that’s the takeaway after he was interviewed by Westwood One’s Jim Grey and asked to opine on the current culture role between those irate that NFL players taking a knee in protest during the playing of the national anthem, and those sympathetic with the issue of oppression and racial inequality that those are protesting.      Ditka said:      I think that you have to be color blind in this country. Have you got to look at a person for what he is and what he stands for. And how he produces. All of a sudden it’s become a big dealing now about oppression. There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. I don’t care who you are, how much money you make. If you don’t respect our country, then you shouldn’t be in this country playing football. Go to another country and play football. If you can’t respect the flag and the country, then you don’t respect what this is all about. So I would say adios.      The dictionary defines “oppression” as “prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control.”      So according to Ditka, the recent deaths of unarmed black men over the past decade that led to Colin Kaepernick‘s original protest seem not to rise to cruel or unjust treatment, which he is right to have his opinion. But he also doesn’t feel that segregated schools, restaurants and drinking fountains does not rise to cruel or unjust treatment or control. Neither does the systemic lynching of black individuals in the Jim Crow era of the South.      So according to Mike Ditka, there has been no oppression, because from his vantage point as a 77-year old white male, what oppression could there possibly be? Love it or leave it losers!

(Darron Cummings/AP)      Even before this NFL season, which has featured team owners linking arms with players as shows of solidarity amid sharply critical comments from President Trump, some players were noting that the original message of protests during the national anthem had been largely lost. To them, the cause of bringing attention to racial injustice, in particular police brutality against black men, had been overshadowed by a heated national discussion over the merits of taking a knee during the national anthem.      To former NFL coach and ESPN analyst Mike Ditka, however, that cause made no sense to begin with. In a pregame interview before a radio broadcast of Monday night’s game between the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings, he said, “There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of.”      [Jerry Jones says Trump reminded him of NFL policy on standing for anthem]      Saying that “you have to be colorblind in this country,” Ditka told Jim Gray on Westwood One that “the opportunity is there for everybody.” He added that the place to protest was at “a ballot box,” and that people should “respect” the winners of elections.      Ditka quickly was condemned, particularly by Joe Namath, for his comments. The Hall of Fame quarterback suggested Tuesday that Ditka “look up the meaning of oppression. Look up the definition of oppression, and you understand that it’s obviously taken place.”      By late Tuesday, Ditka was trying to straight out what he meant.      “The characterization of the statement that I made does not reflect the context of the question that I was answering and certainly does not reflect my views throughout my lifetime,” he said in a statement. “I have absolutely seen oppression in society in the last 100 years and I am completely intolerant of any discrimination. The interview was about the NFL and the related issues. That’s where my head was at. I was quoted in the interview stating, ‘You have to be color blind.’ I stated that you should look at a person for what they are and not the color of their skin. I’m sorry if anyone was offended.”      Ditka, 77, and Gray were talking about the team with which he is most associated, the Bears, when Gray asked about Vice President Pence walking out of an NFL game Sunday because of anthem protests, and about the pregame demonstrations in general.      “Is this the stage for this?” Ditka said. “If you want to protest, or whatever you want to protest, you’ve got a right to do that. But I think you’re a professional athlete. You have an obligation to the game. I don’t see a lot of respect for the game, I just see respect for their own individual opinions. … Respect the game, play the game, when you want to protest, protest when the game’s over, protest whatever other way you want to.”      With Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones making news for saying that his players would either stand for the anthem or get benched, Gray asked Ditka if that would be his policy, as well, were he in charge of an NFL team.      “Yes,” Ditka replied, “I don’t care who you are, or how much money you make, if you don’t respect our country, you shouldn’t be in this country playing football. Go to another country and play football. If you had to go to somewhere else and try to play this sport, you wouldn’t have a job.”      “If you can’t respect the flag and this country, then you don’t respect what this is all about, so I would say: Adios.”      [Jenkins: There are two sides to the NFL anthem debate, and both are right. And wrong.]      Ditka has not been shy in the past about expressing political views, and he was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign. Starting well before the election, Trump has taken frequent shots at former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began the anthem protests during the 2016 preseason, and Ditka has followed suit, saying a year ago that he had “no respect” for the player.      “My choice is that I like this country, I respect our flag, and I don’t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on,” Ditka added at the time.      The Eagles’ Malcolm Jenkins, who has been raising his fist during the anthem and has worked toward helping create better relations between police and community members, offered an explanation Monday of some of the concerns felt by NFL players. “I think we’ve made that very clear that what we are demonstrating about has nothing to do with the flag but everything to do with social injustice, racial inequality and the things that Jerry Jones and other owners who are making statements have yet to address,” the safety said to NBC Sports Philadelphia.      “And so I’d love to hear their takes on that part of the conversation, what these players are trying to draw attention to,” Jenkins continued. “Their thoughts on, you know, police brutality and racial inequality, education gap, the economical gap in these communities that they make money in. And I’d love to hear that part of the conversation so that it’s not so argumentative, so that it’s not isolating the players who are trying to do the right thing with the platform that they have.”      Later on Monday, Gray asked Ditka, “For those who want social justice, and for those who look back at the lives of Muhammad Ali and Jesse Owens, and John Carlos and Tommy Smith, your response would be?”      “I don’t know what social injustices have been,” the Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee replied. “Muhammad Ali rose to the top. Jesse Owens is one of the classiest individuals that ever lived. I mean, you can say, are you talking that everything is based on color? I don’t see it that way.      “I think that you have to be colorblind in this country. You’ve got to look at a person for what he is, and what he stands for and how he produces, not by the color of his skin. That has never had anything to do with anything.      “But all of a sudden, it’s become a big deal now, about oppression. There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of.      “Now maybe I’m not watching it as carefully as other people. I think the opportunity is there for everybody. Race, religion, creed, color, nationality — if you want to work, if you want to try, if you want to put effort into yourself, I think you can accomplish anything.”      [Jemele Hill suspended two weeks by ESPN after tweet about Jerry Jones]      The former coach, who won a Super Bowl with the Bears before a head coaching stint with the New Orleans Saints, said in 2013 that not running against Barack Obama in the 2004 Illinois Senate race was the “biggest mistake I’ve ever made.” He told a Chicago radio station last year that “Obama’s the worst president we’ve ever had.”      “He would be great to play golf with,” Ditka said at the time of Obama. “He’s not a leader. This country needs leadership. It needs direction.”      On Monday, Ditka made an apparent reference to Obama’s successor, telling Gray that NFL players are “protesting an individual,” adding, “That’s wrong, too.”      “You know, you’ve got a ballot box, you’ve got an election. That’s where you protest,” Ditka said. “You elect the person you want to be in office, and if you don’t get that person in office, I think you respect the other one, that’s all.”      “Football has been so good to these guys,” Ditka said of NFL players on the pregame show. “It’s been so good to me. Enjoy it, have fun with it, and I don’t think it’s the stage for protests. I’m sorry, a lot of people disagree with that, but that’s my take on it.”      Read more:      ‘This is about systemic oppression’: Eric Reid becomes the voice of 49ers’ protest with criticism of Pence      ‘He’s all by himself’: Capitals’ Devante Smith-Pelly considers anthem protest after J.T.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.The riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume -- or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks.

While most people stick to conventional toothpaste for their daily dental hygiene routine, there are alternatives available that can prove beneficial to both, our health and the environment. Tooth powder is one such alternative, with its natural ingredients and sustainable packaging that has less impact on our planet. In this article, we will explore the various benefits of tooth powder ingredients, how to combine them, and the proper way to utilize them for optimal oral care. Recognize the Benefits of Tooth Powder Ingredients Tooth powder ingredients are usually derived from natural sources and don't contain artificial additives, such as preservatives or foaming agents. This means they're less likely to cause an allergic reaction or irritation to sensitive gums. Here are some key ingredients commonly found in tooth powders and their benefits: 1. Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda): Baking soda is known for its mild abrasive properties, which help clean and whiten teeth. It can also neutralize harmful acids from food residue and combat bad breath. 2. Calcium Carbonate: This common ingredient strengthens tooth enamel and aids in removing plaque and surface stains on teeth. Furthermore, calcium carbonate provides extra minerals that support healthy teeth and gums. 3. Activated Charcoal: This popular ingredient has remarkable detoxifying and adsorption capabilities. It binds to plaque and stains, making it easier to remove. Activated charcoal can also aid in soothing gum inflammation and limiting harmful bacteria in the oral cavity. 4. Xylitol: A natural sweetener, xylitol works against cavity-causing bacteria and supports a healthy pH balance in the mouth. It can also stimulate saliva production, which is essential to maintaining oral health. 5. Clove, Cinnamon, and Peppermint: These essential oils or powdered spices offer antibacterial properties and can alleviate gum inflammation. They add a refreshing and soothing component to tooth powder, delivering a burst of natural flavor. Combine Ingredients and Mix Thoroughly Once you understand the benefits of various tooth powder ingredients, you can create your own customized blend. Start with one or two tablespoons of base ingredients like baking soda or calcium carbonate. Then, add smaller quantities of activated charcoal, xylitol, and essential oils or powdered spices to suit your personal preferences. Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a clean, dry container until a uniform powder is achieved. Creating your tooth powder blend allows for personalization, enabling you to select flavors and ingredients that work best with your specific needs. Experiment with different combinations to find the ideal tooth powder for you. Apply the Dry Mixture to Your Toothbrush Now that you have a customized tooth powder mixture, it's time to incorporate it into your daily oral care routine. Here's how to use tooth powder effectively: 1. Wet your toothbrush in clean water and shake off the excess. 2. Gently dip the bristles into the tooth powder, ensuring the entire head is coated with a thin layer of the powder. 3. Brush your teeth as you normally would with toothpaste, using gentle strokes and paying special attention to all areas of your mouth, including your gums and tongue. 4. Rinse your mouth thoroughly with water to remove any residual powder and reveal cleaner, fresher teeth. Conclusion Tooth powder is an excellent, eco-friendly alternative to conventional toothpaste. With natural ingredients that boast surprising oral health benefits, tooth powders provide an effective option for those seeking a more sustainable and holistic approach to dental hygiene. By understanding the benefits of each ingredient, combining them to create your personalized mixture, and integrating tooth powder into your routine, you'll be well on your way to maintaining good oral health and contributing to a healthier planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Essentially my view seems to match a number of others - the first half hour was fresh, sharp, deep, entertaining and promising. Well acted too. Natural. My problem, however, is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning, nor the fact that I spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp, grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken, toothless, bread-chewing hags. It's rather with the fact that THEY NEVER WARNED ME!!! The festival brochure synopsis described only the (utterly intriguing-sounding) first half hour - a whore, piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar, pretending to be an advertising agent, genetic engineer, and petty government administration official, respectively - making no mention whatsoever of the never-ending gum-smacking to come. Serves me right for not reading the reviews, you might say - but to my defense, a number of reviews I looked at post-fact um didn't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film. The first hint should have been the introductory words by the director (a bashful, tousle-haired Russian youth) who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium (the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically, and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening, though most of the audience seemed as unaware as I was of the pain to come, judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour, and many exasperated comments on exit) to say the following: 'Well, I... um, thank you very much for coming to see this film, and I just wanted to say... well, it's a very long film... it took me four years to make it, and... it's.. I suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it. It is very long. Thank you for coming.' This is what he said. Alarm bells should have been ringing. 'What's he talking about?' I thought in happy confusion. 'This is gonna be fun!' Of course, by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me, it was far too late to get out. All I could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again. And in the end I can't say I feel in any way improved by the experience. Yes, I absolutely loved the first half hour. It was intelligent, new, and had a lot to say. And yes, Russia is probably in a bad state. Yes, every society has many hidden faces. Yes, toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard. Yes yes yes. I get all of this. Really I do. But I see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out, and so painful to bear. If you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy Hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging, try the Korean-Chinese Bin Jip (3-Iron).

Barbra Streisand: LIFE Magazine Photos From Eary in Her Career, 1966 Barbra Streisand has been such a force on the entertainment scene for so long (her 1963 debut album, recorded when she was just 20, won an Album of the Year Grammy) that a glimpse back at her first years in show business offers fascinating insights into her evolution as a performer, and a person. Here, on her 70th birthday (April 24), LIFE.com offers a window into the intense, emotionally fraught world Streisand inhabited and, in a sense, created for herself with her own outsized insecurities and perfectionism early in her career. In 1966, for example, LIFE published a cover story on the then-23 year old Brooklyn native that portrayed the young star as a “fear-ridden girl” terrified that her early success “could suddenly all fall apart.” Of course, creative people who have enjoyed (or endured) fame right out of the gate almost invariably, at one point or another, suffer lacerating self-doubts; Streisand, however, appears to have interrogated her own talents and achievements with the same tenacity that she brought to, say, mastering the nuances of a new tune or the timing of a comedic line. “Why Barbara Streisand has to know what people think of her every time she performs is an astounding, and wrenching, phenomenon,” wrote LIFE’s Diana Lurie in the March 18, 1966, issue of LIFE. “At 23, she is an undisputed queen of musical comedy, television and records. Every one of the seven records she has made sold a million copies. She gets 50,000 per concert appearance. For nearly two years she pulled in standing room-only audiences for an otherwise undistinguished musical, Funny Girl…Everybody knows Streisand is on top. So does she. And the more she is hailed, the more scared and insure she feels. “I win awards and everything but one of these days something is going to bomb. It’s a scary thing. Even more surprising in the LIFE cover story is the assertion that, while “her audiences adore Barbra,” she “looks on them as her as adversaries.” During taping of a TV special, hyper-critically watching her own performance played back on monitors, she told her agent: “I know this is a better show than the first. But They are waiting for it to bomb. hey always are. People say, ‘Go and see this terrific girl.’ But most of them come thinking, ‘Nah she can’t be that great.’ It makes me feel they’re the monster and I’m their victim.” Despite — or perhaps because of — this deeply ambivalent attitude toward her audience and her triumphs, Streisand also displayed a cool, collected and (for a 23-year-old) remarkably astute understanding of her own stardom. “My success? The only way i can account for it is that whatever abilities other performers have, I must have it plus. Onstage I am a cross between a washwoman and a princess. I am bit coarse, a bit low, a bit vulgar and a bit ignorant. But I am also part princess — sophisticated elegant and controlled. I can appeal to everybody.” Then, she adds: “When I am not not performing, however, I don’t think I have that definite a personality. I think maybe I have nothing.” Maybe I have nothing. All these years later, after the Emmys (five), Oscars (two), Grammys (eight) and a special Tony Award; after selling millions upon millions of records, filling concert halls and arenas and enjoying the undying devotion of countless fans the world over — after all that, one can only hope Streisand has come to embrace the notion that, just maybe, she does have something after all. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article reflects on Barbra Streisand's early career in 1966, discussing her insecurities and perfectionism despite being celebrated as an undisputed queen of musical comedy, television, and records. LIFE Magazine's cover story at the time highlighted Streisand's fear of her success falling apart and her complex relationship with her audience, whom she viewed as adversaries. Despite her doubts, Streisand demonstrated a deep understanding of her stardom, and the article concludes by hoping she eventually embraced her talents after years of immense success, including numerous awards and millions of records sold."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Maintain a regular sleep schedule by going to bed at the same time every night, even on the weekends or on your days off. This will ensure your internal sleep clock is set on a schedule that will make it easier for you to fall asleep at night.  Though you may think that going to bed one hour later won’t affect your sleep schedule, any changes or shifts to your sleep schedule will have negative effects on your sleeping habits and can lead to oversleeping or a restless sleep. On average, you should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep a night.  To avoid messing up your sleep schedule, you can set an alarm on your phone or computer to remind you it’s time for you to go to bed. Have your phone alert you 1 hour or 30 minutes before bedtime so you can prepare yourself for bed and stick to your sleep schedule. You can also set an alarm on your watch or ask the person you live with to give you a 1 hour heads up before bedtime. Having a consistent wake up time every morning will also allow your body to adapt to your sleep schedule. To help maintain a set wake up time every day, you should avoid hitting the snooze button on your alarm or get rid of the snooze button completely. The snooze button will only throw off your wake time and throw off your sleep schedule. If possible, try to trigger your wake up time with lots of light. You could set a timer so the lights in your room turn on at your wake up time or the blinds in your bedroom go up. Exposure to light in the morning will help your body’s internal clock to reset itself every day and help you to avoid oversleeping. If you are traveling to a different time zone, you will need to prepare your body for the time shift so you can get a good night’s sleep. It can take several days to a week for your body to adjust to a new time zone. If you are traveling eastward, you will likely experience more severe jet lag than when you are traveling westward. Traveling east requires you to shorten your day, making it more difficult for your internal clock to adjust to your new sleep schedule.  Prepare your internal clock for the new time zone by getting seven to nine hours of sleep two to three days before your trip. If you are traveling west, you should adjust your sleep schedule by delaying your normal bedtime and wake time in 20-30 minute intervals. If you are traveling east, you should increase your normal wake time by 10 to 15 minutes a day two to three days before your trip and increase your normal bedtime by 10 to 15 minutes. To fight off jet lag and poor sleep in a new time zone, you should decrease your exposure to light when it’s time for bed and increase your exposure to light when it’s time for you to wake up. You should also spend more time outdoors so your body gets used to the light cues, such as the sun rising and falling, in your new time zone.","output":"This article talks about keeping a regular sleep schedule by going to bed at the same time every night, setting alarms to remind you, having a consistent wake up time, using light to help your body adjust, and tips for traveling to a new time zone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What is the name of Coach Gaines' team? Movie title: Friday Night Lights Movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed... A:","output":"The name of Coach Gaines' team in the movie Friday Night Lights is the Permian High School Panthers. This team is based in Odessa, Texas, and holds a prominent place in the town's culture, with many residents heavily invested in the team's performance and success. The movie is adapted from the non-fiction book of the same name written by H.G. Bissinger, which chronicles the true events of the 1988 Permian High School football season. The book is not only about football but also delves into various social issues, like the economic disparity, racism, segregation, desegregation, and poverty affecting Odessa and its residents. The town's passion for the game often spills over into these social issues, affecting the players' lives in both positive and negative ways. Coach Gary Gaines, played by Billy Bob Thornton, is the focal point of the story. He experiences immense pressure from the community to lead the team to success, despite the various personal obstacles his players face throughout the season. Gaines' coaching style is criticized for overusing star player, James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, which leads to a devastating injury for Miles. The team struggles with different personal conflicts, such as quarterback Mike Winchell's inconsistency and inability to make decisions, fullback Don Billingsley's clash with his father over living up to expectations, third-string running back Chris Comer's fear of injury, and safety Brian Chavez's experiences of harassment. Investing in a film proposal such as Friday Night Lights would depend on various factors, including the production team's experience, the profitability of similar movies in the sports drama genre, and the existing fanbase for the story since it's based on true events and an acclaimed book. Carefully considering these factors, along with your personal interest in the social issues and themes presented, will help you make an informed decision about whether or not to invest in the film proposal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Out of fear, Oskar never fights back. In the evenings, however, he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors. One evening, Oskar notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into #15, the apartment next door to his. Oddly, the first thing they do is to cover the windows with cardboard. What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood.

Summarize the following: If you have a persistent dry throat that worsens or doesn't go away with home treatment, you may need to schedule an appointment with your physician or dentist. Your condition might warrant professional attention.  Untreated chronic dry throat can lead to some noteworthy complications. For instance, you may eventually find it difficult to swallow food. When accompanied by dry mouth, a dry throat can also make it difficult to chew or taste food, and you may experience more tooth decay if you are unable to produce enough saliva to protect your teeth and gums. Moreover, dry throats that develop into sore throats might be caused by viral or bacterial infections. When left untreated, these conditions can develop into more serious health problems. Certain medical conditions can cause a chronically dry throat, and if one of them is to blame for your current difficulties, your doctor will need to diagnose and treat that condition to improve the dry throat itself. Some illnesses, like Sjogren's syndrome, directly impact your saliva glands and cause saliva production to decrease. Other conditions, like oral yeast infections, colds, allergies, and diabetes, may increase throat dryness indirectly. If your dry throat is caused by immune disease or saliva gland damage, your doctor may choose to prescribe pilocarpine, a drug that increases natural saliva production by stimulating associated nerves. Alternatively, if your dry throat is caused by Sjogren's syndrome, your doctor may prescribe cevimeline to help treat it and other associated symptoms.","output":"If your throat is dry and doesn't get better with home treatments, it's important to see a doctor or dentist. If you don't, it could become harder to eat, taste, and protect your teeth. Sometimes, a dry throat can be caused by an illness or a problem with your saliva.

She lived in New York and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer. One day, Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her. She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces. Even Jackson, Hannah's dog, was acting different. Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange. Hannah's father, who was known as Pop, explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move. Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal. Then, Hannah's mother explained that they were moving to Kenya. Kenya, she explained, was a place in Africa and life would be very different there. As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, Hannah's mother calmed her with a gentle touch. Jackson began howling as Hannah cried, but was also calmed by Hannah's mother. Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes. She did not know the next time she would be home. She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend, Susan. Susan did not quite understand where Kenya was, but promised to visit Hannah. The next day, Hannah boarded a plane with her family. At first, they thought that Jackson could not come with them.

Sentence 2: Immediately Harun fled Italy to Libya , where he was arrested on 24 June 2011 . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Yes, these two sentences convey the same information, but they differ in their structure and word order. Both sentences communicate that Harun fled from Italy to Libya and that he was arrested on June 24, 2011 (or 24 June 2011). However, the way they present this information varies, as discussed below: 1. Sentence Structure:    Sentence 1: Harun immediately fled Italy for Libya, where he was arrested on June 24, 2011.    Sentence 2: Immediately Harun fled Italy to Libya, where he was arrested on 24 June 2011.    In Sentence 1, the adverb \\"immediately\\" is placed before the verb \\"fled\\" to modify it, while in Sentence 2, the adverb \\"immediately\\" is placed before the subject \\"Harun.\\" Despite this difference, the overall meaning remains the same: Harun fled to Libya without any delay. 2. Word Order:    In Sentence 1, the date is formatted as \\"June 24, 2011,\\" which follows the American English convention of placing the month before the day. In Sentence 2, the date is formatted as \\"24 June 2011,\\" which follows the British English convention of placing the day before the month. Again, although the format of the dates differs, they still represent the same day. There are also minor differences in the use of prepositions and punctuation in the two sentences: 3. Prepositions:    In Sentence 1, the preposition \\"for\\" is used to indicate the destination (Italy for Libya). In contrast, in Sentence 2, the preposition \\"to\\" is used to indicate the destination (Italy to Libya). In the context of these sentences, both prepositions serve the same purpose, conveying that Harun fled from Italy to Libya. 4. Punctuation:    In Sentence 1, there is a space after the comma following \\"Italy,\\" while in Sentence 2, there is no space after the comma following \\"Italy.\\" This is a minor formatting issue that does not affect the meaning of the sentences. In conclusion, both sentences convey the same information about Harun fleeing Italy, arriving in Libya, and being arrested on the same date. The differences in sentence structure, word order, use of prepositions, and punctuation are minor variations that do not change the overall meaning of the information being conveyed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Question: Article: As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops. Question: Scientists originally thought that   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"insects were just blown about by the wind\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"insects were just blown about by the wind\\". Scientists originally thought that insects, during their migration, were simply at the mercy of the wind without having any ability to control their direction.

However, recent research suggests that insects, specifically butterflies and moths, can choose favorable winds and modify their body positions to affect their direction, much like migrating birds. This implies that they have a more active role in their migration than previously thought. Furthermore, technological advancements have enabled scientists to detect and observe these small creatures during their lengthy, high-altitude journeys, further debunking the initial belief."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Haunting Hour Volume One: Don't Think About It Movie plot: Cassie (Emily Osment) is a thirteen-year-old goth girl who just moved with her family to a new neighborhood and school. She loves to trick the popular kids at school and her younger brother Max (Alex Winzenread). On the way to a library, Cassie finds a mysterious Halloween store in an alley and goes inside. The store owner (Tobin Bell) insists on selling her an old book titled The Evil Thing, which contains a warning not to read it aloud or think about its monster called \\"The Evil Thing\\", a two-headed creature that sucks blood while the other head eats meat. That night, Cassie ignores the warning in the book and reads it to Max as revenge for him unplugging her computer in the middle of a report she was writing. Priscilla Wright (Brittany Curran), a school bully who stole The Evil Thing from Cassie's bag in school, films her jumping in fear, after using a CD player to play monster sounds outside in order to make the monster appear to have come to life. After Cassie's parents leave for a Halloween party and later that night, The Evil Thing is brought to life by Max's thoughts, and captures him, Priscilla and a Papa John's Pizza delivery man. It is up to Cassie and Sean (Cody Linley), a popular boy who Cassie likes, to save them. At first, they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own, but fail. Cassie then asks the owner of the shop, where she bought the book, for help. Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween, searching for a person who loves to scare people the most and tricks them into reading the book aloud, releasing The Evil Thing, possibly in order to teach them a lesson. He leaves them with the riddle \\"two heads are better than one; that's the way to get the bloody job done\\" before his shop disappears. After he disappears, Sean solves the riddle.

Movie title: Veronica Guerin Context: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

To boot,Pete has AIDS and this compels Gabriel further still,since his partner Jess(Bobby Cannavale,good)happens to be a survivor of HIV himself.

Question: Given the following context:  In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that George Grove helped?

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What village did the Priestleys move to? ?  Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Philip Seymour Hoffman on Broadway: 'He was getting it right in a hard situation' He didn't audition and I hadn't met him before but I was introduced by John C Reilly, who was his close friend, and we basically pressured him into doing the show. I'd loved him in pretty much everything I'd seen him in: at the very least he was distinctive, and often he was sublime. I had done the production in the West End with Mark Rylance, so I was looking for someone who could match that same mercurial brilliance; something that wouldn't be just a piece of bravura acting. True West is a comedy, and comedy is sometimes seen as more shallow; depth is somehow reserved for more serious drama. The unique thing about Philip was, he could combine the two. I don't keep photos of my productions generally, I have only two on the wall in my office, and one of them is of me and Philip and John with our arms round each other at the Tony awards in the year of True West. We were all very young, of course, but we look kind of like these three cheeky, rogueish brothers. He was never secretive about his past problems. So I knew he'd had a tough time when he was younger, and I knew he was clean when we worked together. I saw him last summer and autumn, I was texting him frequently. I was aware of the TMZ thing [when the gossip website broke news of Hoffman entering rehab], I was with him that weekend in fact; I could see how brutal it was to be betrayed like that. He clearly suffered from addiction, and he wrestled with it. For a long time he seemed to be winning. He was getting it right in a hard situation: he had got the work-life balance right; he had a long-term partner; three children he loved; he loved his work. He was very creative, very successful. He was getting a lot of the things right that should allow someone to be happy. He was also very intelligent. And he didn't have that rock-star mentality, the kind you associate with out-of-control behaviour. He was methodical, and rigorous. Which is part of what makes this so desperately sad, because you can't help thinking it had to have been accidental, it didn't have to happen. It didn't feel to me like he was on a downward spiral.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not correctly address the question. The question focuses on the size of visible light, while the provided response discusses the perception of red wavelengths by birds and humans, which is an unrelated topic. A more relevant and accurate answer to the question, \\"how big or small a visible light can get,\\" should discuss the properties of light, specifically the visible light spectrum and its range of wavelengths. Here is a more appropriate answer: Visible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which is composed of photons - elementary particles that travel in waves. The size of visible light can be referred to as its wavelength, which is the distance between two consecutive points in a wave that are in the same phase. The visible light spectrum features a range of wavelengths extending from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm. Within this spectrum are the colors that we typically perceive, progressing from violet (380-450 nm) to indigo (450-485 nm), blue (485-500 nm), green (500-565 nm), yellow (565-590 nm), orange (590-625 nm), and finally red (625-750 nm). So, the size of visible light - its wavelength - can vary, but it generally falls within that 380 to 750 nm range. The actual size of visible light waves that we can perceive depends on various factors such as the source of the light, medium through which it travels, and an observer's visual perception abilities. However, considering the range of wavelengths for visible light, it can be concluded that visible light can be as small as around 380 nm (violet) or as big as around 750 nm (red)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In industrial process engineering, mixing is a unit operation that involves manipulation of a heterogeneous physical system with the intent to make it more homogeneous. Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is segregation. A classical example of segregation is the brazil nut effect.","output":"Yes, it is true that a gas can mix into a liquid according to the text provided. In the context of industrial process engineering, mixing is a crucial unit operation with the goal of making a physical system more homogeneous. This is achieved by manipulating a heterogeneous system to create a more consistent distribution of its components or phases, such as heat and/or mass transfer. The text specifically states that with suitable equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid, or gas into another solid, liquid, or gas. Therefore, it is feasible to mix a gas into a liquid. Various examples are provided from different industries that demonstrate the importance of mixing different phases to obtain optimal results. One example from the text is a biofuel fermenter, which necessitates the mixing of microbes, gases, and liquid medium to achieve optimal yield. This highlights that incorporating gases into the liquid medium is crucial for the effectiveness of the biofuel production process. In industrial processing, mixing is essential for a wide range of applications and is often mandatory to achieve desired outcomes. Chemical reactors can also serve as mixers in some cases. Mixing ensures proper heat and mass transfer and maintains standardization across the industry. Furthermore, mixing is contrasted with the process of segregation, with the brazil nut effect cited as a classical instance. This demonstrates that mixing plays a vital role in preventing segregation and promoting homogeneity in industrial processes. In summary, based on the text provided, it is indeed true that a gas can mix into a liquid within the realm of industrial process engineering. This capacity to combine gases and liquids contributes significantly to improving the homogeneity of systems, which is essential in many industrial applications and processes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: Others embarked on an overseas exodus that took them around the Mediterranean Sea. Hypothesis: Everyone was too afraid to embark on an overseas exodus. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To assess if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to compare the information presented in both. Premise: \\"Others embarked on an overseas exodus that took them around the Mediterranean Sea.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Everyone was too afraid to embark on an overseas exodus.\\" Step 1: Understanding the premise The premise states that some group of people (\\"Others\\") undertook a journey (\\"embarked on an overseas exodus\\") that led them around the Mediterranean Sea. The premise does not provide information about the emotions or motivations (such as fear) of these people.  Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a claim about the emotions of everyone. It says \\"Everyone was too afraid to embark on an overseas exodus.\\" This implies that no one undertook the journey due to fear. Step 3: Comparing the premise with the hypothesis When comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it's clear that they present conflicting information. The premise confirms that a journey occurred, and it was undertaken by others. But the hypothesis asserts that everyone was too afraid to embark on such a journey. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The presence of a journey in the premise contradicts the assertion in the hypothesis that no one undertook the journey due to fear.

Next question: who was the running back in the longest yard?","output":"In order to find out who the running back was in \\"The Longest Yard,\\" I will need to gather information about the movie, analyze its plot and characters, and identify the specific character who played the running back role. Step 1: Gather information about the movie \\"The Longest Yard\\" is a sports comedy film that was originally released in 1974 and later remade in 2005. It is set in a prison environment where the protagonist, a former professional football player, forms a team consisting of inmates to play against the guards. The protagonist in the original film was played by Burt Reynolds, while Adam Sandler played the role in the 2005 remake. Step 2: Analyze the plot and characters The story revolves around the main character and the formation of the prison inmate team. The running back character would be part of this team and likely have a significant role in the film. Step 3: Identify the running back character In the original 1974 film, the character named \\"Granny\\" was played by Michael Conrad and served as the team's main running back. In contrast, the 2005 remake featured the character Earl Megget played by Nelly, an inmate with a talent for running who effectively serves as the team's primary running back. In conclusion, the running back in \\"The Longest Yard\\" depends on the version of the film. In the 1974 film, it was Granny (played by Michael Conrad), and in the 2005 remake, it was Earl Megget (played by Nelly)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A young man with autism, named Cho-won, finds release only in running. As a child, Cho-won regularly threw tantrums, bit himself, and refused to communicate with othersâfinding solace only in zebras and the Korean snack, choco pie. His mother never gave up on him and was determined to prove to the world that her child can be normal. As Cho-won gets older, he begins to find a passion for running and his mother is there to encourage and support him. Even though their family suffers from financial difficulties, they find a former marathon champion, Jung-wook â now a lethargic older man with an alcohol problem.Jung-wook, who is serving community service hours as a physical education teacher for a DUI, grudgingly accepts the offer to train Cho-won in marathon running, but eventually becomes lazy with him. The coach often takes Cho-won's snack, and takes Cho-won to a jjimjilbang to relax. Even though Jung-wook slacks off most of the time, Cho-won's determination for running is firm (he accidentally runs 100 laps around a soccer field when the coach told him to without literally meaning it).He takes third place in a 10Â km running race, which causes his mother to set another goal for her son: to run a full marathon under three hours. This is not an easy task, however, as Cho-won wants to win but doesnât know how to pace himself. Therefore, his mother pleads the coach to run with Cho-won in order to teach him how to pace his running.

Summarize: Before there were tablets and cell phones, road trippers passed the time by playing car games. Car games are a fun way to engage with your fellow passengers and your changing surroundings. Participants are required to react quickly, think creatively, and remain observant. Classic car ride games include:  The License Plate Game—each time you spot a license plate from a different state, check off the state on a map. Whoever spots the most license plates from different states at the end of the trip wins. The Alphabet Signs Game—scan signs, license plates, and billboards for the letters of the alphabet. Whoever spots all the letters, A through Z, in order first wins. Custom Scavenger Hunt—prior to leaving for the trip, come up with a list of items, people, and places. Give everyone a list so they can keep track of their discoveries and points. Whoever finds the most items, people, and/or places by the end of the trip wins. Create your own car game. Determine who can repeat the most lines from a song or movie.  Count the number of advertisements you see for a specific product. Have a contest to see who can purchase the wackiest souvenirs. There are plenty of wireless games and activities that you can play in the car. Trade in your tablet for a magnetic board game. Set aside your cell phone and pick up a card game. Put away your computer and pick up pens and an activity book or drawing pad.  Car friendly games include: Tic-Tac-Toe, magnetic checkers/chess, hangman, trivia card games, games that only require a deck of cards, such as solitaire or free cell.  Car friendly activities include: drawing, journaling, crossword puzzles, word searches, sudoku puzzles, and fill-in-the-blank stories. Reading allows you to escape into another universe, time period, and/or life. Reading a captivating story (or even assigned reading) will help the miles fly by. Pick out a book or two from your local library or bookshop before you leave on your trip. If you’re prone to car sickness, ask someone in the car to read out loud to everyone. Put your GPS in the glove box and pull out of good ol’ fashioned map. Every passenger can take turns reading the map and guiding the drive towards the next destination. You can even turn navigating into a game. Print out maps and an itinerary of your trip for every passenger. Whenever someone asks “Where are we?” or “Are we there yet?” have them pull out their map and itinerary. They can use road signs and these resources to determine where they are and/or when they might arrive at their next destination. Road trips are excellent times to catch up with your loved ones, get to know new people, and create new memories. Spend time talking to the people in your car. You can share personal anecdotes, tell funny jokes, debate hot topics. If you didn’t all participate in planning the trip, discuss the itinerary in the car.","output":"Car games are a fun way to enjoy a road trip with friends or family.

Protesters were arrested after refusing to leave corporate property outside McDonald's headquarters on Wednesday, as hundreds demonstrated to call attention to the low pay earned by fast-food workers. The actions come ahead of the company's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, where it is also expected to be confronted on issues including its executive pay packages and marketing to children. Early Wednesday, organizers changed the location of their demonstration after learning McDonald's closed the building where they had planned their actions and told employees there to work from home. The corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, has several buildings on a sprawling campus. Scroll down for video. Demands: Protesters are pressuring fast food corporations to pay a minimum wage of 15 per hour and offer better benefits. Protest: Demonstrators from across the country gathered at McDonald's corporate headquarters in Illinois on Wednesday. Riot: Riot police were dispatched to McDonald's Illinois headquarters after hundreds of protesters gathered there to demand better wages. Down the street from Hamburger University, dozens of police officers in riot gear warned protesters to disperse. People dressed in McDonald's uniforms essentially volunteered to be arrested by peacefully crossing a barricade or remaining on the property after being asked to leave. Organizers said about 100 McDonald's workers who traveled from around the country were arrested, along with community leaders and supporters. Among them was Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, who said in a statement released after her arrest that she wanted McDonald's workers to know her union members stood with them. The SEIU has been providing financial and organizational support to the fast-food protests, which began in late 2012 in New York City and have been spreading to other cities and countries. Angry: The protesters are said to be employees from several fast food restaurants, not just McDonald's. Arrests: The protesters say police arrested about 100 demonstrators who refused to leave the property. While turnout for the protests has varied, they've nevertheless struck a chord at a time when the gap between the country's rich and poor has widened. Executive pay packages are coming under greater scrutiny too, and shareholders last week rebuked Chipotle Mexican Grill's compensation of 25.1 million and 24.4 million for its co-CEOs in a non-binding, advisory vote. McDonald's Corp., which is far bigger than Chipotle, gave CEO Don Thompson a pay package worth 9.5 million last year. Outside its headquarters, 25-year-old McDonald's worker Jessica Davis said she wasn't worried about being arrested. 'I'm worried about not being able to pay my bills,' said Davis, who earns about 9 an hour at a Chicago restaurant. She said she supports two young children and relies on public assistance and help from her family to get by. A spokesman for the Oak Brook police department, George Peterson, said the arrested protesters were being processed and would be released, with court dates being assigned later. He estimated the crowd of demonstrators at up to 1,500. Clash: The demonstrators clashed with police on several occasions during the protests. Shareholders: The protests were held in coordination with McDonald's annul shareholders meeting. Pay gap: McDonald's CEO Don Thompson was given a pay package worth 9.5 million last year. Although some municipalities have higher rates, the federal minimum wage is 7.25 an hour and translates to about 15,000 a year for a person who works 40 hours a week. But most fast-food workers are given far less time on the clock, in part because restaurant owners want to avoid paying overtime and limit the number of employees who receive benefits, if they are offered. Protesters also plan to demonstrate outside the company's annual meeting Thursday morning. Shareholder meetings offer the public a rare chance to confront top executives at major publicly traded companies. While ordinary investors typically don't attend, the meetings are frequented by public pension funds, activist groups and religious organizations seeking to change corporate practices. Although other fast-food chains such as Burger King and Taco Bell use many of the same practices, McDonald's is a frequent target for critics because of its size and high profile. In a statement, the company said it respects 'everyone's right to peacefully protest.' Later, spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem called the protest 'very much a staged event.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- Hundreds of protesters gathered at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, demanding higher pay for fast-food workers, specifically a minimum wage of 15 per hour. - The protest took place before the company's annual shareholders meeting, where issues like executive pay packages and marketing to children were also expected to be addressed. - About 100 McDonald's workers, community leaders, and supporters, including the president of the Service Employees International Union, were arrested for refusing to leave the property. - The protests highlight the growing concern about income inequality and executive pay. McDonald's CEO Don Thompson received a pay package worth 9.5 million in the previous year. - Fast-food workers often earn less than the federal minimum wage of 7.25 an hour, due to limited working hours and companies avoiding overtime and benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

Answer the following question: This article: Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.  Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that... contains an answer for the question: What is the type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). The blue whale is not only the heaviest whale species but also the largest creature that has ever lived on Earth. They can reach lengths of up to 29.9 meters (98 feet) and weigh as much as 190 metric tons (210 short tons). Blue whales belong to the Balaenopteridae family, which are commonly known as the rorquals. Rorquals are characterized by their long, streamlined bodies, relatively short dorsal fins, and throat pleats that aid in filter-feeding. The blue whale's massive size allows it to filter-feed on vast amounts of krill, which are small shrimp-like crustaceans that are abundant in the ocean. In fact, an adult blue whale can consume several tons of krill per day during the feeding season. Despite their enormous size, blue whales are generally gentle giants and do not pose a threat to humans. They are filter-feeders, using baleen plates in their mouths to sieve vast amounts of krill from the water. The blue whale's mouth is so large that it can take in an estimated 60,000 liters (15,850 gallons) of water in a single gulp, which it then expels through the baleen plates, trapping the krill inside. Due to their immense size and unique adaptations for life at sea, the blue whale is a true marvel of the animal kingdom. Their incredible mass, unmatched by any other living organism, stands as a testament to the astonishing diversity and beauty of life on Earth. Unfortunately, blue whales were historically targeted by commercial whalers for their valuable oil and baleen, leading to a significant decline in their population. As a result, blue whales are currently listed as an endangered species and are protected under international law to preserve their remaining numbers. Conservation efforts are ongoing to ensure the continued survival and recovery of this magnificent marine mammal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Pick beds that house annuals instead of perennials. Ensure your fabric is permeable. Lay the fabric out in one long piece. Cut out the pieces around barriers. Apply the next piece alongside it. Anchor the edges down. Place mulch on top.\\" Article:","output":"Sure, here's a simple explanation! Imagine you want to start a beautiful garden and you have to decide what kind of flowers you want. There are two types: annuals and perennials. Annuals are like balloons at your birthday party, they're flashy and fun, but only last for a short time, mostly one year. Perennials, on the other hand, are like your favourite teddy bear. They stay with you for a long time, coming back year after year. For our garden project, we're going to pick beds that house annuals. That means we're choosing a place to plant these one-year only flowers. Now, you might wonder, can the bed just be any place in the garden? No, you need something special under these flowers to keep them happy, and that's called fabric. This fabric is not like your clothes though, it needs to be permeable. Permeable fabric is like a superhero's net - it lets water and air pass through while stopping bad stuff like weeds. So, we lay out this special fabric in one long piece across our chosen flower bed. Next, we might find some rocks, trees, or other stuff in our flower bed. For that, we need to cut the fabric around these barriers, like how we cut paper around things when we're doing crafts. This way, our fabric fits perfectly on the bed, just like a puzzle piece! If we need another piece of fabric, we apply it, or place it, right next to the one we just put down. It’s like when we put our storybooks side by side on our shelf, so that they stay neat and tidy. Then, we need to keep these fabrics secure. To do this, we anchor the edges down. Anchoring is like when you hold down your kite's string so it doesn't fly away in the wind. We do this to make sure our special fabric doesn't move or fly away. Lastly, we put something called mulch on top of the fabric. Just like blankets keep us warm, mulch protects our plants. It helps to keep the soil moist and stops weeds from growing. It's almost like a shield for our flower bed! In this way, by picking the right flower beds, using the right special fabric, and protecting it well, we can create a wonderful home for our beautiful flowers to grow.

I would like to start this review by saying that I have been coming to Ken's Nails and Spa for a few years now for several different services and - in the past - have always had great service and results. I have always been greeted immediately and have never had to wait more than a couple minutes before I am taken back for services. It truly has been my go-to in the past and I am super sad that I am going to stop frequenting this business.   I am not exactly sure what has changed but my last few visits have been anything but pleasant. First, a couple weeks ago I came in for my normal eyebrow wax. Usually I am in and out in a couple minutes with perfectly manicured brows. This time I left with my eyebrows on FIRE. I went to the Albertson's following my appointment and bought some cooling aloe gel for relief but nothing helped. The area ended up breaking out in blisters that last at least a week. I had several people ask me if I had suffered a burn. Yikes! it was not good and extremely painful.   I let the bad eyebrow wax slide and thought maybe it was a fluke accident and went back last night for a mani-pedi. I feel bad because I am not sure the tech who was working on me really understood some of the things I was trying to communicate to her. At one point I asked her to file my nails slightly shorter and she said \\"ok\\" but then just moved on. That wasn't really the worst part though. During both the mani and pedi she repeatedly hurt me while removing my cuticles. I can be a wuss so I know sometimes it is just me being a baby but this was ridiculous. At one point I gasped and pulled my foot away and the nail tech next to her actually had to scold her and tell her to take it easy.

Remember to avoid using any harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers that may damage the vacuum's finish. Step 3: Inspect and clean attachments The attachments of your vacuum cleaner are designed to help you clean a variety of surfaces and materials. However, they can also accumulate dirt and hair over time, reducing their effectiveness. Detach all the vacuum cleaner attachments and thoroughly inspect them for any debris, dirt, and hair. Use a soft brush or toothbrush to remove any accumulated hair or dirt from these accessories. Ensure they are free from any obstructions that may affect your vacuum's performance. Step 4: Wipe down and unclog the hose The vacuum hose is a crucial component that transports debris and dirt from the cleaning surface into the vacuum bag or canister. A clogged hose can significantly hamper your vacuum cleaner's performance, making it harder for the machine to pick up dirt and debris. To maintain proper function, detach the hose, straighten it out, and visually inspect it for any clogs or obstructions. Utilize a long, flexible brush or a straightened coat hanger to help dislodge any dirt or debris blocking the hose. Once the clogs are removed, wipe down the hose's exterior with a damp cloth to remove any residual dust or dirt. Conclusion: By following these straightforward maintenance steps regularly, you can extend the lifespan of your vacuum cleaner and ensure it continues to function optimally. Keeping your vacuum cleaner well-maintained not only results in a cleaner home but also saves you money in the long run by reducing the frequency of replacement or repair costs. So, make vacuum cleaner maintenance a part of your cleaning routine to enjoy the benefits of a fresh and healthy living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Lycaenidae is the second-largest family of butterflies (behind Nymphalidae, brush-footed butterflies), with over 6,000 species worldwide, whose members are also called gossamer-winged butterflies. They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species.  - Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies , named by Arthur Francis Hemming in honour of Vladimir Nabokov , who extensively studied the Polyommatinae subfamily . Species include : Nabokovia faga ( Dognin 1895 )    What entity does 'nabokovia' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? The answer to this question is:","output":"The entity 'nabokovia' has the relation 'parent taxon' with the subfamily Polyommatinae.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emilie Autumn Liddell (born on September 22, 1979), better known by her stage name Emilie Autumn, is an American singer-songwriter, poet, violinist, and actress. Autumn's musical style has been described by her as \\"Fairy Pop\\", \\"Fantasy Rock\\" or \\"Victoriandustrial\\". It is influenced by glam rock and from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all-female backup dancers Her music encompasses a wide range of styles. Autumn's vocal range is contralto, but also has the ability to perform in the dramatic soprano range. Her vocal work has been compared to Tori Amos, Kate Bush, and The Creatures. She has released two instrumental albums (On a Day... and Laced/Unlaced), and four featuring her vocals: Enchant, Opheliac, A Bit o' This & That, and \\"Fight Like A Girl\\". The 2003 album Enchant drew on \\"new age chamber music, trip hop baroque, and experimental space pop\\". Autumn layers her voice frequently, and incorporates electronics and electronic effects into her work on Enchant; she also combines strings and piano for some songs, while others feature mainly the piano or violin. The 2006 release Opheliac featured \\"cabaret, electronic, symphonic, new age, and good ol' rock & roll (and heavy on the theatrical bombast)\\".  A classically trained musician, Autumn is influenced by plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. She enjoys the works of Shakespeare, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her husband Robert, and Edgar Allan Poe. She incorporates sounds resembling Victorian machinery such as locomotives, which she noted was \\"sort of a steampunk thing\\". While a young Autumn cited Itzhak Perlman as an influence because of the happiness she believed he felt when he played, her main musical influence and inspiration is the English violinist Nigel Kennedy. Her favorite singer is Morrissey from The Smiths. She takes inspiration for her songs from her life experiences and mixes in \\"layers and layers of references, connections, other stories and metaphors\\". Autumn describes her music and style as \\"Psychotic Vaudeville Burlesque\\". She alternatively labels her music and style as \\"Victoriandustrial'\\", a term she coined, and glam rock because of her use of glitter onstage. According to Autumn, her music \\"wasn't meant to be cutesy\\" and is labeled as \\"industrial\\" mainly because of her use of drums and yelling. Her adaption of \\"O Mistress Mine\\" was praised by author and theater director Barry Edelstein as \\"a ravishing, guaranteed tearjerker\\".  For her live performances, which she calls dinner theatre because of her practice of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, Autumn makes use of burlesque--\\"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make a mockery of things that were going on socially and politically\\"--to counterbalance the morbid topics such as abuse and self-mutilation. She incorporates handmade costumes, fire tricks, theatrics, and a female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets: Veronica Varlow, Jill Evyn (Moth), and formerly The Blessed Contessa, Lady Aprella, Little Lucina, Lady Joo Hee, Captain Vecona, Little Miss Sugarless, Mistress Jacinda, and the model Ulorin Vex.

Last updated at 9:04 AM on 13th September 2011. A drunken housewife hit her husband over the head with a 7ft mirror before he retaliated by attacking her with a stun gun, a court heard yesterday. The couple were watching television and eating a Chinese takeaway following a night out when Terri Smith, 43, became overwhelmed with emotion over their ‘volatile’ 13-year marriage and launched the astonishing attack. She accused husband Antony Smith, 42, of responding by blasting her five times in the stomach with the illegal 50,000 volt ‘black cobra’ taser gun. In court: Terri Smith and her husband Antony Smith outside Chippenham Magistrates Court. She has accused him of attacking her with a stun gun. ‘I was jabbed three, four, five times in my stomach, it was a sharp stabbing pain,’ she told Chippenham magistrates. ‘I heard the clicky sound of the gun three or four times.’ Mrs Smith claimed her husband, a roof tiler, then dragged her through the front door ‘very hard by my hair’ and shut the door. ‘I threw something at the door which smashed the glass and I cut my hand,’ she said. Mr Smith allegedly then hurled his wife’s handbag outside and was said to have kicked her in the face as she picked up the contents. But magistrates cleared Mr Smith of the attack. He admitted possessing an illegal taser, but denied a charge of assault by beating and insisted he had not fired the weapon during the incident because ‘there wasn’t enough charge in it’. Presiding magistrate Roger Coleman said: ‘We find that the defendant did act in self-defence, we believe his version of events. 'The defendant’s actions were reasonable in the circumstances.’ Mr Smith will be sentenced next month for possession of the illegal stun gun. Although Mrs Smith was arrested, she faced no charges over the incident at the couple’s home in Swindon, Wiltshire, in February. She said: ‘I don’t know what came over me, I got up and flipped the coffee table over in front of us. I had so many mixed emotions. ‘I was angry about a lot of things, I was sad, I was living under pressure all the time. I grabbed the mirror from behind him and hit him with it.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"A drunken housewife, Terri Smith, attacked her husband, Antony Smith, with a 7ft mirror during a heated argument, leading Antony to retaliate using a 50,000-volt stun gun.

One of the most important properties of metallic elements is their ability to act as Lewis acids that form complexes with a variety of Lewis bases. A metal complex consists of a central metal atom or ion that is bonded to one or more ligands (from the Latinligare, meaning “to bind”), which are ions or molecules that contain one or more pairs of electrons that can be shared with the metal. Metal complexes can be neutral, such as Co(NH3)3Cl3; positively charged, such as [Nd(H2O)9]3+; or negatively charged, such as [UF8]4−. Electrically charged metal complexes are sometimes called complex ions. A coordination compound contains one or more metal complexes. Coordination compounds are important for at least three reasons. First, most of the elements in the periodic table are metals, and almost all metals form complexes, so metal complexes are a feature of the chemistry of more than half the elements. Second, many industrial catalysts are metal complexes, and such catalysts are steadily becoming more important as a way to control reactivity. For example, a mixture of a titanium complex and an organometallic compound of aluminum is the catalyst used to produce most of the polyethylene and polypropylene “plastic” items we use every day. Finally, transition-metal complexes are essential in biochemistry. Examples include hemoglobin, an iron complex that transports oxygen in our blood; cytochromes, iron complexes that transfer electrons in our cells; and complexes of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mo that are crucial components of certain enzymes, the catalysts for all biological reactions. Metal complexes are so important in biology that we consider the topic separately in Section 23.6 \\"Transition Metals in Biology\\".   Q: Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting what within our blood?   A: Answer:","output":"Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen within our blood. This iron complex plays a crucial role in the circulatory system of humans and many other organisms by binding to oxygen molecules in the lungs and carrying them through the bloodstream to cells and tissues. The oxygen is then released into the cells for cellular respiration, allowing the production of energy required for various biological processes. Hemoglobin's ability to bind and transport oxygen makes it an essential component of life and is a prime example of the importance of metal complexes, particularly transition-metal complexes, in biochemistry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fully expecting for no good reason to get a job and become movie stars, and dressed for the occasion, the Stooges sneak into a movie studio—where they are mistaken for three new executives who are due to take over the facility. Given the authority, they promptly abuse it and take over the production of a movie set in hopes of shooting a blockbuster movie. Curly gets off on the wrong foot when, unable to light his match for a smoke, spots an actress receiving a pedicure (silent star Mildred Harris). He then strikes the match on the sole of her bare foot, startling her. Angered, she is about to storm off the set until the trio convince her to stay. The trio then act out the love scene as they want it filmed, leading its stars to abandon the set. Another telegram arrives with the news that three actual executives were delayed by a storm. Angered at the deception, the studio boss and the film's crew go after the Stooges, who flee the scene. After the trio is able to hide from their pursuers, they soon find themselves in a lion's den.

The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H.

In 1765, the inhabitants of Arkham, Massachusetts, are suspicious of the strange phenomena surrounding the grand \\"palace\\" that overlooks the town. They suspect the palace's owner, Joseph Curwen, is a warlock. A young girl wanders up to the palace in a trance-like state. She is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down into the dungeons. The girl is subjected to a strange ritual, in which an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit. The townspeople observe the girl wandering off, and they storm the palace to confront its owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople surmise that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her. They drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. The mob leader, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Hester (to whom he had been previously engaged to marry). Before being burned alive, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants and their descendants, promising to rise from the grave to take his revenge. In 1875, 110 years later, Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace. They find the townsfolk hostile towards them and are disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the palace and struck by his strong resemblance to a portrait of Curwen. He and Anne meet Simon, the palace caretaker, who persuades them to stay at the palace and to forget the townspeoples' hostility. Charles becomes more and more obsessed with the portrait of Curwen, and at times seems to change in his personality. The answer is:","output":"The inhabitants of Arkham, who suspect Joseph Curwen of being a warlock due to the strange phenomena surrounding his palace, take matters into their own hands after witnessing the bizarre occurrence involving a young girl who enters the palace in a trance-like state and is escorted by Curwen and Hester into the dungeons. Believing that the girl has been bewitched to forget the incident, the townspeople decide to confront Curwen directly. They storm the palace, intent on dealing with the perceived threat posed by the suspected warlock. Although the girl appears physically unharmed, the townspeople's suspicions regarding Curwen's sinister activities are only reinforced. The Arkham inhabitants, led by Ezra Weeden, proceed to capture Curwen and drag him out to a tree where they plan to burn him alive as punishment for his alleged misdeeds. Despite Weeden's insistence on sparing Hester from the same fate due to their previous engagement, Curwen is not shown the same mercy. Having been labelled a warlock, he is deemed too dangerous to be allowed to live.  Before meeting his fiery end, Curwen casts a curse on the entire town of Arkham, as well as its present and future inhabitants, vowing to rise from the grave and exact his vengeance upon those who have wronged him. This ominous prediction comes to a head 110 years later when Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, inherits the palace and arrives in Arkham with his wife Anne, only to be met with hostility and a series of chilling events that call into question the truth behind Curwen's curse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank.\\" correctly answer the question of Who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon?","output":"No, the statement \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank\\" does not correctly answer the question of who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon. The statement mainly discusses the movement of civilians in Egypt due to a specific event but does not provide any information about an entity attacking Israel from Lebanon. However, I can provide a detailed analysis of the different entities that have or could potentially attack Israel from Lebanon. The question of who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon is quite complex, as it involves various political, historical, and strategic aspects. Lebanon shares a border with Israel and has a history of conflicts and tensions between the parties. Throughout history, different groups have attacked Israel from Lebanese territory or have actively sought to do so. Prominent groups and entities that have targeted Israel from Lebanon include: 1. Palestinian militant groups: During the 1960s-1980s, Palestinian militant groups, such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), launched attacks on Israel from Lebanon. These attacks led to various conflicts in the region, including the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which aimed at removing the PLO from the country. 2. Hezbollah: Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based Shia militant group, is considered the most significant threat to Israel from Lebanon. Formed in the 1980s and backed by Iran and Syria, Hezbollah has engaged in multiple conflicts with Israel since its inception. Hezbollah's major offensives against Israel include the 1990s' \\"South Lebanon conflict\\" and the more recent 2006 Lebanon War (also known as the Second Lebanon War or the Israel-Hezbollah War). Many experts believe that the group still possesses thousands of rockets and missiles, making them an ongoing threat to Israel's security. 3. Islamic State (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups: Lebanon has also witnessed the presence of radical Islamist groups, such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliates, who have an interest in attacking Israel. However, their foothold in Lebanon remains limited compared to Hezbollah. These are the primary entities that have targeted or expressed desires to attack Israel from Lebanon. The volatile nature of the region, combined with the varying political interests of neighboring countries such as Syria and Iran, creates a complicated environment in which attacks on Israel could be initiated. Therefore, the question of who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon depends on the specific context, political landscape, and ongoing tensions between the involved parties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the given statement, we have a few key elements: 1. A trio of soccer players: This tells us that there are specifically three soccer players involved. 2. Play on the field: This indicates that the players are actively engaged in the soccer game. 3. As a crowd looks on: This suggests that the event is being watched by an audience. Now, let's break down the conclusion statement and see if it matches the information provided in the original statement. 1. A group of soccer players: The term \\"group\\" is more generic and does not necessarily imply a specific number of players. While three players can be considered a group, the original statement provides more specific information, so we should stick to the term \\"trio\\" when referring to the number of soccer players. 2.

Article: Syrian government forces will not receive the first shipment of S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems until the middle of next year, Russian media have reported.      One defence source told the Kommersant daily that according to contracts signed in 2010, Moscow is due to deliver six sets of the S-300 systems by spring 2014. Another source said it would take another six months for the Syrian military to be trained to use them.      The report contradicts assertions made on Thursday by Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, that the systems were on their way.      The Vedomosti newspaper reported that Russia would send four S-300 systems to Syria as part of a contract worth 1bn (£660m), but that it was unclear when the arms would arrive.      The S-300 contracts were signed roughly a year before civil unrest against Assad's regime erupted in March 2011.      Russia's foreign ministry has been reluctant to discuss an exact time frame for the missile shipments. Earlier this week, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said he wasn't able to confirm when the S-300s would arrive.      \\"I can only say that we won't cancel the contracts,\\" he said. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been similarly reticent.      Separately, Russian officials have said that a new contract to sell updated MiG warplanes to Syria is being finalised with Syrian officials in Moscow. Sergei Korotkov, CEO of the MiG company, told journalists outside Moscow that his company had agreed with a Syrian military delegation to deliver at least 10 MiG-29MM2 aircraft.      Analysts said the move was a further show by the Syrian leadership that western powers should think twice before becoming more deeply embroiled in the war.      \\"Evidently the Syrian government feels confident and wants to show that it's buying modern weapons aimed at countering foreign aggression,\\" said Igor Korotchenko, editor of National Defense magazine and a former defence ministry employee.      \\"Such warplanes aren't used against rebels, because that would bring new sanctions against Syria,\\" he said, although video footage is frequently posted purporting to show MiGs bombing built-up urban areas.      \\"The war with the rebels is waged using infantry, Kalashnikov automatic rifles, tanks and armoured vehicles,\\" he said.      Korotchenko described the MiG 29MM2 as a multifunctional craft that can be used to attack targets on land and sea.      The analyst said Assad's father had bought so many tanks, rifles and armoured vehicles that the current regime had no need for new purchases to wage war against the rebels.      \\"The Syrian government needs modern means of waging war, including S-300s, anti-missile systems and warplanes. These are essential if foreign powers such as the US and Britain impose a no-fly zone or launch air strikes on Syria.\\"      Korotchenko said it was highly unlikely Russia had already delivered shipments of S-300s to Syria, saying the weapons were bulky and US and Israeli intelligence would have easily spotted them using satellite observation.      \\"You can't hide S-300s in your pocket. If they had been delivered, western intelligence would have made an announcement.\\"      An aide to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, refused comment on the possible delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft systems to Syria.      \\"I wouldn't like to comment on the specifics, whether it's the first delivery or the second. I don't know which delivery you're talking about,\\" said Yury Ushakov, the aide, according to the RIA Novosti news agency.      \\"But I would like to stress that the Russian side isn't delivering any weapons that would fall under the relevant international bans,\\" the Kremlin official said.      Assad said on Thursday that it was \\"not our policy to talk publicly about military issues in terms of what we possess or what we receive\\".      During an interview with al-Manar TV, broadcast on Thursday, he said: \\"As far as Russia is concerned, the contracts have nothing to do with the crisis. We have negotiated with them on different kinds of weapons for years, and Russia is committed to honouring these contracts.\\"      He said the ongoing crisis in Syria had not affected arms imports. \\"All of our agreements with Russia will be implemented, some have been implemented during the past period and, together with the Russians, we will continue to implement these contracts in the future.\\" ||||| 1 of 2. Forces of Syrian President Bashar al Assad are seen on a tank in Arjoun village near Qusair town May 30, 2013.      MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia could speed up delivery of anti-aircraft missiles to Syria if the West intervenes, but also floated the idea of suspending the shipment, Russian media reported on Friday, as Moscow set out its negotiating position ahead of peace talks.      A Russian arms industry source was quoted by Interfax news agency as threatening to hasten delivery of the hotly-contested S-300 missiles if the West were to impose a no-fly zone or Israel were to launch new air strikes.      However the source also \\"did not exclude that the delivery of the S-300 to Syria could be frozen for a period of time\\" Interfax reported, comparing the move to the delivery of another weapons system that was suspended by Moscow.      Russia's arms industry is firmly controlled by the state, and it is unlikely the unidentified source would be authorized to speak without the blessing of the Kremlin.      Russia and the West are staking out positions with parallel threats to arm the warring sides ahead of a peace conference next month, the first attempt in a year by the global powers on either side in Syria's civil war to look for a way to end it.      French President Francois Hollande said it was unacceptable for Moscow to talk about arming the Syrian government ahead of the conference, even as he repeated his own threats to arm the rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.      U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also criticized Russia for discussing arms sales to Assad.      Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide, said it was the EU's decision last week to lift its embargo on arming the rebels that was \\"not conducive to preparations for such an important international event\\" as the Geneva conference.      Paris and London say they wanted the embargo lifted ahead of the peace talks to gain leverage over Assad and Moscow.      In another signal that Moscow is prepared to arm Assad, the head of aircraft maker MiG was quoted as saying he still plans to send Syria at least 10 MiG-29 fighters under a 2007 contract.      WORRYING      Particularly worrying for the West is Moscow's plans to fulfill a 2010 contract to send Assad the S-300, an advanced anti-aircraft missile system that could make it far more dangerous to impose a no-fly zone, and could threaten planes deep inside the air space of Israel or NATO-member Turkey.      The Russian arms industry source said the S-300 missiles could not arrive in Syria for months, but the pace of delivery would be determined by the behavior of Assad's foes.      \\"Regarding the deliveries of the S-300, they can begin no earlier than the autumn,\\" the source said. \\"Technically it's possible, but much will depend on how the situation develops in the region and the position of Western countries.\\"      Without naming Israel specifically, Interfax paraphrased the source as saying: \\"Air attacks on Syria from the side of a neighboring government or the introduction of a so-called no-fly zone above Syria may serve as a pretext for speeding up the deliveries of the S-300.\\"      Israel, which has bombed Syria at least three times in recent months to prevent Assad from transferring arms to his Lebanese Hezbollah militia allies, has urgently called on Moscow to scrap the S-300 deliveries, as have Western countries.      France's Hollande set out his country's position - shared with Britain and other allies - that the West must be able to arm the rebels as long as Moscow is arming Assad.      \\"We cannot accept that when we are preparing Geneva 2 (talks) with the idea of finding a political solution, that Russia is delivering weapons at the same time to Assad's regime, and that we should be (prevented) from delivering weapons to the opposition,\\" Hollande said.      \\"To ensure the political solution happens, you should never put aside the option of military pressure, and in this case it is lifting the EU embargo.\\"      \\"PRETTY GOOD AIR DEFENCES\\"      Russian daily Vedomosti has reported that Assad bought four units of the modernized S-300PMU-2 system for nearly 1 billion.      The S-300 can track targets up to 300 km (190 miles) away and can hit at a range of up to 200 km, sparking Israeli fears that Assad's reach could extend well into the Jewish state and threaten flights over its main commercial airport near Tel Aviv.      Western experts say the missiles would enhance Assad's Russian-supplied arsenal of short-range Pantsir missiles and medium-range BUK missile systems.      A source close to the Russian Defense Ministry said Assad would use his other air Defense systems to guard the S-300, giving him \\"pretty good\\" air defenses.      Russia has been Assad's most powerful diplomatic ally in a conflict that has killed more than 80,000 people since March 2011. Along with China, it has vetoed three U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to end violence.      RIA news agency quoted the head of MiG as saying he was discussing terms for the fighter jets with a Syrian delegation in Moscow now. It did not say when delivery was expected.      Russia had planned to begin delivering last year on a 600 million contract for 12 MiG-29MM2 fighter jets signed in 2007, with an option for 12 more. The jets are to be equipped with air-to-air and air-to-surface rockets, making them a tough enemy if a \\"no-fly zone\\" were imposed.      The source close to the Defense Ministry said Syrian troops would need to be trained on the S-300 in Russia's southern province of Astrakhan.      Former Russian Air Force Commander General Anatoly Kornukov told Interfax such training would need a minimum of two to four weeks. The S-300s themselves would be ready for use \\"within five minutes after the delivery\\", he said.      Israeli newspaper Haaretz has quoted National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror as telling European diplomats that Israel would \\"prevent the S-300 missiles from becoming operational\\".      (Additional reporting by Maria Tsvetkova; Editing by Peter Graff and Sonya Hepinstall) |||||Summary:","output":"The Syrian government forces are set to receive the first shipment of S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems by mid-next year, according to Russian media. The delivery of these systems was initially agreed upon in contracts signed back in 2010, with the Russian government due to provide six sets of S-300 systems by spring 2014. However, it is reported that it would take another six months for the Syrian military to be trained to use them effectively. This contradicts earlier claims made by Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, that the systems were already on their way. The acquisition of S-300 anti-aircraft systems would be a significant upgrade for Syria's military capabilities, providing them with an advanced defense measure against any potential foreign air attacks. Furthermore, Russian officials have revealed that a new contract to sell updated MiG warplanes to Syria is being finalized with Syrian officials in Moscow. The delivery of at least 10 MiG-29MM2 aircraft has been agreed upon between the MiG company and the Syrian military delegation. These warplanes are primarily designed to counter foreign aggression, and their deployment sends a clear message to Western powers regarding Syria's determination to protect its sovereignty. The buildup of Syria's military capabilities, particularly through the acquisition of S-300 systems and MiG warplanes, is a strategic move by the Assad regime to deter any foreign intervention in the ongoing conflict. These advanced weapons are essential for the Syrian government to uphold their defense against potential air strikes or the imposition of a no-fly zone by foreign powers, such as the US and Britain."},{"instruction":"Title: Time to relax & dream to Till Broenners Oceana!

This means they had powerful kings who made good decisions, many soldiers to protect their land, and they could get along with others easily. Second answer: The major contributions of the Mughal Empire were things like beautiful buildings, pretty art, and a special way of cooking. This means they built wonderful places like the Taj Mahal and made lovely paintings, and they made yummy food that we still enjoy today. These two questions are not the same thing because the first one asks about the strengths or what made them strong, and the second one asks about their contributions or what they gave to the world.

The Ukulele is being taught to Matthew by Justin in class.  Choices: [a]. Matthew must be the person teaching. [b]. Justin must be the person teaching.","output":"[b]. Justin must be the person teaching. The sun illuminated the classroom through large windows as the students waited for their much-anticipated ukulele lesson. Justin, a well-experienced musician, had been teaching an extracurricular music course at St. Andrew's Academy for the past three years. He had a natural gift for connecting with students and was known for his ability to simplify complicated concepts in a fun and engaging manner. Matthew, a quiet and introverted student with a deep love for music, had eagerly signed up for Justin's ukulele course. He had invariably been captivated by the pleasing strums of a ukulele. Listening to the tiny guitar-like instrument somehow transported him to an entirely different world with its beautiful harmony of sounds. As the lesson began, Justin picked up his ukulele and started by explaining the basics: how to hold the instrument, proper finger placement, and tuning techniques. Matthew watched and listened intently, absorbing every detail. Justin then moved on to demonstrate various chord progressions using soothing, well-known songs as examples. Matthew, in awe of Justin's command of the instrument, had a hard time believing that he could ever achieve the same level of proficiency as his teacher, let alone excel in the art himself. \\"Okay, now it's your turn,\\" Justin said to Matthew, handing over the instrument with a comforting smile. \\"I want you to try strumming a C major chord.\\" Matthew cautiously took the ukulele from his teacher. The student's hands felt slightly shaky, betraying the young musician's nervousness. As he attempted to press his fingers to form the chord, Justin noticed this unease and shared a few calming words of encouragement. \\"Don't worry, Matthew. You'll get the hang of this in no time,\\" he reassured, placing a hand gently on the student's shoulder. With renewed courage, Matthew tried again and miraculously produced a sweet, melodic sound. He looked up at Justin, eyes shining with excitement and gratitude. The two spent the rest of the lesson working on different chord progressions, and Matthew began to grow more confident in his abilities, thanks to Justin's patient guidance. Over the semester, Matthew's dedication, combined with Justin's expertise, bore fruit in the form of significant improvement in the student's ukulele skills. Not only did Matthew learn to play a variety of chords and songs, but he also began understanding the subtleties of music theory, something that elevated his knowledge to a whole new level. It was during their final lesson together when Justin decided to surprise Matthew. Handing him a piece of paper, he asked him to read aloud its contents. \\"Your hard work and passion have paid off, Matthew. I'm proud to announce that you have been selected as the ukulele player for our upcoming school concert!\\" Matthew's face lit up with a mixture of shock and joy. He had never imagined that he would end up on stage as a performer, especially given his timid and introspective nature. At the concert, Matthew's performance was met with roaring applause. It was evident to everyone present that this newfound talent of his was no mere fluke. Most importantly, his success served as a testament to the power of having an exceptional teacher like Justin, who instilled confidence, knowledge, and passion into his students."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible A: windows, trunks, four wheels, seat belts, diesel engines  Why is \\"seat belts\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Seat belts\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it fulfills the following logical steps: 1. Understanding the question: The question mentions \\"safety concerns\\" and asks which feature in the list of possible answers has been made mandatory due to this reason. This directs us to look for an answer that has a strong impact on improving safety. 2. Eliminating irrelevant options: We can eliminate the following options based on their relevance to safety:    - Windows: Though they provide visibility and security, they are not directly linked to accident safety.    - Trunks: Trunks are primarily for storage purposes and don't significantly affect safety.    - Four wheels: While it affects stability, it is not a safety feature implemented specifically to address safety concerns. Additionally, there are vehicles with different numbers of wheels (e.g., motorcycles have two wheels).    - Diesel engines: Engine type is more related to fuel efficiency and performance rather than safety. 3. Identifying the correct option: Among the remaining option, \\"seat belts\\" is directly related to safety. Seat belts are designed to secure occupants in their seats and reduce the risk of injury or death during collisions or sudden stops. They have been proven to be effective in reducing fatalities and injuries in road accidents. This aligns with the aspect of \\"safety concerns\\" mentioned in the question.

Group P had larger logs, while group Q had small twigs, sawdust and kindlings.  But I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid.

Victims of the payment protection insurance pay-outs scandal are more likely to have spent their compensation on holidays or a new car than squirrelled the money away into savings, research suggests. Nearly one quarter (24 per cent) of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday, a survey for the website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk found. On average, successful claimants said they had received £2,810 - but those who spent the money said it took just two and-a-half weeks typically before all the cash was gone. According to recent figures, Lloyds' PPI costs now total a potential £9.825bn. For all banks the bill is approaching £20bn. Nearly one quarter of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday. One fifth (22 per cent) of those who had received compensation said they had used the cash to buy a new vehicle and a similar proportion (19 per cent) bought a home appliance. Only around one in seven (13 per cent) people who received compensation put the money they had received into savings, while 17 per cent used it to pay off household bills. One in 10 (10 per cent) splashed out on new clothes and one in 20 (5 per cent) compensation recipients treated themselves to new shoes. PPI, which will cover a borrower’s loan repayments if they stop being able to earn money for some reason, is the biggest scandal that the financial ombudsman has ever seen. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers who have been unable to come to an agreement with a financial firm. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers. The insurance was often added on to loans or credit cards without people realising. Some people were given the 'hard sell' or found such policies were unsuitable for their circumstances. According to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) a total of £13.3 billion has been paid out in PPI compensation since January 2011. VoucherCodesPro.co.uk surveyed more than 2,000 people from across the UK who had purchased PPI at some point, of which nearly one quarter (22 per cent) said they had received compensation arising from a mis-sold PPI claim. Those who received compensation were allowed to select more than one answer when asked what they had spent the money on. PPI was designed to protect borrowers' payments. If the borrower lost their job, had to take maternity leave or suffered from loss of income that they could not make repayments the insurance would have protected them to cover the costs until the policyholder is able to again. The misselling of PPI grew into the biggest financial scandal in the UK within the past five years and has cost banks millions of pounds. Action wasn't taken until 2005 when the Financial Service Authority (FSA) took over regulation of the general isurance market. Citizens Advice also issued a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading. That complaint included evidence of:. Excessively high prices.Only partial protection, with many exclusions which prevent many seemingly reasonable claims.Mis-selling, including high pressures sales tactics.A slow and often unfair claims process when consumers were eligible to claim. In January 2009, a year after the OFT handed its investigation over to them, the Competition Commission recommended that sales of PPI be banned alongside lending products such as credit cards and loans. In August 2010, the FSA published its PPI consultation paper which recommended that banks who had engaged in mis-selling should compensate all the customers who had been sold products using the same methods. The British Banking Association (BBA), a trade body for all UK banks, appealed against the FSA rules by seeking a judicial review to have them annulled or curtailed. By May 2010, 30 per cent of all cases coming in to the Financial Ombudsman Service concerned PPI. Highlights:","output":"1.

A:","output":"The information you provided seems to be missing some steps or might be a little unclear. The process you are describing resembles cellular respiration, so let me provide an accurate description of the final stages of this process.  Cellular respiration is the process by which cells produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from glucose and oxygen. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process: 1. Oxygen is inhaled through the nose or mouth and enters the lungs. 2. The oxygen diffuses from the lungs into the bloodstream, where it is carried by hemoglobin in red blood cells. 3. Blood circulation transports oxygen and glucose to individual cells throughout the body. 4. Within the cells, glucose is broken down through a process called glycolysis, which takes place in the cytoplasm and produces pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule) and a small amount of ATP. 5. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria and undergoes the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), releasing carbon dioxide as a waste product. 6. The carbon dioxide produced during the citric acid cycle diffuses from the cells into the bloodstream, where it is carried back to the lungs. 7. The final step involves exhaling carbon dioxide from the body through the lungs. As one breathes out, carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth or nose into the atmosphere. So, the last step of the process is exhaling carbon dioxide from the body."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Football manager Paulo Di Canio is caught on camera grieving at the funeral of an Italian fascist connected with a terrorist attack which killed 85 people. The controversial new Sunderland boss was present when Paolo Signorelli was laid to rest and fellow mourners gave the right-arm salute as the coffin was carried out of the church. Di Canio, 44, refused to discuss his. political views as he was unveiled as manager of the struggling Premier. League side yesterday. Scroll down to see the press conference. Fascist salute: Paulo Di Canio was at Paolo Signorelli's funeral where mourners gave the right-arm Fascist salute as the 76-year-old's body was carried out of the church. Mourner: Di Canio, centre, at Mr Signorelli's funeral in December 2010. The extreme-right activist was held in prison on remand for eight years over a terrorist bombing which killed 85 people in 1980. He dismissed questions about his views as 'ridiculous and pathetic'. Asked if he is still a fascist he said: 'I don't have to answer that question any more.' But Di Canio issued a statement today, stating: 'I am not political, I do not affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone.' The pictures emerged today after the political storm over the Italian's appointment intensified when a miners' group asked the club to return an iconic banner which hangs in its. stadium in protest. Signorelli, who died aged 76 in December 2010, had been a senior member of the Italian Socialist movement which grew out of the collapse of Benito Mussolini's Fascist party after World War II. He spent eight years in jail on remand after a bomb was set off killing 85 people at Bologna railway station in 1980. Terror outrage: 85 people were killed in the 1980 bombing of Bologna train station. Paolo Signorelli spent eight years on remand while awaiting trial but was eventually cleared of involvement on appeal. Although he was initially convicted he was cleared on appeal because of insufficient evidence. But he was still found guilty of being part of an 'armed band' and a 'subversion against democracy', The Sun reported. Di Canio is understood to have been a frequent visitor to the far right politician's home in the final years of his life. Three days after the appointment of Di Canio, the row has shown no sign of abating. Labour MP David Miliband resigned from his position on the Sunderland board after the controversial Italian was installed as boss. And the general secretary of the Durham Miners' Association, which has close links to the Sunderland, has spoken out against Di Canio and his far-right views. First day: Paolo Di Canio takes control of a training session today for the first time after being appointed Sunderland manager. Controversy: Di Canio at the funeral of Mr Signorelli. The picture emerged today after the new Sunderland manager refused to discuss his political views at a press conference. Sunderland's ground, the Stadium of. Light, is named after a Davy lamp in honour of its location on the. former site of Wearmouth Colliery. Adding to the team's association with the mining industry, it hosts the Wearmouth Miners' Banner on permanent display. But. Dave Hopper, who worked at the colliery for 27 years and now heads the. miners' union, has asked the club to return the commemorative object. 'I,. like many thousands of miners, have supported Sunderland from infancy. and we are passionate about football,' he said. 'But there are. principles which are much more important. ‘Our. banner represents the Durham miners’ long struggle for the rights of. the working class, rights which were annihilated by fascism in Germany,. Italy, Spain and Chile. Quit: Labour MP David Miliband resigned as a director of the club after Di Canio's appointment. Iconic: This miners' banner has long hung at the club's Stadium of Light, but a union leader has called for it to be returned over the new manager's fascist links. ‘We have a sacred obligation to the. millions who were wiped out by Hitler, Mussolini and Franco to oppose. fascism wherever and in whatever context this evil creed raises its. head, particularly at a time when working people are again being forced. to pay for capitalism’s crisis as they were in Europe in the 1920s and. 1930s. ‘The appointment. of Di Canio is a disgrace and a betrayal of all who fought and died in. the fight against fascism. Everyone must speak out and oppose this. outrage and call on Ellis Short [club owner/chairman] and the Sunderland. board to reverse their decision.' Di. Canio had a distinguished but controversial playing career for. teams including Lazio, Juventus and West Ham United, and entered. management with Swindon Town in 2011. He. was fined for giving a fascist salute to ultra-nationalist fans of. Lazio, and defended himself saying: 'I am a fascist, not a racist.' Asked yesterday if. the focus on politics was making his job more difficult, he said: 'No. Because always there is an issue if people try to put you in difficulty. for a ridiculous and pathetic situation which doesn't represent Paolo Di. Canio. So I'm not worried.' When. he was pressed on the issue of his political beliefs, Di Canio replied:. 'The people talking about this are offending my parents - I don't give. the chance to offend my parents and my daughter.' Controversy: Di Canio has refused to answer questions about his political views since being appointed manager of Sunderland. Bullish: The manager has repeatedly dodged questions about his apparent fascist sympathies. Gesture: Di Canio controversially giving a fascist salute to ultra-nationalist Lazio fans in 2005. Ground: The Stadium of Light is named after the Davy lamp and built on the site of a colliery.

They both looked at each other and exchanged knowing smiles; it was going to be a great day. As they strolled through the mall, they passed rows of enticing shops, each offering an array of tempting items. However, they remained focused on their mission – to find the perfect, soft and fruity candy for Adam. Craig remembered a candy store that he had visited a few months ago, \\"Dulce Delights,\\" which seemed to have an endless variety of candy. He was confident that it would have just what they were looking for. Upon arriving at the store, they were awestruck by the vibrant colors, jars filled with candy of all shapes and sizes, and the sweet-smelling aroma that filled the air. Excitedly, they dove into their search, scanning the shelves for the perfect treat. Craig spotted a shelf filled with gummy candies and immediately thought of Adam's love for anything soft and chewy. He noticed a bag marked \\"Tropical Fruit Gummies,\\" which boasted exotic flavors like mango, pineapple, and passion fruit. He thought of how much Adam enjoyed tropical flavors and believed these would be a great choice. At the same time, Adam was intrigued by a collection of artisanal fruit-flavored hard candies. While they may not have been as soft as gummy candies, they promised a long-lasting flavor experience. The delicate packaging and notably higher price suggested these were no ordinary candies. Adam wondered if these would be a good option, as they seemed more unique and thoughtful. In the end, they both brought their finds to the counter to make their decisions. (1) Craig made a good choice. As they compared the two options, Craig was adamant that the gummy candies would be perfect for Adam. He reminded Adam of his love for chewy candies and pointed out the tropical flavors that he knew Adam would enjoy. Finally, convinced by Craig's enthusiasm, Adam agreed to go with the tropical gummies. As it turns out, the gummies were a huge hit at the party. Not only did Adam love them, but the other guests devoured them as well, delighted by their soft, chewy texture and exquisite flavors. They all raved about the candy, grateful for Craig's thoughtful and delicious choice.

The Marxist critique of capitalism — developed with Friedrich Engels — was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the Twentieth Century. The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought. Urbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the socialist movement began to form. In the mid-19th century, Marxism was developed, and socialism in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel Castro. Though Hegel's philosophy of history is similar to Immanuel Kant's, and Karl Marx's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was \\"standing on its head\\", \\"the right side up again\\". Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism, Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of Spirit. By the late 19th century, socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of anarchism, with thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Peter Kropotkin, and syndicalism also gained some prominence.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering.

This species can be found from South America to northern Mexico . The species can be found from Mexico to northern South America . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"These two sentences convey a similar meaning, but with a slight difference in emphasis and direction. Both sentences indicate that the species in question is distributed within a geographic range that encompasses parts of South and Central America and northern Mexico. However, the order in which these locations are mentioned creates a subtle distinction between the sentences. The first sentence, \\"This species can be found from South America to northern Mexico,\\" emphasizes the starting point of the species' distribution in South America and implies a directionality progressing northward towards Mexico. The focus is placed on South America as the primary origin, and readers might infer that the species has expanded its range toward northern Mexico. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"The species can be found from Mexico to northern South America,\\" reverses the order of the geographic locations and indicates a starting point in Mexico with a southward progression toward northern South America. In this case, the emphasis is on Mexico as the primary origin, and the species' expansion appears directed towards northern South America. While both sentences describe the same geographic range, they imply different directional trends in the species' distribution. However, it is important to note that these inferences are subtle and may not always be key information for every context. Generally speaking, the sentences can be read as indicating the same distribution range, with the focus shifting slightly between South America and Mexico due to the order of the mentioned locations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: No one can deny that buttons are an important clothing device. But, can they rise to the level of art? Organizers of an exhibit in New York think so. Peter Souleo Wright organized \\"The Button Show\\" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \\"What I tried to do with this show,\\" he said , \\"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \\"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\\". Artist Beau McCall produced \\"A Harlem Hangover\\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design. For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. Others use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs. \\"The Button Show\\" ends at March 12. The Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation paid for the exhibition. The foundation was created in 1995 by the Simmons brothers: artist Danny, hip-hop producer Russell and rapper Rev. Run. The foundation seeks to bring the artists to urban youth and to provide support for new artists. Question: Whose works are personal? Options: A: Peter Souleo Wright. B: Beau McCall. C: Lisa Kokin.

They have webbed feet\\". The clues provided suggest that aquatic animals, such as beavers, employ webbed feet to navigate through water at a quicker pace. To further elaborate on this, webbed feet essentially entail the presence of a membrane of skin connecting each of the toes. This characteristic is frequently seen in animals that have adapted to living in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. There are several reasons why webbing aids these creatures in their locomotion in water. First, the webbing between the toes of these animals increases the surface area of their feet. When a beaver paddles its feet in the water, the webbed foot can push against a larger amount of water with each stroke as compared to a foot without webbing. This enables the beaver to apply more force onto the water and, therefore, move at a faster speed. Second, the webbed feet of a beaver also provide an additional benefit of better control while swimming. When a beaver lifts its foot, water can pass over the  webbing, thereby reducing drag and allowing the beaver to lift its foot more effortlessly and quickly for the next stroke. This characteristic further aids in the enhanced speed of the beaver in water. In summary, beavers, being primarily aquatic creatures, have developed adaptations such as having webbed feet. These special adaptations enable them to efficiently and swiftly move through water. Hence, the statement \\"They have webbed feet\\" best answers the question of how beavers can move through water quickly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How did brasseries become popular?\\"  Context: \\"In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The popularity of brasseries can be attributed to several factors including their origins, evolution over time, and the unique blend of food, drink, and atmosphere that they offer. 1. Origins of brasseries: Brasseries originated as taverns next to breweries in the 19th century. They served beer and food at any hour to accommodate the needs of factory workers, laborers, and other locals. The convenience of having a place nearby to grab a quick meal and a drink without worrying about strict dining hours attracted many customers. 2. Paris Exposition of 1867: The Paris Exposition of 1867 introduced the brasserie concept to a wider audience. During this time, brasseries featured beer and other beverages served by young women dressed in traditional attire, which created a unique and inviting atmosphere. The mix of cultural elements, such as German costumes serving beer, further enhanced the experience and drew in more patrons. 3. Flexible hours and diverse menu: Unlike traditional restaurants, which often have limited hours and a more formal atmosphere, brasseries offer a more relaxed and casual vibe. They serve food and drinks throughout the day, making them an attractive option for diners with varying schedules. Over time, their menus have diversified, featuring dishes ranging from sandwiches and salads to more elaborate French fare. 4. Meeting place for artists and intellectuals: In the 20th century, brasseries in Paris became popular gathering spots for artists, writers, and philosophers. Establishments such as Café de la Rotonde, Le Dôme Café, Café de Flore, and Les Deux Magots hosted important cultural and political discussions, ultimately becoming a part of Parisian history and lore. This cultural significance further entrenched the popularity of brasseries. 5. Focus on camaraderie and atmosphere: Brasseries emphasize a convivial ambiance, which appeals to a wide range of clientele. The casual environment encourages socialization and conversation, making them an ideal choice for friends and family to gather and enjoy each other's company. 6. Adaptation to modern tastes: Modern brasseries have adapted to the evolving preferences of Parisian diners, incorporating ethnic flavors and ingredients into their menus when necessary. This flexibility has allowed them to remain competitive in the face of increasing competition from other restaurant types. In conclusion, the popularity of brasseries rose through a combination of historical events, unique aspects such as their flexible hours, diverse menus, cultural atmosphere, and their adaptability to modern tastes. Brasseries have not only provided a place for people to enjoy food and drinks but have also acted as a hub for intellectual and cultural exchanges in Paris. This rich history and continued evolution make brasseries an enduring fixture in the Parisian culinary landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.
