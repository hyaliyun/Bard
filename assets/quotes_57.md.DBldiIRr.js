This means that each vertex of the polygon touches the circle. 2. **Tangents from Vertices:**    Draw tangents from each vertex of the polygon to the circle ( Omega ). Let ( A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, A_n ) be the vertices of the polygon. 3. **Equality of Tangents:**    From each vertex ( A_i ), we draw tangents to the circle that touch the circle at points ( T_i ) and ( T_{i+1} ) respectively. Since the tangents from a given point to a circle to the point of tangency are equal, we have:    [    A_iT_i = A_iT_{i+1}    ] 4. **Midpoints of Sides:**    Now consider any two consecutive vertices ( A_{i-1} ) and ( A_i ). The tangents ( A_{i-1}T_i ) and ( A_iT_i ) are equal in length. Because all the sides ( A_iA_{i+1} ) of the polygon are equal, each side of the polygon bisects the angle formed by the two tangents at each vertex. This implies that the points of tangency ( T_i ) are midpoints of the sides ( A_iA_{i+1} ). 5. **Symmetry and Regularity:**    Since the polygon is symmetric about its center ( O ) and has an odd number of sides, the arguments about the tangents and midpoints can be extended to the entire polygon. This symmetry implies that each side is bisected by the radius drawn to the midpoint of every side. Consequently, all angles between consecutive vertices are equal, confirming that each internal angle is the same, adhering to the properties of a regular polygon. 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, for a polygon inscribed in a circle with an odd number of equal sides, the points of tangency are the midpoints of the sides, and by the definition of a regular polygon, it is regular. Thus, we have shown that an inscribed polygon with all sides equal and an odd number of sides is indeed a regular polygon.

Consider ( A' ) as the orthogonal projection of point ( A ) onto the lower base of the cylinder, and ( B' ) as any point on the circumference of the lower base circle. 2. The distance ( AB' ) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the following way:    [    AB'^2 = A'A^2 + A'B'^2    ] 3. Since the length ( A'A ) (the height of the cylinder) does not depend on the position of point ( B' ) on the lower base, the distance ( AB' ) will be maximized when ( A'B' ) is a diameter of the lower base. 4. This means the point ( B ) given in the problem is diametrically opposite to ( A' ), making ( A'B ) the diameter of the lower base circle. Therefore, ( A'B = 2r ). 5. Draw orthogonal projection ( A'C ) of the slant ( AC ) onto the plane of the lower base. Since ( A' ), ( C ), and ( B ) are collinear and point ( B ) is diametrically opposite to ( A' ), the triangle ( ACB ) is a right triangle with the right angle at ( C ). 6.

The general rule for a 90^{circ} clockwise rotation is that the coordinates (x,y) become (y,-x). Applying this rule to point A(-4,1): 1. Swap the x and y coordinates: (-4,1) becomes (1,-4). 2. Change the sign of the original x coordinate: (1,-4) becomes (1,4). Therefore, after rotating point A 90^{circ} clockwise about the origin, the new coordinates are (1,4). This matches the expectation that after a 90^{circ} rotation, the point should move to a position that is perpendicular to its original position relative to the origin. Given that the original slope from the origin to A is -1/4, the perpendicular slope would indeed be 4, which corresponds to moving from the origin to the point (1,4) in Quadrant I, confirming our rotation.

Given the constraints of two odd and two even digits within a specific arrangement (odd units and thousands digits, even tens and hundreds digits), a minimal sum scenario with the units and thousands digits being an odd number results in at least a sum of 18.  1. **Choosing minimal values**: Let's choose the smallest possible odd number for the thousands digit, which is 3, the next eligible odd number ensuring a four-digit value without minimizing below 2000. 2. **Choosing the hundreds and tens digits**: To keep the number low but maintain the requirement, we choose 0 for hundreds and 2 for tens, the smallest even numbers. 3. **Choosing the units digit for sum minimization**: With the digits 3, 0, 2, the remaining digit needs to ensure that the sum of all digits is divisible by 9 and also be an odd number. Calculating the current sum gives me 3 + 0 + 2 = 5. The smallest odd number that can be added to make the sum divisible by 9 is 4. Adding 4 to 5 gives 9, which is divisible by 9. However, 4 is not odd. So, the next suitable odd digit that makes total nine when added to 5 is 13, necessitating the addition of a 4. Thus the units digit should be 5, making the total 10 (not divisible by 9). Thus, we incrementally test odd numbers until sum results divisible by 9: the next odd digit after 5 is 7 (7 + 5 = 12; not divisible by 9). Therefore, the next is 9 (3 + 0 + 2 + 9 = 14), which obviously doesn't work since we need multiple of 9. The next trial would be:     - Thousands: 3     - Hundreds: 0     - Tens: 2     - Units: 1 (as this is the only combination left to make the sum exactly 18 after the trial with 0, 2, 7, 9 which gives 13 and is not perfectly divisible by 9) So the number is 3021, which checks out as 3 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 6 (hence a wrongfully considered because it's not divisible by 9), meaning error in calculation. I need a re-evaluation with correct digit sums to meet the divisible by 9 rule. Adjusting properly, considering a new odd unit digit potential, such as 9 (the last valid check): - Thousands: 3 - Hundreds: 0 - Tens: 4 - Units: 9 Sum: 3+0+4+9=16; hence, still not perfectly correct. Scaling digits: - Thousands: 3 - Hundreds: 6 - Tens: 0 - Units: 9 Sum: 3+6+0+9 = 18.

Since the cooperative pays ( 0.99 ) times the old total price due to the cumulative effect of the increase and discount, we have:    [    N = 0.99 times T_{text{old}}    ] 4. **Determining the Divisibility:**    The (0.99) factor can be represented as:    [    0.99 = frac{99}{100}    ]    Given the cooperative paid (N) rubles, we can write:    [    N = frac{99}{100} times T_{text{old}}    ]        For (N) to be an integer, ( T_{text{old}} ) must be such that (frac{99}{100} times T_{text{old}}) results in an integer. This happens if ( T_{text{old}} ) is multiple of 100. Thus:    [    N = k times 99 quad text{for some integer } k    ]    Therefore, (N) must be divisible by (99). # Conclusion: [ boxed{99} ]"},{"instruction":"A cube with edge length 2 cm is sitting on a flat table along with a sphere of radius 1 cm.

The cube, having an edge length of 2 cm, has a face diagonal of 2sqrt{2} cm (since the diagonal of a square is asqrt{2} for side a). When the cube rolls, it rotates about one edge. Since the sphere and the cube start at the same height, their centers move in parallel paths. The sphere, with radius 1 cm, rolls without slipping, completing a full rotation after traveling along the circumference of 2pi times text{radius} = 2pi cm.  For the cube: - Dot D is at the center of the cube top face, initially 2 cm above the table. - Each complete revolution of the cube corresponds to rolling along one edge until returning to the starting orientation, tracing one full circle around the edge it rotates about. - Each edge acts as a rotation axis. Thus, the distance D travels is along a circle with radius equal to half of the face diagonal of the cube, which is sqrt{2} cm. - The total distance the dot travels is the circumference of this circle: 2pi times sqrt{2} cm.

Part (a) 1. Let's start by expanding both sides using the power series definition of the exponential function. Recall that the exponential function (operatorname{Exp}(z)) can be expressed as:    [    operatorname{Exp}(z) = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{z^n}{n!}    ] 2. Consider (operatorname{Exp}((a+b)x)):    [    operatorname{Exp}((a+b)x) = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{((a+b)x)^n}{n!}    = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{(a+b)^n x^n}{n!}    ] 3.

Thus, we find that a+b=1. So, we have boxed{a+b=1}.  Part (2): To prove frac{1}{a}+frac{4}{b}+frac{4}{{({3a+1})b}}geqslant 12, we follow these steps: 1. Start with the left side of the inequality: frac{1}{a}+frac{4}{b}. 2. Multiply by (a+b), which we found to be 1 in part (1), to get: (frac{1}{a}+frac{4}{b})(a+b)=5+frac{b}{a}+frac{4a}{b}. 3. By the AM-GM inequality, for positive a and b, frac{b}{a}+frac{4a}{b}geqslant 2sqrt{frac{b}{a}cdotfrac{4a}{b}}=2sqrt{4}=4. Adding 5 to both sides, we get 5+frac{b}{a}+frac{4a}{b}geqslant 9. 4. For the term frac{4}{{({3a+1})b}}, we simplify it to frac{12}{{(3a+1)3b}} and apply the AM-GM inequality again: frac{12}{{(3a+1)3b}}geqslant 12left({frac{2}{{3a+3b+1}}}right)^2=3, where the equality holds for a=frac{1}{3} and b=frac{2}{3}. 5. Adding the inequalities, we get frac{1}{a}+frac{4}{b}+frac{4}{{({3a+1})b}}geqslant 9+3=12. Therefore, we have proven that boxed{frac{1}{a}+frac{4}{b}+frac{4}{{({3a+1})b}}geqslant 12}."},{"instruction":"A belt is fitted without slack around two circular pulleys with radii of 10 inches and 6 inches.

What is the minimum number of buttons that need to be bought in order to sew them in a row such that for any two different colors in the row, there are two adjacent buttons of those colors?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:      We need to determine the minimum number of buttons of six different colors such that in any sequence of these buttons, each pair of different colors has at least one instance where two adjacent buttons are of these two colors. 2. **Establishing the Conditions**:      Let's denote the six different colors as ( A, B, C, D, E, F ). For any given color ( A ), there must be adjacent pairs ( (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (A, F) ). Each color must satisfy this condition with all other colors. 3. **Minimum Number of Buttons Calculation**:      - Each button can have at most 2 adjacent buttons in a sequence.    - For a fixed color ( A ), to meet the requirement of being adjacent to each of the other 5 colors, ( A ) must appear at least 3 times (since each pair ( (A, X) ) will have 2 neighbors around one instance of ( A ); hence 3 instances cover all pairs without overlap). 4. **Generalizing for All Colors**:      Each of the six colors ( A, B, C, D, E, F ) must appear at least 3 times. Thus, the total number of buttons necessary is:     [     text{Total Number} = 3 times 6 = 18     ] 5. **Example Sequence Construction**:      A sequence of 18 buttons that fulfills the condition can be constructed.

Since the motion is relative, we can consider the hula hoop to be stationary and the girl to be moving inside it. 2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Square:**    The problem asks us to show that a point on the hula hoop that was initially in contact with the waist travels a distance equal to the perimeter of a square circumscribing the waist. The perimeter ( P ) of such a square, whose side length is equal to the diameter of the waist (( frac{D}{2} )), is:    [    P = 4 times frac{D}{2} = 2D    ] 3. **Considering the Relative Motion:**    In this stationary frame of reference of the hula hoop, the point of initial contact on the hula hoop (let's call this point (C)) will move as the girl completes one full rotation inside the hoop.

Through detailed analysis, it has been found that: [ x = frac{a-1 pm sqrt{a^{2}-6a-3}}{2}. ] For (x) to be an integer, the discriminant (Delta) must be a perfect square.

To understand this better, let's revise the form of the equation into a standard hyperbola equation: 1. First, we observe that for the curve to represent a conic section (ellipse or hyperbola), the coefficients of x^2 and y^2 need to be of the same sign for an ellipse or of opposite signs for a hyperbola. For our equation, the denominator of the x^2 term is positive, while the denominator of the y^2 term is negative, suggesting opposite signs and confirming that it must be a hyperbola. 2. To further classify this hyperbola, we consider the denominators of the squared terms. The standard equation for a hyperbola centered at the origin with its transverse axis (the axis along the foci) along the x-axis is given by:     frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1     In this case, since the x^2 term has a positive coefficient and the y^2 term has a negative coefficient, the hyperbola opens along the x-axis. This implies that the foci of the hyperbola are located on the x-axis. 3. Next, let's recognize that for a hyperbola with foci on the x-axis, the term associated with x^2 is positive, and the term with the y^2 is negative, matching what we have in our problem.

So, the discounted price of the computer is 400 - 40 = 360. Now, we need to add the sales tax for the computer, which is 8%. Sales tax for the computer = 8/100 * 360 = 28.80. The final price of the computer after the discount and adding the sales tax is 360 + 28.80 = 388.80. Next, the printer: The price of the printer is 40. The sales tax for the printer is 5%.

Let F(x) = f(x) - 1, then we get F(-x) = -F(x), which means F(x) is an odd function.

Since when x > 0, f(x) > 1, we get x > 0 implies F(x) = f(x) - 1 > 0, Therefore, from x_1 - x_2 > 0, we get F(x_1 - x_2) > 0, which means F(x_1) > F(x_2). Thus, F(x) = f(x) - 1 is an increasing function on mathbb{R}, and hence the function y = f(x) is also an increasing function on mathbb{R}. Since f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) + f(x_2) - 1, and f(4) = 5, f(4) = f(2) + f(2) - 1 = 5, we get f(2) = 3. Therefore, the inequality f(3m - 2) < 3 becomes f(3m - 2) < f(2), which gives 3m - 2 < 2.

Thus, ( b neq 5 ).    - For ( b = 6 ):      [      frac{2}{5} < frac{a}{6} < frac{1}{2} implies 0.4 < frac{a}{6} < 0.5      ]      Similarly, for any integer ( a ), ( frac{a}{6} ) cannot strictly lie between 0.4 and 0.5. Thus, ( b neq 6 ).    - For ( b = 7 ):      [      frac{2}{5} < frac{a}{7} < frac{1}{2} implies 0.4 < frac{a}{7} < 0.5      ]      Testing integer values for ( a ):      [      a = 3: quad frac{3}{7} approx 0.4286 quad (text{fits: } 0.4 < 0.4286 < 0.5 )      ]      Thus, for ( b = 7 ), there exists a natural number ( a = 3 ) which satisfies the inequality ( frac{2}{5} < frac{a}{b} < frac{1}{2} ). 5. **Conclude the Solution:**    The smallest natural number ( b ) that satisfies the condition is ( 7 ).

So, we have boxed{y = -2x + 100}. (3) To maximize profit, we let the profit function W be defined as the product of the profit per item (x - 20) and the sales volume y, which follows the relationship y = -2x + 100.

Let ( r ) be the rate (in meters per hour) at which one person digs. Hence, the equation becomes: [ 5 times r times t = 10 ] 6.

Therefore, in ( t ) hours, the six members together would dig: [ 6 times (r times t) = 6 times 2 = 12 text{ meters} ] 8. We know the entire trench is completed after the sixth person has worked ( t ) hours, meaning the total time taken by the team to dig the full 40 meters is ( 6t ). 9.

Therefore, the total distance they could dig working together in ( t ) hours would be: [ 6 times 2 = 12 text{ meters} ] 15.

To find out how long it takes to fill the remaining half at the combined rate, we divide the remaining volume (half the tank, or ( frac{1}{2} )) by the combined rate: Time to fill the remaining half = ( frac{1/2}{32/1250} ) = ( frac{1250}{64} ) = ( 19.53125 ) minutes.

Since A > B, it follows that sin A > sin B. Therefore, we can conclude that option A is correct because sin A > sin B holds true. 2. **For option B**: The cosine function decreases as the angle increases from 0^circ to 180^circ. Given A > B, it implies that cos A < cos B. This confirms that option B is also correct due to the nature of the cosine function. 3. **For option C**: The function sin 2A = 2sin A cos A and sin 2B = 2sin B cos B. If we consider the possibility of angle A being obtuse, this could potentially make sin 2A < sin 2B, since the sine function for double angles involves both sine and cosine values of the original angles. Without loss of generality, for acute angles, given A > B, normally, we would expect sin 2A > sin 2B due to the direct relationship in the product of sin and cos of the same angle.

We need to find the minimum possible sum of the products of the numbers in each column. 2. **Using AM-GM Inequality:**    The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n),    [    frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 cdots a_n}    ]    with equality if and only if (a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n). 3. **Applying AM-GM to the Problem:**    Let (P_i) be the product of the numbers in the (i)-th column. We need to minimize the sum (S = P_1 + P_2 + cdots + P_8).    Since each row is a permutation of (1, 2, ldots, 8), the product of all numbers in each row is (8!).

Since the integral of sin t is -cos t and the integral of cos t is sin t, the expression for m is:  m = -cos t + sin t + C,  where C is the integration constant. Now, let's expand the binomial (m - x)^6 using the Binomial Theorem, which states that:  (m-x)^6 = sum_{r=0}^{6} binom{6}{r} m^{6-r} (-x)^r.  To find the coefficient of the x^2 term, we need to identify the term where the power of x is 2, which corresponds to r = 2:  [x^2] rightarrow binom{6}{2} m^{6-2} (-x)^2 = binom{6}{2} m^4 x^2.  The binomial coefficient binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!}=15. Since m^4 will not affect the coefficient of x^2, we can write the coefficient of the x^2 term as:  [text{Coefficient of } x^2] = 15 cdot m^4.  However, since we don't need the specific form of m for this calculation (given that m^4 does not involve x), we only need to consider the numerical coefficient. Thus, the coefficient of x^2 is boxed{15}. To find the sum of the coefficients, we set x = 1 in the expansion (m - x)^6, which eliminates all powers of x. The sum of the coefficients of the expansion is simply the value of the expression evaluated at m = 1:  (m-1)^6|_{m=1} = (1 - 1)^6 = 0^6 = 0.  However, this result is not correct since the function for m must include the integration constant C. If no limits of integration are given, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. But, under normal circumstances when calculating the sum of coefficients, we disregard any variables not associated with x and consider the case where x=0. Hence, the correct sum of the coefficients is obtained by evaluating (m - x)^6 at x=0, yielding:  (m - 0)^6 = m^6.  Since m has an added integration constant C, m^6 would be some constant value raised to the 6th power (which we have yet to determine). Nevertheless, to gain insight into the sum of the coefficients independently from the variable m, we can use the concept that the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is equal to (1 + 1)^n when setting x = 1. Thus, for (m - x)^6, it would be:  (1 - 1)^6 = 0^6 = 0,  However, this is only correct when not taking into consideration the constant value C. To avoid confusion and without a specific numeric value for m, the sum of the coefficients is better described as the sum of the terms when x=0, which is equal to m^6.

From these, (k) quadrilaterals are chosen such that any two chosen quadrilaterals are separated by at least one line from the first series and at least one line from the second series. Prove that the sum of the areas of the chosen quadrilaterals is equal to (frac{1}{k} S_{ABCD}).","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**    We are given a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) with its sides divided into (k) equal parts. The division points on side (AB) are connected to the corresponding division points on side (CD), and similarly for sides (BC) and (DA). As a result, the quadrilateral is subdivided into (k^2) smaller quadrilaterals.     We need to show that the sum of the areas of any selected (k) quadrilaterals, such that every pair of selected quadrilaterals is separated by at least one line from the first series and one line from the second series, equals (frac{1}{k} S_{ABCD}), where (S_{ABCD}) is the area of quadrilateral (ABCD). 2. **Key Observations**    - Each segment in the first series divides each segment in the second series into (k) equal parts. This follows immediately from problem 56471.    - The areas of the quadrilaterals in one row formed between two consecutive lines from the first series form an arithmetic progression (for (k > 2)). The differences in these progressions are the same, according to problem 55130. 3. **Decomposing the Problem**    Let’s prove that the sum of the areas of any such selection of (k) quadrilaterals in a grid (k times k) is (frac{1}{k}) the area of the entire quadrilateral by leveraging the structure and arithmetic progression properties:    - Consider all rows of the quadrilateral grid. Each row contains (k) quadrilaterals.    - We can denote the area of the quadrilaterals in one row by (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k). These areas form an arithmetic progression:      [      a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = cdots = d      ]    - The sum of the areas in each row is an arithmetic series:       [      sum_{i=1}^k a_i = a_1 + (a_1+d) + (a_1+2d) + cdots + (a_1+(k-1)d)      ]      Simplifying, we get:      [      sum_{i=1}^k a_i = k a_1 + d(0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (k-1)) = k a_1 + d frac{(k-1)k}{2}      ]      For different rows, the progression’s first term might differ, but the sequence remains arithmetically structured. 4. **Choosing Quadrilaterals**    - When selecting (k) quadrilaterals from the (k times k) grid such that no two selected quadrilaterals are in the same row or column, we effectively pick one quadrilateral per row and column.    - The sum of (k) quadrilaterals’ areas selected in one such manner will be:      [      sum_{i=1}^k a_i = frac{1}{k} ( text{sum of areas of all quadrilaterals in the entire grid} )      ] 5. **Generalizing to Arbitrary (k)**    - Considering all subdivided (k^2) quadrilaterals in the grid, the total area is (S_{ABCD}).     - Each selection of (k) quadrilaterals, with one from each row and column, maintains the arithmetic structure and hence the sum of their areas is:            [      frac{1}{k} sum_{j=1}^k sum_{i=1}^k a_{ij}      ] 6. **Conclusion**    By the observations and properties of arithmetic progressions formed by the subdivisions, it’s shown that such a selected sum of areas from (k) quadrilaterals indeed equals (frac{1}{k} S_{ABCD}). [ boxed{ frac{1}{k} S_{ABCD} } ] Thus, we have rigorously proven that the sum of the areas of the selected (k) quadrilaterals is indeed (frac{1}{k} S_{ABCD})."},{"instruction":"75 × ? + ( 18 + 12 ) × 6 / 4  11 × 8 = 2734","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step.

According to the problem, the integer formed by deleting 6 is ( frac{1}{25} ) of the original integer:    [    a = frac{1}{25} n    ] 3. Substitute ( n ) from the first equation into the second equation:    [    a = frac{1}{25} (6 times 10^k + a)    ] 4.

Divide both sides by 24:    [    a = frac{6 times 10^k}{24} = frac{10^k}{4}    ] 7. Since ( a ) must be an integer, ( 10^k ) must be divisible by 4. This implies ( k geq 2 ) because ( 10^k ) is divisible by 4 only if ( k geq 2 ). 8. Let ( 10^k = 4m ), where ( m ) is an integer. Then:    [    a = m    ] 9. Substitute ( a = m ) back into the expression for ( n ):    [    n = 6 times 10^k + m    ] 10. Since ( 10^k = 4m ), we have:     [     n = 6 times 4m + m = 25m     ] 11. Therefore, ( m = 10^k / 4 ) and ( n = 25 times 10^m ). For ( m ) to be a nonnegative integer, ( k ) must be a multiple of 2. Hence, ( m ) can be any nonnegative integer. 12. The general form of ( n ) is:     [     n = 625 times 10^m     ] # Part (b) 1. Let the original number be ( n ) and the number after deleting the first digit be ( a ). We can express ( n ) as:    [    n = d times 10^k + a    ]    where ( d ) is the first digit and ( k ) is the number of digits in ( a ). 2. According to the problem, the integer formed by deleting the first digit is ( frac{1}{35} ) of the original integer:    [    a = frac{1}{35} n    ] 3. Substitute ( n ) from the first equation into the second equation:    [    a = frac{1}{35} (d times 10^k + a)    ] 4. Multiply both sides by 35 to clear the fraction:    [    35a = d times 10^k + a    ] 5. Subtract ( a ) from both sides:    [    34a = d times 10^k    ] 6.

However, ( 10^k ) is only divisible by 2 and 5, and ( d ) is a single digit (1 through 9). Therefore, ( d times 10^k ) cannot be divisible by 34 because 34 has a prime factor of 17, which is not a factor of ( 10^k ). 8.

We are informed that when an attempt is made to type a specific sequence containing ten digits, only seven digits were registered. Therefore, three digits are missing. 3. This implies that a defective key was pressed at least five times, but the first, third, and fifth presses did not result in the desired digit, while at least the second and fourth presses were successful. 4. Observing this, we note that there could be two digits that were each pressed at least twice and failed at least one other time. 5. Therefore, the missing digits must align with those that were frequently attempted but did not always register. From the problem's context, these digits are noticeably the ones appearing multiple times. 6. Cross-referencing the available information, we find that the digits '7' and '9' appear on such occasions. 7. For example, if we attempt to type the number (7774779189 ):    - We notice that '7' should appear more than once and could be a candidate for the defective key as it appears thrice where it might have failed. 8.

If these two objects indeed existed in the same reality and interacted, it would result in a paradox. 3. **Logical Contradiction Explained:**     - If the all-destroying cannonball hits the indestructible pillar:         - The cannonball should destroy the pillar, contradicting the pillar's indestructibility.         - The pillar should withstand the impact, contradicting the cannonball's capability to destroy anything.     - Therefore, these two objects cannot coexist in the same logical framework. 4. **Conclusion Based on the Contradiction:**     - The existence of an all-destroying cannonball implies there cannot be an indestructible pillar and vice versa.     - The simultaneous existence of both is impossible due to the inherent logical contradiction.

For (F) to lie on (AI), the coordinates of (F) must satisfy the ratio:    [    frac{-cb(a+c)}{-cb(a+b)} = frac{b}{c}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{a+c}{a+b} = frac{b}{c}    ]    Cross-multiplying, we obtain:    [    ac + c^2 = ab + b^2    ]    Rearranging, we get:    [    a(c - b) = -(b + c)(c - b)    ]    Since (c neq b), we can divide both sides by (c - b):    [    a = -(b + c)    ]    This leads to a contradiction unless (b = c). 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, if (A), (F), and (I) are collinear, it must be that (b = c), implying (AB = AC).

Alice's goal is to move the red bead to the point ( B ). Find all rational numbers ( r > 1 ) such that Alice can reach her goal in at most 2021 moves.","output":"To find all rational numbers ( r > 1 ) such that Alice can move the red bead from point ( R ) to point ( B ) in at most 2021 moves, we can follow these steps: 1. **Define Coordinates and Distance:**    - Set up the coordinate system so that ( R = 0 ) and ( B = 1 ). This way, the location of the red bead ((mathcal{R})) and the blue bead ((mathcal{B})) can be identified by their coordinates.    - The initial distance between (mathcal{R}) and (mathcal{B}) is (left| 1 - 0 right| = 1). 2. **Form of Distance:**    - During the game, the distance between the beads will always be ( r^{ell} ) where (ell) is an integer, because each move scales the distance by a factor of (r^k).    - Denote the distance after the ( m^{text{th}} ) move as ( d_m = r^{alpha_m} ) with (alpha_0 = 0) since the initial distance is ( 1 = r^0 ). 3. **Alternating Moves and Total Moves:**    - Alice can alternate moves between (mathcal{R}) and (mathcal{B}) without loss of generality to potentially minimize the number of moves.    - Assume (mathcal{R}) is shifted ( t ) times and total number of moves is at most 2021. 4. **Equations for Coordinates:**    - After each pair of alternating moves, let's say (mathcal{R}) and then (mathcal{B}):      [      sum_{i=0}^{t-1} left( d_{2i} - d_{2i+1} right) = 1 quad text{or} quad sum_{i=0}^{t-1} left( d_{2i-1} - d_{2i} right) = 1.      ]    - Summarizing and generalizing, we get:      [      sum_{i=1}^{n} r^{beta_i} = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r^{gamma_i} quad text{for some integers} quad beta_i, gamma_i in mathbb{Z}      ]      with ( n leq 1011 ). 5. **Solving the Rational Equation:**    - Assume ( r = frac{a}{b} ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime integers (i.e., (gcd(a,b)=1)).    - Multiply the generalized equation by ( b^N ):      [      sum_{i=1}^{2n-1} (-1)^{i} a^{mu_i} b^{N-mu_i} = 0      ]      for some ( N geq 0 ) and some (mu_i in {0, 1, ldots, N}). 6. **Modular Reduction:**    - By reducing modulo ( (a-b) ):      [      0 = sum_{i=1}^{2n-1} (-1)^{i} b^N equiv -b^N pmod{a-b},      ]      which implies ( a - b = 1 ) because (gcd(b,N) = 1).    - By reducing modulo ( (a+b) ):      [      0 = sum_{i=1}^{2n-1} (-1)^i (-b^N) equiv (-1)^S b^N pmod{a+b},      ]      where (S) is an odd integer, meaning ((a+b) mid S).

If both (m) and (n) are odd, then the total number of unit squares (m times n) is odd.  4. **Sum of Adjacencies:**    If we sum the number of same-colored adjacent squares for all unit squares, each adjacency is counted twice (once for each square in the pair). Therefore, the total sum must be even. 5. **Contradiction for Odd (m) and (n):**    If both (m) and (n) are odd, the total number of unit squares is odd, and thus the sum of the number of same-colored adjacent squares (including itself) for all squares would be odd, which contradicts the requirement that this sum must be even. Therefore, at least one of (m) or (n) must be even. 6. **Constructing the Coloring:**    Without loss of generality, assume (m) is even. We can construct a valid coloring by alternating rows of black and white squares. For example:    - Rows (A_1) and (A_2) are all black.    - Rows (A_3) and (A_4) are all white.    - Rows (A_5) and (A_6) are all black.    - Continue this pattern.

We know that the ellipse passes through the point D(1, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and has an eccentricity e = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.  - From the point D(1, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), we can write the equation frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{2b^2} = 1. This comes from substituting the coordinates of D into the general equation of the ellipse frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. - Given the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we can relate a, b, and c through the ellipse's eccentricity formula and the Pythagorean relation a^2 = b^2 + c^2. - Solving these equations, we find a^2 = 2 and b^2 = 1. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1. - The foci of the ellipse, given a^2 = 2 and b^2 = 1, are located at F_1(-1, 0) and F_2(1, 0). Next, we find the equation of the line QF_2. Since PF_1 parallel QF_2, we can assume their equations have the same slope m. Thus, the equation of PF_1 is x + 1 = my and for QF_2 it is x - 1 = my.  - For a point P(x_1, y_1) on the ellipse, substituting the equation of PF_1 into the ellipse's equation, we get a quadratic equation in y_1: ({m^2} + 2)y_1^2 - 2my_1 - 1 = 0. Solving this for y_1, we find y_1 = frac{m + sqrt{2m^2 + 2}}{m^2 + 2}. - The length |PF_1| can be found using the distance formula, leading to |PF_1| = frac{sqrt{2}(m^2 + 1) + msqrt{m^2 + 1}}{m^2 + 2}. - Similarly, for |QF_2|, we find |QF_2| = frac{sqrt{2}(m^2 + 1) - msqrt{m^2 + 1}}{m^2 + 2}. - Given |PF_1| + |QF_2| = 2, we solve for m and find m^2 = sqrt{2}.

The table shows the total sales and the number selected from each city. The total sales for cities A, B, and C are 420, 280, and 700, respectively. First, we need to determine the ratio of the total sales for each city. The total sales can be simplified to a ratio by dividing each city's total sales by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which in this case is 140. Therefore, the simplified ratio of the total sales for cities A, B, and C is 420:280:700 = 3:2:5. Given the proportional allocation, the number of cars selected from each city should be in the same ratio as their total sales. The problem provides the number of cars selected from city B as 20, and we need to find the numbers selected from cities A (denoted as m) and C (denoted as n). Using the ratio 3:2:5, we can set up proportions to find m and n. Since the ratio of the number of cars selected from city B is 2 parts of the total ratio, and is given as 20, we can find the value of each part in the ratio as 20/2 = 10.  Therefore, for city A, which is 3 parts of the total ratio, the number of cars selected is 3 times 10 = 30. So, m = 30. For city C, which is 5 parts of the total ratio, the number of cars selected is 5 times 10 = 50. So, n = 50.

The gain is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, so: Gain = S2 - C2 Gain = Rs. 228.0805 - Rs. 191.67 Gain = Rs. 36.4105 The gain percentage (G%) is calculated as: G% = (Gain / C2) * 100 G% = (Rs. 36.4105 / Rs. 191.67) * 100 G% = 0.190005 * 100 G% = 19.0005% Therefore, the gain percentage on the second book is approximately boxed{19.0005%} ."},{"instruction":"Given that F is the focus of the parabola C: y^{2}=4x, A(x_{1}, y_{1}), B(x_{2}, y_{2}) are two points on C, O is the origin, M is a point on the positive xaxis, a perpendicular line is drawn from B to the directrix of C with the foot of the perpendicular being B_{1}, and E is the midpoint of AB.

Given that B lies on the parabola, we can deduce |y_{2}|=2. 4. The coordinates of B_{1} become B_{1}(-1, y_{2}). 5. The distance |OB_{1}| can be calculated as |OB_{1}|=sqrt{1+y_{2}^{2}}=sqrt{1+4}=sqrt{5}. 6. Therefore, the perimeter of quadrilateral OFBB_{1} is calculated as sqrt{5}+1+2times2=5+sqrt{5}. Hence, option A is incorrect because the perimeter is 5+sqrt{5}, not 3+sqrt{5}.  Option B Analysis: 1. For |AF|=3, we have 1+x_{1}=3, which implies x_{1}=2. 2.

First, consider the digits of the numbers ( X ) and ( Y ). Since ( Y ) is obtained from ( X ) by permuting its digits, they have the same set of digits. 2. The problem requires that the sum ( X + Y = 999...999 ) (with 1111 nines). This means every pair of corresponding digits in ( X ) and ( Y ) must sum to 9 because no carries over to the next place value. 3. To illustrate this, let’s take the unit place of ( X ) and ( Y ). Suppose the last digit of ( X ) is ( x ) and the last digit of ( Y ) is ( y ). Then, ( x + y = 9 ). 4. Next, consider the second to last digits of ( X ) and ( Y ). Similarly, these must sum to 9 because no carry over takes place. Let’s denote the second to last digit of ( X ) as ( x_1 ) and the second to last digit of ( Y ) as ( y_1 ). Hence, ( x_1 + y_1 = 9 ). 5. Continue this reasoning through each place value in ( X ) and ( Y ). We can generalize this for any digit. Thus, for each place value, any digit ( a ) in ( X ) has a corresponding digit ( b ) in ( Y ) such that ( a + b = 9 ). 6. This implies that for each digit ( a ) in ( X ), there must be exactly one digit ( 9 - a ) in ( Y ) to complete the sum to 9 in every position. 7. Now, consider the total number of digits in ( X ). Given that ( X ) and ( Y ) have digits that pair up to sum to 9, the numbers of each digit ( a ) and its complement ( 9 - a ) must be equal. This forms pairs—an even number of digits. 8. However, the problem specifies that the total number of digits in ( 999...999 ) is 1111, an odd number of nines. Therefore, ( X ) would need to have an odd number of digits. 9. This requirement for an odd number of digits in total contradicts our earlier conclusion that the sum to 9 in each position would necessitate an even number of digits in ( X ).  Conclusion: It is impossible to form two natural numbers ( X ) and ( Y ) such that ( Y ) is a permutation of ( X ) and their sum equals ( 999...999 ) with 1111 nines. This contradiction finishes our proof. [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"We remove the square numbers from the sequence of natural numbers.

Computation of lengths and angles:     - CP = frac{ab}{b+c} and CQ = frac{ab}{a+c}.     - angle OCQ = frac{pi}{2} - beta and angle OCP = frac{pi}{2} - alpha.     - CD = b cdot cos(gamma) and CE = a cos(gamma).     - CI = frac{r}{sin(frac{gamma}{2})}.     - angle OCI = angle ICF = frac{pi}{2} - beta - frac{gamma}{2} or frac{gamma}{2} + alpha - frac{pi}{2}.     - angle OCF = pi - 2beta - gamma or gamma + 2alpha - pi. We then examine triangles triangle PCQ, triangle DCE, and triangle OCF using trigonometric identities:     2. **Testing for points P, O, Q collinear:** [ frac{sin gamma}{OC} = frac{sin angle OCP}{CQ} + frac{sin angle OCQ}{CP} ] Substituting the known values: [ ab cdot sin gamma = R[(a+c) cdot cos alpha + (b+c) cdot cos beta] ] Using the trigonometric identity: [ 4R^2 cdot sin alpha cdot sin beta cdot sin gamma = R^2[sin 2alpha +  sin 2beta + 2 sin gamma(cos alpha + cos beta)] ] Thus: [ sin 2 gamma = 2 sin gamma (cos alpha + cos beta) implies cos gamma = cos alpha + cos beta. ] 3. **Testing for points D, I, E collinear:** [ frac{sin gamma}{CI} = frac{sin frac{gamma}{2}}{CD} + frac{sin frac{gamma}{2}}{CE} ] Substituting known values and solving: [ ab cdot sin gamma cdot cos gamma = r(a+b) implies r(a+b+c) cdot cos gamma = r(a+b). ] Further simplifying: [ (sin alpha + sin beta)(1 - cos gamma) = sin gamma cdot cos gamma ] Breaking down: [ 2 cos frac{gamma}{2} cdot cos frac{alpha - beta}{2} cdot 2 sin^2 frac{gamma}{2} = sin gamma cdot cos gamma ] So: [ 2 sin frac{gamma}{2} cdot cos frac{alpha - beta}{2} = cos gamma implies cos gamma = cos alpha + cos beta. ] 4. **Testing for points O, I, F collinear:** [ frac{sin angle OCF}{CI} = frac{sin angle OCI}{CF} + frac{sin angle ICF}{CO} ] From the previous calculations and trigonometric identities, we derive: [ sin(2 beta + gamma) = cos left(beta + frac{gamma}{2}right)+ ldots  ] Simplifications lead to: [ 4 sin left(beta + frac{gamma}{2}right) cdot cos frac{alpha}{2} cdot cos frac{beta}{2} = 1 + 2 sin alpha cdot sin beta, ] So: [ cos gamma = cos alpha + cos beta. ] Concluding, we have: D, I, E text{ are collinear} iff P, O, Q text{ are collinear} iff O, I, F text{ are collinear}.   Case II: When alpha is an obtuse angle. The procedures are similar to the acute angle case, involving similar trigonometric identities and relations and eventually arriving at the same conclusion.  Case III: When alpha is a right angle. Points D, I, E are collinear if and only if triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle; also for P, O, Q and O, I, F collinearity, we must have triangle ABC as an isosceles right.

Show this fact.","output":"1. **Initial Considerations**:     - We start by analyzing a sequence of eighteen consecutive three-digit numbers.      - For example, consider the sequence ( a, a+1, a+2, ldots, a+17 ). 2. **Multiples of 9 in the Sequence**:     - Among any eighteen consecutive numbers, we observe that there are at least two multiples of 9. This is a consequence of the pigeonhole principle.    3. **Properties of Multiples of 9**:     - For any multiple of 9, the sum of its digits is also a multiple of 9. This follows from the divisibility rule for 9. 4. **Identifying Three-Digit Multiples of 9**:     - Let's identify two possible values for the sum of the digits of a three-digit number:         - If the sum of the digits is either 9, 18, or 27 since these are the only multiples of 9 within the range from 1 to 27. 5. **Case Analysis of Sequences**:     - We will analyze different possible sequences to demonstrate the claim. 6. **Case (i) Sum of digits 9 and 9**:     - Consider the sequence of consecutive numbers including 144, where (1 + 4 + 4 = 9).     - The two consecutive multiples of 9 in this sequence can be:       - Numbers: 135, 144, 153.       - These sequences ensure (135 = 144 - 9) and (153 = 144 + 9) while 144 is divisible by 9. 7. **Case (ii) Sum of digits 9 and 18**:     - Suppose one of the numbers is 900, where (9 + 0 + 0 = 9), another multiple could be 891 or 909:       - These numbers ensure:         - Sequence includes numbers such as 891, 900, 909.         - These numbers provide that 900 (sum = 9) and 891 or 909 (sum = 18). 8. **Case (iii) Sum of digits 18 and 18**:     - Suppose one of the numbers is 828, with its digit sum (8 + 2 + 8 = 18):       - The sequence could include numbers such as 819 (sum = 18) or 837 (sum = 18). 9. **Case (iv) Sum of digits 18 and 27**:     - Suppose one of the numbers is 999, with its digit sum ( 9 + 9 + 9 = 27):       - Then, 999 ensures an inclusion within a sequence of eighteen numbers. 10. **Verification of Divisibility**:     - In cases (i) and (ii):       - A multiple of 9 which has sum of digits as 9 or 18 will satisfy divisibility.     - In case (iii):       - With both sums as 18, ensuring one of these multiples is even, making it divisible by their digit-sum.     - In case (iv):       - The number 999 is divisible by 27. **Conclusion**: - After analyzing each case, we conclude that there always exists at least one number in any sequence of eighteen consecutive three-digit numbers that is divisible by the sum of its digits. Hence, the problem's claim is valid and illustrated.    - (boxed{text{One number is always divisible by the sum of its digits within any 18 consecutive three-digit numbers}})."},{"instruction":"A quadrilateral is inscribed in a rectangle such that each vertex of the quadrilateral lies on each side of the rectangle. Prove that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is at least twice the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Symmetries:**    To solve this problem, we use transformations. We perform three axial symmetries successively:     - First, with respect to the line ( BC ),    - Second, with respect to the line ( CD ),    - Third, with respect to a line ( A_1D_1 ), where ( A_1D_1 ) is the image of line ( AD ) after the first symmetry (see the accompanying diagram in the given reference). 2. **Understanding the Result of Symmetries:**    After these three transformations, the images of the sides of the quadrilateral ( KLMN ) will form a four-segment broken line ( KLM_1N_2K_3 ). The endpoints ( K ) and ( K_3 ) of this broken line are connected by a segment ( KK_3 ). 3. **Length of Segment ( KK_3 ):**    The length of segment ( KK_3 ) is actually the twice the length of the diagonal of rectangle ( ABCD ). This is because each axial symmetry essentially reflects the figure across the specified axis, doubling the distance between the points of interest. 4. **Perimeter Consideration:**    In geometry, the perimeter of a quadrilateral inscribed in a rectangle formed in this manner is essentially the sum of the lengths of its sides. Given the broken line construction of ( KLM_1N_2K_3 ):    [    text{Perimeter of quadrilateral } KLMN = |KL| + |LM_1| + |M_1N_2| + |N_2K_3|     ]    Since these segments combine to span twice the distance of the diagonal within the rectangular boundary through symmetry, the sum effectively measures the perimeter in fragmented steps. 5. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, we conclude that the perimeter of the original quadrilateral ( KLMN ) is at least twice the length of the diagonal of the rectangle ( ABCD ). This is ensured by the reflections, making sure the covering distance includes the two diagonals accounting per geometric transformations:    [    text{Perimeter} (KLMN) geq 2 times text{Diagonal length of rectangle } ABCD    ] Thus, this geometric transformation and reflection process shows that the perimeter of the quadrilateral cannot be less than twice the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.

Prove that the triangle AFG is isosceles.","output":"1. **Identify Properties of the Trapezoid and Triangles**:    - Since ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid with AB parallel CD, it follows that AD = BC.    - The trapezoid ABCD is cyclic because opposite angles sum to 180^circ. 2. **Reflective Symmetry**:    - Consider the reflection of triangle BCD over the line perpendicular to AB and passing through the midpoint of CD. This reflection maps BCD to ADC.    - Let the incircle of triangle BCD touch CD at E. If K is the point where the incircle of triangle ADC touches DC, then by symmetry, DK = CE. 3. **Properties of the Excircle**:    - The reflection property implies that the excircle of triangle ADC is tangent to DC at E.    - Since EF perp CD and E is the point of tangency of the excircle with CD, EF must pass through the center of the excircle of triangle ADC. 4. **Location of Point F**:    - The center of the excircle lies on the angle bisector of angle DAC and the line perpendicular to CD through E. Therefore, F is the center of the excircle of triangle ADC. 5. **Angles in Triangle ACF and AFG**:    - Since F is on the angle bisector of angle DAC, angle DFA = angle DFA = 90^circ.    - The circle circumscribed around triangle ACF meets line CD at C and G. Thus, ACFG is cyclic.    - In cyclic quadrilateral ACFG, angle AGF = angle ACF. 6. **Calculating Angles**:    - angle ACF = 90^circ + frac{angle DAC}{2} because F is the center of the excircle, making angle ACF a right angle plus half the angle at A.    - angle AGF = 90^circ - frac{angle ACD}{2} because of the cyclic nature of ACFG and the exterior angle theorem. 7. **Proving AFG is Isosceles**:    - Since angle FAG = angle AGF (as calculated from the cyclic properties and angle bisector theorem), triangle AFG is isosceles.

Let's break down the problem into two parts: # Part (a): Number of triangle-friendly sequences with 2012 letters 1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - A sequence is triangle-friendly if it starts and ends with the letter ( C ).    - Each letter in the sequence must be adjacent to the previous letter in terms of the triangles' shared edges. 2. **Coloring Argument:**    - Shade the triangles ( C, F, H ) black and the remaining triangles white.    - Notice that every move from one triangle to another changes the color (since each triangle shares an edge with triangles of the opposite color). 3. **Contradiction for 2012 Letters:**    - If there are 2012 letters, there are 2011 moves.    - Since each move changes the color, an odd number of moves (2011) would mean the starting and ending triangles must be of different colors.    - However, both the first and last triangles are ( C ), which are black. This leads to a contradiction. Thus, there are no triangle-friendly sequences with 2012 letters. # Part (b): Number of triangle-friendly sequences with 2013 letters 1. **Define Recurrences:**    - Let ( a_n ) be the number of triangle-friendly sequences of length ( n ) ending in ( C ).    - Let ( b_n ) be the number of triangle-friendly sequences of length ( n ) ending in ( F ) or ( H ). 2. **Initial Conditions:**    - ( a_1 = 1 ) (the sequence is just ( C )).    - ( b_1 = 0 ) (no sequence of length 1 can end in ( F ) or ( H )). 3. **Recurrence Relations:**    - To form a sequence of length ( n+2 ) ending in ( C ), the previous letter must be adjacent to ( C ). The possible sequences are:      - ( ...CAC )      - ( ...CBC )      - ( ...CDC )      - ( ...FBC )      - ( ...HDC )    - Therefore, ( a_{n+2} = 3a_n + 2b_n ).    - To form a sequence of length ( n+2 ) ending in ( F ) or ( H ), the previous letter must be adjacent to ( F ) or ( H ).

Thus, let's list and count all adjacencies:    - Corners (4 cells, each has 2 adjacencies): (4 times 2 = 8) adjacencies.    - Borders (4 cells, each has 3 adjacencies): (4 times 3 = 12) adjacencies.    - Center (1 cell, has 4 adjacencies): (4) adjacencies.    So, the total number of adjacencies in a (3 times 3) grid:    [    8 + 12 + 4 = 24    ]    But every adjacency is counted twice (once for each involved cell), so:    [    frac{24}{2} = 12 text{ adjacencies}    ] 2. **Calculate the total adjacencies for three (3 times 3) squares:**        Since there are 3 such grids:    [    3 times 12 = 36 text{ adjacencies}    ] 3. **Consider the number of adjacencies each number can have:**    Each number from 1 to 9 can potentially be adjacent to up to 8 other numbers in any arrangement.

Note: Permuting the rows or columns of a valid position on the board does not change its properties. Specifically, if a configuration is losing for player 1, permuting the rows and columns results in another losing configuration for player 1, and the same applies if it is winning. 2. **Symmetry Argument:**    If player 1 places the first piece, rearrange the board such that this piece is on the central vertical line but not at the center of the board. This aids in employing symmetry. 3. **Strategy for Player 2:**    Player 2 can always respond to each move of Player 1 by placing their piece symmetrically relative to the center of the board. This symmetry ensures that, after every move by Player 2, the configuration remains symmetric about the center line vertically and horizontally. 4. **Middle Row and Column:**    Every time Player 1 makes a move on the middle vertical line, Player 2 mirrors it. Hence, Player 1 cannot occupy the central cell, as Player 2 would have mirrored it symmetrically to the middle of the board. 5. **Ensuring Valid Moves:**    Player 2 ensures that the positioning of each piece maintains the conditions of no more than two pieces per row and column, mirroring each of Player 1's moves symmetrically. 6. **Proof of Outcome:**    Since player 2 always mirrors player 1’s move, the middle row always ends up with an even number of pieces (either 0 or 2) – reinforcing that Player 1 cannot seize an advantage. 7. **Dirichlet's Principle:**    According to the pigeonhole principle (Dirichlet's principle):     After filling up to 128 moves (only partial occupation of the board), there will definitely be an empty row or column, or other rows/columns that don't reach the maximum limit (2 pieces per row/column). 8. **Critical Position:**    Upon symmetrical play, a critical point emerges usually after 128 moves:    - Player 2 will have arranged the moves symmetrically such that either:      - A full row and column are empty.      - Both rows and columns have a single piece.    - The placement strategy ensures that there remains a valid move for player 2, preventing Player 1 from making a valid move that could trap Player 2. 9. **Result of Symmetrical Strategy:**    Since Player 2 can always mirror Player 1’s move, avoiding occupying the essential central cell and ensuring every move is valid, Player 2 never forfeits a move first. # Conclusion: Player 2 will always win with correct play.

This means that x can be expressed as:    x = 82k + 5, where k is some integer. 2. When y is squared and added to x, the new number (x + y^2) is divisible by 41. Since 82 is a multiple of 41 (82 = 2 * 41), x is also divisible by 41 when the remainder 5 is not included. Therefore, y^2 must be such that it cancels out the remainder of 5 when x is divided by 41, making x + y^2 divisible by 41. Since x = 82k + 5, let's find a value for y^2 such that (82k + 5 + y^2) is divisible by 41. We know that 82k is divisible by 41, so we need to find a y^2 that when added to 5, the sum is a multiple of 41. The smallest such y^2 would be when y^2 = 36, because 5 + 36 = 41, which is divisible by 41. Therefore, y could be 6 or -6 (since both 6^2 and (-6)^2 equal 36). Now, we need to find the remainder when x + y^3 + 7 is divided by 61.

Substituting ( y = 250 ) into ( y = 5x ): [ 250 = 5x ] [ x = 50 text{ grams} ] 11. The mass of water in vessel ( A ): [ frac{4}{5} y - x = frac{4}{5}(250) - 50 = 200 - 50 = 150 text{ grams} ] 12.

I. Solution 1. **Take the square root of both sides:** [  sqrt{x y} = sqrt{(12 - x)^2 (12 - y)^2}  ] Since (x) and (y) are within the interval ([0, 12]), and each side consists of non-negative numbers, we can transform the right-hand side as: [  (12 - x)(12 - y)  ] 2. **Expand the right-hand side:** [ sqrt{x y} = (12 - x)(12 - y) ] [  = 144 - 12(x + y) + xy ] So we get: [  sqrt{xy} = 144 - 12(x + y) + xy ] 3. **Substitute ( t = sqrt{xy} ):** Then we obtain: [ t = 144 - 12(x + y) + xy ] 4. **Apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality):** By AM-GM inequality, we know: [  frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}  ] Using this: [ t leq 144 - 24 sqrt{xy} + xy ] Substituting ( t = sqrt{xy} ), we get: [  t leq 144 - 24t + t^2  ] 5. **Solve the resulting quadratic inequality:** [ 0 leq t^2 - 25t + 144 ] [ 0 leq (t - 9)(t - 16) ] Solving this, considering the allowable range for ( t ) (since (0 leq sqrt{xy} leq 12)), we find: [  0 leq t leq 9  ] Therefore: [  sqrt{xy} leq 9  ] Which leads to: [  xy leq 81  ] 6. **Check when equality holds:** Equality holds when: [  sqrt{xy} = 9  Rightarrow xy = 81  ] Considering the condition ( frac{x + y}{2} = 9 ), solve this system. If ( x = y = 9 ), we find: [  xy = 81  ] Thus, the maximum value of ( xy ) within the interval ([0, 12]) is achieved at ( x = 9 ) and ( y = 9 ). # **Conclusion:** The maximum value of ( xy ) is ( boxed{81} ).

(ii) If the slopes of lines OP and OQ exist, denote them by k_1 and k_2 respectively. Determine whether k_1k_2 is a constant value. If it is, find the value; if not, provide an explanation.","output":"(1) We know the focus of the parabola x^2 = 4y is at (0, 1), and this point coincides with one endpoint of the minor axis of ellipse C, so b = 1. The eccentricity e of the ellipse C is frac{c}{a} = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}. Solving for a^2, we get a^2 = 3. Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse is frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1, and the equation of the \\"companion circle\\" is x^2 + y^2 = 4. (2)(i) Let's denote the points of tangency as A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). Assuming the slope of the tangent line at point P does not equal zero and exists, we can express it as y = kx + m (with k neq 0). Since m = y_1 - kx_1 and x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 4, we substitute into the equation of the ellipse, resulting in (3k^2 + 1)x^2 + 6kmx + 3m^2 - 3 = 0. For the line to be tangent to the ellipse, the discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be zero, so Delta = 36k^2m^2 - 4(3k^2 + 1)(3m^2 - 3) = 0. From here, we find m^2 = 3k^2 + 1.  Substituting m = y_1 - kx_1 into the discriminant equation, we end up with a quadratic in k: (x_1^2 - 3)k^2 - 2x_1y_1k + y_1^2 - 1 = 0. Since x_1^2 - 3 neq 0, the product of the roots k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} is  frac{y_1^2 - 1}{x_1^2 - 3}. Given that x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 4, this simplifies to k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} = -1. Therefore, even if the slope of the tangent line is zero or undefined, the condition holds, which means PA perp PB. (ii) When the slope of line PQ exists, using the same line equation y = kx + m and intersecting it with the circle x^2 + y^2 = 4, we obtain (k^2 + 1)x^2 + 2kmx + m^2 - 4 = 0. Solving the discriminant Delta = 4k^2m^2 - 4(k^2 + 1)(m^2 - 4) with m^2 = 3k^2 + 1, we get Delta = 4k^2 + 12 > 0.  Let's denote P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2). Then, x_1 + x_2 = -frac{2km}{k^2 + 1} and x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{m^2 - 4}{k^2 + 1}. Thus, we have k_1k_2 = frac{y_1y_2}{x_1x_2} = frac{(kx_1 + m)(kx_2 + m)}{x_1  x_2} = frac{k^2x_1x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2}{x_1x_2}. Substituting known values, we obtain k_1k_2 = frac{m^2 - 4k^2}{m^2 - 4}. Lastly, substituting m^2 = 3k^2 + 1 into the equation, we get k_1k_2 = -frac{1}{3}. It follows that k_1k_2 is a constant when the slope of line PQ exists. When the slope of PQ does not exist, it can easily be verified that k_1k_2 = -frac{1}{3}. Consequently, regardless of the circumstances, [ k_1k_2 = boxed{-frac{1}{3}} ]."},{"instruction":"There are 20 points distributed on a circle, and 10 chords are drawn such that no two chords share endpoints and no two chords intersect.

Since we don't have a clear description of the shape of the plot, let's assume it's a trapezoid with AE and CD as the parallel sides and AF, FB, CE, and ED as the non-parallel sides. Let's denote the length of AE as x. The area of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) * (height) In this case, the height of the trapezoid would be the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides AE and CD. Since we have AF and CE, we can assume that the height is the average of these two lengths, which would be (AF + CE) / 2 = (30 m + 40 m) / 2 = 35 m. Now, let's denote the length of CD as y.

Given that a > b > 0, we can express the eccentricity as frac{sqrt{a^2-b^2}}{a} = frac{1}{2}. This implies 2sqrt{a^2-b^2} = a, and squaring both sides gives 4(a^2-b^2) = a^2. Solving for b^2 in terms of a^2, we find b^2 = frac{3}{4}a^2. To simplify calculations, let's denote a = 2c, which implies b^2 = 3c^2 and thus the ellipse equation becomes frac{x^2}{4c^2} + frac{y^2}{3c^2} = 1.

Substituting y from the line equation into the ellipse equation, we get 13x^2 + 8cx - 32c^2 = 0.  Using Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots {x}_{1}+{x}_{2}=-frac{8c}{13} and the product of the roots {x}_{1}{x}_{2}=-frac{32{c}^{2}}{13}.

Now, we want to find the smallest positive integer d such that when multiplied by 10,000, the result is the square of an integer that has three distinct prime factors, p, q, and r.  Since 10,000 is already a square, we need to introduce another square of an integer that has three distinct prime factors. Let's call this integer x, and it can be represented as x = p * q * r, where p, q, and r are distinct prime numbers. For 10,000 * d to be a square, d must be a square itself (since 10,000 is already a square). Moreover, d must include the prime factors p, q, and r to satisfy the condition that the resulting square has three additional prime factors. The smallest such d would be the square of the product of the three smallest distinct prime numbers (other than 2 and 5, which are already present in the factorization of 10,000).

He lost 8% of his pets when he left the door open:    Loss = 8% of 120 = 0.08 * 120 = 9.6    Since we can't have a fraction of a pet, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. Assuming he lost 10 pets (rounding up because you can't lose a fraction of a pet):    Remaining pets = 120 - 10 = 110 pets 3. After 5 of his pets won a contest, he received 15 additional pets:    New total = 110 + 15 = 125 pets 4. Later that week, 3/8 of his pets gave birth, each producing 3 offspring:    Number of pets giving birth = 3/8 * 125 = 46.875    Since we can't have a fraction of a pet giving birth, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. Assuming 47 pets gave birth (rounding up):    Offspring produced = 47 * 3 = 141    New total = 125 + 141 = 266 pets 5. His pet count grew by 25% due to a donation:    Increase = 25% of 266 = 0.25 * 266 = 66.5    Since we can't have a fraction of a pet, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. Assuming an increase of 67 pets (rounding up):    New total = 266 + 67 = 333 pets 6. 9% of the pets died from old age the following month:    Loss = 9% of 333 = 0.09 * 333 = 29.97    Since we can't have a fraction of a pet dying, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. Assuming a loss of 30 pets (rounding up):    Remaining pets = 333 - 30 = 303 pets 7. A sudden illness outbreak caused a further 11% pet loss:    Loss = 11% of 303 = 0.11 * 303 = 33.33    Since we can't have a fraction of a pet loss, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. Assuming a loss of 33 pets (rounding up):    Remaining pets = 303 - 33 = 270 pets Therefore, after all the events, Anthony has boxed{270}  pets remaining."},{"instruction":"Given a > b > c, which of the following inequalities is correct?

We know that 12.5% of the uninsured employees work part-time. There are 104 uninsured employees, so: Number of uninsured part-time employees = 12.5% of 104 = 0.125 * 104 = 13 (rounded down since we can't have a fraction of a person) Now, let's find out how many employees work part-time but are insured. We know that there are 54 part-time employees in total, so: Number of insured part-time employees = Total part-time employees - Uninsured part-time employees = 54 - 13 = 41 Next, let's find out how many employees are neither uninsured nor work part-time. We know there are 330 employees in total, 104 are uninsured, and 54 work part-time. However, we need to be careful not to double-count the 13 employees who are both uninsured and work part-time. So, we subtract the uninsured and part-time employees from the total and then add back the 13 who were double-counted: Number of employees neither uninsured nor part-time = Total employees - Uninsured employees - Insured part-time employees + Uninsured part-time employees = 330 - 104 - 41 + 13 = 330 - 104 - 41 + 13 = 330 - 145 + 13 = 330 - 132 = 198 Finally, to find the probability that a randomly selected person will neither work part-time nor be uninsured, we divide the number of such employees by the total number of employees: Probability = Number of employees neither uninsured nor part-time / Total number of employees = 198 / 330 = 0.6 (or 60%) So, the probability that a randomly selected person from those surveyed will neither work part-time nor be uninsured is boxed{0.6}  or 60%."},{"instruction":"What is the units digit of the expression 7 ^ y + 6, where y is a positive integer, and the units digit of the expression is 9?","output":"To find the units digit of the expression 7^y + 6, we need to look at the pattern of the units digits of powers of 7. The units digit of 7^1 is 7. The units digit of 7^2 is 9 (because 49 ends in 9). The units digit of 7^3 is 3 (because 343 ends in 3). The units digit of 7^4 is 1 (because 2401 ends in 1). After the fourth power, the pattern of the units digits repeats every four powers because the units digit of 7^5 is 7 again (since 16807 ends in 7), and so on. So the pattern of the units digits for powers of 7 is: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then it repeats. Now, we want the units digit of 7^y + 6 to be 9. We can check the pattern to see which power of 7, when added to 6, will give us a units digit of 9. - If y gives a units digit of 7, then 7 + 6 = 13, and the units digit is 3, not 9. - If y gives a units digit of 9, then 9 + 6 = 15, and the units digit is 5, not 9. - If y gives a units digit of 3, then 3 + 6 = 9, and the units digit is 9, which is what we want. - If y gives a units digit of 1, then 1 + 6 = 7, and the units digit is 7, not 9. Therefore, we need y to be a positive integer such that 7^y has a units digit of 3. From the pattern, we see that this happens when y is a multiple of 4 plus 3 (i.e., y = 4k + 3 for some non-negative integer k).

Let each pile ( i ) have ( l_i ) peanuts where ( i in {1, 2, ldots, n} ).    To manage the distribution quantitatively, assign each peanut in pile ( i ) a value of ( frac{1}{l_i} ). Since each pile ( i ) consists of ( l_i ) peanuts, the sum of the assigned values in each pile is:    [    l_i times frac{1}{l_i} = 1    ]    Therefore, the total sum of values over all piles:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{text{peanuts in pile } i} frac{1}{l_i} = n    ] 2. **Assumption for Contradiction:**        Assume, contrary to the statement of the problem, that at most ( k ) peanuts end up in a smaller pile in the new distribution of ( n+k ) piles. 3. **Distribution Analysis:**        Since there are ( n+k ) new piles, it means at least ( n ) of these new piles contain peanuts that have at least the same number of peanuts as they originally did or more. For every one of these ( n ) new piles, the sum of the values assigned to each peanut in the pile is at least 1. 4. **Summation Over ( n ) Piles:**        Let's denote these ( n ) well-distributed piles by ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ). Then for each ( P_i ):    [    sum_{text{peanuts in pile } P_i} frac{1}{l_i} geq 1    ]    Summing these quantities over the ( n ) piles, we get:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{text{peanuts in pile } P_i} frac{1}{l_i} geq n    ]    However, since the total sum of values over all peanuts must be ( n ), and no peanuts are missing, this part is correct but the logic contradiction lies ahead. 5. **Remaining ( k ) Piles:**        In the remaining ( k ) piles, by our assumption, at most ( k ) peanuts ended up in smaller piles. Hence, the sum of the values in these remaining ( k ) piles can correct the summation:    [    sum_{text{peanuts in remaining } k text{ piles}} frac{1}{l_i} > 0    ] 6. **Contradiction:**    The earlier assumption leads to a contradiction because the sum of values in the remaining ( k ) piles must be zero or positive and must add up to total ( n ) already accounted for greater than or equal to ( n ) in part since distribution calculation stands invalid. Hence the ( k ) piles also need correct distribution analysis leading to contradiction in the remaining piles' calculation altogether. 7. **Conclusion:**        Therefore, our assumption must be incorrect, and at least ( k+1 ) peanuts must move to a smaller pile in order to satisfy the distribution. 8. **Conclusion and Final Assertion:**    [    boxed{k+1}    ]"},{"instruction":"Given a mapping ( f: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ) which is both injective and surjective and satisfies ( f(x) + f(f(x)) = 6 ), find ( f(1) ).","output":"1. **Given Information:**    We are provided with a function ( f : {1,2,3,4,5} rightarrow {1,2,3,4,5} ) that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

Therefore: d = frac{|1 cdot 0 + 1 cdot 0 - 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. The length of the chord is found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the chord length is the base of an isosceles triangle whose legs are radii of the circle with length r, and the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord is d. Therefore, the half-chord length is: sqrt{r^2 - d^2} = sqrt{3^2 - (sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{9 - 2} = sqrt{7}. The full chord length is then twice the half-chord length: 2sqrt{7}.

The slope of this line is given by the ratio of the change in y to the change in x, which is frac{2 - 0}{-1 - 0} = frac{2}{-1} = -2. Therefore, we have tan alpha = -2. This shows that if the terminal side of angle alpha passes through (-1,2), then it is sufficient to conclude tan alpha = -2. 2. **Necessity**: When tan alpha = -2, this means that the slope of the line from the origin to a point on the terminal side of alpha is -2. This condition is met for angles in both the second and fourth quadrants.

Consider:    [    11(k+h) + 10(n^k + n^h) = 11(k+h) + 10((11m)^k + (11m)^h)    ]    Since ( 11m ) raised to any power is still divisible by 11, ( n^k equiv 0 pmod{11} ). Thus:    [    11(k+h) + 10(0 + 0) = 11(k+h)    ]    This implies that ( 11(k+h) ) is always divisible by 11, and hence, ( a equiv b pmod{110} ) for some ( k neq h ). 3. **Primitive Roots of 11:**    Next, consider ( n ) which are primitive roots modulo 11. A primitive root modulo 11 is an integer ( g ) such that the powers of ( g ) generate all the non-zero residues modulo 11. The primitive roots modulo 11 are 2, 6, 7, and 8.    For ( n ) to be a primitive root modulo 11, we need to check:    [    11(k+h) + 10(n^k + n^h) equiv 0 pmod{110}    ]    This implies:    [    11(k+h) + 10(n^k + n^h) equiv 0 pmod{110}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    11(k+h) equiv -10(n^k + n^h) pmod{110}    ]    Since ( 11 ) and ( 10 ) are coprime, ( 11(k+h) equiv 0 pmod{11} ) and ( 10(n^k + n^h) equiv 0 pmod{10} ). This implies ( k+h equiv 0 pmod{10} ) and ( n^k + n^h equiv 0 pmod{11} ). 4. **Non-Primitive Roots:**    For non-primitive roots, consider ( k = h ). For example, if ( k = h = 5 ) and ( k = h = 10 ):    [    11(5+5) + 10(n^5 + n^5) = 110 + 20n^5    ]    [    11(10+10) + 10(n^{10} + n^{10}) = 220 + 20n^{10}    ]    Both expressions are congruent modulo 110, leading to ( a equiv b pmod{110} ). 5. **Conclusion:**    Since both primitive and non-primitive roots lead to contradictions, there are no such ( n ) that satisfy the given conditions.

In this context, x^{2}+y^{2} represents the squared distance between the point on the circle and the origin.

If they do not contain the element (m-1)^2, their sum will be at most (m-1)(m-2):         [         (m-1)(m-2) = m^2 - 3m + 2 < (m-1)^2 = m^2 - 2m + 1,         ]         which indicates that without (m-1)^2 and elements after it, their sum is definitely smaller than (m-1)^2.                  Otherwise, their sum is at least (m-1)^2 + (m-2) = m^2 - 2m + 1 + m - 2 = m^2 - m - 1, which is greater than m^2 - m - 2. Therefore, S also cannot be m-term-sum-related. 3. **Ensuring Minimum Value**:     The results from the subsets S and T suggest that n_m geq m^2 - m - 1 to avoid both being not m-term-sum-related.      4. **Verification for Threshold**:     When n = m^2 - m - 1, assume N = {1, 2, cdots, n} and divide it into S and T disjoints such that S cup T = N and S cap T = emptyset. Assume 1 in S.           If both S and T are not m-term-sum-related:     [     1 cdot (m-1) = m-1 in T.     ]          Consequently:     [     (m-1)^2 in S.     ]     Also known is:     [     1 + (m-2)m = (m-1)^2,     ]     so m in T implies m, m-1 in T, and 1, (m-1)^2 in S, thus:     [     (m-2) cdot m + 1 cdot (m-1) = m^2 - m - 1 = (m-2) cdot 1 + 1 cdot (m-1)^2.     ]     Whether m^2 - m - 1 is in S or T, both conditions contradict the assumptions. Hence, there must be a violation indicating S or T must be m-term-sum-related. # Conclusion: Thus, the smallest value of n_m ensuring that at least one partitioned subset is m-term-sum-related is: [ boxed{m^2 - m - 1} ]"},{"instruction":"Given f(x) = 2x + 3 and g(x + 2) = f(x), find g(x).

However, the same conditions could also describe a trapezoid, where only one pair of opposite sides is parallel, and the non-parallel sides could be equal in length.

Indeed, we have:      [      measuredangle HJ'H' = measuredangle HGH' = measuredangle DGE = measuredangle DFE = measuredangle J'FJ = measuredangle J'HJ      ]      Thus, (H'J' parallel HJ).    - Similarly, (K'I' parallel KI). 4. **Coincidence of Centers**:    - Let (O, O') be the centers of ((HIJK)) and ((H'I'J'K')), and (X, Y) be the centers of ((AFG)), ((ADE)).    - We have:      [      XO perp HJ parallel H'J' perp XO'      ]      So, (X, O, O') are collinear.    - Similarly, since (K'I' parallel KI), (YO parallel YO') and so (Y, O, O') are collinear. 5. **Conclusion**:    - This implies (O' = XO cap YO = O), but we need to dispel some configuration issues first.    - Suppose (O neq O'), then (XYO) are collinear. In particular, (JH parallel KI), which implies that (measuredangle KIE = measuredangle HJF), or (measuredangle GDE = measuredangle DGF).    - WLOG, let (BC) be horizontal with (B) to the left of (C). Then, (measuredangle GDE = angle GDE), and (measuredangle DGF = 180^circ - angle DGF), so (angle DGF + angle GDE = 180^circ).    - But:      [      angle GDE < angle ADE < 90^circ, quad angle DGF < angle AGF < 90^circ      ]      This is a contradiction. Thus, (XYO) cannot be collinear, so (O' = O) indeed.

How many different distribution schemes are there?","output":"Firstly, let's address the constraint that each class must have at least one intern teacher. We can initially distribute one teacher to each of the three classes, leaving us with 2 teachers to distribute freely without any restrictions. Now, let's use the stars and bars method to find the different ways we can distribute the remaining 2 intern teachers to the 3 classes.  We have 2 \\"stars\\" to represent the teachers and 2 \\"bars\\" to divide them into the three \\"bins\\" or classes. Each configuration of stars and bars represents a unique distribution of teachers to classes.  If n represents the number of stars (teachers) and k the number of bars (class dividers), then the number of ways to distribute the stars among the bins separated by bars is given by the formula:  binom{n + k}{k}  Thus, for 2 teachers and 2 dividers, we have:  binom{2 + 2}{2} = binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!2!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6  There are 6 different ways to distribute the remaining 2 teachers among the 3 classes. However, this is not the final answer, since we initially distributed one teacher per class in an arbitrary manner. We must account for the permutations of these initial placements. Given 5 teachers (denoted as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5), we're looking at ways to choose which 3 teachers go to each class first. This is a combination since the order of selection doesn't matter. So we calculate:  binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!2!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10  So, there are 10 ways to choose which 3 teachers go into the classes first. The final number of distribution schemes can be found by multiplying the number of ways to choose the first 3 teachers (10 ways) by the number of ways to distribute the remaining teachers (6 ways):  10 times 6 = 60  Thus, there are 60 different distribution schemes.

This step ensures that the entire polygon is covered by these triangles. This can be achieved by any of the existing triangulation algorithms which are efficient for simple polygons.     2. **Vertex Coloring Lemma**:     We need to color the vertices of the polygon with three colors (blue, red, and yellow) such that each triangle formed in the triangulation has exactly one vertex of each color.    To prove the lemma, we use induction on the number of vertices n. 3. **Base Case (n=3)**:     When n=3, the polygon is already a triangle. We can simply color each vertex of this triangle with a different color (blue, red, yellow). Therefore, the base case holds trivially. 4. **Inductive Step**:     Assume the lemma holds for any polygon with k vertices where k < n.    - Consider a triangulation of the n-vertex polygon mathcal{P} which results in n-2 triangles.    - Since there are n-2 triangles and n sides, there must be at least one triangle in this triangulation whose two sides are also sides of mathcal{P}. These sides are necessarily consecutive and share a common vertex X.     5. **Application of Induction Hypothesis**:    - Remove the vertex X and the associated triangle from the original polygon to form a new polygon mathcal{P}' with n-1 vertices.    - By the induction hypothesis, mathcal{P}' can be colored such that every triangle in mathcal{P}' has one vertex of each color (blue, red, yellow). 6. **Extension to Original Polygon**:    - When adding back vertex X and the triangle containing X, the vertex X will be connected to precisely three vertices from mathcal{P}' that form a triangle.    - In mathcal{P}', color X such that it does not conflict with the existing coloring in the triangle it is part of. This is possible because there are only three colors, and X is included in one triangle, leaving two colors available.     7. **Completion of Coloring**:    - This ensures that every triangle in the full triangulated mathcal{P} contains exactly one vertex of each color. 8. **Selecting Set mathcal{A}**:    - Select all vertices of the color that appears the least frequently.     - Since every triangle contains exactly one vertex of each color and there are n-2 triangles, it follows that the selected color will be used at most leftlfloorfrac{n}{3}rightrfloor times.     9. **Verification**:    By construction, for each triangle formed inside mathcal{P}, there is at least one vertex in the chosen set mathcal{A}, guaranteeing the visibility coverage as required. # Conclusion: There exists a set mathcal{A} of leftlfloorfrac{n}{3}rightrfloor vertices such that for any point X inside mathcal{P}, there exists a vertex C in mathcal{A} where the segment [C, X] is entirely within mathcal{P}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Two concentric circles have diameters of 2 inches and 4 inches respectively.

Let the distance traveled by the tourist from A before meeting be s km, and the distance traveled by the tourist from B be (s-2) km. 2. The time taken by the tourist from A to travel (s-2) km after meeting is 1.6 hours (1 hour 36 minutes = 1.6 hours). Hence, his speed is:    [    v_A = frac{s-2}{1.6} text{ km/h}    ] 3.

The probability of drawing a white ball is frac{2}{5}, and the probability of drawing a black ball is frac{3}{5}.

We define a disorder to be a pair of volumes where the volume with the larger number is positioned to the left. For a given arrangement of the volumes, the number S of all disorders is counted. What values can S take?","output":"1. First, we note the constraint for the number of disorder pairs (S). Clearly, (S) cannot be less than 0, since there are no negative pairs, and it cannot be more than the maximum possible pairs in a 10-volume set. 2. The maximum number of possible pairs of 10 volumes is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{10}{2} = frac{10 cdot 9}{2} = 45    ]    Therefore, (S) can range from 0 to 45. 3. Next, we demonstrate that any integer value from 0 to 45 can be achieved by some arrangement of the 10 volumes. To do this, let us start by reversing the order of the volumes, which maximizes the number of disorder pairs. 4. Let's consider a list of volumes ordered from 10 to 1, i.e., ([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]). In this case, every pair is in disorder. For each pair ((i, j)) where (i > j), there is a disorder. Specifically:    [    S = 45    ] 5. Now, we will illustrate how to decrease (S) by 1. Choose two consecutive elements in the arrangement that form a disorder. Switch them to make them ordered correctly, reducing the number of disorder pairs by exactly 1.  6. For example, if in a certain step we swap two consecutive elements (a_i) and (a_{i+1}) such that (a_i > a_{i+1}):    [    S rightarrow S - 1    ] 7. By applying such swaps iteratively, we can reduce (S) step-by-step from 45 down to 0. Hence, we can generate every integer value of (S) between 0 and 45:    - Start from (S = 45) (fully reversed order).    - Swap any two adjacent volumes that are in disorder.    - Repeat the process until (S) decreases to 0 (perfect order). # Conclusion Any integer value from 0 to 45 can be achieved by some arrangement of the 10 volumes.

Choosing fresh, high-quality ingredients greatly enhances the flavor of the dish. Additionally, the natural oils present in the herbs and the fish itself contribute to a moist and flavorful crust that complements the tender salmon. This dish is ideal for a quick and easy weeknight meal that feels gourmet, or it can serve as an impressive centerpiece for a special occasion dinner.

As for me, the success of “Taobao” is a business legend, and I was fortunate to attend an online lecture delivered by Mr. Ma during my college life, which endowed me with a more intuitive understanding of the operating mechanism of the entire enterprise. He told us that the success of an enterprise not only relied on sales and marketing but also cutting-edging management techniques, including logistics management, supply chain management, project management, staff management, information system management and business management. Since then, I have developed a keen interest in enterprise management so as to become a successful business leader like Jack Ma. Therefore, I have decided to undertake the Master of Business Administration at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, which will be a vital step toward realizing my career aspirations. Academically, I believe that I am competent in completing this prestigious postgraduate program. Majoring in Financial Engineering at Guangzhou Huashang College, I was exposed fully to the comprehensive knowledge in business management through taking courses including Entrepreneurial Management, Corporate Finance, Microeconomics, Internet and Marketing Innovation, and Cross-Border E-commerce. Meanwhile, all these courses aroused my awareness of the great importance of proper business administration for the business success. More specifically, I became aware that the reasonable and scientific management of a firm’s resources, time and people will lead to businesses that run effectively, efficiently and profitably. As an individual who aspires to become an elite business manager, I have felt the imperative to acquire more knowledge of how businesses harness technology, e-commerce, and communication. Besides, I am eager to delve deeper into the exploration of key topics on office procedures, project management, and employment success strategies. Equipped with a solid theoretical foundation of business management, I thus aspire to pursue a master’s degree in business administration currently. Throughout college, I also sought every opportunity to apply the business management related knowledge I absorbed to practice through participation in academic competitions. Cooperating with several peer students, I partook in the campus Financial Engineering Cup that required entrepreneurial teams to thrive and succeed in entrepreneurship in a multi-production-enterprise competition operating environment by leveraging the electronic sand table tool as the platform. As a team leader, I not only took the lead in the operation and management of the simulated enterprise but was responsible for the overall division of labor of team members. Also, I needed to organize the brainstorming discussions, whilst flexibly interpreting financial statements with my accounting knowledge and conducting simple financial analysis. Thanks to our concerted efforts, my team ended up achieving the runner-up in the competition. In retrospect of this valuable experience, it was the first time that I had been deeply engaged in such a skills-driven competition involving actual business practice with a focus on teamwork cooperation. Meanwhile, I mastered how to swiftly become familiar with the complete operation process of an enterprise, and understand its current situation, as well as make an all-round analysis of the situation of competitors with the tools I grasped. Then, I sought how to accurately integrate the market situation in the simulation environment, and work out the future development plan by combining with the marketing methods and marketing strategies commonly used in theoretical learning. More significantly, this experience boosted my confidence and further accelerated my academic pursuit of business administration. Aside from my academic excellence, my internship and work experiences deepened my understanding of business management. Serving as an assistant at the Bureau of Science, Technology, Industry and Information Technology in Haifeng County of Shanwei City, I was tasked with the promotion of the construction of e-commerce service system and platform as well as the organization of the promotion and application of e-commerce conference. Additionally, I assisted in the analysis of cross-border e-commerce and e-commerce statistical data, and the formulation of relevant reports. From this experience, I gained exposure to e-commerce development plans, programs and policy initiatives from the perspective of public sectors. After graduation, currently, I have been working at the Shanwei Haifeng County Chuangjian Clothing Technology Co., Ltd. as an accountant. My main responsibilities there included sorting out cost expenditure, carrying out material and fixed assets accounting, expense management, cost analysis, and completing analysis reports. In the meantime, I was in charge of the accounting of sales transactions of the firm, reviewing sales data, unit price, preferential policies, whilst making statistics, summary and analysis of sales data as well as taking part in meetings with sales and human resources departments. This rewarding work experience heavily improved my effective communication, problem-solving, time management and organizational skills. On the other hand, it made me realize that business administration is such a balancing act requires knowledge and skills in many disciplines and reminded me of extending my background into further study of this interesting yet challenging field at the postgraduate level. In this respect, the Master of Business Administration program at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University is an ideal choice for me, which will give me full access to the frontier business knowledge, management and administration skills as well as practical tools I need to handle any situation that may arise at my future workplace. Core courses of the elaborate and well-designed curriculum appeals to me as well, notably, I am particularly interested in the courses such as Strategic Management and the Business and Entrepreneurship Project. Furthermore, undertaking this program will prepare me for today’s fast-paced and increasingly complicated business environments. Lastly, Hong Kong is a highly internationalized city and is home to many world-leading enterprises, where I will be allowed to attain cutting-edge business data and industry information. Therefore, I believe that I will be able to achieve self-growth and career development at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University.","output":"Jack Ma, undoubtedly a household name in China, is a source of inspiration for many.

Инцидент произошел спустя сутки после поражения российской команды. Вечером Харин, уходя из бара в центре Торонто, обратил внимание на камеру корреспондента и подошел к нему. Журналист агентства предложил хоккеисту записать с ним интервью, на что последний спросил: «Хочешь, я тебе камеру сломаю?». После этого хоккеист выломал жидкокристаллический дисплей видеокамеры. Затем Харин, улыбнувшись, молча вышел на улицу и уехал. «Я держал камеру в правой руке, когда подошел Харин, я ее опустил, и он своей правой рукой выломал ЖК-дисплей. Из рук не выхватывал, все произошло за секунды. После этого хоккеист, улыбнувшись, молча вышел на улицу и уехал. Люди вокруг даже не заметили, реакции никакой», — рассказал пострадавший корреспондент. Позднее стало известно, что Харин выместил свое раздражение на ни в чем не повинной девушке. Болельщица специально прилетела в Канаду, чтобы поддержать российскую команду. 26 февраля она ждала хоккеистов у входа в «Русский дом» и снимала все происходящее на видеокамеру. Харину это не понравилось, он обругал девушку матом и сломал камеру. Видео обиженная фанатка прислала в редакцию. Сама потерпевшая болельщица рассказала, что лично перед ней Харин не извинялся, а сделал это через прессу. «Пусть так, — говорит любительница хоккея, — наверное, у него не было возможности подойти ко мне самой. Я встречалась с его представителем, и он говорил, что Харин очень сожалеет о произошедшем. Хотелось бы только пожелать, чтобы он больше не срывался на болельщиках, а выплескивал свою агрессию на хоккейной площадке. Чего, к слову, так не хватало нашей сборной в матче с канадцами». Харин сожалеет о том, что грубо толкнул девушку и сломал ей камеру в «Русском доме». Он, по его собственным словам, совершил этот поступок на волне эмоций. «Не хочу об этом распространяться. Так получилось. Я чувствую себя виноватым, но в тот момент меня переполняли эмоции. Я не хотел никому ничего плохого сделать, не хотел кого-то обидеть, но сорвался», — сообщил хоккеист изданию «Washington Post». Он также заявил, что с ужасом вспоминает четвертьфинальный матч против канадцев, в котором наши хоккеисты проиграли со счетом 3:7. «Каждая игра Россия — Канада особенная. Однако этот матч выделяется на фоне других, потому что мы потерпели просто унизительное поражение. Я не знаю, что случилось. Мы вообще не играли. Это было ужасно как для нас, так и для наших болельщиков. Но жизнь на этом не заканчивается», — отметил Харин. Кроме того, российский хоккеист считает, что Канада по праву выиграла олимпийский турнир, победив в заключительной игре американцев (3:2). «Что касается финала, то я видел только овертайм. Думаю, Канада победила заслуженно, они играли лучше. В овертайме канадцы выглядели более мобильными и создали больше возможностей для взятия ворот», — сказал нападающий. Однако Харин уклонился от ответа на вопрос о том, как он отреагировал на победный гол форвард команды-соперника. «В данном случае это значения не имеет», — пояснил россиянин. СМИ считают поведение Харина грубым и непозволительным. Тот факт, что эти инциденты не вызвали практически никакого обсуждения, раздражает журналистов еще больше, чем само поведение хоккеиста.

Причиной конфликта стало разочарование и разочарование Харина в своих выступлениях, а также отрицательные эмоции, которые он перенес из игры на внекорпоративную ситуацию. Конфликт также имел мотивацию снизить эмоциональное напряжение Харина, который решил устранить свое фрустрацию за счет разрушения камеры журналиста. В данном конфликте обе стороны могли получить некоторую выгоду: для Харина это могло быть снятие эмоционального напряжения, а для журналиста - получение информации об инциденте, который может привлечь внимание общественности и увеличить интерес к его работе. 2. Прямыми участниками конфликта являются Евгений Харин и корреспондент РИА «Новости», а косвенными участниками - болельщица и представитель Харина. Роль Харина заключалась в разрушении камеры журналиста и в оправдании своего поведения через прессу. Роль журналиста состояла в предложении Харину провести с ним интервью и документировать произошедший инцидент. Болельщица выступила как невинная сторона, на которую Харин выместил свое раздражение. Приверженец Харина выступил в роли посредника в передаче извинений Харина. 3. Позиция Харина заключается в признании своей вины и сожалении о произошедшем случае, а также взломе своих эмоций. Журналист, в свою очередь, хочет получить информацию об инциденте и привлечь внимание общественности к неправильному поведению Харина. Интересы Харина заключаются в сохранении своей репутации и урегулировании конфликта, чтобы избежать дальнейшей негативной публичности. Журналист интересует привлечение внимания общественности к поведению Харина и возможное восстановление своей камеры. Болельщица интересует получение извинений от Харина. 4. В данной ситуации Харин не использовал инструменты связей с общественностью для урегулирования конфликта. Он публично извинился через прессу, однако не предпринял шагов для личного примирения с болельщицей или журналистом. Журналист, напротив, использовал инструменты связей с общественностью, отправив видео инцидента в редакцию агентства, чтобы привлечь внимание общественности к происходящему. 5. Вариант решения конфликта может быть следующим: Харин может публично извиниться перед болельщицей лично или через прессу и возместить ущерб, связанный с разрушением камеры. Такой шаг поможет смягчить негативные общественные последствия для Харина и урегулировать ситуацию. Кроме того, он может встретиться с журналистом, провести интервью и ответить на его вопросы, чтобы показать свою готовность к примирению и урегулированию конфликта. Журналист, в свою очередь, может принять извинения Харина и получить информацию об этом, чтобы дать широкую оценку происходящему в своих публикациях.

In the novel, Ice-9 is a form of water that becomes solid at room temperature and acts as a seed crystal, causing all water it comes into contact with to solidify into Ice-9 as well. Vonnegut uses Ice-9 as a metaphor for scientific advancements and their potentially catastrophic consequences. In the novel, a small amount of Ice-9 is accidentally released and it quickly spreads, leading to a global catastrophe as all water on Earth freezes solid, killing all life. The significance of Ice-9 in the novel lies in the idea of unintended consequences of scientific progress and the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancements. It serves as a cautionary tale, pointing out the ethical and moral responsibilities that come with scientific discoveries. Although Ice-9 is purely fictional, it has become a symbolic reference to dangerous scientific advancements and the potential risks they pose. It is often used in popular culture to illustrate the concept of a scientific discovery that, if misused or mishandled, could have disastrous consequences."},{"instruction":"Ola","output":"Olá!

No entanto, há algumas realizações gerais esperadas de cada modelo que podem ajudar a identificar qual está em uso: 1. **Desempenho na Geração de Texto**: O GPT-4 pode gerar textos mais precisos, coerentes e contextuais do que o GPT-3.5. O mais recente deve ser melhor em manter o contexto ao longo de conversas mais longas e em produzir respostas que pareçam mais naturalmente escritas por humanos. 2. **Entendimento de Instruções**: O GPT-4 pode entender e executar instruções complexas melhor do que seus antecessores. Se você fornecer instruções complexas ou tarefas que exigem raciocínio abstrato e resolução de problemas, o GPT-4 deve ser mais eficaz em manipular essas solicitações. 3. **Conhecimento Atualizado**: Uma diferença chave seria que o GPT-4 teria sido treinado em dados disponíveis até mais recentemente do que o GPT-3.5, oferecendo possivelmente informações mais atualizadas (embora ambos tenham um limite no conhecimento devido ao corte na data de treinamento). 4. **Habilidades de Multitarefa**: O GPT-4 pode ser melhor em realizar várias tarefas durante uma única sessão ou alternar contextos mais habilmente sem perder o desempenho. Para verificar qual versão você está interagindo, pode tentar pedir a versão diretamente ou pedir a resolução de um problema complexo que poderia ser difícil para versões anteriores.

However, it is important to note that this formula provides a rough estimate, as the precise factors that determine a star's lifetime can vary based on its composition, mass, and evolutionary stage. The main sequence lifetime formula is given as: T = M / L Where: T = Stellar lifetime M = Stellar mass L = Stellar luminosity Given that Geronte has a mass of 0.8 solar masses, and assuming its luminosity is approximately 0.8 times that of the Sun (as it is a blue subdwarf star), we can substitute these values into the formula: T = 0.8 / 0.8 = 1 The estimated stellar lifetime of Geronte, therefore, is approximately 1 billion years. It is important to keep in mind that this calculation serves as a rough estimate, and there can be variations in the actual lifetime of Geronte due to factors that are not accounted for in this basic formula."},{"instruction":"Give calculated stellar lifetime (depends on mass) number for star Geronte.","output":"To provide a more accurate estimate of the stellar lifetime of Geronte based on its mass, we can use the appropriate mass-luminosity relationship for stars. The relationship between a star's mass (M) and its luminosity (L) is often expressed using power laws. For stars with masses between 0.08 and 0.5 solar masses (M☉), which includes Geronte's mass of 0.8 solar masses (0.8 M☉), we can use the following power-law relation: L = M^3.5 Using this relation, we can calculate the luminosity of Geronte: L = (0.8 M☉)^3.5 = 0.8^3.5 ≈ 0.32 L☉ Where L☉ is the solar luminosity. To estimate the stellar lifetime (T) based on the mass-luminosity relation, we can use the following relation: T = 10^10 (M / L) Substituting the values for Geronte: T = 10^10 (0.8 M☉ / 0.32 L☉) = 10^10 (2.5) ≈ 2.5 × 10^10 years Therefore, the calculated stellar lifetime of Geronte, based on its mass, is approximately 25 billion years. It is important to note that this estimate assumes Geronte follows standard stellar evolution patterns, and the actual lifetime may have variations due to other factors."},{"instruction":"Describe star named Novathanatos, name is derived from new and death word, it has 2000 kelvins and 150 Solar mass.","output":"Novathanatos, a star with a profound and evocative name, derives its identity from the combination of the words \\"new\\" and \\"death.\\" This enigmatic celestial object holds immense significance in the cosmos, capturing the imagination with its intriguing characteristics.

Если ты начинающий и хочешь заниматься ходьбой, я могу дать тебе несколько советов. 1. Начни с разминки: перед началом ходьбы, сделай несколько минут простой разминки, чтобы разогреть свои мышцы и готовить их к физической активности. 2. Наладь правильную походку: старайся идти прямо, держи плечи опущенными и расслабленными. Убедись, что ты ноги полностью откатываешь от пятки до носка при каждом шаге. 3. Установи комфортную скорость: начни с умеренного темпа ходьбы и постепенно увеличивай его, когда твое тело привыкнет к нагрузке. Старайся поддерживать уровень активности, при котором ты можешь разговаривать без особых усилий. 4. Не забывай о правильном дыхании: вдыхай через нос, заполняя легкие, и выдыхай через рот. Правильное дыхание поможет тебе сохранять энергию и повысит твою выносливость. 5. Разнообразь тренировки: попробуй ходить в разных направлениях, выбери разные маршруты или добавь в свои тренировки небольшие участки подъема или спуска. Так ты сможешь разнообразить свою тренировку и эффективнее работать над своим телом. Что касается оборудования, для занятий ходьбой тебе потребуется: 1. Удобная обувь: выбери спортивные кроссовки или ходовую обувь с подошвой, которая обеспечит хорошую амортизацию и поддержку для твоих стоп. Это поможет избежать травм и дискомфорта во время тренировок. 2. Удобная одежда: носи одежду, которая позволяет твоей коже дышать и обеспечивает свободу движений. Избегай слишком тесных или неприятных материалов, чтобы твои тренировки были комфортными. 3. Аксессуары для безопасности: если ты планируешь заниматься ходьбой на улице в темное время суток, надень светоотражающие элементы или используй нарукавные повязки, чтобы быть более видимым для водителей. Важно помнить, что перед началом новой тренировочной программы всегда лучше проконсультироваться с врачом. Также не забывай пить достаточное количество воды и следить за своими ощущениями во время тренировок.

DAVE remains quiet, his eyes lowered, and nods slightly. PAT (to her cronies, playfully) Can you believe he actually believes he's just meditating? Poor thing... Pat's cronies, SUE (early 40s, mischievous) and MIKE (late 30s, supportive), giggle and take sips of their wine. SUE (teasingly) I have to hand it to you, Pat, you've trained him well. Look how mesmerized he is, just staring at your feet. MIKE (chuckling) It's like he's under a spell. I bet he doesn't even remember how it all started. DAVE's eyes flicker with confusion but quickly return to a glazed state. PAT (smirking, sips her wine) That's the beauty of it. Dave here is completely unaware of our little hypnosis sessions. He simply believes he's fulfilling his true purpose as my loyal servant. DAVE's breathing becomes shallow and controlled, as if entranced. SUE (raising her glass) To Dave, a man who knows his place. MIKE (cheerfully) To Dave, the devoted footstool! They all clink their glasses, laughing mischievously. PAT (teasingly) Dave, dear, fetch me another glass of wine. Don't keep us waiting. DAVE, without uttering a word, slowly rises from the floor and heads towards the bar. INT. LUXURIOUS LIVING ROOM - BAR AREA - CONTINUOUS DAVE moves in an almost robotic manner, pouring a glass of wine for Pat with precision and grace. His movements display his complete surrender to Pat's control. BACK TO INT. LUXURIOUS LIVING ROOM Dave returns to the group, placing the fresh glass of wine gently in Pat's hand. He then kneels back down beside her feet, his gaze fixed submissively on the ground. PAT (smiling down at Dave) Good boy. Your dedication is truly remarkable. SUE (raising her eyebrow) Have you decided what else Dave should believe about himself yet, Pat? MIKE (excitedly) I vote for making him believe he's a human footrest. Just picture Dave with a cushion on his back! Pat and her cronies erupt into laughter as they continue to enjoy their evening, with Dave embracing his role as the obedient servant at Pat's feet.

Detta är en tragisk verklighet som tyvärr påverkar alltför många barn runt om i världen. Denna berättelse kommer att utforska de situationer och känslor som ett 6-årigt barn kan möta när skolan inte agerar för att lösa dessa problem. Låt oss möta Lisa, en livlig och sprudlande 6-åring som älskar att utforska världen runt henne. Hon är full av drömmar och ambitioner, men dessa positiva egenskaper naggas snabbt i kanten när hon börjar erfara mobbning och kränkningar i skolan. Det började med små kommentarer av elakhet, som över tid eskalerade till verbal och fysisk mobbning. Lisa blir förlöjligad för sin klädsel, sitt utseende och sitt beteende. Hon blir utvald och utsatt av ett gäng barn som ständigt berövar henne på hennes självförtroende och självkänsla. Denna konstanta kränkning får Lisa att tvivla på sig själv och hon börjar tro på de negativa sakerna som sägs om henne. För Lisa blir skolan inte längre en plats där hon kan vara trygg. Hon blir rädd att gå till skolan varje dag och hennes tidigare entusiasm för att lära sig och träffa vänner försvinner. Hon börjar dra sig undan och isolerar sig själv, vilket gör att hon känner sig ännu mer ensam och förtvivlad. Det värsta är när andra barn börjar prata dåligt om Lisa's föräldrar. Barnen sprider rykten och fäller elaka kommentarer om dem, och det känns som en personlig attack mot Lisa. Hon älskar sina föräldrar och känner sig maktlös gentemot ryktena och påhoppen. Det blir som att hela hennes tillvaro kollapsar och hon känner sig bortstött från både sina kamrater och sina föräldrar. Samtidigt blir även relationen med föräldrarna påverkad. Lisa blir alltmer innesluten och missnöjd med sig själv, och hon har svårt att uttrycka sina känslor för dem. Hon börjar undvika att berätta om sin skoldag och blir alltmer tillbakadragen. Föräldrarna märker en förändring hos Lisa, men förstår inte riktigt vad som försiggår i hennes liv. Eftersom skolan inte agerar för att lösa problemen Lisa står inför, känner hon sig övergiven och ignorerad. Hon vänder sig till sina lärare för stöd och hjälp, men möts av en likgiltighet som förstärker hennes känsla av att vara ensam och osedd. Skolans oförmåga att ta itu med mobbningen tar en stor toll på Lisa's tro på rättvisa och att vuxenvärlden finns där för att skydda henne. Lisa börjar tappa förtroendet för andra människor och utvecklar en allmän misstro mot sin omgivning. Hon blir alltmer tillbakadragen och förlorar sig själv i en spiral av ångest och ensamhet. Hennes självkänsla och självförtroende försvinner i de mörka avsnitten av sinnet där mobbningen ständigt påminns henne om sin plats och sin brist på värde. Det är dock viktigt att förstå att Lisa's historia kan ha en ljusare framtid. Med rätt stöd och intervention kan hon hitta tillbaka till sin inre styrka och återupprätta sin tro på sig själv och andra människor. Att visa Lisa att hon är viktig och att hon förtjänar kärlek och respekt kan vara början på hennes läkning. Mobbning och kränkningar är aldrig acceptabelt och skolan måste ta sitt ansvar för att skydda och stödja barn som blir utsatta. Att ignorera problemet eller blunda för det kan få oåterkalleliga konsekvenser för barnets framtid. Det är dags att vi alla tar ett steg framåt och kämpar för att skapa en trygg och inkluderande miljö för våra barn, där inget barn behöver lida i tystnad."},{"instruction":"1.

Khi con người đưa mắt vào vị trí xem, ánh sáng từ quả bóng bay được phản xạ và bắn vào võng mắt, gửi tín hiệu đến não. Giai đoạn thứ hai là xử lý thông tin. Khi tín hiệu được gửi đến não, não bắt đầu xử lý thông tin với sự hỗ trợ của các vùng của não như vùng thị giác và vùng thần kinh. Trong trường hợp này, các vùng này sẽ phân tích các thông tin như hình dạng và màu sắc của quả bóng bay. Giai đoạn tiếp theo là hiểu thông tin.

Dave, a blank and dazed expression on his face, obediently sits on the floor by Pat's sweaty bare feet. His eyes are fixed on the ground. PAT (intoxicated, laughing) Oh, Dave! Look at you, my obedient servant. So unhinged, so utterly devoted. Your place at my feet truly suits you. Dave remains silent, seemingly lost in a hypnotic trance. PAT'S FRIEND 1 (teasingly) How did you manage to convince him, Pat? PAT (raising her glass) Oh, it took some time, my dear friends. But with whispered suggestions and gentle guidance, I molded him into the perfect submissive. PAT'S FRIEND 2 (laughing) And here he is, obedient and under your complete control. It's both satisfying and amusing. Dave continues to sit motionless, his thoughts seemingly disconnected from reality. PAT (patting Dave's head) You see, dear friends, power can be intoxicating. To have someone willingly bow at your feet, to fulfill your darkest desires without question. It's a beautiful dance between dominance and submission. PAT'S FRIEND 3 (raising an eyebrow) But what do you get out of it, Pat? The control, the domination? PAT (smirking) Control, yes. Domination, certainly. But more than that, my friends, it's about exploring the depths of desire and pushing the boundaries of our understanding of pleasure. It's electrifying. Dave's eyes flicker slightly, a hint of recognition flashing for a brief moment before vanishing. PAT'S FRIEND 1 (curious) What about when the hypnosis wears off? Will he remember any of this? PAT (nonchalantly) No, he won't remember a thing. To him, it'll be a blank, submissive state. He'll attribute it to a relaxation technique, a mere meditation. The perfect way to keep our secret realm intact. Amidst the laughter and clinking glasses, Dave's expression remains docile, a mere vessel for Pat's desires. PAT (to Dave) You're doing so well, my obedient servant. Stay here, at my feet, where you belong. Embrace your submission. Dave nods ever so subtly, his trance-like state unmistakable.

D'autre part, l'identité nationale renvoie à la perception que les individus ont d'appartenir à une nation spécifique.

Этот метод анализирует как сам текст, так и социокультурные факторы, которые влияют на его создание и интерпретацию. Основная идея критического дискурс-анализа заключается в том, что язык не просто отражает реальность, но и активно конструирует ее. В этом подходе считается, что социальные отношения, власть и идеологии влияют на язык, используемый в текстах, а также на способы интерпретации этих текстов. КДА помогает выявить эти влияния и раскрыть скрытые аспекты коммуникации. Основные принципы и методы критического дискурс-анализа включают: 1. Анализ социокультурного контекста: КДА уделяет внимание социальным, политическим и культурным условиям, в которых происходит коммуникация. Исследователи анализируют исторические, политические, экономические и социокультурные факторы, которые влияют на создание и интерпретацию текстов. 2. Анализ лингвистических приемов: КДА анализирует лингвистические приемы и структуры, используемые в текстах, чтобы выявить их смысловую нагрузку и влияние на коммуникацию. Это включает изучение лексических единиц, грамматических конструкций, синтаксических структур, метафор и др. 3. Анализ властных отношений: КДА исследует, как власть и идеологии выражаются в текстах и как они влияют на коммуникацию. Исследователи ищут признаки и механизмы власти, доминирования и социального контроля. 4. Политическая и социальная эмансипация: КДА стремится раскрыть и анализировать неравенства, доминирование и несправедливость в коммуникации. Это метод, который позволяет разоблачить скрытые сообщения и создать основу для политической и социальной эмансипации. Критический дискурс-анализ является мощным методом для изучения социальной коммуникации, который помогает расширить понимание языка и его влияния на общество. Он открывает возможности для анализа социальных проблем, идеологических конструкций и выявления способов борьбы с неравенством и дискриминацией через язык."},{"instruction":"Информационно-коммуникационная политика государства и современные информационные войны","output":"Информационно-коммуникационная политика государства охватывает все меры, принимаемые правительством для управления информацией, коммуникацией и медиа. Она основывается на признании того, что информация и коммуникация являются важными ресурсами для формирования общественного мнения, создания политической стабильности, управления кризисными ситуациями и достижения различных целей, заданных государством. Современные информационные войны - это конфликты, в которых информационные технологии и средства коммуникации используются для воздействия на общественное мнение, создания дезинформации, манипулирования и дискредитации, а также для хакерских атак на информационную инфраструктуру. Они становятся все более распространенными и значимыми в контексте глобализации и цифровизации общества. Государства проводят информационные войны, чтобы достичь своих политических, экономических и военных целей. Они могут использовать тактики, включающие создание фейковых новостей, платных троллей и ботов для распространения дезинформации, хакерские атаки на важные информационные системы, кибершпионаж и т. д. Чтобы справиться с вызовами современных информационных войн, государства разрабатывают стратегии информационной безопасности, создают специальные службы и ведомства для защиты информационной инфраструктуры и борьбы с дезинформацией. Они также могут предпринимать международные действия, например, создавать международные соглашения для борьбы с киберпреступностью и информационными атаками. Однако, в то же время, информационно-коммуникационная политика государства может быть использована также для ограничения свободы слова, цензуры и контроля над медиасредой. Такие действия могут иметь негативные последствия для демократии и прав человека.

This can be achieved by applying the first-order central difference scheme. Let's consider the equation (1) as mentioned in the previous statement. We can express it as: u''(x) + q(x)u'(x) + p(x)u(x) = f(x) + λ∫[a,b] k(x,t)u(t)dt To discretize this equation using a fourth-order compact difference approximation, we need to approximate the second derivative term u''(x) by a finite difference scheme. The central difference scheme for approximating the second derivative is given by: u''(x) ≈ (u(x - 2h) - 4u(x - h) + 6u(x) - 4u(x + h) + u(x + 2h))/(h^2) Here, h represents the spatial step size. By applying this central difference scheme to the equation (1), we obtain: (u(x - 2h) - 4u(x - h) + 6u(x) - 4u(x + h) + u(x + 2h))/(h^2) + q(x)u'(x) + p(x)u(x) = f(x) + λ∫[a,b] k(x,t)u(t)dt This discrete equation represents the fourth-order compact finite difference scheme for the given equation.

PAT smirks and playfully waves at DAVE, her feet still captivating his attention. DAVE (confused) Impressive skills? What are you all talking about? CO-WORKER 3 (raising an eyebrow) Oh, come on, Dave. Don't act innocent. Pat has been hypnotizing you, and it's been quite the show. DAVE's eyes widen in astonishment. DAVE (disbelieving) Hypnotized? No way! CO-WORKER 4 (nodding) It's true! Pat convinced you it was just a meditation thing, but we all saw the sessions firsthand. You were putty in her hands! PAT, like a mischievous cat, toys with DAVE by raising her feet closer to his face. DAVE (stammering) I... I don't remember any of this. How did it happen? CO-WORKER 1 (grinning) She started innocently, but soon Pat had you under her spell. You became more and more suggestible, eager to please her every command. CO-WORKER 2 (winking) And let's just say, she made you do some rather kinky things during those sessions. PAT lets out a low chuckle, relishing in this moment of power. DAVE's mind races with a mix of confusion, curiosity, and arousal. DAVE (blushing) I can't believe I fell for all of this. What have I been doing? CO-WORKER 3 (teasingly) Oh, don't worry, Dave. It's all in good fun. But now you know the truth, and I'm sure Pat has some exciting plans for you. PAT lifts her feet playfully, inviting DAVE to give in to his desires.

The \`Math.ceil()\` function always rounds a number up to the nearest integer."},{"instruction":"it doesn't work that way.","output":"My apologies for the confusion. In JavaScript, the \`Math.ceil()\` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. However, for your specific requirement of rounding up to 86400, you can use a simple control statement based on the remainder modulo (\`%\`) operator. Here's an example: \`\`\`javascript let num = 86399; if (num % 60 !== 0) { num += (60 - num % 60); } console.log(num); \`\`\` This code first checks if the remainder of \`num\` divided by 60 is not zero, indicating that the number is not already a multiple of 60. In that case, it adds the difference between 60 and the remainder to bring it to the next multiple of 60, which in this case is 86400.

While brainstorming for the research topic, the teacher guided my teammates and me to think broadly about the problems people face. I recalled a boy in my class who had been absent for class for a long time, who turned out to have depression as we later knew. To understand the social relevance of depression, I led the team to design a questionnaire, with part of the questions for people who consider themselves as mentally healthy and the other part for those who had psychological issues. After analyzing the data, I found that many people who feel depressed did not go to the hospital for a diagnosis, mainly due to family disapproval and social stigma. Thus, I participated in creating a public service advertisement “It’s OK to not be OK” to combat the stigma surrounding depression, which was published on a major platform in China and received wide support from social media users. Besides, we also researched the current way of depression diagnosis by interviewing a psychiatrist at the Shandong Mental Health Center. We discovered that the existing diagnostic method depends on the result of psychological questionnaires and objective judgment from the psychiatrist, which is time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate, hindering people from seeking help. To improve diagnosis, we decided to develop an efficient and accurate way for self-diagnosis. After the literature review, we found that some microRNAs are significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in the cerebrospinal fluid of major depression disorder patients. We focused on the amilCP, which is an up-regulated microRNA that could be transcripted to fluorescent proteins. We together conceived the design of a detector with a filter paper strip biosensor based on a toehold switch and cell-free system to diagnose depressive disorders by detecting specific microRNAs with assistance from the teacher. We synthesized three toehold switches and inserted them into the pET-28a expression vector, constructing these three recombinant plasmids. When they are transformed into E. coli, the miRNA can trigger the expression of the corresponding reporter protein. The teacher led us to make the test paper step by step, involving extracting the plasmid, amplifying DNA, constructing recombinant plasmids, and many other steps. In the process, sometimes I faced some challenges. For example, I was confused about how PCR works, but I asked the teacher and communicated with my teammates to figure out the problem. After we finally made the test paper, we did many experiments. However, I noticed that the sensitivities of 3 kinds of chromoproteins are relatively low. To make the results more noticeable, I persuaded the others to replace AmilCP with the lacZ gene to make the results more noticeable. All in all, the training for iGEM offers me a great chance to discover the problems in the surroundings and do my part to improve the conditions, with a attentiveness to others, a logical mind to analyze and skillful basic techniques for developing new things.","output":"During the summer vacation after grade 10 and the winter vacation in grade 11, I participated in an iGEM training program to enhance my research skills and laboratory techniques.

By combining attentiveness to people’s struggles, analytical reasoning skills, and laboratory techniques, I was able to make a meaningful impact.","output":"During the summer 2022 to winter 2023, I participated in the iGEM training program, enhancing my research skills and laboratory techniques. Focusing on depression, we designed a questionnaire to understand its social relevance. Our analysis revealed that many people with depression didn't seek help due to stigma. To combat this, I created a public service ad \\"It's OK to not be OK,\\" published in China with widespread support. We researched existing methods of depression diagnosis and found them time-consuming and inaccurate. Thus, we aimed to develop an efficient self-diagnosis method. Through our literature review, we identified specific microRNAs in the cerebrospinal fluid of major depressive disorder patients. We focused on the up-regulated microRNA, amilCP, and designed a detector using a filter paper strip biosensor and toehold switch. By transforming these recombinant plasmids into E. coli, the microRNA can trigger reporter protein expression. Throughout the process, I faced challenges, but communication with my teacher and teammates helped me overcome them. After successfully developing the test paper, we conducted experiments and noticed low sensitivities in the chromoproteins. I suggested replacing AmilCP with the lacZ gene to improve visibility. In conclusion, the iGEM program allowed me to discover societal problems and contribute to their improvement.

Elle stipule que la dispersion des résidus, ou des erreurs, est constante à travers toutes les valeurs des variables prédictives. En d'autres termes, l'hypothèse d'homogénéité de la variance suppose que la variance des résidus ne change pas en fonction des valeurs des variables prédictives. Cela signifie que la relation entre les variables prédictives et la variable dépendante est constante sur toute la gamme des valeurs des variables prédictives. Prenons un exemple simple pour illustrer cette hypothèse. Supposons que nous voulons étudier la relation entre le revenu (variable dépendante) et l'éducation et l'expérience professionnelle (variables prédictives) d'un groupe de personnes. Nous collectons des données sur ces variables pour un échantillon de personnes. Si l'hypothèse d'homogénéité de la variance est respectée, cela signifie que la variation du revenu est constante pour toutes les combinaisons possibles d'éducation et d'expérience professionnelle. Par exemple, si nous prenons deux personnes avec la même éducation mais des niveaux d'expérience différents, la variation du revenu devrait être similaire pour les deux personnes. Cependant, si l'hypothèse d'homogénéité de la variance est violée, cela signifie que la variation du revenu peut varier en fonction des combinaisons d'éducation et d'expérience professionnelle. Par exemple, si la variation du revenu est plus grande pour les personnes ayant une faible éducation et une faible expérience professionnelle que pour les personnes ayant une éducation plus élevée et une expérience professionnelle plus longue, cela indique une violation de l'hypothèse d'homogénéité de la variance. En résumé, l'hypothèse d'homogénéité de la variance pour une régression linéaire multiple suppose que la dispersion des résidus est constante à travers toutes les valeurs des variables prédictives. Elle est importante dans l'analyse de la relation entre les variables prédictives et la variable dépendante et permet d'assurer la validité des résultats de la régression. Si cette hypothèse est violée, des ajustements ou des transformations des variables peut être nécessaire pour corriger les problèmes potentiels."},{"instruction":"explique moi ce que signifie l'hypothèse de normalité pour une application de regression multiple en s'appuyant sur des exemples simples","output":"L'hypothèse de normalité est une autre hypothèse importante dans la régression linéaire multiple. Elle suppose que les résidus, ou les erreurs, de la régression suivent une distribution normale. Cela signifie que les valeurs des résidus sont réparties symétriquement autour de zéro et suivent une courbe en forme de cloche. L'hypothèse de normalité est importante car elle permet de faire des inférences statistiques plus robustes et facilite l'utilisation de tests d'hypothèses et d'intervalles de confiance. Elle implique également que les estimations des coefficients de la régression sont effectivement les meilleures estimations linéaires non biaisées (BLUE). Pour comprendre cette hypothèse, prenons un exemple simple. Supposons que nous voulions examiner la relation entre la consommation de calories (variable dépendante) et le poids et la taille (variables prédictives) d'un échantillon de personnes. Selon l'hypothèse de normalité, les résidus de cette régression linéaire multiple devraient suivre une distribution normale. Cela signifie que les résidus pourraient être aussi bien positifs que négatifs et seraient répartis de manière équilibrée de part et d'autre de zéro. Par exemple, si nous trouvons que les résidus de notre régression linéaire multiple sont effectivement distribués de manière normale, cela indiquerait que nos prédictions de consommation de calories pour chaque individu sont en moyenne aussi précises que possible. Cependant, si l'hypothèse de normalité est violée, cela signifie que les résidus ne suivent pas une distribution normale. Par exemple, si les résidus ont une distribution asymétrique ou présentent des valeurs aberrantes, cela suggère une violation de l'hypothèse de normalité. Dans ce cas, il peut être nécessaire d'explorer davantage les raisons de la violation de l'hypothèse et d'envisager des transformations des variables ou d'ajuster le modèle pour prendre en compte des variables supplémentaires qui pourraient améliorer l'ajustement du modèle aux données. En résumé, l'hypothèse de normalité pour une régression linéaire multiple suppose que les résidus suivent une distribution normale et que les valeurs des résidus sont symétriquement réparties autour de zéro. Cette hypothèse facilite l'interprétation des résultats et permet de faire des inférences statistiques appropriées."},{"instruction":"explique moi ce que signifie l’hypothèse de linéarité pour une application de régression multiple en s’appuyant sur des exemples simples","output":"L'hypothèse de linéarité est une hypothèse clé dans la régression linéaire multiple. Elle suppose que la relation entre les variables prédictives et la variable dépendante peut être modélisée par une relation linéaire. En d'autres termes, elle suppose que l'effet de chaque variable prédictive sur la variable dépendante est constant et proportionnel. Prenons un exemple simple pour illustrer cette hypothèse. Supposons que nous voulons étudier la relation entre la quantité de ventes (variable dépendante) et le prix et la publicité (variables prédictives) d'un produit. Selon l'hypothèse de linéarité, nous supposons qu'il existe une relation linéaire entre les variables prédictives et la variable dépendante. Par exemple, nous pouvons supposer que chaque augmentation d'une unité dans le prix entraînera une diminution constante dans les ventes, et chaque augmentation d'une unité dans le budget publicitaire entraînera une augmentation constante dans les ventes. Cependant, il est important de noter que l'hypothèse de linéarité ne limite pas nécessairement la forme fonctionnelle des relations entre les variables. Par exemple, si nous soupçonnons une relation non linéaire entre le prix et les ventes (par exemple, une relation décroissante jusqu'à un certain point puis croissante), nous pouvons créer des termes polynomiaux ou des transformations pour capturer cette relation dans le modèle linéaire multiple. Si l'hypothèse de linéarité est violée, cela signifie que la relation entre les variables prédictives et la variable dépendante ne peut pas être modélisée de manière appropriée en utilisant une relation linéaire. Dans ce cas, des techniques plus avancées, telles que la régression non linéaire, peuvent être nécessaires pour modéliser correctement la relation. En résumé, l'hypothèse de linéarité suppose que la relation entre les variables prédictives et la variable dépendante peut être modélisée par une relation linéaire. Cela permet de simplifier le modèle et facilite l'estimation des paramètres.

Quelles sont les opportunités de recherche futures dans l'application de la régression multiple pour modéliser et prédire l'inflation dans différentes économies ? Quelles sont les améliorations possibles pour améliorer l'exactitude des prévisions ?"},{"instruction":"suite a la question précédente , donnez moi quelques éléments de réponse pour le problème posé","output":"Voici quelques éléments de réponse pour le problème posé de prédiction de l'inflation à l'aide de la régression multiple : 1. L'inflation est une augmentation générale et durable des prix dans une économie au fil du temps. Elle est importante car elle affecte le pouvoir d'achat des consommateurs, l'investissement des entreprises et la politique monétaire des gouvernements. 2. Les variables économiques candidates qui pourraient influencer l'inflation pourraient inclure le taux de croissance du PIB, le taux de chômage, les taux d'intérêt, la masse monétaire, les prix du pétrole, les prix des matières premières, l'indice des prix à la consommation, etc. 3. Pour modéliser et prédire l'inflation à l'aide de la régression multiple, nous pouvons utiliser ces variables économiques comme variables prédictives et l'inflation comme variable dépendante. Les coefficients estimés dans le modèle de régression indiquent comment chaque variable prédictive influence l'inflation. 4. La normalité des résidus dans la régression multiple est importante car elle garantit que les estimations des coefficients sont non biaisées et que les intervalles de confiance et les tests statistiques sont valides. La normalité des résidus peut être vérifiée en utilisant des tests statistiques tels que le test de Shapiro-Wilk ou en traçant un histogramme des résidus. 5. En plus de l'hypothèse de normalité des résidus, d'autres hypothèses clés de la régression multiple doivent être prises en compte, telles que l'indépendance des résidus, l'homogénéité de la variance (homoscédasticité) et l'absence de corrélation sérielle (autocorrélation) dans les résidus. 6. Les avantages de l'utilisation de la régression multiple pour prédire l'inflation comprennent sa simplicité, sa flexibilité pour inclure plusieurs variables explicatives et sa capacité à estimer les effets individuels de chaque variable indépendante. Les limitations comprennent l'interprétation des coefficients, la colinéarité entre les variables prédictives et les hypothèses strictes de la régression. 7. Pour évaluer la qualité du modèle de régression pour prédire l'inflation, des mesures telles que le coefficient de détermination (R-carré), l'erreur quadratique moyenne (RMSE) ou le test de significativité des coefficients peuvent être utilisées. Une validation croisée peut également être effectuée pour évaluer la performance prédictive du modèle. 8. Les défis potentiels rencontrés lors de l'application de la régression multiple pour prédire l'inflation incluent la présence de données manquantes, la violation des hypothèses de la régression et la sélection des variables prédictives les plus pertinentes. Ces défis peuvent être résolus en utilisant des techniques de pré-traitement des données appropriées et en effectuant une analyse rigoureuse de la qualité du modèle. 9. Les prévisions d'inflation produites par le modèle de régression multiple peuvent être utilisées par les gouvernements, les banques centrales, les entreprises et les investisseurs pour prendre des décisions économiques, élaborer des politiques monétaires et financières et gérer les risques. 10. Les opportunités de recherche futures dans l'application de la régression multiple pour prédire l'inflation incluent l'amélioration des modèles en incluant de nouvelles variables explicatives, l'exploration de méthodes plus avancées de traitement des données manquantes ou de variables catégorielles, et l'étude de l'effet des chocs économiques externes sur l'inflation.

Données économiques : Il faut disposer de données historiques sur l'inflation dans l'économie, ainsi que sur d'autres variables économiques qui peuvent influencer l'inflation. Cela peut inclure le taux de chômage, le PIB, les niveaux de consommation, les taux d'intérêt, les dépenses gouvernementales, etc. 2. Période de temps : Les données doivent être collectées sur une période de temps suffisamment longue pour pouvoir identifier des tendances et des relations statistiques significatives. 3. Sources de données fiables : Il est important de s'assurer que les données utilisées sont fiables et provenant de sources officielles ou réputées. 4. Fréquence des données : La fréquence des données utilisées peut varier en fonction des disponibilités, mais généralement des données mensuelles ou trimestrielles sont utilisées pour analyser les tendances de l'inflation. 5. Données comparables : Il est essentiel de s'assurer que les données utilisées sont comparables sur la même base (par exemple, en termes nominaux ou réels). En ce qui concerne les hypothèses nécessaires : 1. Linéarité : La modélisation de régression multiple suppose une relation linéaire entre la variable dépendante (l'inflation) et les variables indépendantes (les autres variables économiques). Cela implique que les changements dans ces variables sont linéairement liés aux changements dans l'inflation. 2. Indépendance des erreurs : La régression multiple suppose que les erreurs sont indépendantes entre elles, c'est-à-dire qu'il n'y a pas de corrélation entre elles. 3. Absence de colinéarité : Les variables indépendantes doivent être indépendantes les unes des autres, c'est-à-dire qu'il ne doit pas y avoir de corrélation élevée entre elles. La colinéarité peut rendre difficile l'identification des effets individuels de chaque variable sur l'inflation. Il convient de noter que ces données et hypothèses peuvent varier en fonction du contexte spécifique de chaque économie et des choix du modèle utilisé."},{"instruction":"suite à la question precedente pouvez me dire comment introduire les données que vous venez de presenter sous le logiciel spss","output":"Pour introduire les données que vous avez présentées dans le logiciel SPSS, vous pouvez suivre les étapes suivantes : 1.
