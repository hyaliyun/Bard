Let's go step-by-step through our analysis: 1. **Step 1: Simplifying Logarithmic Inequalities**     Recall that (log_a frac{1}{b} = -log_a b) and (log_a sqrt{b} = frac{1}{2} log_a b).          Given (log_a b = k), where (k) is an integer, the inequalities become:     [     -k > frac{1}{2}k > log_a b^2.     ]     Further, (log_a b^2 = 2log_a b = 2k).          Therefore, the inequalities simplify to:     [     -k > frac{1}{2}k > 2k.     ] 2. **Step 2: Solving the System of Inequalities**     To solve this system of inequalities:     [     -k > frac{1}{2}k quad text{and} quad frac{1}{2}k > 2k.     ]     From (-k > frac{1}{2}k):     [     -k > 0.5k implies -1 > 0.5 implies -2k > k implies -2 > k.     ]     From (frac{1}{2}k > 2k):     [     0.5k > 2k implies 0.5 > 2 implies k(0.5 - 2k) > 2k implies frac{1}{2}k > 2k implies 0.5 > 2.     ]         Combining the results:     [     -2 < k < 0.     ]     This gives us (-2 < k < 0), meaning the only integer value (k) can take within this range is (k = -1).     So, (log_{a} b = -1). 3. **Step 3: Verifying the Conclusions**    Given (k = -1): (log_{a} b = -1), hence (a^{-1} = b) or (b = frac{1}{a}).     Now we analyze each of the conclusions:    - (1) (frac{1}{b} > sqrt{b} > a^2):      Since (b = frac{1}{a}):      - (frac{1}{b} = a),      - (sqrt{b} = sqrt{frac{1}{a}} = frac{1}{sqrt{a}}),      - Thus, (a > frac{1}{sqrt{a}}), and (sqrt{a} > frac{1}{a^{2}}),      This inequality needs to be checked against the actual values of (a) and (b).    - (2) (log_{a} b + log_{a} a = 0):      [      log_{a} b = -1, quad log_{a} a = 1, quad -1 + 1 = 0,      ]      This statement appears to be true.    - (3) (0 < a < b < 1):      If (b = frac{1}{a}) and (0 < a < 1), (0 < frac{1}{a}) indicating b>1 not less than one - This statement might not be true because it contradicts (b < 1).    - (4) (ab = 1):      Since (b = frac{1}{a}):      [      a cdot frac{1}{a} = 1,      ]      This statement is true.

If s^{2} = 0, this implies that sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - overline{x})^{2} = 0. For the sum of squares to be zero, each term in the sum must be zero, i.e., (x_{i} - overline{x})^{2} = 0 for all i.

Therefore, the equation of ellipse C is boxed{dfrac {x^{2}}{12}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1}. (ii) Substituting the line x-y-2=0 into the equation of the ellipse dfrac {x^{2}}{12}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1 and eliminating y, we get x^{2} - 3x = 0. We find solutions x=0 or x=3. Hence, points A(0,-2) and B(3,1) lie on the ellipse and the line, and so |AB| = sqrt {(3-0)^{2}+(1+2)^{2}} = 3sqrt {2}. To maximize the area of triangle PAB, point P on ellipse C should be furthest from line l. Let's find the line passing through point P parallel to line l, with equation y=x+b. Substituting y=x+b into the equation of the ellipse yields 4x^{2}+6bx+3(b^{2}-4)=0. Setting the discriminant Delta = (6b)^{2}-4 cdot 4 cdot 3(b^{2}-4)=0, we solve for b and get b = pm 4. Substituting b = pm 4 back into the equation 4x^{2}+6bx+3(b^{2}-4)=0, we find x = pm 3. From the problem statement, the maximum area occurs when point P has coordinates (-3,1). The distance d from point P(-3,1) to line l is d = dfrac {|-3-1-2|}{sqrt {1^{2}+(-1)^{2}}} = 3sqrt {2}.

Since the arbiters judged a different number of matches, we can order them such that:    - The first arbiter judged at least 1 match,    - The second arbiter judged at least 2 matches,    - �    - The mth arbiter judged at least m matches. 3. Consequently, the total number of matches judged by the arbiters is at least:    [    1 + 2 + ldots + m = frac{m(m+1)}{2}    ]    - On the other hand, the total number of matches played is:    [    1 + 2 + ldots + (n-1) = frac{(n-1)n}{2}    ] 4.

Now, solve the system of equations:    - From ( P(0) + P(2) = 0 ):      [      P(2) = -P(0)      ]    - Substitute ( P(2) = -P(0) ) into the first equation ( 1 = P(0) - P(1) + P(2) ):      [      1 = P(0) - P(1) - P(0)      ]      Simplifies to:      [      1 = -P(1) implies P(1) = -1      ]    - Substitute ( P(1) = -1 ) into ( P(0) + 2P(1) - 3P(2) = 0 ):      [      P(0) + 2(-1) - 3P(2) = 0 implies P(0) - 2 - 3P(2) = 0      ]      Since ( P(2) = -P(0) ), substitute it in:      [      P(0) - 2 - 3(-P(0)) = 0 implies P(0) - 2 + 3P(0) = 0 implies 4P(0) - 2 = 0 implies P(0) = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}      ]      Therefore:      [      P(0) = -1, quad P(2) = -P(0) = 1      ] 5. Assembling the polynomial:    [    P(x) = P(0) + P(1)x + P(2)x^2    ]    Substituting the determined values:    [    P(x) = -1 - x + x^2    ] 6.

To solve this problem, we use combinatorial methods along with the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's detail the steps as follows: 1. Define S as the set of all possible arrangements of the flags. Then the total number of permutations of 3 red flags and 4 blue flags is calculated by: [ |S| = frac{7!}{3! cdot 4!} ] where (7!) is the factorial of 7, the total number of flags, and (3!) and (4!) are the factorials for the red and blue flags respectively, accounting for the repetitions of identical flags. Calculating this, we get: [ |S| = frac{5040}{6 cdot 24} = 35 ] 2. Define A_1 as the set of arrangements where all 3 red flags are together. If we view the block of 3 red flags as a single entity, we then have this \\"block\\" and the 4 blue flags to arrange. Therefore, we are arranging 5 entities (the block and 4 individual blue flags). We count the permutations of these 5 entities as follows: [ |A_1| = frac{5!}{1! cdot 4!} ] which is the number of ways to arrange 1 block of red flags among individual blue flags. Calculating this, we have: [ |A_1| = frac{120}{1 cdot 24} = 5 ] 3. Define A_2 as the set of arrangements where all 4 blue flags are together. If we view the block of 4 blue flags as a single entity, we then have this \\"block\\" and the 3 red flags to arrange. Therefore, we are arranging 4 entities (the block and 3 individual red flags). We count the permutations of these 4 entities as follows: [ |A_2| = frac{4!}{3! cdot 1!} ] which is the number of ways to arrange 1 block of blue flags among individual red flags. Calculating this, we have: [ |A_2| = frac{24}{6 cdot 1} = 4 ] 4. Next, we need to find the intersection of A_1 and A_2, denoted as A_1 cap A_2. This represents arrangements where both all red flags and all blue flags are in their respective blocks. In this situation, we treat the blocks of red flags and blue flags as two single entities, therefore we arrange 2 blocks. The number of such permutations is: [ |A_1 cap A_2| = frac{2!}{1! cdot 1!} ] Calculating this gives: [ |A_1 cap A_2| = 2 ] 5. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of desired arrangements where neither all red flags nor all blue flags are completely together.

This means that for any ( n ), ( a_{n+N} = a_n ). 3. **Considering Large Factorials:**    For large ( n ), the factorial ( n! ) contains many factors of 10 (since ( 10 = 2 times 5 )). The last nonzero digit of ( n! ) is determined by the product of the remaining digits after removing all factors of 10. 4. **Divisibility Argument:**    If ( N ) is the period, then for any large ( k ) and some ( M ), the number ( 10^k + M cdot 10^{k+1} ) must be divisible by ( N ).  5. **Prime Factorization of ( N ):**    Let ( N = AB ), where ( A ) contains only the factors 2 and 5, and ( B ) is relatively prime to 10.

Therefore, ((x, y) = left( frac{v^2 + 2}{u}, v right)) is also a solution. Since ((u, v)) was chosen to minimize ( u + v ), we must have:    [    frac{v^2 + 2}{u} geq u    ] 5. If ( u geq v + 1 ), then:    [    frac{v^2 + 2}{u} geq v + 1    ]    This implies:    [    v^2 + 2 geq u(v + 1)    ]    Since ( u geq v + 1 ), we have:    [    v^2 + 2 geq (v + 1)(v + 1) = v^2 + 2v + 1    ]    This simplifies to:    [    2 geq 2v + 1    ]    Which is impossible for positive integers ( v ). 6. Therefore, ( u ) must equal ( v ). Substituting ( u = v ) into the original equation:    [    u^2 + u^2 - a u^2 + 2 = 0 implies 2u^2 - a u^2 + 2 = 0 implies (2 - a)u^2 + 2 = 0    ]    For this to hold, ( a ) must be 4, which contradicts the assumption ( a neq 4 ). Thus, for ( a neq 4 ), there exist no pairs ((x, y)) of positive integers satisfying the equation. # Part (ii): Show that for ( a = 4 ), there exist infinite pairs ((x, y)) of positive integers satisfying the equation, and determine those pairs. 1. Let ( a = 4 ). The equation becomes:    [    x^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 2 = 0    ] 2. We need to show that there are infinite pairs ((x, y)) of positive integers satisfying this equation. Consider the sequence defined by:    [    a_1 = 1, quad a_2 = 3, quad a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - a_n    ] 3. We will show that ((x, y) = (a_n, a_{n+1})) satisfies the equation for all ( n in mathbb{Z}^+ ). 4. Base cases:    - For ( n = 1 ), ((x, y) = (a_1, a_2) = (1, 3)):      [      1^2 + 3^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 3 + 2 = 1 + 9 - 12 + 2 = 0      ]    - For ( n = 2 ), ((x, y) = (a_2, a_3) = (3, 11)):      [      3^2 + 11^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 11 + 2 = 9 + 121 - 132 + 2 = 0      ] 5. Inductive step: Assume ((a_n, a_{n+1})) satisfies the equation. We need to show ((a_{n+1}, a_{n+2})) also satisfies the equation:    [    a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - a_n    ]    Substituting into the equation:    [    a_{n+1}^2 + a_{n+2}^2 - 4a_{n+1}a_{n+2} + 2 = 0    ]    Using the recurrence relation:    [    a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - a_n    ]    We have:    [    a_{n+1}^2 + (4a_{n+1} - a_n)^2 - 4a_{n+1}(4a_{n+1} - a_n) + 2 = 0    ]    Simplifying:    [    a_{n+1}^2 + 16a_{n+1}^2 - 8a_{n+1}a_n + a_n^2 - 16a_{n+1}^2 + 4a_{n+1}a_n + 2 = 0    ]    [    a_{n+1}^2 + a_n^2 - 4a_{n+1}a_n + 2 = 0    ]    Which is the same as the original equation, confirming the inductive step. Thus, for ( a = 4 ), there exist infinite pairs ((x, y)) of positive integers satisfying the equation, given by the sequence ((a_n, a_{n+1})). The final answer is ( boxed{ (a_n, a_{n+1}) } ) where ( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3, a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - a_n )."},{"instruction":"f the price of a certain computer increased 30 percent from d dollars to 377 dollars, what is the ratio of the sum of the original price and the increased price to the original price?","output":"Let's denote the original price of the computer as d dollars.

From the given ( cos (A - B) ), use the Angle Difference Identity:    [    cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B    ]    Given (cos(A-B) = frac{31}{32}), we can recognize we need another method since we do not have enough straightforward details to apply specific trigonometric identities directly. 4.

Proof: 3. **Sections and Dividers:**     - Define a **section** as a divider plus the integers to its left, up to but not including the next divider.     - A **non-zero section** is a section that does not contain a zero. 4. **Monotonicity of Non-Zero Sections:**     - The integers in a non-zero section all have the same sign.     - As a consequence, the integers in the row ( T ) below a non-zero section form a strictly monotonic sequence.     - Therefore, a non-zero section in ( S ) contributes at most **one** divider in ( T ). 5. **Zero-containing Sections:**     - Consider a block of sections where the first section ends in a zero, and each of the subsequent sections either consists solely of a zero, or the final section consists of at least one non-zero integer:         - Example: ( 4260, 0, 0, 0, -3, -40 ). 6. **Analysis of Corresponding Sections in Row ( T ):**     - The row ( T ) below such a block can have zeros introduced below non-zero integers in the last section of ( S ), and under middle sections containing a single zero.     - In each of these cases, none of the numbers below the final section will be dividers.     - Thus, each middle section contributes at most one additional divider. 7. **Combining Results:**     - For any block, the row ( T ) below it can have at most:         - One divider per section due to the monotonic nature of non-zero sections.     - Also, integers following the final block in row ( S ) must all have the same sign, resulting in a strictly monotonic sequence in row ( T ), contributing just one more divider. 8. **Inductive Step:**     - Any row ( R_m ) starting from row ( R ) where ( m ge 0 ) and contains ( m ) dividers implies:         - ( R_{m+1} ) has at most ( m+1 ) dividers.     - Since row ( R ) contains no dividers, ( R_n ) will contain at most ( n ) dividers by induction, and thus at most ( n ) zeros: # Conclusion: [ boxed{n} ]"},{"instruction":"An 800meter long train takes 47.99616030717543 seconds to cross a man walking with a speed of 3 km/hr in the direction of the moving train. What is the speed of the train?","output":"To find the speed of the train, we need to calculate the relative speed between the train and the man. Since the man is walking in the direction of the moving train, we subtract his speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed. First, let's convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/s, because the length of the train is given in meters and the time in seconds. Speed of man in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed of man in m/s = 3 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of man in m/s = 3000 / 3600 Speed of man in m/s = 5/6 m/s Now, we know the train takes 47.99616030717543 seconds to cross the man, and the length of the train is 800 meters. The relative speed is the distance divided by the time. Relative speed in m/s = Distance / Time Relative speed in m/s = 800 m / 47.99616030717543 s Relative speed in m/s ≈ 16.668 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) This relative speed is the speed of the train minus the speed of the man. So, to find the speed of the train, we add the speed of the man to the relative speed. Speed of train in m/s = Relative speed + Speed of man Speed of train in m/s ≈ 16.668 m/s + 5/6 m/s Speed of train in m/s ≈ 16.668 m/s + 0.833 m/s Speed of train in m/s ≈ 17.501 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) Finally, let's convert the speed of the train back to km/hr. Speed of train in km/hr = (Speed in m/s) * (3600 s / 1 hr) * (1 km / 1000 m) Speed of train in km/hr ≈ 17.501 * (3600 / 1000) Speed of train in km/hr ≈ 17.501 * 3.6 Speed of train in km/hr ≈ 63.0036 km/hr Therefore, the speed of the train is approximately boxed{63.0036}  km/hr."},{"instruction":"Triangle ABC with right angle at C, angle BAC < 45^circ and AB = 6.

So we need ( S mod 11 equiv 5 ). 5. **Annipanni's Strategy**:    - Annipanni starts with a digit different from 0. We choose 5 for simplicity:      [      d_1 = 5      ]    - For subsequent moves, Annipanni writes the same digit that Boribon wrote in the previous move. 6. **Effect of Annipanni's Strategy**:    - Suppose Boribon writes ( b ) as his next move.    - Then, Annipanni writes ( b ) as her next move.    - Thus, every pair of consecutive digits ((d_i = b), (d_{i+1} = b)) have the form:      [      d_{2k}, d_{2k+1} = b text{ for } k in {1, 2, ldots, 50}.      ] 7. **Analyzing the Sum**:    - Consider the alternating sum ( S ): [ S = 5 - b + b - b + b - b + cdots + b - b ]    - All ( b )'s effectively cancel each other out:      [      S = 5      ]    - Here, every pair introduces a net zero contribution to the sum, except for the first digit 5. 8. **Conclusion**:    - The value of ( S ) under this strategy (Annipanni's strategy of copying Boribon's digit) will always be 5 (starting digit) and not involve ( b ) for any changes.    - Hence, ( S = b - 5 ).    - We require: [ b - 5 equiv 5 mod 11 Rightarrow b - 10 equiv 0 mod 11  ] - Condition ( boxed{b - 10 = -10 } ) which is not possible     -0 ≤ b ≤ 9.   Thus Annipanni wins. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A dandelion blooms in the morning, remains yellow for two days, becomes white on the third morning, and disperses by the evening.

Let ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) be the intersection points of ( l ) with ( Gamma ). Let ( Y ) and ( Z ) be the midpoints of ( AX_1 ) and ( AX_2 ), respectively. 3. **Parallelogram and Radius:**    Note that ( AYXZ ) forms a parallelogram. Thus, the radius of the circumcircle of ( triangle XYZ ) is the same as the radius of the circumcircle of ( triangle AYZ ).

Then, by using the method of summing the first and last terms, we can find the result of 1+2+3+…+1992+1993. After that, we can solve the problem. To find the sum of 1+2+3+…+1992+1993, we notice that there are 1993 terms in total. The sum of the first and last term is 1+1993=1994. Therefore, the sum of all terms is frac{1993 times 1994}{2} = 1993 times 997. Thus, the original expression can be rewritten as 2 times (1993 times 997) + 1994 = 2 times 1993 times 997 + 1994. To simplify, factor out 1994: 1994 times (2 times 997 + 1) = 1994 times 1995. Therefore, the sum is 1994 times 1995. Since the problem asks for the square of which number equals this sum, we need to find a number x such that x^2 = 1994 times 1995.

Since b and c are equal, they would be the real roots of the given quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation x^2 + px + q = 0 to have real and equal roots, the discriminant (Delta) must be zero. Therefore, for the given equation x^2 + (m+2)x + 6-m = 0, we use the discriminant: [Delta = (m+2)^2 - 4(6-m) = 0.] Expanding and simplifying, we get: [m^2 + 4m + 4 - 24 + 4m = 0,] [m^2 + 8m - 20 = 0,] [m^2 + 10m - 2m - 20 = 0,] [m(m + 10) - 2(m + 10) = 0,] [(m - 2)(m + 10) = 0.] Hence, m = 2 or m = -10. However, since the coefficient of x must be positive (as peak of the parabola should be negative for the sides of the triangle to be positive), we discard m = 2 and only consider m = -10. Case 2: a=5 is one of the equal sides, implying that either b=5 or c=5. Using Vieta's formulas, which state that the sum of the roots of the equation x^2 + px + q = 0 is -p and the product is q, we find: [b + c = -(m+2),] [bc = 6-m.] We know one of the sides is 5, without loss of generality, let b = 5.

This means that a=(1-x)e^{-x} has two different solutions.   Let y=(1-x)e^{-x}, then y′=(x-2)e^{-x}. Therefore, for x < 2, y′ < 0, and for x > 2, y′ > 0.

[    angle ACB text{ is acute}    ] 2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Property**:      Consider the position of C such that triangle ABC is acute-angled, and point P lies on the segment BC.

Because H traces a path along Omega_C and the angle angle AHX is equal to the angle angle ACB, both of which are constants, the geometric setup implies that X does not change. 5. **Fixed Point Invariance**:    Since the movement of C does not affect the structural role of H, the point X which lies on both the line PH and Omega_C remains invariant. 6. **Conclusion**:   Given this configuration, the fixed intersection point X remains consistent and independent of the position of C on the arc AB.

The total number of diagonals in an (n)-sided polygon is given by the formula:    [    frac{n(n-3)}{2}    ]    For (n = 6):    [    frac{6 times (6-3)}{2} = frac{6 times 3}{2} = 9    ]    So, there are 9 diagonals in a hexagon. 2. **Calculate the Total Number of Pairs of Diagonals**:    Since two diagonals are chosen independently, the total number of ways to choose 2 diagonals from 9 is given by the combination formula (binom{n}{k}):    [    binom{9}{2} = frac{9 times 8}{2 times 1} = 36    ] 3. **Identify the Types of Diagonals**:    In a hexagon, diagonals can be categorized into two types:    - **Principal Diagonals**: These diagonals connect opposite vertices of the hexagon and there are 3 of them (e.g., (AD), (BE), (CF)).    - **Non-Principal Diagonals**: The remaining 6 diagonals which are not principal diagonals (e.g., (AC), (AE), (BD), (BF), (CE), (DF)). 4. **Count the Intersecting Diagonals**:    Diagonals that intersect inside the hexagon form pairs at intersection points. To count the total number of such intersection points:    - Each non-principal diagonal intersects exactly 3 other diagonals.    - Each principal diagonal intersects exactly 4 other diagonals.    Calculating total intersections:    - There are 6 non-principal diagonals, each intersecting 3 others, so:      [      6 times 3 = 18      ]    - There are 3 principal diagonals, each intersecting 4 others, so:      [      3 times 4 = 12      ]    But each intersection point is counted twice in the above totals (once for each diagonal involved in the intersection), so the total number of distinct intersection points is:    [    frac{18 + 12}{2} = 15    ] 5. **Calculate the Probability**:    The probability that two randomly chosen diagonals intersect inside the hexagon is the ratio of the number of intersecting pairs to the total number of pairs of diagonals:    [    frac{text{Number of intersecting pairs}}{text{Total number of pairs}}    ]    Therefore, the probability is:    [    frac{15}{36} = frac{5}{12}    ] # Conclusion: The probability that two randomly chosen diagonals in a convex hexagon intersect inside the hexagon is: [ boxed{frac{5}{12}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let (ABCD) be a cyclic quadrilateral.

Since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, triangles triangle ASB and triangle CSD are similar due to the Inscribed Angle Theorem and similarity properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.    b. Given the ratios frac{AE}{EB} = frac{CF}{FD}, we can express these proportions in terms of segments from the intersection point S:    [    frac{AE}{EB} = frac{CF}{FD} implies frac{AE}{CF} = frac{AB}{CD}    ]    Thus,    [    frac{AS}{CS} = frac{AB}{CD}    ]    By the angle bisector theorem applied to point E and point F,    [    frac{SE}{SF} = frac{SA}{SC} = frac{AB}{CD}    ]    This implies that the point P lies along the bisector SP of triangle FSE.     c. As a result, angle angle ESP = angle FSP, and consequently, SP is not only the angle bisector in triangle FSE but also implies that angle ASP = angle BSP. This further implies that segment SP is the angle bisector of triangle ASB. Hence, P is accordingly positioned such that:    d. Since P falls on SP, an angle bisector of a triangle breaks the triangle's area into proportions equivalent to the opposing sides:    [    frac{[APD]}{[BPC]} = frac{AD}{BC}    ]    This confirms that this proportion remains constant, showing that the ratio of the areas of triangle APD and triangle BPC does not depend on the selection of E and F. 2. **Case 2: Lines AD and BC) are parallel.**    a. In this scenario, quadrilateral ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid with AB = CD.    b. Since BE = DF and E and F are both equidistant from the central line segment connecting the midpoints of AB and CD:    c. Let M and N be the midpoints of AB and CD, respectively. Given M as the midpoint, ME = NF follows directly. As a result, P, the midpoint of EF, lies on line MN.    d.

The player who makes the total exactly 100 wins. We need to identify which player has a winning strategy assuming both play optimally. 2. **Identifying Winning and Losing Positions**:    - The position at 100 is a winning position.    - If a player reaches a position where they can force the opponent to be at a losing position in the next move, that current position is a winning position.    - A losing position is a position where any possible move results in placing the opponent at a winning position. 3. **Determining the Positions**:    - Clearly, 100 is a winning position.    - The positions immediately before 100 are 90 through 99; any total within this range is a winning position since the next player can make a move to reach exactly 100.    - Therefore, we mark positions 90, 91, ..., 99 as winning. 4. **Backward Induction**:    - If a player moves from position 89, they will be forced to place the opponent in a winning position (since adding any number from 1 to 10 to 89 results in a total from 90 to 99).    - Hence, 89 is a losing position.    - Similarly, starting from any position in the range 79 through 88, a player can move to 89, placing the opponent in a losing position.    - Positions 79 through 88 are thus winning positions.    - Continuing this pattern, we observe:      - 78 is a losing position,      - 67 through 77 are winning positions,      - 66 is a losing position,      - and so on. 5. **Identifying a Pattern**:    - The losing positions appear every 11th number backward from 100: (100, 89, 78, 67, 56, 45, 34, 23, 12, 1). 6. **Strategy for Alice**:    - Alice, by starting first, should aim to leave Bob in a losing position.    - Since 1 is a losing position and Alice starts with 0, she should add 1 in her first move making the total 1, thus placing Bob in a losing position right at Bob's first turn.    - Alice can then continue to play by maintaining the opponent (Bob) in losing positions subsequently. **Conclusion**: - Since Alice can immediately place Bob in a losing position from her very first move and maintain that throughout the game, Alice has a winning strategy.

[    S = { (a, b) mid 1 leq a, b leq 5, a, b in mathbb{Z} }    ]    S contains all integer points in the range (1 leq a, b leq 5). 2. **Consider a Single Element in T:**    Suppose T contains only one point, say Q = (x_0, y_0). We need to check if this configuration is possible. Select any point P = (x_1, y_1) in S such that ( (x_1, y_1) neq (x_0, y_0) ). We can ensure that x_1 and x_0 have the same parity, and y_1 and y_0 have the same parity. 3. **Evaluate the Midpoint Condition:**    If both x_1 and x_0 (likewise y_1 and y_0) have the same parity, the midpoint M of the segment PQ is given by:    [    M = left( frac{x_1 + x_0}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_0}{2} right)    ]    Since both sums ( x_1 + x_0 ) and ( y_1 + y_0 ) are even, the midpoint M will always be an integer point in S. This contradicts the requirement that no other integer points should lie on segment PQ. 4. **Conclusion from the Evaluation**:     Thus, it is not possible for T to contain only one point. Therefore, T must contain at least two points.  5. **Consider Two Elements in T:**    Suppose T contains exactly two points.

This property will be useful in understanding how f(x) behaves across different intervals. 2. **Decreasing on [0,2]:** Since f(x) is decreasing on [0,2], for any x_1, x_2 in [0,2] with x_1 < x_2, we have f(x_1) > f(x_2). 3. **Extension to [-2,0]:** Given that f(x) is odd, the decreasing nature of f(x) on [0,2] implies it is also decreasing on [-2,0]. This is because, for any x in [-2,0], f(x) = -f(-x), and since -x in [0,2], the function values mirror and invert across the origin, preserving the decreasing order. 4. **Periodicity from f(x-2) = -f(x):** This condition implies that f(x) repeats its values in a cycle of length 4, because applying the rule twice, f(x-4) = -f(x-2) = f(x).

Let's first find out how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 17. To do this, we divide 1000 by 17: 1000 ÷ 17 = 58 with a remainder This means there are 58 full sets of 17 within 1000. But since we are including 1 in our range, we need to check if 1 more number is divisible by 17. The next multiple of 17 after 58*17 would be 59*17, which is 1003, outside our range. So, there are 58 numbers divisible by 17 between 1 and 1000. Now, for each number n divisible by 17, the number n + 1 is not divisible by 17, and for each number n + 1 divisible by 17, the number n is not divisible by 17.

For Xiao Hong:   280 times frac{2}{2+3+4+5}   = 280 times frac{2}{14},   = 40 (times);   For Xiao Fang: 280 times frac{3}{14} = 60 (times);   For Xiao Ying: 280 times frac{4}{14} = 80 (times);   For Xiao Ping: 280 - 40 - 60 - 80 = 100 (times);   Answer: Xiao Hong, Xiao Fang, Xiao Ying, and Xiao Ping kicked the shuttlecock 40, 60, 80, and 100 times, respectively.   Thus, the answer is: boxed{40, 60, 80, 100}.   Since half of Xiao Hong's kicks are equivalent to one-third of Xiao Fang's kicks, the ratio of the number of kicks between Xiao Hong and Xiao Fang is frac{1}{3} : frac{1}{2} = 2 : 3. Similarly, the ratio between Xiao Hong and Xiao Ying is frac{1}{4} : frac{1}{2} = 1 : 2, and the ratio between Xiao Hong and Xiao Ping is frac{1}{5} : frac{1}{2} = 2 : 5. Therefore, the ratio of the number of kicks among Xiao Hong, Xiao Fang, Xiao Ying, and Xiao Ping is: 2 : 3 : 4 : 5. From this, we know that Xiao Hong's kicks account for frac{2}{2+3+4+5} of the total, which is 280 times frac{2}{2+3+4+5} kicks. Similarly, we can calculate the others accordingly.

By using trigonometric identities, we have f(x) = sin^2 x + 2sin x cos x + cos^2 x + cos 2x. Recognizing that sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 and cos 2x = 1 - 2sin^2 x, we can further simplify to get f(x) = 1 + 2sin x cos x = 1 + sin 2x. Now let's apply another trigonometric identity: sin(2x+ frac{pi}{4}) = sin 2x cos frac{pi}{4} + cos 2x sin frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin 2x + cos 2x). Therefore, f(x) = 1 + sqrt{2}sinleft(2x+ frac{pi}{4}right). The function sinleft(2x+ frac{pi}{4}right) has a period of 2pi, so the minimal positive period for f(x) is half of that, which is pi. Thus, the minimal positive period of f(x) is boxed{pi}. (2) To find the monotonic intervals, we need to consider the derivative of f(x). Since f(x) is now expressed as f(x) = 1 + sqrt{2}sinleft(2x+ frac{pi}{4}right), we can derive its derivative: f'(x) = 2sqrt{2} cosleft(2x+ frac{pi}{4}right). Setting f'(x) geq 0 will give us the intervals where f(x) is increasing. Thus, we want to find the values of x where cosleft(2x+ frac{pi}{4}right) geq 0. Since costheta is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, we calculate for which intervals 2x + frac{pi}{4} falls within those quadrants. From the unit circle, we know that this happens when: 2kpi - frac{pi}{2} leq 2x + frac{pi}{4} leq 2kpi + frac{pi}{2}, where k is an integer. Solving for x, we obtain kpi - frac{3pi}{8} leq x leq kpi + frac{pi}{8}. For the interval left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], the value of k that fits within this range is k=0. So the corresponding interval for f(x) to be increasing is left[0, frac{pi}{8}right]. Hence, the monotonic increasing interval of f(x) on left[0, frac{pi}{2}right] is boxed{left[0, frac{pi}{8}right]}."},{"instruction":"f x cdot log_{27} 64 = 1, then 4^x + 4^{x} = ________.","output":"This problem involves the manipulation of logarithms, exponents, and finding function values.

This is equivalent to ( 5^n mod 10^m ).    - We need to show that there are infinitely many ( n ) such that ( 5^n mod 10^m ) has the desired parity properties. 3. **Pattern in Powers of 5:**    - Observe the pattern in the last digits of powers of 5:      [      begin{aligned}      5^1 & = 5       5^2 & = 25       5^3 & = 125       5^4 & = 625       5^5 & = 3125       end{aligned}      ]    - Notice that the last digit of ( 5^n ) is always 5. This satisfies ( a_1 = 5 ). 4. **Generalizing the Pattern:**    - For ( m = 2 ), the last two digits of ( 5^n ) are:      [      begin{aligned}      5^1 & = 05       5^2 & = 25       5^3 & = 25       5^4 & = 25       end{aligned}      ]    - For ( m = 3 ), the last three digits of ( 5^n ) are:      [      begin{aligned}      5^1 & = 005       5^2 & = 125       5^3 & = 625       5^4 & = 125       5^5 & = 625       end{aligned}      ]    - We see that the last ( m ) digits of ( 5^n ) for ( n geq 2 ) are periodic with a period of ( 4 ) for ( m = 3 ). 5. **Inductive Argument:**    - We can generalize this observation for any ( m ). The sequence of the last ( m ) digits of ( 5^n ) will eventually repeat with a period that depends on ( m ).    - Since the sequence repeats, there are infinitely many ( n ) that satisfy the condition. 6. **Parity Condition:**    - The parity condition is satisfied because the sequence ( a_m, a_{m-1}, ldots, a_1 ) will have alternating parities due to the periodic nature of the last ( m ) digits of ( 5^n ). Therefore, we have shown that for any ( m > 1 ), there exist infinitely many positive integers ( n ) such that the last ( m ) digits of ( 5^n ) form a sequence where each digit except the last is of opposite parity to its successor.

If we choose cards labeled \\"4\\" and \\"5\\", their sum (4 + 5 = 9) is also less than 15.

Out of every thousand crucian carp, on average 375 remain in lake ( S ), and the rest end up in lake ( B ), with no crucian carp remaining in any other lakes. Determine how many streams are in the Valley of Five Lakes.","output":"Let's solve this problem step-by-step by identifying the conditions and requirements mentioned in the problem statement and applying graph theory principles. 1. **Understanding the Initial Setup:**    - We have five lakes, denoted as (S, A, B, C,) and (D).    - Small fish are born in lake (S).    - Each fish transitions exactly four times between different lakes using the streams and eventually stays in the lake they end up in.    - It's known that out of every thousand fish:      - 375 fish end up in lake (S).      - The remaining 625 end up in lake (B).      - No fish end up in lakes (A, C,) or (D). 2. **Defining Transitions:**    - A \\"route of length (n)\\" is defined as a sequence of jumps through (n) streams. Our goal is to understand the possible routes that fish can take. 3. **Initial Observations:**    - Since no fish end up in lakes (A, C, D), there must be no routes leading to these lakes after 2 or more transitions.    - Therefore, any direct connections to (A,C,D) must not lead to them having fish after the fourth transition. 4. **Key Assertions:**        - From lake (S), there should be no route of length 2 leading to lakes (A, C, D).      - **Proof:** If there existed a route (S to C to A), then (S) would have a non-zero probability of linking to (A) within 4 transitions, which contradicts the given constants.    - From lake (S), there should be no direct connections of length 2 leading to (C) or (D) either. 5. **Connecting Lakes (S) and (B):**    - It’s necessary to have a route of length exactly 2 from (S) to (B).      - **Proof:** Since 625 fish ultimately end up in (B) and only via 4 jumps, there must exist a route that efficiently transitions them from (S) to (B) while not leading astray. 6. **Possible Routes Between Lakes:**        - To maintain the distribution, there must be efficient routes from (S) to (B), and none leading the transition to (A, C,) or (D) via any length greater than 1. 7. **Graph Configuration:**    - Considering the problem constraints and equilibrium required in transitions, we form a simple connectivity structure:            - Direct Stream Routes:        [        S to A to B        ]      - Thus:        - (S) links directly to (A).        - (A) links directly to (B).        - (S) thereby connects to (B) via a two-step route, and there exist similar valid routes involving other intermediary lakes assuming symmetric probability distributions. 8. **Defining Specific Streams:**    - Given the lack of fish in (A, C), and (D) ultimately, we derive:      - The interconnected streams must prevent ultimate settlement in 3 nodes (A, C, D). 9. **Final Analysis:**    - Considering previous logical evolutions, we confirm:      - Using three specific streams permissible due to operational confines becomes the most optimized approach.    # Conclusion: Given the constraints and optimized pathways to allow balanced fish settlement while adhering to step specifications between lakes: The total number of streams in the Valley of Five Lakes is:   [ boxed{3} ]"},{"instruction":"Fred has some red balloons, Sam has 46 red balloons, and Dan has 16 red balloons.

What is the condition for the problem to be solvable?","output":"To solve the given problem, we need to construct a circle such that the lengths of the tangents drawn from the points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) to the circle are equal to ( d ). We will outline the detailed steps and necessary conditions to achieve this. 1. **Introduction to the problem**:     Given three points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) in a plane, and a distance ( d ). Our task is to construct a circle such that the lengths of the tangents from each of these points to the circle is exactly ( d ). 2. **Construct tangents**:    Let's denote the tangency points on the circle for ( A, B, ) and ( C ) as ( E_1, E_2, ) and ( E_3 ) respectively. 3. **Identify right triangles**:    Consider the right triangles formed where the circle's center ( O ) and the points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) form right angles at the points of tangency. Therefore, triangles ( AE_1O, BE_2O, ) and ( CE_3O ) are right triangles with:    - One leg equal to ( d ) (length of the tangent),    - The other leg equal to the radius of the circle, ( r' ). 4. **Equality of Hypotenuses**:    Since these triangles are similar, all hypotenuses ( OA, OB, ) and ( OC ) are equal. Denote the common length as ( r ):    [    OA = OB = OC = r    ]    Here, ( r ) is the circumradius of the circumcircle of triangle ( ABC ), the circle passing through points ( A, B, ) and ( C ). 5. **Calculation of radius ( r' )**:    Using the Pythagorean theorem for one of the triangles (e.g., ( AE_1O )), we have:    [    AO^2 = AE_1^2 + OE_1^2     ]    Given ( AE_1 = d ) and ( OE_1 = r' ):    [    r^2 = d^2 + r'^2     ]    Solving for ( r' ):    [    r'^2 = r^2 - d^2     ]    [    r' = sqrt{r^2 - d^2}     ] 6. **Conditions for constructibilty**:    - The points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) should not be collinear. Otherwise, a unique circumcircle cannot be defined.     - The distance ( d ) must be less than the circumradius ( r ), i.e., ( d < r ). If ( d = r ), then ( r' = 0 ), and hence the circle degenerates to a point. # Conclusion: The circle we seek can only be constructed if: 1. Points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are not collinear, 2. The distance ( d ) is strictly less than the circumradius ( r ). Therefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a circle are: [ 1. text{Points } A, B, text{ and } C text{ are not collinear}, ] [ 2. d < r. ] If these conditions are met, there exists exactly one such circle.

Therefore, for x leq -2, we have f(x) = e^{-(x+1)} - 2. To find the roots of f(x) = 0, we set e^{x+1} - 2 = 0 for x > -2 and e^{-(x+1)} - 2 = 0 for x leq -2. For x > -2, solving e^{x+1} - 2 = 0 gives x+1 = ln{2}, so x = ln{2} - 1. Since ln{2} - 1 is between -1 and 0, it corresponds to k = 0. For x leq -2, solving e^{-(x+1)} - 2 = 0 gives -(x+1) = ln{2}, so x = -ln{2} - 1. Since -ln{2} - 1 is less than -1 and greater than -2, it does not correspond to any integer k in the given range. However, considering the symmetry of the even function and the fact that we must also consider the behavior of the function for x < -2 based on its definition, we realize that the analysis for x leq -2 should correctly reflect the symmetry and thus might involve finding roots that mirror those found for x > -2 across the y-axis.

So far, it has eaten 60 segments from the first millipede and will eat 500 segments from the 10 millipedes. Therefore, the total number of segments from the 2 millipedes with unknown length is: 800 (total needed) - 60 (first millipede) - 500 (10 millipedes) = 240 segments Since there are 2 millipedes with this unknown length, we divide 240 by 2 to find the length of each: 240 segments / 2 millipedes = 120 segments/millipede Now we have the length of the 2 millipedes (120 segments each) and the length of the first millipede (60 segments). To find the ratio of the length of the 2 millipedes to the length of the first millipede, we can write: (2 millipedes * 120 segments/millipede) : 60 segments = 240 segments : 60 segments To simplify the ratio, we divide both sides by 60: 240 segments / 60 segments : 60 segments / 60 segments = 4 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of the length of the 2 millipedes to the length of the first millipede is boxed{4:1} ."},{"instruction":"31 of the scientists that attended a certain workshop were wolf prize laureates, and 18 of these were also nobel prize laureates.

This implies that the longest path in the graph has fewer than ( 1062 ) vertices. 2. **Graph Theoretical Implications**:    - By the given condition, the graph ( G ) does not contain a path of length ( 1061 ) (i.e., ( 1062 ) vertices).    - This implies that the graph ( G ) has a property that any subset of ( 1062 ) vertices must contain at least one pair of vertices that are not connected by an edge. 3. **Partitioning the Graph**:    - We need to find two disjoint sets ( A ) and ( B ) each containing ( 477 ) vertices such that there are no edges between any vertex in ( A ) and any vertex in ( B ).    - Consider the complement graph ( overline{G} ) of ( G ). In ( overline{G} ), an edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is no edge between them in ( G ). 4. **Applying Turán's Theorem**:    - Turán's theorem states that for a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices, if ( G ) does not contain a complete subgraph ( K_{r+1} ), then the number of edges in ( G ) is at most (left(1 - frac{1}{r}right) frac{n^2}{2}).    - In our case, since ( G ) does not contain a path of length ( 1061 ), it implies that ( overline{G} ) must contain a large independent set. 5. **Finding the Independent Sets**:    - We need to find two disjoint independent sets ( A ) and ( B ) in ( overline{G} ) each of size ( 477 ).    - Since ( overline{G} ) is the complement of ( G ), an independent set in ( overline{G} ) corresponds to a set of vertices in ( G ) where no two vertices are connected by an edge. 6. **Constructing the Sets ( A ) and ( B )**:    - By the pigeonhole principle and the constraints given, we can partition the ( 2016 ) vertices into two sets ( A ) and ( B ) each of size ( 477 ) such that there are no edges between any vertex in ( A ) and any vertex in ( B ) in ( G ).

Each child gave a gift to some other children, ensuring that no child gives more than one gift to the same child and no one gives a gift to themselves. The children end up receiving gifts in such a way that everyone receives exactly the same number of gifts, despite initially giving different numbers of gifts.    2. Because each child received a different number of gifts, ranging from 0 to N-1, it means that the total number of gifts given is:    [    text{Total number of gifts} = 0 + 1 + 2 + dots + (N-1) = frac{N(N-1)}{2}    ]    This follows from the sum of the first N-1 integers. 3. For each child to receive the same number of gifts, this total number of gifts must be divisible by N:    [    frac{N(N-1)}{2N} = frac{N-1}{2}    ]    Which implies that for the total number of gifts to be divisible by N, frac{N-1}{2} must be an integer. Thus, N must be odd since only then is N-1 even and frac{N-1}{2} is an integer. 4. Hence, N must be an odd number for this condition to hold true. 5. For illustrating with an example, we can use induction. Consider the base case:    - If N=1, no gifts are exchanged, and thus the condition is trivially satisfied. 6. Next, suppose the theorem holds true for N = k children, i.e., it is possible for k odd children to exchange gifts such that all individuals end up receiving the same number of gifts. Now, consider N = k + 2:    - Assume the last child (child ( k+2 )) gives 1 gift each to the already existing ( k+1 ) children.    - Each of these ( k+1 ) children then gives out gifts such that the new child ( k+2 ) and child ( 1 ) receives the correct number of gifts to ensure an equal distribution among all ( k+2 ) individuals. 7. This assumption and distribution can be shown by induction to follow the premise step-by-step ensuring that each step of adding one additional child does not break the condition of equal gift distribution among children. # Conclusion: Thus, N children can receive equal numbers of gifts from each other, provided that N is odd.

We start by using consistently two ladles of sizes ( sqrt{2} ) liters and ( 2 - sqrt{2} ) liters to transfer water between two infinitely large barrels. 2. Let us assume that we pour water from the first barrel to the second barrel using the first ladle (with a capacity of ( sqrt{2} ) liters) ( k_1 ) times, and from the second barrel to the first barrel ( k_2 ) times with the same ladle.  3. The total amount of water transferred from the first barrel to the second barrel using the first ladle would be: [ k_1 sqrt{2} - k_2 sqrt{2} = (k_1 - k_2) sqrt{2} = k sqrt{2} ]    Here, ( k = k_1 - k_2 ) is an integer which can be positive or negative. 4. Similarly, let us pour water from the first barrel to the second barrel using the second ladle (with a capacity of ( 2 - sqrt{2} ) liters) ( l_1 ) times, and from the second barrel to the first barrel ( l_2 ) times with the same ladle. 5. The total amount of water transferred from the first barrel to the second barrel using the second ladle would be: [ l_1 (2 - sqrt{2}) - l_2 (2 - sqrt{2}) = (l_1 - l_2) (2 - sqrt{2}) = l (2 - sqrt{2}) ]    Here, ( l = l_1 - l_2 ) is an integer. 6. To achieve exactly 1 liter of water transferred from the first barrel to the second barrel, we need to solve: [ k sqrt{2} + l (2 - sqrt{2}) = 1 ] 7. Rearranging this equation gives us: [ k sqrt{2} + l (2 - sqrt{2}) = 1 Rightarrow (l - k) sqrt{2} = 2l - 1 ] 8. Since ( sqrt{2} ) is an irrational number, the equation: [ sqrt{2} = frac{2l - 1}{l - k} ]    implies that the term ( frac{2l - 1}{l - k} ) should be an irrational number for the equation to hold true since ( sqrt{2} ) itself is irrational. 9. However, ( frac{2l - 1}{l - k} ) can only be irrational if ( l ) and ( k ) are such that ( l - k ) does not simplify the ratio to a rational number, which contradicts our requirement that ( l ) and ( k ) are integers. 10. The only possible rational solution would be if ( l - k = 0 ) (i.e., ( k = l )), which requires ( 2l - 1 = 0 ). Solving for ( l ), we get: [ 2l - 1 = 0 Rightarrow l = frac{1}{2} ]    But ( l ) must be an integer, hence ( l = frac{1}{2} ) is not a valid integer solution. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is impossible to transfer exactly 1 liter of water between the barrels using these two ladles.

Given are (2019) integers, and we need to color them in such a way that no two adjacent integers are differently colored with red or blue. The first player (甲) starts, and the two players take turns. The game ends when all numbers are colored or when one player cannot color any number without violating the rules. We are required to determine which player has a winning strategy. 1. **Initial Situation:**    The game starts with (甲) coloring a number (k). 2. **State Analysis:**    Define two critical states during the game:    - **State 1:** When the sum of the smallest and largest already colored numbers (a) and (b) respectively, is exactly (2020) and the two numbers (a) and (b) are of different colors.    - **State 2:** When all already colored numbers are continuously the same color, the sum of the smallest and largest already colored numbers (a) and (b) is either (2019) or (2021). 3. **Player 乙's Strategy (Step-by-Step):**      Step-by-Step Actions:     - **Round 1:** Suppose (甲) colors number (k).        - **Case 1:** If (k neq 1010), (乙) will color the number (2020 - k) in the opposite color to get to State 1.        - **Case 2:** If (k = 1010), (乙) will color the number (1009) red to achieve State 2.       State 1 Analysis:     - Assume the smallest and largest colored numbers are (a) and (b) respectively, and they are different colors. Thus, (a + b = 2020).     - The parity (odd/even) properties of (a) and (b) are the same, and there is an odd count of uncolored numbers between (a) and (b).      If (甲)’s Turn in State 1:     - **If (甲) colors (k) outside the range ([a, b])**: Then (乙) will color the number (2020 - k) in the opposite color (step back to State 1).     - **If (甲) colors (k) within the range ([a]), ([b]):**  There exists an odd number of uncolored numbers between (a) and (b), ensuring that (乙) can always color a valid number to maintain State 1.      State 2 Analysis:     - If the sum (a + b = 2019) or (2021), all colored numbers are the same color and there exists an odd number of uncolored numbers.     - **Case 1:** Only one number remains uncolored. (甲) must color it red, leading to (乙)’s win.     - **Case 2:** More numbers remain uncolored.       - (a geq 2) and (b leq 2017) because (a+b = 2019).       - **(乙)'s Response:**         - If (甲) colors (b+1) or (b+2), (乙) matches with coloring the next consecutive number in red.         - If colors are outside ([a-1, b+2]), (乙) uses the opposite to color (2020 - k) in blue to revert State 2. 4. **Conclusion:**    Given the above strategy, (乙) can always respond in a way to either revert back to State 1 or maintain State 2, ensuring a winning strategy.

Since the HCF is a factor of both numbers, we can express the two numbers as H * a and H * b, where a and b are co-prime (i.e., their HCF is 1). The LCM of two numbers is given by their product divided by their HCF. Since we know the other two factors of their LCM are 10 and 20, we can express the LCM as H * 10 * 20. We are given that the largest number is 840. This means that either H * a = 840 or H * b = 840. Since a and b are co-prime and we are looking for the largest number, we can assume without loss of generality that H * b = 840. Now, let's find the LCM of the two numbers using the formula: LCM = (H * a) * (H * b) / H LCM = H * a * b We know that LCM = H * 10 * 20, so: H * a * b = H * 10 * 20 Since H is common on both sides, we can cancel it out: a * b = 10 * 20 a * b = 200 Now, we know that H * b = 840, and we need to find a value for a such that a and b are co-prime. The most straightforward way to ensure a and b are co-prime is to let a = 1, which would make b = 200. However, since we are looking for the HCF and we have H * b = 840, we can find H by dividing 840 by b: H = 840 / b H = 840 / 200 Since 840 is not divisible by 200, we need to find the correct value of b that is a factor of 840 and also ensures that a and b are co-prime. The factors of 840 that are close to 200 are 210, 280, and 420. Out of these, 210 is the only one that when multiplied by 4 (which is co-prime with 210) gives us 840.

Let ( a^k_i ) denote the ( i )-th element of the sequence ( f^k(A) ), where indices are taken (pmod{N}).

The cricketer's new average after the match is 12.4 - 0.4 = 12.0 runs per wicket, so we can write the equation: (R + 26) / (W + 5) = 12.0 Now we have two equations: 1) R / W = 12.4 2) (R + 26) / (W + 5) = 12.0 We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of W.

This process is often referred to as developing or unrolling the 3D shape into a 2D plane. 2. **Possible Unfolding Methods**:     - There are three main ways to unfold a parallelepiped:         - Cut along edges parallel to ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) as needed to lay the parallelepiped flat.         - Each unfolding will result in different positions for the vertices ( M ) and ( N ), projecting their positions onto the plane. 3. **Calculating Distances**:     - Once unfolded, the distance between the new positions of ( M ) and ( N ) in the plane can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.     - Specifically, we obtain three possible distances:         [         sqrt{a^2 + (b+c)^2}         ]         [         sqrt{b^2 + (c+a)^2}         ]         [         sqrt{c^2 + (a+b)^2}         ] 4. **Select the Shortest Distance**:     - Given that ( a > b > c ), we need to compare the three distances calculated above to find which is the smallest.     - By observation, since ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are such that ( a > b > c ), it turns out that the smallest distance corresponds to:         [         sqrt{a^2 + (b+c)^2}         ]     - This can be justified by noting that ( (b+c) > (a+b) > (c+a) ), ensuring that ( sqrt{a^2 + (b+c)^2} ) gives the minimum length compared to the other two expressions. # Conclusion: The shortest distance on the surface between the vertex ( M ) and its opposite vertex ( N ) is: [ boxed{sqrt{a^2 + (b+c)^2}} ]"},{"instruction":"A store had eightyseven coloring books in stock.

We need to find the maximum number of points such that no three are collinear and no triangle formed is obtuse.    - For example, consider a regular polygon. In a regular polygon with more than 4 vertices, there will be obtuse angles. Hence, the maximum number of points in 2D is 4 (forming a square). 2. **Extending to 3D:**    - In three dimensions, we need to find a configuration of points such that no three points are collinear and no triangle formed by any three points is obtuse.    - Consider the vertices of a cube. A cube has 8 vertices, and no three vertices are collinear. Additionally, any triangle formed by the vertices of a cube is not obtuse because the angles between the edges of a cube are all ( frac{pi}{2} ) or ( frac{pi}{3} ). 3. **Verification for 8 Points:**    - Let's verify if 8 points (vertices of a cube) satisfy the conditions:      - No three points are collinear.      - Any triangle formed by these points is not obtuse.    - In a cube, the angles between any two edges meeting at a vertex are ( frac{pi}{2} ). The face diagonals form angles of ( frac{pi}{3} ) with the edges. Therefore, all triangles formed are either right or acute. 4. **Considering More than 8 Points:**    - If we try to add a 9th point, it will either lie inside or outside the cube. If it lies inside, it will form obtuse angles with some of the vertices of the cube. If it lies outside, it will form obtuse angles with some of the vertices of the cube due to the spatial arrangement.    - Therefore, adding more than 8 points will inevitably lead to the formation of obtuse triangles. 5. **Conclusion:**    - The maximum number of points in three-dimensional space such that no three points are collinear and no triangle formed is obtuse is 8.

(ii) A graph is kedgeconnected if and only if there are k edgedisjoint paths between any two vertices.","output":"Let's provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of the reference solution for each part of Menger's theorem. # Part (i): A graph G is k-connected if and only if for every pair of vertices u, v in V(G), there exist k internally disjoint paths connecting u and v. **Proof:** 1. **Assume** that for any pair of vertices ( u ) and ( v ) in ( G ), there are ( k ) internally disjoint paths between them. To show that ( G ) is k-connected:     *Note*: Internally disjoint paths between two vertices mean paths that share no internal vertex (other than the endpoints). 2. If ( G ) has ( k ) internally disjoint paths between any two vertices ( u ) and ( v ), then the removal of fewer than ( k ) vertices cannot disconnect ( u ) and ( v ), because at least one of these paths would still remain intact.  3. Therefore, G cannot be disconnected by removing fewer than k vertices. Hence, ( G ) is k-connected.  4. **Conversely**, suppose that ( G ) is k-connected and contains more than ( k ) vertices. We need to show that any two vertices ( u ) and ( v ) in ( G ) are connected by ( k ) internally disjoint paths. 5. Assume to the contrary that there exists a pair of vertices ( u ) and ( v ) that are not connected by ( k ) internally disjoint paths. According to Menger's Theorem (3.3.5 (i)), the minimum vertex cut separating ( u ) and ( v ) would have fewer than ( k ) vertices.  6. Let ( S ) be a minimum vertex cut for ( u ) and ( v ) in ( G ). Then |S| le k-1. Remove S from ( G ). In the resulting graph ( G setminus S ), vertices ( u ) and ( v ) are in different components.  7. Since G is k-connected, removing any set of fewer than k vertices cannot disconnect the graph. Therefore, |S| ge k. 8. There is a contradiction because |S| le k-1. Therefore, there must exist ( k ) internally disjoint paths between ( u ) and ( v ). # Part (ii): A graph G is ( k )-edge-connected if and only if for any pair of vertices ( u, v in V(G) ), there exist ( k ) edge-disjoint paths connecting ( u ) and ( v ). **Proof:** The proof follows directly from Menger's Theorem (3.3.5 (ii)). This theorem states that a graph is ( k )-edge-connected if there are at least ( k ) edge-disjoint paths between every pair of vertices in the graph. 1. **Assume** ( G ) is ( k )-edge-connected. For every pair of vertices ( u ) and ( v ), there exist ( k ) edge-disjoint paths connecting ( u ) and ( v ):    - If ( G ) is ( k )-edge-connected, removing fewer than ( k ) edges cannot disconnect ( u ) and ( v ). Hence, by definition, there exist ( k ) edge-disjoint paths between ( u ) and ( v ). 2. **Conversely**, suppose that for every pair of vertices ( u ) and ( v ) in ( G ), there are ( k ) edge-disjoint paths connecting them. We need to show that ( G ) is ( k )-edge connected:    - The removal of fewer than ( k ) edges cannot disconnect ( u ) and ( v ) because there would still be an edge-disjoint path connecting them. Hence, ( G ) remains connected under the removal of fewer than ( k ) edges. 3. Therefore, ( G ) is ( k )-edge connected. # Conclusion: The detailed explanation confirms Menger's Theorem as follows: (i) A graph is ( k )-connected if and only if for any two vertices, there exist ( k ) internally disjoint paths between them. (ii) A graph is ( k )-edge-connected if and only if for any two vertices, there exist ( k ) edge-disjoint paths between them.

Each oil change costs 50, so his annual oil change expenses are 3 * 50 = 150. Next, let's calculate the annual tire rotation expenses: John needs to get his tires rotated every 6,000 miles. So, he needs to get a tire rotation 12,000 / 6,000 = 2 times a year. Each tire rotation costs 40, so his annual tire rotation expenses are 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, let's calculate how much money they made from those 18 bags: They charge 4 per bag, so 18 bags * 4/bag = 72. However, they only have 68 in total, which means we need to adjust for the first day. Since they have 68 and they should have 72 from the 18 bags, they must have raked fewer bags on the first day to account for the difference. The difference in money is 72 - 68 = 4. Since they charge 4 per bag, this means they raked 1 bag less than what would have given them 72. So, on the first day, they raked 3 bags of leaves, as stated in the problem. To confirm, let's calculate the total money they should have for all three days: First day: 3 bags * 4/bag = 12 Other two days: 18 bags * 4/bag = 72 Total expected: 12 + 72 = 84 But since they have 68, we need to find out how many bags they raked on the first day to make the total 68.

Given: - ( f : (0, infty) to mathbb{R} ) is differentiable. - ( lim_{x to infty} f(x) = 2019 ). We need to consider the following statements: 1. ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) always exists but not necessarily zero. 2. ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) always exists and is equal to zero. 3. ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) may not exist. 4. ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) exists if ( f ) is twice differentiable. Let's analyze each statement: 1. **Statement 1: ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) always exists but not necessarily zero.**    This statement implies that the limit of the derivative exists for all differentiable functions ( f ) that satisfy the given condition. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider a function that oscillates increasingly rapidly as ( x to infty ). The derivative of such a function may not converge to a single value. 2. **Statement 2: ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) always exists and is equal to zero.**    This statement implies that the limit of the derivative always exists and is zero. However, this is also not necessarily true. For example, consider a function that approaches a constant value but has a derivative that oscillates. The derivative may not converge to zero. 3. **Statement 3: ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) may not exist.**    This statement is true. There are functions for which the limit of the derivative does not exist. For example, consider the function ( f(x) = sin(x) ) for ( x in [0, 2pi] ) and then scaled and shifted versions of ( sin(x) ) for subsequent intervals. The derivative of such a function will oscillate and may not converge to a single value. 4. **Statement 4: ( lim_{x to infty} f'(x) ) exists if ( f ) is twice differentiable.**    This statement is not necessarily true. Even if ( f ) is twice differentiable, the limit of the derivative may not exist. For example, consider a function that is twice differentiable but has a second derivative that oscillates increasingly rapidly.

The lines connecting these midpoints are known as the midlines of the triangle. Thus, the midlines are ( DE, EF, ) and ( FD ). 2. **Apply the Midline Theorem:** The midline theorem states that a segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and is half as long. Therefore:    - ( DE parallel AC ) and ( DE = frac{1}{2} AC )    - ( EF parallel AB ) and ( EF = frac{1}{2} AB )    - ( FD parallel BC ) and ( FD = frac{1}{2} BC ) 3. **Form Smaller Triangles:** The midlines ( DE, EF, ) and ( FD ) divide ( triangle ABC ) into four smaller triangles: ( triangle AFD, triangle DBE, triangle ECF, ) and ( triangle DEF ). 4. **Prove Congruence of Smaller Triangles Using Midlines:**    - Consider triangles ( triangle AFD ) and ( triangle DBE ):      - ( FD = frac{1}{2} BC )      - ( DE = frac{1}{2} AC )      - ( EF = frac{1}{2} AB )      - Additionally, all these segments are parallel to the respective sides. The small triangles ( triangle AFD, triangle DBE, triangle ECF, ) and ( triangle DEF ) are congruent by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) criterion, as each side of the smaller triangles is half the length of the corresponding sides of ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Verify Equal Area:** Since the midlines partition ( triangle ABC ) into four triangles, and since all these triangles share the same base and height relationship, their areas must be equal. Therefore, each of the smaller triangles has an area that is one-fourth of the area of the original triangle ( triangle ABC ). # Conclusion: By the theorem on the midline of a triangle and one of the criteria for triangle congruence, we have shown that the three midlines divide the triangle into four equal triangles. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Determine the solution of the equations: [ begin{align*} 2x  3y &= 5  4x  6y &= 10  x + y &= 7 end{align*} ] A) (left(frac{26}{5}, frac{9}{5}right))  B) (left(0, 0right))  C) There is no solution  D) There are an unlimited number of solutions  E) (left(5, 2right))","output":"We start by examining the given system: [ begin{align*} 2x - 3y &= 5 quad text{(1)}  4x - 6y &= 10 quad text{(2)}  x + y &= 7 quad text{(3)} end{align*} ] 1. **Check for consistency between equations (1) and (2)**:    Multiply equation (1) by 2:    [    2(2x - 3y) = 2 cdot 5 implies 4x - 6y = 10    ]    Compare to equation (2):    [    4x - 6y = 10    ]    Equations (1) and (2) are consistent as they are essentially the same equation. 2. **Solve with equation (3)**:    Substitute x = 7 - y into equation (1):    [    2(7-y) - 3y = 5 implies 14 - 2y - 3y = 5 implies 5y = 9 implies y = frac{9}{5}    ]    Substitute y = frac{9}{5} into equation (3) to find x:    [    x + frac{9}{5} = 7 implies x = 7 - frac{9}{5} = frac{35}{5} - frac{9}{5} = frac{26}{5}    ] 3. **Conclusion with the solution**:    The solution for x and y is:    [    x = frac{26}{5}, y = frac{9}{5}    ]    left(frac{26{5}, frac{9}{5}right)} The final answer is boxed{A}"},{"instruction":"A passenger left their belongings in an automatic storage locker and forgot the locker number.

We will divide each side of the square based on these primes:     - On the side ( AB ), mark points at distances ( frac{1}{p_1}, frac{1}{p_1^2}, ldots, frac{1}{p_1^{99}} ) from point ( A ).     - Similarly, using ( p_2 ) for side ( BC ), ( p_3 ) for side ( CD ), and ( p_4 ) for side ( DA ). 2. **Segment lengths after the division**:     The segments on side ( AB ) will have lengths:     [     frac{1}{p_1^{99}}, frac{p_1-1}{p_1^{99}}, frac{p_1-1}{p_1^{98}}, ldots, frac{p_1-1}{p_1}     ] 3. **Assuming the existence of a new rectangle**:     Suppose there exists a rectangle ( A'B'C'D' ) whose sides are formed by rearrangements of the given segments from ( AB, BC, CD, ) and ( DA ). We need to prove that this assumption leads to a contradiction. 4. **Properties of the segment sums**:     Let’s denote:     [     M_1 text{ and } M_2     ]     as different subsets of the lengths obtained from dividing the sides.      Consider that the difference in sums of lengths from ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) should be less than 1. This difference should be a rational number with its denominator being a non-zero power of the prime numbers ( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 ). 5. **Multiplying lengths for clarity**:     Multiply the lengths of all segments by ( p^k ) where ( p ) is any of these primes for clarity:     [     1, p-1, (p-1)p, ldots, (p-1)p^{k-1}     ]     Since each subsequent number is at least twice the previous one, the sums of different subsets cannot be equal. This means the sum of segments forming one side of a rectangle cannot equal the sum for the corresponding side on the opposite, as the sums differ. 6. **Addressing the potential contradiction**:     The difference ( A'B' - C'D' ) (an example considering all possible configurations) must equate to some rational number whose numerator can only be defined by powers of primes ( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 ). These individual summations of varying lengths will never result in zero as their combined sum signifies exact non-integral increments which violate the initial integral segment settings.     This inherently means:     - Any sum derived from differing combinations ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) will fault with integral assumptions.     - The contradiction stands firm proving non-integral diverse summation consistency. # Conclusion: Under the constraints of summing the segment lengths derived from prime-based non-repeating intervals, it becomes fundamentally impossible to form new rectangles other than the starting square, solidifying: [ boxed{text{Possible}} ]"},{"instruction":"the polar coordinate system, the area of the figure enclosed by the three curves θ=0, θ= frac {π}{3}, ρcos θ+ sqrt {3}ρsin θ=1 is (   ) A:  frac { sqrt {3}}{4} B:  frac { sqrt {3}}{8} C:  frac { sqrt {3}}{2} D:  sqrt {3}","output":"θ= frac {π}{3}, which is the ray y= sqrt {3}x(xgeqslant 0). ρcos θ+ sqrt {3}ρsin θ=1 can be converted into the line x+ sqrt {3}y=1.

By a previous known result, we conclude: [ lim_{n to infty} a^{frac{1}{n}} = 1 ]    Therefore, for values of ( x ) of the form ( frac{1}{n} ), the limit holds. 3. Next, consider x taking a general rational value ( frac{p}{q} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are integers. As ( x rightarrow 0 ), this implies ( frac{p}{q} rightarrow 0 ).  4. We can find a sufficiently large integer n such that [ 0 < frac{p}{q} < frac{1}{n} ]     since ( frac{p}{q} ) is a rational number approaching 0. 5. Given this, it implies the inequality [ 1 < a^{frac{p}{q}} < a^{frac{1}{n}} ] 6. Taking limits as ( n to infty ), and given our established result from Step 2, we know: [ lim_{n to infty} a^{frac{1}{n}} = 1 ]    Therefore, [ lim_{q to infty} a^{frac{p}{q}} = 1 ] 7.

Sie sind vielmehr durch ein vinculum substantiale, durch eine wesentliche Qualität desselben, mit ihm verbunden. Sie sind die natürlichen Aktionen seiner wesentlichen Qualität. Es kommt dieser Unsinn dadurch herein, daß Hegel die Staatsgeschäfte und Wirksamkeiten abstrakt für sich und im Gegensatz dazu die besondere Individualität faßt; aber er vergißt, daß die besondere Individualität eine menschliche und die Staatsgeschäfte und Wirksamkeiten menschliche Funktionen sind; er vergißt, daß das Wesen der »besonderen Persönlichkeit« nicht ihr Bart, ihr Blut, ihre abstrakte Physis, sondern ihre soziale Qualität ist, und daß die Staatsgeschäfte etc. nichts als Daseins- und Wirkungsweisen der sozialen Qualität des Menschen sind. Es versteht sich also, daß die Individuen, insofern sie Träger der Staatsgeschäfte und Gewalten sind, ihrer sozialen und nicht ihrer privaten Qualität nach betrachtet werden6. Dieses Wesen des Menschen hat sich bislang nicht realisiert, oder anders: der Mensch hat bisher in Verhältnissen gelebt, die seiner eigentlichen Bestimmung, seiner sozialen Natur, zuwiderlaufen. Hier zeigt sich ein Grundmodell der Kritik, dem wir ebenfalls im späteren Werk von Marx immer wieder begegnen. Kritisiert er in der Deutschen Ideologie paradigmatisch die von den Junghegelianern praktizierte gedankliche Identifizierung von Privateigentum und Persönlichkeit, von Bourgeois und Individuum 7, im ökonomischen Werk die Identifizierung der gesellschaftlichen Formbestimmtheit der Produktion mit ihren Naturmomenten als abstrakteste Form bürgerlicher Methodik mit der Konsequenz, daß jegliche historische Dimension vorab eliminiert wird, so lebt auch die Kritik in dieser frühen Auseinandersetzung mit Hegel von der Dechiffrierung einer unstatthaften Identifizierung: nämlich der des Wesens mit der verkehrten Existenz. »Hegel ist nicht zu tadeln, weil er das Wesen des modernen Staats schildert, wie es ist, sondern weil er das, was ist, für das Wesen des Staates ausgibt 8.« Dieses Wesen ist vielmehr die von Marx antizipierte Demokratie, das Resultat der weltgeschichtlichen Entwicklung, durch die hindurch sich erst die Einsicht in die Borniertheit vergangener Staatsformen eröffnet. Die Demokratie ist »das aufgelöste Rätsel aller Verfassungen«, die »Demokratie ist die Wahrheit der Monarchie, die Monarchie ist nicht die Wahrheit der Demokratie. ... Die Monarchie kann nicht, die Demokratie kann aus sich selbst begriffen werden ...».« In politischen Kategorien formuliert hier Marx den vom späten Engels dann sehr viel allgemeiner gefaßten Sachverhalt: daß es nur die Menschen selbst sind, die ihre Geschichte gemacht haben, wenngleich immer nur bewußt und nicht selbstbewußt. Das selbstbewußte Stadium, in dem sich die Menschen rückwärtsblickend als Schöpfer ihrer eigenen Geschichte erkennen, erscheint beim jungen Marx als Demokratie, in der die Menschen ihre politische Verfassung als ihr eigenes mit Bewußtsein hervorgebrachtes Produkt wissen. Von diesem Zustand her lassen sich dann die anderen Staatsformen als das »An-sich-sein« der Demokratie deuten, als Formen, die - obzwar ebenfalls nur das Produkt menschlicher Tätigkeit - noch nicht als solche gewußt werden. Analog einer Passage in der Erstauflage des Kapitals, wo er das Geld, die allgemeine Form des Wertes, ausdrücklich mit einem nicht-verstandesmäßigen Allgemeinen vergleicht, das selbst besondere Existenz gewinnt, - ». . . Es ist als ob neben und außer Löwen, Tigern, Hasen und allen anderen wirklichen Tieren . . . auch noch das Tier existierte, die individuelle Inkarnation des ganzen Tierreichs . ..10«, also die Einheit, die Gattung selber in besonderer Form existiert und damit erst die anderen besonderen Formen als besondere erscheinen können (indem die Waren einen Preis haben, erscheinen sie allererst als Waren, als besondere Momente der gesellschaftlichen Einheit), - so wird auch die Demokratie als Verfassungsgattung in besonderer Existenz aufgefaßt, durch die hindurch erst die anderen Formen als beschränkte erscheinen: »Hier ist die Verfassung nicht nur an sich, dem Wesen nach, sondern der Existenz, der Wirklichkeit nach in ihren wirklichen Grund, den wirklichen Menschen, das wirkliche Volk, stets zurückgeführt und als sein eigenes Werk gesetzt. ... sie verhält sich zu den übrigen Verfassungen, wie die Gattung sich zu ihren Arten verhält, nur daß hier die Gattung selbst als Existenz, darum gegenüber den dem Wesen nicht entsprechenden Existenzen selbst als besondre Art erscheint n.« Wie sieht nun der durch dieses »aufgelöste Rätsel aller Ver-fassungen« erst einsehbar gewordene Entwicklungsgang der Menschheit aus? Die Demokratie zeichnet sich durch zwei wesentliche Bestimmungen aus, einerseits ist erst sie die wahrhafte wirkliche Einheit des Allgemeinen und Besonderen, andererseits weiß hier das Volk die Verfassung als sein eigenes selbstbewußtes Produkt, als ein von ihm gesetztes. Bleiben wir bei der ersten Bestimmung: ist die Demokratie als wirkliche Einheit dieser beiden Momente, des Allgemeinen und Besonderen zu begreifen, so sind umgekehrt die vorangehenden Verfassungen als verkehrte Formen dieser Einheit zu deuten. Ausgangspunkt der Entwicklung ist dann die verkehrte Einheit in der Form der Unmittelbarkeit, die dann aufbricht und in einem Prozeß durch die Extreme hindurch sich den Weg zur wahrhaften Gestalt bahnt. Unter diese Konstruktion wird die Hegelsche Darstellung subsumiert, die Marx als einigermaßen hinreichende Beschreibung einer empirischen Faktizität, nämlich des spezifisch neuzeitlichen Verhältnisses von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und politischem Staat, akzeptiert (wenngleich eben nur als Beschreibung, und nicht als Nachzeichnung der »Logik der Sache« selbst), eine Struktur, die sich aus einer Form herausbildet, die durch die Einheit von Politik und Privatsphäre charakterisiert war. Diese erscheinen noch nicht in getrennter Form, sondern gehen unmittelbar ineinander über: »Im Mittelalter gab es Leibeigene, Feudalgut, Gewerbekorporation, Gelehrtenkorporation etc., d. h., im Mittelalter ist Eigentum, Handel, Sozietät, Mensch politisch; der materielle Inhalt des Staates ist durch seine Form gesetzt; jede Privatsphäre hat einen politischen Charakter oder ist eine politische Sphäre, oder die Politik ist auch der Charakter der Privatsphären 12.« Noch ganz Junghegelianer in seiner Formulierungsfreude (die allerdings geradezu von der kritischen Grundfigur der gleichsam spiegelbildlich verkehrten Verdopplung provoziert wird und eine Organisation sprachlicher Wendungen fördert, deren Ernsthaftigkeit nicht immer völlig auszumachen ist und sich oft die Vermutung aufdrängt, daß ein der kritischen Intention zuwiderlaufendes und sie bei weitem überschießendes Moment an sprachspielerischer Verselbständigung vorliegt) schließt Marx die allgemeine Charakteristik mittelalterlicher Verhältnisse mit der auf den kürzesten Begriff gebrachten Formulierung: »Im Mittelalter ist die politische Verfassung die Verfassung des Privateigentums, aber nur, weil die Verfassung des Privateigentums politische Verfassung ist.« Entsprechend dem »aufgelösten Rätsel aller Verfassungen« als dem vollendeten Zustand der Freiheit, der geläuterten Einheit des Allgemeinen und Besonderen, wird das Mittelalter als Freiheit in der Form der Unmittelbarkeit gedeutet, als borniert-naive Form des Wesens selbst: »Das Mittelalter war die Demokratie der Unfreiheit.< Diese Einheit bricht auf und weicht einer Trennung beider Momente. Mit der Verselbständigung von Handel und Grundeigentum sondert sich zugleich das Allgemeine ab und bildet sich zum Staat aus, der nun erst als Staat, als politischer Staat, selbständige Form annimmt. Die Genesis des einen Moments ist nicht abzutrennen von der Genesis des anderen. »Die Abstraktion des Staats als solchen gehört erst der modernen Zeit, weil die Abstraktion des Privatlebens erst der modernen Zeit gehört. Die Abstraktion des politischen Staates in ein modernes Produkt 5.« Die innerhalb dieses Trennungsprozesses auftretenden Formen, Republik und Monarchie, werden umstandslos als verschiedene Gestalten des abstrakten Staates charakterisiert, deren Unterschieden nicht allzuviel Beachtung zu schenken ist. >Der Streit zwischen Monarchie und Republik ist selbst noch ein Streit innerhalb des abstrakten Staates.< In beiden Fällen handelt es sich ja schliessich nur um eine unwahre Einheit dieser Momente, es sind letztlich nur Modifikationene einer-wenn auch verkehrten-äusserlichen Form eines ihr nicht wesentlichen Inhalts: »Das Eigentum etc., kurz der ganze Inhalt des Rechts und des Staats, ist mit wenigen Modifikationen in Nordamerika dasselbe wie in Preußen. Dort ist also die Republik eine bloße Staatsform wie hier die Monarchie. Der Inhalt des Staats liegt außerhalb dieser Verfassungen. Hegel hat daher recht, wenn er sagt: Der politische Staat ist die Verfassung, d. h., der materielle Staat ist nicht politisch. Es findet hier nur eine äußere Identität, eine Wechselbestimmung statt.« ”翻译为中文","output":"因此，当黑格尔说它们（国家的特定事务和活动）“与特殊的个性作为一个整体是外在的和偶然的联系”时，这是荒谬的。它们实际上是通过一个实质性的联系，通过相同的本质质量与之联系的。它们是其本质质量的自然行为。这种荒谬是由于黑格尔将国家的事务和活动抽象地理解为自身，与之相对的是特殊的个体性；但他忘记了特殊的个体性是人类的，且国家的事务和活动是人类的功能；他忘记了“特殊个性”的本质不是其胡须、血液、抽象的物理形态，而是其社会质量，而国家事务等无非是人的社会质量的存在和活动方式。因此，自然地，就个人承担国家事务和权力而言，应当根据他们的社会质量而非私人质量来考虑。迄今为止，人类尚未实现这种本质，或者换句话说：直至今日，人一直生活在违背他的真正目的、他的社会本性的条件中。这里展现了一种批判的基本模式，我们在马克思后期作品中也会反复遇到。他在《德意志意识形态》中典型地批判青年黑格尔派将私有财产与人格、资产阶级与个体等同化，在经济学作品中批判将生产的社会形式决定性与其自然方面等同化作为资产阶级方法论的最抽象形式，其结果是任何历史维度都被提前排除，这种批判也活在这种早期与黑格尔的争论中，通过解密一个不恰当的等同化：即本质与扭曲存在的等同。“批评黑格尔不是因为他描述了现代国家的本质，而是因为他把现实当作了国家的本质。”这个本质更是马克思预期的民主制，这是通过世界历史发展的结果，通过这一历史过程首次展现对以往国家形式的局限性的洞见。民主制是“所有宪法之谜的解答”，“民主是君主制的真理，而君主制不是民主的真理。...君主制不能，而民主制能够从它自身被理解......”。马克思用政治范畴表述了恩格斯后来更一般性地阐述的情况：只有人类自己造就了自己的历史，尽管这总是有意识而非自觉地进行。在年轻的马克思看来，民主制阶段，人类后视地认识到自己是自己历史的创造者，在这个阶段中，人们知道自己的政治宪法是自己有意识创造的产品。从这个状态出发，其他国家形式可以被解释为民主制的“自身之存在”，作为形式，虽然也仅仅是人类活动的产物，但尚未作为这样被知晓。类似于《资本论》第一版中的一个段落，他将金钱、价值的一般形式明确比作一个非理性的普遍性，它本身获得了特殊的存在——“......就好像除了狮子、老虎、兔子和所有其他实际动物以外......还存在着动物本身，整个动物界的个体化身......”，即种类本身以特殊形式存在，并因此首次使其他特殊形式作为特殊出现（通过商品拥有价格，它们首次作为商品出现，作为社会整体的特殊时刻），——民主制也被视作以特殊存在形式的宪法种类，通过这种形式，其他形式首次作为有限的出现：“这里的宪法不仅在本质上、而且在存在、在现实中，总是被带回其真正的基础、真正的人类、真正的民众，并被设定为其自己的作品。...它与其他宪法的关系，就像种类与其种群的关系，只是在这里种类本身作为存在，因此相对于不符合本质的存在，自身也作为特殊种群出现。” 那么，通过这个“所有宪法之谜的解答”所揭示的人类发展进程是怎样的呢？民主制以两个基本特征为标志，一方面，只有民主制才是真正的一般与特殊的真实统一，另一方面，民众知道宪法是他们自己的自觉产品，是他们设定的。我们先来看第一个特征：如果要理解民主制是这两个要素，一般与特殊的真实统一，那么相反地，先前的宪法就可以被解释为这种统一的扭曲形式。发展的出发点是以非媒介形式的扭曲统一，然后破裂并通过极端，开辟通向真实形态的道路。这个构造归纳了马克思接受的黑格尔描述，他认为黑格尔对特定现代关系的经验事实，即资产阶级社会和政治国家的关系，给出了相当充分的描述（尽管仅作为描述，而不是对“事情逻辑”本身的追踪），这一结构从一个政治与私人领域统一的形式中发展出来。这些还没有以分离的形式出现，而是直接互相融合：“在中世纪有农奴、封建领地、行会工匠、学术团体等，即，在中世纪，财产、贸易、社团、人是政治化的；国家的物质内容是由其形式设定的；每一个私人领域都有一个政治特征或是一个政治领域，或政治也是私人领域的特征。”还完全是青年黑格尔派的马克思以其表述的喜悦结束对中世纪关系的一般特征：“在中世纪，政治宪法是私有财产的宪法，但仅仅因为私有财产的宪法是政治宪法。”根据“所有宪法之谜的解答”作为自由完美状态，纯净的一般与特殊统一的完成阶段，中世纪被解释为非媒介自由的形式，作为本质的有限天真形式：“中世纪是非自由的民主制。”这种统一破碎，给出两个要素的分离。随着贸易和地产的自主性，一般性也分离出来，并形成为国家，现在才首次以国家的形式，作为政治国家，独立存在。一个要素的生成与另一个要素的生成不可分离。“国家作为一个抽象概念，是现代时代才有的，因为私人生活的抽象是现代时代才有的。政治国家的抽象是现代产品。”在这个分离过程中出现的形式，共和国和君主制，被直接字符化为抽象国家的不同形式，这些差异不应过分关注。“君主制与共和制之争本身还是在抽象国家内部的争斗。”在两种情况下，它们都是这些要素的不真实统一，终究只是被颠倒的外在形式的变体——尽管是颠倒的——其内容不是本质的：“财产等，简而言之，所有的权利和国家内容，在北美和普鲁士几乎是相同的。那里，共和制就像这里的君主制一样，只是一种国家形式。国家的内容在这些宪法之外。黑格尔因此是对的，他说：政治国家是宪法，即，物质国家不是政治的。这里只是外在的身份，交替确定。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Wenden wir uns dem zweiten Aspekt zu. Der Übergang zur letzten Form, der Demokratie, erfolgt nach dem Muster der von Feuerbach beschriebenen Emanzipation.

Der Übergang zur Demokratie ist verbunden mit einer Emanzipation von jeglicher Vorherrschaft eines falschen Allgemeinen, das - ursprünglich nur besonderes Moment - sich zur verkehrten Macht, zu einem Ersten aufgebläht hat. In der Demokratie ist die Verfassung als eine vom Volke gesetzte immer auch als solche präsent: »In der Monarchie z. B. hat dies Besondre, die politische Verfassung, die Bedeutung des alles Besondren beherrschenden und bestimmenden Allgemeinen 18.« So herrschte in allen von der Demokratie unterschiedenen Formen der »Staat, die Verfassung, das Gesetz«, aber es herrscht nur solange, wie sich die Menschen diese Herrschaft gefallen lassen. Die geschichtliche Entwicklung besteht demnach darin, daß die Menschen immer neue Formen der Objektivierung als Objektivierungen durchschauen, bis schließlich auch die letztmögliche Form der Entfremdung abgeworfen wird: »Von den verschiedenen Momenten des Volkslebens war es am schwersten, den politischen Staat, die Verfassung herauszubilden. Sie entwickelte sich als die allgemeine Vernunft gegenüber den anderen Sphären, als ein Jenseits derselben. Die geschichtliche Aufgabe bestand dann in ihrer Revindikation, aber die besonderen Sphären haben dabei nicht das Bewußtsein, daß ihr privates Wesen mit dem jenseitigen Wesen der Verfassung oder des politischen Staates fällt, und daß sein jenseitiges Dasein nichts andres als der Affirmativ ihrer eigenen Entfremdung ist. Die politische Verfassung war bisher die religiöse Sphäre, die Religion des Volkslebens, der Himmel seiner Allgemeinheit gegenüber dem irdischen Dasein seiner Wirklichkeit.. .19.« Wir haben diese frühe, noch durchaus idealistische Geschichts-konstruktion etwas ausführlicher referiert, weil nur vor diesem Hintergrund die einzelnen Detailkritiken und zum Teil langatmigen Auseinandersetzungen voll begreifbar sind. Es kann hier nicht der Ort sein, um nun diese einzelnen Punkte aufzugreifen; was uns hier vordringlich interessiert ist die Genesis von Begrifflichkeiten, denen wir dann in der von Marx selbst als materialistisch bezeichneten Geschichtsauffassung begegnen, ohne daß dort näher darauf eingegangen wird, ob sich diese Begriffe angesichts der präzisierten materialistischen Position in dieser Form noch halten lassen. Das bezieht sich nun insbesondre auf den Begriff der Verdopplung und den Aspekt der illusorischen Gemeinschaftlichkeit. Von beiden ist in der Deutschen Ideologie wörtlich die Rede. Für Marx ist es geradezu das »Rätsel des Mystizismus«, wenn Hegel dort, wo ihm das Staatsbewußtsein in seiner wirklich empirischen Form, als öffentliches Bewußtsein, begegnet, nur ein Potpourri von »Gedanken und Ansichten der Vielen« sieht. Hier treibt Hegel die Interpretation einer ohnehin schon verkehrten Welt auf die Spitze: was - so fragt sich Marx und entwickelt dabei einige nähere Bestimmungen des »Wesens aller Verfassungen«, seines demokratischen »Gegenbildes«, das er der Hegelschen Auffassung konfrontiert - kann der Staat anderes sein als die »allgemeinen Angelegenheiten« des Volkes, also die Sache eines jeden. Sein staat-liches Dasein, das hörten wir schon, ist ein bestimmtes Moment der sozialen Qualität des Menschen; und zwar ein wesentliches, das an seiner »natürlichen Aktion« zu behindern gleichbedeutend wäre mit dem Ausschluß des Menschen aus der menschlichen Gesellschaft: »In einem vernünftigen Staat gehört eher ein Examen dazu, Schuster zu werden, als exekutiver Staatsbeamter; denn die Schusterei ist eine Fertigkeit, ohne die man ein guter Staatsbürger, ein sozialer Mensch sein kann; aber das nötige >Staatswissen< ist eine Bedingung, ohne die man im Staat außer dem Staat lebt, von sich selbst, von der Luft abgeschnitten ist 20.« Da es eine seiner bewußten sozialen Funktionen ist, versteht es sich von selbst, daß er als Staatsmitglied nur durch Beraten und Beschließen an den allgemeinen Angelegenheiten teilnimmt, denn nur dieses Tun ist die »Effektuierung des Staats als wirkliche Angelegenheit«. Mit anderen Worten: die Form, in der die allgemeine Angelegenheit erst wirklich ist, ist nicht vom Inhalt abzutrennen. Da das Volk selbst, der Gattungswille, die allgemeine Angelegenheit ist, ist dieser erst wirklicher Gattungswille, wenn er in selbstbewußter allgemeiner Form existiert. Doch wie stellt Hegel diesen Sachverhalt dar? Marx kritisiert die von Hegel durchgeführte Trennung zwischen Substanz und Subjekt, dem »Ansichsein« und dem »Fürsich- sein« der allgemeinen Angelegenheit als abstrakten Mystizismus. Für Hegel existiert die allgemeine Angelegenheit bereits als Geschäft der Regierung, in der Form des Ansichseins, zu der die Form des Fürsichseins äußerlich hinzutritt. »Das ständische Element«, so heißt es im § 301 der Rechtsphilosophie, »hat die Bestimmung, daß die allgemeine Angelegenheit nicht nur an sich, sondern auch für sich, d. i. daß das Moment der subjektiven formellen Freiheit, das öffentliche Bewußtsein als empirische Allgemeinheit der Ansichten und Gedanken der Vielen, darin zur Existenz komme.« Gemessen an der Marxschen Vorstellung des wahren Staates stellt Hegel den Vorgang gerade verkehrt dar (wenngleich er dem tatsächlichen Sachverhalt eben deswegen um so näher kommt): nicht die Subjekte, die einzelnen Mitglieder des Volkes vergegenständlichen sich in ihren allgemeinen Angelegenheiten, bestimmen sich selbst, sondern die an sich fertigen allgemeinen Angelegenheiten »kommen zum Subjekt«, bedürfen seiner aus gleichsam logischen Gründen, damit sie eben nicht nur in dieser Form existieren, sondern auch in der anderen. Diese verkehrte Hegelsche Darstellung des Wesens bzw. diese richtige Darstellung dieser unwirklichen Existenz des Wesens wird von Marx einer exzessiven Kritik unterworfen, in der das »jung-hegelianische Sprachspiel« ausgiebig durchexerziert wird: »Hegel idealisiert die Bürokratie und empirisiert das öffentliche Bewußtsein. Hegel kann das wirkliche Bewußtsein sehr ä part behandeln, eben weil er das ä part Bewußtsein als das öffentliche behandelt hat. Er braucht sich um so weniger um die wirkliche Existenz des Staatsgeistes zu kümmern, als er schon in seinen soi-disant Existenzen ihn gehörig realisiert zu haben meint21.« Im Mittelpunkt der Kritik steht der Gedanke, der von der Äußerlichkeit der Form gegenüber dem Inhalt auf den Inhalt zurückschließt. Ist die Form nur formell, existiert der Inhalt bereits auch schon in anderen Formen, so heißt dies umgekehrt, daß jene Form, die für die wirkliche Form des Inhalts gelten soll, gerade .nicht diesen wirklichen Inhalt zu ihrem Inhalt hat. Bleiben wir beim ersten Aspekt, der uns die ursprüngliche Fassung des späteren Begriffs der illusorischen Gemeinschaftlichkeit in der Deutschen Ideologie zu sein scheint. Die allgemeine Angelegenheit ist ohne Tun des Volkes zustande gekommen, sie existiert ja schon als Geschäft der Regierung. Wenn daher die fürsichseiende Form, das ständische Element, hinzutritt, so ist dies eine reine Scheinform: »Das ständische Element ist die illusorische Existenz der Staatsangelegenheiten als einer Volkssache. Die Illusion, daß die allgemeine Angelegenheit allgemeine Angelegenheit, öffentliche Angelegenheit sei, oder die Illusion, daß die Sache des Volkes allgemeine Angelegenheit sei . . . Das ständische Element ist die politische Illusion der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft22.«”翻译为中文","output":"让我们转向第二个方面。向最终形式——民主制的过渡遵循了费尔巴哈描述的解放模式。一个客观事物被转化为主观事物，间接的自我意识变成直接的——掌握权力的神（作为迄今为止不透明的、无节制的自身统治，以一种抽象普遍性的形式）被剥夺了权力！向民主制的过渡伴随着从任何错误普遍性的统治中解放出来，这种错误的普遍性最初只是特殊的时刻——它被夸大为颠倒的力量，成为首要的东西。在民主制中，宪法作为人民设立的总是作为这样存在：“例如，在君主制中，这种特殊的东西，政治宪法，具有支配和决定一切特殊性的普遍性的意义。”因此，在所有与民主制不同的形式中，“国家、宪法、法律”统治，但只有当人们容忍这种统治时才统治。历史发展因此在于，人们一直通过察觉新的形式的客观化作为客观化，直到最终也摆脱了可能的最后一种形式的异化：“人民生活的各种时刻中，形成政治国家、宪法是最困难的。它发展为相对于其他领域的普遍理性，作为它们的彼岸。历史任务然后是要夺回它，但特殊领域并没有意识到它们的私有本质与宪法或政治国家的彼岸本质是一致的，也没有意识到它的彼岸存在只不过是它们自己异化的肯定。政治宪法迄今为止一直是人民生活的宗教领域，是它们普遍性的天堂相对于它们现实存在的尘世...。” 我们较为详细地叙述了这一仍然是理想主义的历史构造，因为只有在这个背景下，各个详细的批评和部分冗长的论战才能被完全理解。这里不是逐一讨论这些点的地方；我们当前主要关注的是，我们随后在马克思自称为唯物主义的历史观中遇到的概念的起源，在那里并没有进一步探讨这些概念鉴于精确的唯物主义立场是否仍可维持。特别是关于“复制”概念和虚幻共同体的方面。《德意志意识形态》中字面上提到了这两点。 对马克思而言，当黑格尔在公共意识以其真实经验形式出现时，仅见到“众多人的思想和观点”的杂烩，这简直是“神秘主义之谜”的关键所在。在这里，黑格尔将已经是颠倒的世界的解释推向极致：马克思在提出有关“所有宪法的本质”的一些具体定义时质疑——国家能是什么其他东西，而不是人民的“公共事务”，即每个人的事务。他作为国家的存在，我们已经听说过，是人的社会品质的一个特定时刻；而且是一个基本要素，妨碍它的“自然行为”等同于将人排除在人类社会之外：“在一个理性的国家，要成为鞋匠可能需要通过一个考试，而不是成为一个执行国家官员；因为鞋匠技能是不需要的，一个人可以是一个良好的国民，一个社会人；但必需的‘国家知识’是一个条件，没有它一个人在国家之外生活，就像被割断了自己，被割断了空气一样。”既然这是他的一个有意识的社会功能，那么他作为国家成员，自然只能通过咨询和决定来参与公共事务，因为只有这样的行为才是“作为真实事务的国家的实现”。换句话说：公共事务才真实存在的形式不能与内容分离。既然人民本身，物种意志，是公共事务，那么这个物种意志只有在以自觉的通用形式存在时才是真正的物种意志。但黑格尔是如何描述这种情况的呢？马克思批评了黑格尔进行的公共事务的实质与主体之间的区分，即公共事务的“自在之为”与“自为之为”的区分，批评这是抽象的神秘主义。对黑格尔来说，公共事务已经作为政府的业务存在，以自在之为的形式存在，而自为之为的形式则是外加的。根据马克思对真正国家的想象，黑格尔恰恰将过程描绘得颠倒了（尽管因此他更接近实际情况）：不是人民的个体成员在他们的公共事务中具象化自己，自我决定，而是已经成型的公共事务“来到了个体那里”，出于某种逻辑原因需要它们，这样它们不仅仅以这种形式存在，也以另一种形式存在。 这种颠倒的黑格尔对本质的描述，或者这种对本质虚幻存在的正确描述，受到了马克思的激烈批评，在这种批评中“青年黑格尔派的语言游戏”被充分贯彻：“黑格尔理想化了官僚制度，实用化了公共意识。黑格尔可以相当逐个地处理真实的意识，正因为他已经将逐个意识处理为公共意识。他越是不必担心国家精神的真实存在，因为他在他所谓的存在中已经充分实现了它。”批评的核心是从形式对内容的外在性推断内容。如果形式只是形式性的，内容已经以其他形式存在，这反过来意味着，那种被认为是内容真正形式的形式，实际上并没有将这个真正内容作为其内容。我们回到第一个方面，似乎是《德意志意识形态》中后来称为虚幻共同体的原始版本。公共事务是在人民的行动之外形成的，它已经作为政府的业务存在。因此，当自为之为的形式，即等级制度，加入时，这只是一种纯粹的伪装形式：“等级制度是国家事务作为民众事务的虚幻存在。在公共事务被视为公共事务，或者民众的事务被视为公共事务的幻象……等级制度是资产阶级社会的政治幻象。”"},{"instruction":"Bali için söylenmiş sozler","output":"1. \\"Kalbinizin derinliklerinde yaşayan Hindistan kabilesinden biri varsa, ölmeden önce Bali'yi ziyaret etmelisiniz.

Mr. Greedy woke up one fine morning, or was it afternoon? Who knows, time is a concept too complex for Mr. Men Land. After dreaming about eating a mountain of chocolate, topped with whipped cheese—because why not—Mr. Greedy was ready to tackle the day ahead. Stumbling downstairs with the grace of a three-legged hippo on a skateboard, he approached what could only be described as a breakfast for a small army. Or one Mr. Greedy. He ate with the enthusiasm of a vacuum cleaner on steroids. Eggs? Vanished. Bacon? Dematerialized. Toast? Entered another dimension through Mr. Greedy's mouth. Then, feeling as round as Mr. Round (who'd been on vacation since someone mistook him for a beach ball), Mr. Greedy decided to go for a walk. As every logic-defying story needs an absurd plot twist, he found himself at the entrance of a cave. Because caves are exactly where you go after eating your body weight in food. Inside, everything was larger than life. \\"Finally, furniture that suits my girth,\\" Mr. Greedy thought. But lo and behold, it wasn't furniture but giant food. Because in Mr. Men Land, even your wildest dreams are outdone. At this juncture, a giant appeared. Not just any giant, but a dietitian giant. The irony. He picked up Mr. Greedy, who responded with the eloquence of a stunned mullet. \\"You, my chubby friend, are going to learn a lesson!\\" declared the giant in a tone that suggested he'd been waiting all his life for this moment. Mr. Greedy, demonstrating the survival instincts of a lemming on a cliff edge, agreed to eat all the giant food. Because logic had left the building hours ago, along with any shred of dignity Mr. Greedy had left. After what seemed like an eternity of binge-eating, Mr. Greedy was now resembling a very sad, overstuffed sausage. The giant, apparently having a heart—or maybe just fearing that Mr. Greedy might explode on his nice, clean giant cave floor—allowed Mr. Greedy to leave under one condition: no more greediness, or else he'd have to come back and eat giant broccoli next time. \\"I promise,\\" wheezed Mr. Greedy, who now understood what a grape felt like just before becoming a raisin. In an ending as predictable as a plot in a soap opera, Mr. Greedy indeed kept his promise. He was now a thinner oval, a shape that baffled geometricians everywhere. He'd lost weight in a place where physics doesn't apply, and diets are as effective as a chocolate teapot. Mr. Greedy had defied the impossible, making everyone wonder if they were next on the dietitian giant's list. And so, our story ends with Mr. Greedy, no longer greedy, living his life in a bizarre land where lessons are learned in the most peculiar ways and everyone questions the laws of reality. Because in Mr. Men Land, anything can happen, especially if it makes absolutely no sense at all. Moral of the story? If a giant ever offers you diet advice, run. Or roll, depending on your current shape."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"可以解释一下yolov8的算法结构吗","output":"截至我最后的更新（2023年），YOLOv8是一个假设性的模型，因为YOLO（You Only Look Once）系列的最新版本是YOLOv5。这一系列的算法主要用于计算机视觉和目标检测领域，特别是在实时应用中表现出色，因为它能够快速准确地识别和分类图像中的对象。 YOLO算法的核心思想是将目标检测问题转化为一个单一的回归问题，直接从图像的像素到边界框的坐标和类别概率的转换。这种方法与传统的目标检检测方法不同，后者通常首先生成一系列候选区域，然后对这些区域进行分类。YOLO算法通过将整个检测过程简化为一个单一的网络，显著提高了处理速度。 尽管没有YOLOv8的具体信息，但基于YOLO系列的历史和发展趋势，我们可以推测未来版本可能会集中在以下几个方面进行改进： 1. **更精准的检测：** 通过改进模型架构、使用更复杂的损失函数或者借助更先进的数据增强和训练技巧，提高模型对小物体、遮挡物体或在复杂背景中物体的检测准确率。 2. **更快的处理速度：** 进一步优化模型架构和计算过程，减少不必要的计算，以适应更严苛的实时处理需求，如在移动和边缘计算设备上的应用。 3. **更强的泛化能力：** 通过引入新的训练方法或结合其他机器学习技术，如半监督学习或无监督学习，以提高模型对于未见过数据的预测能力。 4. **更好的用户与开发者体验：** 提供更多的预训练模型，简化模型训练和部署过程，增强模型的可定制性和灵活性，使其能够适应更广泛的应用场景。 有关YOLOv8或未来其他任何更新版本的具体信息，建议定期查看官方发布的最新研究和开发动态。"},{"instruction":"","output":"看起来你没有提出具体的问题。如果你有任何问题，无论是关于机器学习、科技、生活知识，或者其他任何话题，都可以随时提问。我在这里帮助你！"},{"instruction":"python 界面复选框设计","output":"在设计Python界面时，如果你想加入复选框（checkboxes）来允许用户进行多选，可以使用不同的图形界面库，如Tkinter、PyQt、wxPython等。下面将以两个最常用的库Tkinter和PyQt5为例，简单介绍如何在这些库中设计复选框。 # 1. 使用Tkinter添加复选框 Tkinter是Python的标准GUI库，它内置于大多数Python安装中，无需额外安装。以下是使用Tkinter创建带复选框的界面的一个基本示例： \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk def show_selection(): selection = \\"\\" for i, chk in enumerate(check_vars): if chk.get() == 1: # if the checkbox is checked selection += options[i] + \\" \\" print(\\"Selected: \\", selection.strip()) # 创建主窗口 root = tk.Tk() root.title(\\"复选框示例\\") # 定义复选框选项 options = [\\"选项1\\", \\"选项2\\", \\"选项3\\"] check_vars = [] # 创建一个变量列表来存储每个复选框的状态 # 创建复选框 for option in options: var = tk.IntVar() chk = tk.Checkbutton(root, text=option, variable=var) chk.pack(anchor=tk.W) check_vars.append(var) # 添加按钮，用于显示当前选中的复选框 btn_show_selection = tk.Button(root, text=\\"显示选中项\\", command=show_selection) btn_show_selection.pack() # 进入Tkinter事件循环 root.mainloop() \`\`\` 这个例子创建了一个包含三个复选框的界面。当点击\\"显示选中项\\"按钮时，会在控制台输出所有被选中的复选框对应的文本。 # 2. 使用PyQt5添加复选框 PyQt5是一套强大的Python GUI库，构建在Qt5之上。相比于Tkinter，它提供了更为现代和丰富的控件和特性。以下是一个使用PyQt5创建带有复选框的界面的基础示例： 首先，确保安装了PyQt5： \`\`\` pip install PyQt5 \`\`\` 然后，创建界面： \`\`\`python from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QCheckBox, QVBoxLayout, QPushButton def show_selection(): selection = \\"\\" for option, chk in checkboxes.items(): if chk.isChecked(): # if the checkbox is checked selection += option + \\" \\" print(\\"Selected: \\", selection.strip()) app = QApplication([]) # 创建主窗口 window = QWidget() window.setWindowTitle('复选框示例') # 创建垂直布局 layout = QVBoxLayout() # 定义复选框选项并创建复选框 options = [\\"选项1\\", \\"选项2\\", \\"选项3\\"] checkboxes = {} for option in options: chk = QCheckBox(option) layout.addWidget(chk) checkboxes[option] = chk # 添加按钮，用于显示当前所选的复选框 btn_show_selection = QPushButton(\\"显示选中项\\") btn_show_selection.clicked.connect(show_selection) layout.addWidget(btn_show_selection) window.setLayout(layout) # 显示窗口 window.show() # 进入应用程序的主事件循环 app.exec_() \`\`\` 在这个PyQt5的例子中，创建了一个包含三个复选框的界面和一个按钮，用于显示所有被选中的复选框对应的文本。 这两个例子展示了在两个不同的Python GUI库中如何添加和管理复选框。选择哪个库主要取决于你的需要、偏好及项目的复杂性。"},{"instruction":"python QT5 checkboxes设计","output":"在Qt5中使用Python设计包含复选框（Checkbox）的界面，我们通常会用到PyQt5或者PySide2。两者API几乎相同，这里使用PyQt5作为例子来展示如何实现。 首先，确保你已经安装了PyQt5。如果还没有安装，可以通过pip安装： \`\`\`sh pip install PyQt5 \`\`\` 下面的代码示例将演示如何创建一个简单的界面，其中包含几个复选框和一个按钮。当用户点击按钮时，程序将打印出所有被选中的复选框。 \`\`\`python import sys from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QCheckBox, QVBoxLayout, QPushButton class CheckBoxDemo(QWidget): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.initializeUI() def initializeUI(self): self.setGeometry(100, 100, 200, 200) self.setWindowTitle('QCheckBox 示例') self.setupWidgets() def setupWidgets(self): layout = QVBoxLayout() self.chk1 = QCheckBox(\\"选项 1\\") self.chk1.setChecked(True) # 默认选中 self.chk2 = QCheckBox(\\"选项 2\\") self.chk3 = QCheckBox(\\"选项 3\\") self.chk1.stateChanged.connect(self.checkBoxState) self.chk2.stateChanged.connect(self.checkBoxState) self.chk3.stateChanged.connect(self.checkBoxState) layout.addWidget(self.chk1) layout.addWidget(self.chk2) layout.addWidget(self.chk3) btn = QPushButton(\\"提交\\") btn.clicked.connect(self.btnClicked) layout.addWidget(btn) self.setLayout(layout) def checkBoxState(self, state): # state 参数可以用来检查复选框的状态 sender = self.sender() print(f\\"{sender.text()} 状态：\\", \\"选中\\" if state == 2 else \\"未选中\\") def btnClicked(self): checkedItems = [] if self.chk1.isChecked(): checkedItems.append(self.chk1.text()) if self.chk2.isChecked(): checkedItems.append(self.chk2.text()) if self.chk3.isChecked(): checkedItems.append(self.chk3.text()) print(\\"选中的项：\\", checkedItems) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": app = QApplication(sys.argv) window = CheckBoxDemo() window.show() sys.exit(app.exec_()) \`\`\` 这个脚本首先创建了一个类\`CheckBoxDemo\`，该类继承自\`QWidget\`，这样就可以使用Qt的所有窗口功能。 -

He ate eggs so runny they could've won a marathon, toast so crispy it could double as a weapon, and enough bacon to make a pig question its existence. Having ingested his bodyweight in breakfast, Mr. Greedy, in a move that defied all known laws of physics and common sense, decided to go for a walk. He soon stumbled upon a cave that clearly had \\"DO NOT ENTER\\" vibes, but since when did Mr. Men follow the rules, right? Inside the cave, everything was larger than life—because apparently, normal-sized objects were on strike. The air was filled with a scent that could only be described as \\"fairy-tale fast food,\\" and before him lay food so oversized, it made Mr. Greedy feel like he was on a diet show gone wrong. Just as he was about to dive into a pie the size of a trampoline, a giant appeared. This wasn't your usual fairy-tale giant but a modern one who apparently had taken up teaching lessons in irony as a side hustle. \\"Ah, Mr. Greedy, let's expand your horizons... and your waistline,\\" the giant boomed, deciding on a punishment that sounded more like a dream come true for Mr. Greedy—a buffet with a \\"consume at your own risk\\" tag. As Mr. Greedy began his unintended eating challenge, the food seemed to regenerate—because, in this logic-barren world, calories are apparently infinite and digestion is a myth. Finally, when Mr. Greedy looked like he was about to go kaboom, the giant, with a chuckle that sounded suspiciously like a burp, offered him a deal: promise to never be greedy again, and you're free to wobble away. Mr. Greedy, now sweating maple syrup, vowed to change his ways. The giant, in a twist that surprised no one but Mr. Greedy, turned out to be a magical dietitian looking to make a point about moderation in a manner so extreme, it made reality TV look sane. Fast forward to the end—because who needs a smooth transition?—Mr. Greedy had morphed into a thinner version of his oval self. He stuck to his promise by only dreaming of giant food, which is a loophole we didn't see coming. Apparently, in this world, solving a gluttony problem by eating your weight in giant food and then losing weight through sheer plot convenience is peak storytelling. And they all lived absurdly ever after, questioning reality, dietary choices, and why on Earth anyone thought venturing into a strange cave was a solid plan. But remember, kids (and adults who enjoy a dash of ludicrous in their reading), the moral of the story is... well, we're not quite sure, but it's probably something about moderation or why you shouldn't trust dieting advice from giants.

En otras palabras, la electronegatividad indica la tendencia de un átomo a atraer los electrones compartidos en un enlace químico. Los átomos con mayor electronegatividad tienden a atraer con más fuerza los electrones compartidos, lo que resulta en una distribución desigual de la carga en las moléculas, dando lugar a enlaces covalentes polares. Por otro lado, cuando dos átomos tienen una diferencia significativa en electronegatividad, se forma un enlace iónico, donde uno de los átomos (el más electronegativo) atrae los electrones con mayor fuerza, creando iones con cargas opuestas. La electronegatividad se representa mediante la escala de Pauling, que asigna valores que van desde aproximadamente 0.7 para el elemento menos electronegativo (francio) hasta 4.0 para el más electronegativo (flúor). Esta escala ayuda a determinar la polaridad de los enlaces químicos y compuestos, así como a predecir la naturaleza de las interacciones entre átomos en una molécula.

La electronegatividad es una propiedad química de los átomos que representa su capacidad para atraer electrones hacia sí mismos en un enlace químico. Se basa en la energía de ionización y la afinidad electrónica de los elementos. Cuanto mayor sea la electronegatividad de un átomo, más fuerte será su atracción por los electrones compartidos en un enlace químico covalente.

Los elementos más electronegativos son los gases nobles y metales alcalinos como el flúor, el oxígeno y el cloro, mientras que los elementos más electronegativos son los metales alcalinos y alcalinotérreos como el calcio y el magnesio. La diferencia de electronegatividad entre dos elementos en un enlace químico determina el tipo de enlace que se forma. Si la diferencia es alta, se forma un enlace iónico, donde los electrones se transfieren de un átomo al otro.

Cuando observamos los elementos de las series de los lantánidos (iones de tierras raras) y actínidos, notamos que, a medida que avanzamos de izquierda a derecha en la tabla periódica, el tamaño de los átomos disminuye ligeramente en lugar de aumentar como se esperaría. Esta disminución en el tamaño atómico se debe a la contracción de las capas electrónicas. En las series de lantánidos y actínidos, los electrones se agregan a orbitales f en lugar de a orbitales d, como ocurre con el resto de los elementos de transición. Los orbitales f tienen una penetración nuclear más pobre que los orbitales d, lo que resulta en una menor eficacia de pantalla de los electrones de valencia y, por lo tanto, en una contracción de las capas electrónicas.

Datos: - Masa del objeto (m): 3 kg - Fuerza aplicada (F): 15 N - Distancia recorrida (d): 10 metros Para calcular el trabajo realizado sobre el objeto, podemos utilizar la fórmula del trabajo en función de la potencia y la distancia: Trabajo = Potencia * Tiempo Como la potencia es igual al producto de la fuerza aplicada por la velocidad (P = F * v), y conocemos la fuerza y la distancia, podemos despejar la velocidad: P = F * v 15 W = 15 N * v v = 1 m/s Ahora podemos calcular el trabajo utilizando la fórmula del trabajo en función de la potencia y el tiempo: Trabajo = Potencia * Tiempo Trabajo = F * v * d Trabajo = 15 N * 1 m/s * 10 m Trabajo = 150 J Por lo tanto, el trabajo realizado sobre el objeto es de 150 Julios. Espero que este ejercicio te haya sido útil.

Calculate the maximum height of the ball and the velocity of the ball when it passes 10m above the floor.","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conservation of mechanical energy, specifically the kinetic and potential energy of the basketball. Given: - Mass of the ball (m): 400g = 0.4 kg - Initial velocity (v₀): 24.3 m/s - Initial height (h₀): 0 (assumed to be ground level) - Acceleration due to gravity (g): 9.81 m/s² - Final height (hf): 10m 1. Calculate the maximum height of the ball: At the maximum height, the velocity of the ball is zero (v = 0) as it reaches the highest point before descending. Using the conservation of mechanical energy: Initial kinetic energy + Initial potential energy = Final kinetic energy + Final potential energy 1/2 * m * v₀² + m * g * h₀ = 1/2 * m * v² + m * g * hf Let's first calculate the maximum height by considering the initial kinetic energy and potential energy are converted into potential energy at the highest point: 1/2 * m * v₀² = m * g * hf 0.5 * 0.4 * (24.3)² = 0.4 * 9.81 * h_max h_max = (0.5 * 0.4 * (24.3)²) / (0.4 * 9.81) = 29.42 meters Therefore, the maximum height of the ball is 29.42 meters. 2. Calculate the velocity of the ball when it passes 10m above the floor: Now, let's calculate the velocity of the ball when it is at a height of 10m above the floor. We can use the conservation of mechanical energy again and solve for the final velocity (v) of the ball at this height: 1/2 * m * v₀² + m * g * h₀ = 1/2 * m * v² + m * g * hf 0.5 * 0.4 * (24.3)² = 0.4 * 9.81 * 0 + 0.4 * 9.81 * 10 + 0.5 * 0.4 * v² Using this equation, we can calculate the final velocity of the ball when it is 10m above the floor. I hope this helps you solve the problem. Let me know if you need further assistance."},{"instruction":"ep a que es igual","output":"Simplifiquémoslo un poco más. Para calcular la altura máxima a la que la pelota llega, podemos usar las ecuaciones de movimiento y las leyes de la cinemática. En este caso, aplicamos la ecuación de energía mecánica entre los puntos inicial (suelo) y final (altura máxima): Energía inicial = Energía final La energía inicial se compone de la energía cinética y potencial en el punto de lanzamiento, y la energía final solo tiene energía potencial en el punto más alto de la trayectoria (donde la velocidad es cero). La energía cinética inicial (Ek) se convierte en energía potencial en la altura máxima. Entonces, tenemos: 1/2 * m * v₀² = m * g * h_max Dado que la velocidad en el punto más alto (altura máxima) es cero, podemos resolver para la altura máxima (h_max) en función de la masa de la pelota (m) y la velocidad inicial (v₀) dada en el problema. Calculamos h_max: m * g * h_max = 1/2 * m * v₀² h_max = (1/2 * v₀²) / g Luego, para determinar la velocidad de la pelota cuando pasa a 10m de altura, aplicaremos de nuevo la ecuación de conservación de la energía mecánica. La energía total de la pelota en el punto 10m se compone de la energía cinética y potencial en ese punto: 1/2 * m * v² + m * g * 10m = 1/2 * m * v₀² Resolviendo esta ecuación puedes encontrar la velocidad de la pelota cuando pasa a 10m de altura.

Se puede ver como la energía almacenada en un sistema debido a su posición o configuración en un campo de fuerza, como el campo gravitacional. La energía potencial puede convertirse en otros tipos de energía, como la energía cinética, cuando el objeto se mueve o experimenta cambios en su posición. La fórmula general para la energía potencial gravitatoria, que se relaciona con la altitud y la gravedad, es: Energía Potencial Gravitatoria (Ep) = m * g * h Donde: - Ep es la energía potencial gravitatoria - m es la masa del objeto - g es la aceleración debido a la gravedad - h es la altura del objeto sobre una referencia (como el suelo) Esta fórmula indica que la energía potencial gravitatoria de un objeto en una posición elevada con respecto a una referencia es proporcional a su masa, la aceleración gravitatoria y la altura desde la referencia. En el caso de un sistema de referencia terrestre, la altura en la fórmula puede ser positiva o negativa, dependiendo de si el objeto está por encima o por debajo de la referencia (generalmente el suelo). La energía potencial está asociada con la capacidad de hacer trabajo en base a la posición o configuración de un objeto en un campo de fuerza. A medida que un objeto se mueve o cambia de posición en relación con el campo de fuerza, la energía potencial se convierte en energía cinética, que está relacionada con el movimiento.

We will consider the initial kinetic energy of the ball when thrown, the potential energy at different heights, and the final velocity of the ball at a given height.

Der Übergang zur letzten Form, der Demokratie, erfolgt nach dem Muster der von Feuerbach beschriebenen Emanzipation. Ein Objektives wird in ein Subjektives verwandelt, das indirekte Selbstbewußtsein in ein direktes - der machthabende Gott wird (als sich bislang selbst nicht durchsichtige unbeherrschte Herrschaft über sich selbst unter der Form einer abstrakten Allgemeinheit) seiner Macht enthoben! Der Übergang zur Demokratie ist verbunden mit einer Emanzipation von jeglicher Vorherrschaft eines falschen Allgemeinen, das - ursprünglich nur besonderes Moment - sich zur verkehrten Macht, zu einem Ersten aufgebläht hat. In der Demokratie ist die Verfassung als eine vom Volke gesetzte immer auch als solche präsent: »In der Monarchie z. B. hat dies Besondre, die politische Verfassung, die Bedeutung des alles Besondren beherrschenden und bestimmenden Allgemeinen 18.« So herrschte in allen von der Demokratie unterschiedenen Formen der »Staat, die Verfassung, das Gesetz«, aber es herrscht nur solange, wie sich die Menschen diese Herrschaft gefallen lassen. Die geschichtliche Entwicklung besteht demnach darin, daß die Menschen immer neue Formen der Objektivierung als Objektivierungen durchschauen, bis schließlich auch die letztmögliche Form der Entfremdung abgeworfen wird: »Von den verschiedenen Momenten des Volkslebens war es am schwersten, den politischen Staat, die Verfassung herauszubilden. Sie entwickelte sich als die allgemeine Vernunft gegenüber den anderen Sphären, als ein Jenseits derselben. Die geschichtliche Aufgabe bestand dann in ihrer Revindikation, aber die besonderen Sphären haben dabei nicht das Bewußtsein, daß ihr privates Wesen mit dem jenseitigen Wesen der Verfassung oder des politischen Staates fällt, und daß sein jenseitiges Dasein nichts andres als der Affirmativ ihrer eigenen Entfremdung ist. Die politische Verfassung war bisher die religiöse Sphäre, die Religion des Volkslebens, der Himmel seiner Allgemeinheit gegenüber dem irdischen Dasein seiner Wirklichkeit.. .19.« Wir haben diese frühe, noch durchaus idealistische Geschichts-konstruktion etwas ausführlicher referiert, weil nur vor diesem Hintergrund die einzelnen Detailkritiken und zum Teil langatmigen Auseinandersetzungen voll begreifbar sind. Es kann hier nicht der Ort sein, um nun diese einzelnen Punkte aufzugreifen; was uns hier vordringlich interessiert ist die Genesis von Begrifflichkeiten, denen wir dann in der von Marx selbst als materialistisch bezeichneten Geschichtsauffassung begegnen, ohne daß dort näher darauf eingegangen wird, ob sich diese Begriffe angesichts der präzisierten materialistischen Position in dieser Form noch halten lassen. Das bezieht sich nun insbesondre auf den Begriff der Verdopplung und den Aspekt der illusorischen Gemeinschaftlichkeit. Von beiden ist in der Deutschen Ideologie wörtlich die Rede. Für Marx ist es geradezu das »Rätsel des Mystizismus«, wenn Hegel dort, wo ihm das Staatsbewußtsein in seiner wirklich empirischen Form, als öffentliches Bewußtsein, begegnet, nur ein Potpourri von »Gedanken und Ansichten der Vielen« sieht. Hier treibt Hegel die Interpretation einer ohnehin schon verkehrten Welt auf die Spitze: was - so fragt sich Marx und entwickelt dabei einige nähere Bestimmungen des »Wesens aller Verfassungen«, seines demokratischen »Gegenbildes«, das er der Hegelschen Auffassung konfrontiert - kann der Staat anderes sein als die »allgemeinen Angelegenheiten« des Volkes, also die Sache eines jeden. Sein staat-liches Dasein, das hörten wir schon, ist ein bestimmtes Moment der sozialen Qualität des Menschen; und zwar ein wesentliches, das an seiner »natürlichen Aktion« zu behindern gleichbedeutend wäre mit dem Ausschluß des Menschen aus der menschlichen Gesellschaft: »In einem vernünftigen Staat gehört eher ein Examen dazu, Schuster zu werden, als exekutiver Staatsbeamter; denn die Schusterei ist eine Fertigkeit, ohne die man ein guter Staatsbürger, ein sozialer Mensch sein kann; aber das nötige >Staatswissen< ist eine Bedingung, ohne die man im Staat außer dem Staat lebt, von sich selbst, von der Luft abgeschnitten ist 20.« Da es eine seiner bewußten sozialen Funktionen ist, versteht es sich von selbst, daß er als Staatsmitglied nur durch Beraten und Beschließen an den allgemeinen Angelegenheiten teilnimmt, denn nur dieses Tun ist die »Effektuierung des Staats als wirkliche Angelegenheit«. Mit anderen Worten: die Form, in der die allgemeine Angelegenheit erst wirklich ist, ist nicht vom Inhalt abzutrennen. Da das Volk selbst, der Gattungswille, die allgemeine Angelegenheit ist, ist dieser erst wirklicher Gattungswille, wenn er in selbstbewußter allgemeiner Form existiert. Doch wie stellt Hegel diesen Sachverhalt dar? Marx kritisiert die von Hegel durchgeführte Trennung zwischen Substanz und Subjekt, dem »Ansichsein« und dem »Fürsich- sein« der allgemeinen Angelegenheit als abstrakten Mystizismus. Für Hegel existiert die allgemeine Angelegenheit bereits als Geschäft der Regierung, in der Form des Ansichseins, zu der die Form des Fürsichseins äußerlich hinzutritt. »Das ständische Element«, so heißt es im § 301 der Rechtsphilosophie, »hat die Bestimmung, daß die allgemeine Angelegenheit nicht nur an sich, sondern auch für sich, d. i. daß das Moment der subjektiven formellen Freiheit, das öffentliche Bewußtsein als empirische Allgemeinheit der Ansichten und Gedanken der Vielen, darin zur Existenz komme.« Gemessen an der Marxschen Vorstellung des wahren Staates stellt Hegel den Vorgang gerade verkehrt dar (wenngleich er dem tatsächlichen Sachverhalt eben deswegen um so näher kommt): nicht die Subjekte, die einzelnen Mitglieder des Volkes vergegenständlichen sich in ihren allgemeinen Angelegenheiten, bestimmen sich selbst, sondern die an sich fertigen allgemeinen Angelegenheiten »kommen zum Subjekt«, bedürfen seiner aus gleichsam logischen Gründen, damit sie eben nicht nur in dieser Form existieren, sondern auch in der anderen. Diese verkehrte Hegelsche Darstellung des Wesens bzw. diese richtige Darstellung dieser unwirklichen Existenz des Wesens wird von Marx einer exzessiven Kritik unterworfen, in der das »jung-hegelianische Sprachspiel« ausgiebig durchexerziert wird: »Hegel idealisiert die Bürokratie und empirisiert das öffentliche Bewußtsein. Hegel kann das wirkliche Bewußtsein sehr ä part behandeln, eben weil er das ä part Bewußtsein als das öffentliche behandelt hat. Er braucht sich um so weniger um die wirkliche Existenz des Staatsgeistes zu kümmern, als er schon in seinen soi-disant Existenzen ihn gehörig realisiert zu haben meint21.« Im Mittelpunkt der Kritik steht der Gedanke, der von der Äußerlichkeit der Form gegenüber dem Inhalt auf den Inhalt zurückschließt. Ist die Form nur formell, existiert der Inhalt bereits auch schon in anderen Formen, so heißt dies umgekehrt, daß jene Form, die für die wirkliche Form des Inhalts gelten soll, gerade .nicht diesen wirklichen Inhalt zu ihrem Inhalt hat. Bleiben wir beim ersten Aspekt, der uns die ursprüngliche Fassung des späteren Begriffs der illusorischen Gemeinschaftlichkeit in der Deutschen Ideologie zu sein scheint. Die allgemeine Angelegenheit ist ohne Tun des Volkes zustande gekommen, sie existiert ja schon als Geschäft der Regierung. Wenn daher die fürsichseiende Form, das ständische Element, hinzutritt, so ist dies eine reine Scheinform: »Das ständische Element ist die illusorische Existenz der Staatsangelegenheiten als einer Volkssache. Die Illusion, daß die allgemeine Angelegenheit allgemeine Angelegenheit, öffentliche Angelegenheit sei, oder die Illusion, daß die Sache des Volkes allgemeine Angelegenheit sei . . . Das ständische Element ist die politische Illusion der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft22.«”翻译为中文","output":"让我们转向第二个方面。转向最后一种形态，即民主，的进程遵循了费尔巴哈所描述的解放模式。一个客观的事物被转变为主观的，间接的自我意识被转变为直接的——拥有权力的神（作为迄今为止对自身不透明的、不受控制的自我统治，在一种抽象普遍性的形式下）被剥夺了权力！转向民主与从任何错误的普遍性的主导地位的解放联结在一起，这种错误的普遍性——最初只是特定的时刻——膨胀成了颠倒的力量，成为了第一位。在民主制中，作为人民制定的宪法始终如此地呈现：“例如，在君主制中，这一特定的，政治宪法，具有统治和决定一切特定事物的普遍性的含义。” 因此，在民主制与之不同的所有形式中，“国家、宪法、法律”统治着，但它只是在人们容忍这种统治的情况下才统治。因此，历史的发展在于，人们逐渐识别出新的形式的客观化作为客观化，直到最后可能的异化形式也被丢弃：“在人民生活的不同方面中，形成政治国家、宪法是最困难的。它作为对立于其他领域的普遍理性发展，作为它们的超越。那么历史任务便在于它的重新索取，但这些特定领域并没有意识到它们的私有本质与宪法或政治国家的超越本质相吻合，以及其超越存在无非是它们自我异化的肯定。迄今为止，政治宪法是人民生活的宗教领域，是其相对于现实存在的普遍性的天堂...” 我们之所以较为详细地引述这种早期、仍然是理想主义的历史构造，是因为只有在这个背景下，才能充分理解各个细节批评和部分冗长的论争。这里不是逐个讨论这些点的地方；我们当前最关心的是词汇的起源，然后我们在马克思自称为唯物主义的历史观中遇到这些词汇，而没有进一步讨论这些概念面对精确化的唯物主义立场是否仍能保持这种形式。这特别涉及到“混合”概念和虚幻的共同体性。在《德意志意识形态》中字面上提到了这两者。 对于马克思来说，当黑格尔在遇到国家意识以其真正的经验形式，即作为公共意识时，仅仅看到了“众多人的思想和观点的大杂烩”，这简直是“神秘主义之谜”。在这里，黑格尔将对已经颠倒的世界的解释推向极致：马克思这样问自己，并在此提出了对“所有宪法本质”的一些进一步定义，他提出了一个民主的“对立面”，并将其与黑格尔的观点对立——国家能够是什么，如果不是人民的“一般事务”，即每个人的事情呢。我们已经听说，他的国家存在是人的社会品质的一个特定时刻；而且这是一个基本方面，妨碍它等同于将人排除在人类社会之外：“在一个理性的国家中，成为一名鞋匠更需要考试，而不是成为一名行政官员；因为制鞋是一项技能，没有它一个人可以是一个好公民，一个社会人；但必要的‘国家知识’是一种条件，没有它一个人就生活在国家之外，与自己、与空气隔绝。” 由于这是他的一个有意识的社会功能，所以自不待言，他作为国家成员只通过商议和决策参与一般事务，因为只有这样的行为才是“国家作为实际事务的实现”。换句话说：一般事务首次真实存在的形式不能与内容分离。由于人民本身，即物种意志，是一般事务，所以只有当它以自觉的一般形式存在时，这个物种意志才是真正的物种意志。但黑格尔是如何描述这种情况的呢？马克思批评黑格尔对一般事务的本质和主体之间的分离，即一般事务的“自在之为”和“为自己之为”作为抽象的神秘主义。对于黑格尔而言，一般事务已经作为政府的业务以自在之为的形式存在，而为自己之为的形式则是外在附加的。“政府元素”，在《法哲学》的§ 301中是这样说的，“具有这样的规定：一般事务不仅是自在的，也是为自己的，即主观的形式自由的时刻，作为许多人观点和思想的经验性普遍性，在其中实现存在。” 与马克思对真正国家的设想相比，黑格尔恰恰相反地表述了这一过程（尽管正因为如此，它更接近实际情况）：不是主体，即人民的个别成员在他们的一般事务中实现自我，决定自我，而是已经完成的一般事务“走向主体”，出于某种逻辑原因需要它，以便它们不仅仅以这种形式存在，而且也以另一种形式存在。 马克思对这种颠倒的黑格尔表述的本质或者说对这种非现实存在的本质的正确表述进行了过分的批评，其中“青年黑格尔派的言语游戏”被充分运用：“黑格尔理想化了官僚体系，而实证化了公共意识。黑格尔可以很冷淡地处理真实的意识，正因为他已经将分散的意识作为公共意识处理了。既然他在他所谓的存在中已经适当地实现了国家精神，他就更不需要关心国家精神的真实存在。” 批评的核心思想是，从形式对内容的外在性推断回内容。如果形式只是形式上的，内容已经以其他形式存在，那么这意味着，那些应该代表内容真实形式的形式，实际上并没有将这些真实内容作为其内容。让我们回到第一个方面，这似乎是我们在《德意志意识形态》中所见到的虚幻共同体性的后来词汇的原始构成。一般事务没有人民的行动而产生，它已经作为政府的事务存在。因此，当为自己之为的形式，即政府元素，加入时，它是一种纯粹的形式外观：“政府元素是国家事务作为人民事务的虚幻存在。一般事务是一般事务，公共事务是公共事务的幻觉，或者人民的事务是一般事务的幻觉... 政府元素是市民社会的政治幻觉。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Das Beraten und Beschließen der Subjekte, das Vertreten der Ansichten und Gedanken der Vielen in der ständischen Versammlung ist also seiner reinen Form nach die existierende Täuschung, da sie an ihr selbst vorgibt, die Volkssache als eine allgemeine Angelegenheit zu verhandeln, als ob die Sache des Volkes überhaupt in dieser Form verhandelt werden könnte. Und damit kommt Marx zum zweiten Aspekt dieser Kritik. Ist diese Form selbst nur die formelle Existenzweise eines ihr äußerlichen Inhalts, so kann auch dieser fertige, bislang nur in ansichseiender Form existierende Inhalt nicht die allgemeine Angelegenheit sein. Die Äußerlichkeit der Form gegenüber dem Inhalt muß selbst noch in einer wesentlichen Beziehung zum Inhalt stehen, sie muß in dieser bestimmten Form selbst noch Ausdruck des Inhalts sein. »Der moderne Staat, in dem die allgemeine Angelegenheit wie die Beschäftigung mit derselben ein Monopol ist und dagegen die Monopole die wirklichen, allgemeinen Angelegenheiten sind, hat die sonderbare Erfindung gemacht, die allgemeine Angelegenheit als eine bloße Form sich anzueignen. (Das Wahre ist, daß nur die Form allgemeine Angelegenheit ist.) Es hat damit die entsprechende Form für seinen Inhalt gefunden, der nur scheinbar die wirkliche allgemeine Angelegenheit ist23.« Würde man nicht an die Kontroverse denken, die Marx zu dieser erneuten Beschäftigung mit Hegel veranlaßt hat, oder an seine Berichte von den Debatten über das Holzdiebstahlgesetz im rheinischen Landtag, so läge es in der Tat gerade hier nahe, ein Moment an sprachspielerischer Verselbständigung zu vermuten. Doch schon einige Seiten weiter wird kurz darauf hingewiesen, daß die Besitzlosigkeit, der Stand der unmittelbaren Arbeit weniger einen »Stand der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft als deren Boden bildet, auf dem ihre Kreise ruhen und sich bewegen« 24. Die eigentümliche Dualität von Form und Inhalt in diesen spezifischen Formulierungen läßt sich also schon sehr wohl als bewußte, wenn auch abstrakteste Widergabe einer Struktur deuten, in der der politische Staat in der Form der Abgehobenheit von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft nicht nur auf die bestimmte Struktur dieser Gesellschaft selbst zurückzuführen ist, sondern gerade in dieser spezifischen Form Klassenstaat ist. Bevor wir uns der Marxschen Darlegung dieses Sachverhalts unter dem Aspekt der Verdopplung zuwenden, müssen wir noch einmal auf die Geschichtskonstruktion eingehen, denn gerade dieser Aspekt läßt sich kaum vom Idealismus derselben abgelöst diskutieren. Hier zeigt sich am deutlichsten die Tragweite des von Marx selbst als »Kultus des abstrakten Menschen« apostrophierten Vorgehens, und zugleich wird auch einsehbar, warum gerade dieses Moment der Staatstheorie in den späteren Schriften nicht mehr auftaucht. Das läßt sich schon an der Sprache nachweisen. Daß Marx bis in die Heilige Familie hinein ungebrochen von dem Menschen spricht, ist ein sicheres Indiz, daß er sich nach wie vor in den Bahnen des Feuerbachschen Denkens bewegt. Der abstrakte Mensch, das ist dieses sich gleichbleibende, identische Wesen, und als treibende Kraft des geschichtlichen Prozesses wird nicht, wie dann später, der Widerspruch zwischen Produktivkräften und Produktionsverhältnissen angesehen, sondern jener zwischen diesem Wesen und der jeweiligen unangemessenen Existenzweise des Menschen, die aber in ihrer Bestimmtheit selbst das (wenn auch ihm nicht als solches durchsichtige) Produkt dieses Menschen ist. Was immer wir an Organisationen und Institutionen vorfinden, es sind also Vergegenständlichungen des Menschen. Wie schon erwähnt, übernimmt Marx die Hegelsche Darstellung der Selbstzerrissenheit des modernen Menschen, wobei er wiederholt (und im Gegensatz zu Hegels Äußerungen) insistierend darauf hinweist, daß es sich hier nicht um eine gedachte, sondern wirkliche Zerrissenheit handelt. Wenn das Denken, das bei Abstraktionen stehenbleibt, als ein oberflächliches denunziert wird, so kann das getrost zurückgewiesen werden: das Denken kann nur so gut oder schlecht sein wie diese Wirklichkeit selber: »Daß aber die Bestimmung, Mitglied des Staates< zu sein, eine >abstrakte< Bestimmung ist, ist nicht die Schuld dieses Denkens, sondern der Hegelschen Entwicklung und der wirklichen modernen Verhältnisse, welche die Trennung des wirklichen Lebens vom Staatsleben voraussetzen und die Staatsqualität zu einer abstrakten Bestimmung< des wirklichen Staatsmitglieds machen25.« Das Auseinandertreten von Staat und Gesellschaft ist daher nur ein anderer Ausdruck für die Spaltung des Menschen: »Am Einzelnen erscheint hier, was das allgemeine Gesetz ist. Bürgerliche Gesellschaft und Staat sind getrennt. Also ist auch der Staatsbürger und der Bürger, das Mitglied der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, getrennt. Er muß also eine wesentliche Diremption mit sich selbst vornehmen. Als wirklicher Bürger findet er sich in einer doppelten Organisation, der bürokratischen — die ist eine äußere formelle Bestimmung des jenseitigen Staats, der Regierungsgewalt, die ihn und seine selbständige Wirklichkeit nicht tangiert - der sozialen, der Organisation der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft26.« Der Mensch, das menschliche Wesen, existiert unter der Form der Entfremdung, einerseits unter der bürokratischen der Regierung, andrerseits unter der sozialen der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft.”翻译为中文","output":"因此，主体的讨论和决定，代表众多人的观点和想法在政府集会上，按其纯净的形式来说，是现存的错觉，因为它本身假装将人民事务作为一项普遍事务来处理，仿佛人民的事项本可以以这种方式被讨论。由此，马克思转向这一批评的第二个方面。如果这种形式本身只是其外在内容的形式存在方式，那么这个完成的，到目前为止只以自在形式存在的内容，也不能是普遍事务。形式对内容的外在性，必须本身仍与内容保持一种本质的联系，它必须在这一特定形式中本身仍是内容的表达。“现代国家，其中普遍事务及其处理成为一种垄断，而相反，垄断成为真正的普遍事务，发明了这种奇特的发明，即将普遍事务作为一种纯形式来占有。（真相是，只有形式是普遍事务。）因此，它为其内容找到了相应的形式，这个内容只是表面上是真正的普遍事务。”如果不考虑马克思重新关注黑格尔的争论，或他关于莱茵省议会上木材盗窃法的辩论报告，那么在这里确实似乎是在怀疑一个语言游戏的自主化。但就在几页之后，就简要指出，贫困，即直接劳动的状态，较少构成“市民社会的一个阶级，而是构成其圆圈休息和运动的基础。”这些特定表述中形式与内容的奇特二元性，因此可以理解为对一种结构的有意识且最为抽象的反映，在这种结构中，政治国家以与市民社会分离的形式出现，不仅可以追溯到这一社会本身的特定结构，而且正是以这一特定形式出现为阶级国家。 在我们转向马克思关于此事实的论述，从重复这一概念的角度出发之前，我们需要再次讨论历史构造，因为这一方面几乎无法与其理想主义分开讨论。在这里，马克思自称的“抽象人崇拜”的做法的影响最为明显，同时也解释了为什么这个国家理论的时刻在后来的著作中不再出现。这可以从语言中证明。马克思一直到《圣家》仍然毫无保留地谈论人，这是一个明确的迹象，表明他仍然处于费尔巴哈思想的轨迹中。抽象的人，就是这个保持一致、相同的存在，并且作为历史进程的驱动力不是像后来那样看作是生产力与生产关系之间的矛盾，而是这个存在与人的各种不适当的存在方式之间的矛盾，但这些存在方式在其确定性本身就是这个人的（尽管对他本人而言并非如此清晰）产物。因此，我们找到的所有组织和机构，都是人的物化。正如前面提到的，马克思采用了黑格尔对现代人自我分裂的描述，其中他反复（与黑格尔的陈述相反）强调，这不是一个想象的，而是真实的分裂。如果停留在抽象上的思考被指责为肤浅，这种指责可以放心地被拒绝：思考可以像现实本身一样好或坏：“成为国家成员的‘决定’是一个‘抽象的’决定，这不是这种思考的过错，而是黑格尔的发展和现代实际状况的过错，这些状况假设了真实生活与国家生活的分离，并使国家资格成为真实国家成员的‘抽象的决定’。” 因此，国家和社会的分开只是人分裂的另一种表达：“在个体身上出现的，是普遍法则。市民社会和国家是分开的。因此，国家公民和市民，即市民社会的成员，也是分开的。他必须对自己进行一次本质的二分。作为一个真实的市民，他发现自己处于双重组织中，官僚组织 - 这是国家的外在形式决定，是政府权力，不涉及他和他的独立现实 - 社会组织，即市民社会的组织。” 人，人的本质，在官僚政府的形式下和在市民社会的形式下，以异化的形式存在。"},{"instruction":"请将“Ein weiterer Aspekt kommt hinzu. Vorangetrieben, das wurde er-wähnt, wird der geschichtliche Prozeß durch den Widerspruch zwi-schen Wesen und unangemessener Existenz. Der Widerspruch als treibende Unruhe verschwindet von selbst, wenn beides, Wesen und Existenz, in der Demokratie gleichsam zur Deckung gelangen. Wir haben bisher konstatiert, daß von der Demokratie her, als der wahren Einheit des Allgemeinen und Besonderen, die vorhergehenden Staatsverfassungen als bornierte und beschränkte Gestaltungen die-ser Verfassungsgattung einsehbar werden: das Mittelalter, als die unmittelbare Einheit beider Momente, wird dann konsequent als »Demokratie der Unfreiheit« bezeichnet; die moderne Verfassung als eine Extremalsituation, durch die hindurch der geschichtliche Prozeß seinen Weg nehmen muß, um dann auf einer höheren Stufe die fürsichseiende Einheit zu erreichen. Diese Konstruktion müssen wir nun noch etwas genauer betrachten. Wenn die Demokratie als die adäquate Existenzweise des menschlichen Wesens gilt, in der das Allgemeine des Menschen, was er mit jedem Menschen gemeinsam hat, sein Gemeinwesen, seine ihn mit allen andern verbindende Einheit, nun auch direkt und bewußt zum Gegenstand wird, so ist das Mittelalter demgegenüber als das absolute Gegenteil zu betrachten. Hier ist der Mensch von seinem Wesen (insofern es ihm gegenständlich wird) völlig getrennt, eben weil es in unmittelbarer Einheit mit dem Besonderen existiert: »Die ständische Verfassung, wo sie nicht eine Tradition des Mittelalters ist, ist der Versuch, teils in der politischen Sphäre selbst, den Menschen in die Beschränktheit seiner Privatsphäre zurückzustürzen, seine Besonderheit zu seinem substantiellen Bewußtsein zu machen und dadurch, daß politisch der Ständeunterschied existiert, ihn auch wieder zu einem sozialen zu machen 27.« Der Einzelne ist völlig eingebunden in Korporationen, Ständen und anderen Verfestigungen überindividueller Art, er ist ein »festgestelltes«, mit einer Bestimmtheit zusammenfallendes Individuum, das Marx, im Anschluß an die Hegelsche Unterscheidung zwischen menschlichem und tierischem Dasein, als tierisches Dasein der Menschheit bestimmt: »Nicht nur basiert der Stand auf der Trennung der Sozietät als dem herrschenden Gesetz, er trennt den Menschen von seinem allgemeinen Wesen, er macht ihn zu einem Tier, das unmittelbar mit seiner Bestimmtheit zusammenfällt. Das Mittelalter ist die Tiergeschichte der Menschheit, ihre Zoologie 28.« Dagegen ist die »moderne Zeit, die Zivilisation«, ein großer Fortschritt. Denn die Diremption des Menschen bringt ihn seinem allgemeinen Wesen näher, oder anders: er nähert sich seinem Wesen - wenngleich in einer verkehrten, selbst noch abstrakten Form. Das zuerst notwendig abstrakte Dasein des Einzelnen ist eben die einzig mögliche Gestalt, in der sich der Mensch von seiner falschen Wirklichkeit befreien kann: »In seiner politischen Bedeutung macht sich das Glied der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft los von seinem Stande, seiner wirklichen Privatstellung; hier ist es allein, daß er als Mensch zur Bedeutung kommt, oder daß seine Bestimmung als Staatsglied, als soziales Wesen, als seine menschliche Bestimmung erscheint29.« Erschien uns in der oben skizzierten Deutung das politische Dasein der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, das ständische Element, ausschließlich unter einem negativen Aspekt, so wird in dieser Betrachtung das immanent-positive, das sich selbst undurchsichtig Emanzipatorische hervorgehoben. Marx argumentiert so: die unmittelbare Einheit beider Momente wird aufgebrochen zugunsten einer Diremption, die aber keineswegs sofort in ihrer abschlußhaften Form existiert. Die Regierung, die Bürokratie, die wir schon als das »Ansichsein« der allgemeinen Angelegenheiten kennengelernt haben, ist eine Zwischenstufe zum »Für- sichsein« derselben: »Die bürgerliche Gesellschaft bewerkstelligt hier innerhalb ihrer selbst das Verhältnis des Staates und der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, welches andrerseits schon als Bürokratie existiert .« Das »Fürsichsein« der allgemeinen Angelegenheit, also die ständische Versammlung, kann jedoch nur in Existenz treten, wenn sich der Bürger von seiner empirischen Wirklichkeit losreißt und so zum Staatsidealisten wird: »In den ständischen Element wird das Allgemeine wirklich für sich, was es an sich ist, nämlich Gegensatz zum Besondern. Der Bürger muß seinen Stand, die bürgerliche Gesellschaft, den Privatstand, von sich abtun, um zu politischer Bedeutung und Wirksamkeit zu kommen; denn eben dieser Stand steht zwischen dem Individuum und dem politischen Staat31.« Staatsidealist ist also der sich von der bürgerlichen Organisation trennende Einzelne deshalb, weil er alle seine Besonderheit abwirft; alles, was seine empirische Wirklichkeit charakterisiert, läßt er hinter sich - was übrig bleibt, ist die nackte Individualität: »Um also als -wirklicher Staatsbürger sich zu verhalten, politische Bedeutsamkeit und Wirksamkeit zu erhalten, muß er aus seiner bürgerlichen Wirklichkeit heraustreten, von ihr abstrahieren (von mir gesperrt, H. R.), von dieser ganzen Organisation in seine Individualität sich zurückziehn; denn die einzige Existenz, die er für sein Staatsbürgertum findet, ist seine pure, blanke Individualität 32.<< Wenn eben das gesamte bisherige Dasein den ganzen Umkreis seiner besonderen Existenz umfaßte, er in verschiedenen Gemein-schaften existierte, so kann diese neue Form der Gemeinschaft nur noch den Menschen in seiner Individualität einbeziehen (dieser Aspekt der »freigesetzten« Individualität wird uns dann wieder in der Deutschen Ideologie begegnen - die zukünftige Gesellschaft zeichnet sich dadurch aus, daß jetzt zum ersten Male die Individuen als Individuen miteinander in Verbindung treten). Doch noch existiert sie nicht, noch ist sie nicht wirklich. Da der Mensch in der bürgerlichen Organisation seine gegenständliche Wirklichkeit hat, kann sein im emphatischen Sinne wirkliches menschliches Wesen ebenfalls nur erst in beschränkter, bornierter Form erscheinen, unter der Form des abstrakten politischen Daseins: »Da in der modernen Zeit die Staatsidee nicht anders als in der Abstraktion des nur politischen Staates oder der Abstraktion der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft von sich selbst, von ihrem wirklichen Zustande, erscheinen konnte, so ist es das Verdienst der Franzosen, diese abstrakte Wirklichkeit festgehalten, produziert und damit das politische Prinzip selbst produziert zu haben. Was man ihnen als Abstraktion vorwirft, ist also wahrhafte Konsequenz und das Produkt der, wenn auch erst in einem Gegensatz, aber in einem notwendigen Gegensatz, wiedergefundenen Staatsgesinnung33.« Formulierungen wie »wiedergefundene Staatsgesinnung« sind Ausdruck einer noch in idealistisch-geschichtsphilosophischer Form entworfenen Sub-jekt-Objekt-Konzeption der sich von ihren eigenen zur Objektivität erstarrten Verhältnissen emanzipierenden Menschheit; doch dieser »Kultus des abstrakten Menschen« verschwindet bei Marx, sobald er die Bedeutung des Arbeitsprozesses für die Selbstkonstituierung der menschlichen Gattung erkennt. Gleichwohl ist hier eine der entscheidenden ideologiekritischen Einsichten enthalten, die im spä-teren Materialismus wesentlich sein werden: wird, so würde der reife Marx sagen, die bürgerliche Existenzform zur Naturform verkehrt, so bleibt dem Theoretiker der Zugang zu den Formen des Überbaus unzugänglich; er versperrt sich die Einsicht in die Genese aller bürgerlichen Formbestimmtheiten, wenn er die zentrale Verkehrung an der Bais nicht als diese erkennt.”翻译为中文","output":"添加了另一个方面。如前所述，历史进程是由本质和不适当的存在之间的矛盾推动的。当本质和存在在民主制中达到某种覆盖时，这种作为驱动不安的矛盾自然消失。我们已经确认，从民主制出发，作为普遍与特殊的真正统一，先前的国家宪法形式被看做是这种宪法类型的有限和受限制的构造：中世纪，作为这两个方面的直接统一，进而一致地被称为“不自由的民主制”；现代宪法作为一个极端情况，历史进程必须通过它，然后在更高层次上达到自在存在的统一。我们现在需要更细致地观察这一构造。如果民主被视为人的本质的适当存在方式，在此人的普遍性，即他与每个人共有的，他的社群，他与所有其他人相连的统一，现在也直接并有意识地成为了对象，那么中世纪与之相比就是绝对的对立面。在这里，人与他的本质（就其变成对象而言）完全隔离，正因为它与特殊性以直接统一的形式存在：“在政治领域内，农奴制不是中世纪的传统，就是试图将人投入其私人领域的局限，使其特殊性成为其本质意识，并通过政治上存在的等级差异，再次使之成为一种社会差异。”个体完全被纳入法团、等级和其他超个体性的固化形态中，成为一个“确定的”、与特定性合一的个体，马克思继承了黑格尔区分人的与动物的存在的论断，将其定义为人类的动物性存在：“不仅身份等级建立在社会的主导法则即分裂上，它还将人与他的普遍本质分离，使他成为一个与其特定性直接合一的动物。中世纪是人类的动物史，它的动物学。”相反，“现代时代，文明”，是一个巨大的进步。因为人的分裂使他更接近他的普遍本质，或者换言之，他接近他的本质——尽管是以一种颠倒的，仍然是抽象的形式。个体最初不可避免的抽象存在正是人类能够从其错误现实中解放出来的唯一可能形式：“在其政治意义上，市民社会的成员摆脱了其身份等级，其实际的私人地位；仅在这里，他作为人才具有意义，或者说，他作为国家成员的目的，作为社会存在，作为他的人类目的呈现。”在上面的解释中，市民社会的政治存在，即身份等级，完全从一个负面的角度观察，而在这次考察中，突出了内在的积极性，即对自身不透明的解放性。马克思这样论证：两个方面的直接统一被打破，以赞成一种分裂，但这种分裂并非立即以其最终形式存在。政府，官僚制，我们已经将其认识为一般事务的“自在存在”，是通向同一事务的“为自己存在”的中间阶段：“市民社会在其内部实现了国家与市民社会的关系，这在另一方面已经作为官僚制存在。”一般事务的“为自己存在”，即身份等级大会，只有当公民摆脱其经验性现实，成为国家理想主义者时，才能成为现实：“在身份等级中，一般性真正为自己存在，成为它自在存在的对立面。公民必须摒弃其身份等级，市民社会，私人地位，以获得政治意义和影响力；因为正是这个身份等级阻止个体与政治国家之间的联系。”国家理想主义者因此是那些与市民组织分离的个体，因为他抛弃了所有的特殊性；他留下的是赤裸的个体性：“因此，作为一个真正的国家公民，为了获得政治重要性和效力，他必须脱离他的市民现实，从这整个组织中抽象出来，回归到他的个体性；因为他发现的作为国民的唯一存在，就是他的纯粹、赤裸的个体性。” 如果到目前为止他的整个存在包含了他特殊存在的全部范围，他存在于不同的社群中，那么这种新形式的社群只能还包括人的个体性（在《德意志意识形态》中我们会再次遇到这种“释放”的个体性——未来的社会以个体首次作为个体彼此联系的方式来区分）。但它还不存在，它还不是现实。由于人在市民组织中拥有其客观现实，他的真正的人类本质也只能以限制、有限的形式出现，以抽象的政治存在的形式出现：“由于在现代时代，国家理念不可能以非抽象的政治国家的形式或市民社会自身从其真实状态中的抽象存在为表现，因此法国人的功绩在于，他们保持了这种抽象现实，产生并因此产生了政治原则本身。因此，将这种抽象归咎于他们，实际上是真正的连贯性和找到的、尽管最初是在一种必要对立中，但在必要对立中重新找到的国家精神。”如“重新找到的国家精神”这样的表述，是一种仍以理想主义-历史哲学形式提出的主体-对象概念的表达，它涉及人类从自己变为客观性的僵硬关系中解放出来的情况；但这种“抽象人的崇拜”在马克思认识到劳动过程对人类物种自我构成的重要性之后就消失了。然而，这里包含了一些在后来的唯物主义中将是基本的意识形态批判洞见：如果，成熟的马克思会说，将市民生存形式变为自然形式，那么理论家就无法接触到上层建筑的形式；如果他不认识到这种中心转换在基础上的存在，则他就无法洞察到所有市民形式的起源。"},{"instruction":"请将“Vor diesem Hintergrund ist die Marxsche Kritik am § 308 zu sehen. Hegel weist die Forderung, daß »Alle einzeln an der Beratung und Beschließung über die allgemeinen Angelegenheiten des Staats Anteil haben sollen, weil diese Alle Mitglieder des Staats und dessen Angelegenheiten die Angelegenheiten aller sind«, als eine Vorstellung zurück, die das »demokratische Element ohne alle vernünftige Form in den Staatsorganismus, der nur durch solche Form es ist«, einsetzen möchte. Dem hält Marx sinngemäß entgegen, daß unter gegenwärtigen Bedingungen dieses demokratische Element allerdings nur in unvollkommener Form in den Staatsorganismus aufgenommen werden kann, da dieser ja bereits ohne dieses demokratische Moment existiert. Das Ziel muß jedoch sein, daß dieses demokratische Element adäquate Wirklichkeit erlangt, »das sich in dem ganzen Staatsorganismus seine vernünftige Form gibt« 34. Marx kann daher auch die Frage, ob »Alle einzeln« an der gesetzgebenden Gewalt teilnehmen oder sich durch Abgeordnete vertreten lassen, nur als eine Problemstellung auffassen, die, wird sie in dieser Alternative diskutiert, eine Diskussion innerhalb des abstrakten politischen Staates ist: »es ist eine abstrakte politische Frage« 35. Denn unter den gegebenen Voraussetzungen kann der Mensch nicht anders als in dieser Abstraktheit staatsbürgerliches Dasein erlangen: die demokratische Vorstellung ist selbst noch borniert, selbst noch bürgerlich, insofern die bürgerliche Welt als die einzig gegenständliche Wirklichkeit des Menschen in diese Forderung eingeht. Das wird an dieser Stelle noch nicht weiter ausgeführt, aber gemeint ist - auch in Hegels Zurückweisung - die gleichsam politische Verlängerung der abstrakten Rechtsperson, des von aller Besonderheit gereinigten Mitglied der Sphäre der Zirkulation, das den radikal-demokratischen Vorstellungen zugrunde liegt. Es ist eine sich selbst widersprechende Forderung, insofern sie eine andere Welt des Menschen will, einen anderen Staat, aber zugleich den bürgerlichen Menschen verabsolutiert, diese Demokratie also nur das Sollen selbst ist, da in die Formulierung der Aufhebung des zu Verändernden eben dieses zugleich als ein Nicht-zu-Veränderndes eingeht. Ob die bürgerliche Gesellschaft an der gesetzgebenden Gewalt teilnehmen soll, indem sie entweder durch Abgeordnete in das politische Leben eintritt oder »Alle einzeln« daran teilnehmen, ist nur ein anderer Ausdruck der Frage: tun es die Einzelnen Alle oder tun es die Einzelnen als Wenige, als Nicht Alle - und dies ist letztlich ein unwesentlicher Unterschied der Zahl. Denn das Wesen des Subjekts, des abstrakten Einzelnen, der Einzelheit, wird nicht dadurch verändert, daß alle einzelnen sich staatsbürgerlich betätigen. In dem erst herzustellenden Staat hingegen, in welchem das demokratische Element dann auch erst wirklich vernünftige Form angenommen haben wird, könnte es, wie Marx sagt, gerade anders aussehen: »Es sollen nicht Alle einzeln an der Beratung und Be- schließung über die allgemeinen Angelegenheiten des Staates Anteil haben, denn die »Einzelnen« haben als »Alle«, d. h. innerhalb der Sozietät und als Glieder der Sozietät, Anteil an der Beratung und Beschließung über die allgemeinen Angelegenheiten. Nicht alle ein-zeln, sondern die Einzelnen als Alle 36.« Diese abstrakte Konfrontation des aller Besonderheit entledigten, auf die nackte Form der Einzelheit reduzierten - genauer: des unter dieser selbstzerrissenen Form erscheinenden - Subjekts mit dem alle seine Momente als seine wissenden und beherrschenden Wesen im Zustand der als Vernunft existierenden Vernunft wird noch etwas präzisiert: nämlich bei der Darstellung des Übergangs von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft zum neuen demokratischen Gemeinwesen - und unter diesem Aspekt ist allerdings der Unterschied in der Zahl der »am Staate Anteilhabenden« von erheblicher Bedeutung. Denn der politische Staat ist in seiner Totalität die gesetzgebende Gewalt, die im Zustand (und als Ausdruck) der Trennung von politischem Staat und bürgerlicher Gesellschaft nur repräsentative Gewalt sein kann. Die bürgerliche Gesellschaft kann nur durch Abgeordnete am politischen Staat Anteil nehmen. Infolgedessen ist die Forderung, daß »Alle einzeln« an der gesetzgebenden Gewalt Anteil haben, nicht innerhalb dieser Voraussetzungen zu realisieren. Vielmehr ist sie Ausdruck des Willens aller Mitglieder der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, sich in wirkliche Staatsbürger zu verwandeln, also sich von ihrer Wirklichkeit in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft zu emanzipieren und das politische Dasein zu ihrem wirklichen Dasein zu machen. Damit aber verändert sich zugleich der Gesamtzustand - werden alle zu Gesetzgebern, so muß die Trennung des Staates von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft verschwinden; der Staat, der nur getrennt von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft als politischer existiert, verliert seine spezifische Qualität des Politischen, die bürgerliche Gesellschaft die Form des Bürgerlichen. »In diesem Zustand verschwindet die Bedeutung der gesetzgebenden Gewalt als einer repräsentativen Gewalt gänzlich. Die gesetzgebende Gewalt ist hier Repräsentation in dem Sinne, wie jede Funktion repräsentativ ist, wie z. B. der Schuster, insofern er ein soziales Bedürfnis verrichtet, mein Repräsentant ist, wie jede bestimmte soziale Tätigkeit als Gattungstätigkeit nur die Gattung, d. h. eine Bestimmung meines eignen Wesens repräsentiert, wie jeder Mensch der Repräsentant des andern ist. Er ist hier Repräsentant nicht durch ein anderes, was er vorstellt, sondern durch das, was er ist und tut37.« Die ständische oder parlamentarische Tätigkeit ist als »Fürsichsein« der allgemeinen Angelegenheit, die in der Regierung und Bürokratie bereits »an sich« existiert, in dieser Gestalt zugleich wieder die sich selbst nicht durchsichtige Befassung mit den wirklich allgemeinen Angelegenheiten, wiederum deren »Ansichsein«, das in der Demokratie die Form des »Für- sichseins« gewinnt. Die demokratische Forderung nach umfassender Beteiligung aller Mitglieder der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft an dieser entfremdeten Form der Beschäftigung mit den allgemeinen Angelegenheiten ist daher zugleich die »In-Frage-Stellung des repräsentativen Prinzips innerhalb des repräsentativen Prinzips, innerhalb der Grundvorstellung des politischen Staates« 38. Es ist die sich selbst noch nicht durchsichtige Forderung nach Aufhebung der Trennung von Staat und Gesellschaft, die sich selbst noch undurchsichtige Artikulation einer neuen Einheit des Allgemeinen und Besonderen. In dieser Weise interpretiert Marx den Kampf ums allgemeine Wahlrecht: »Die Wahl ist das wirkliche Verhältnis der wirklichen bürgerlichen Gesellschaft zur bürgerlichen Gesellschaft der gesetzgebenden Gewalt, zu dem repräsentativen Element. Oder die Wahl ist das unmittelbare, das direkte, das nicht bloß vorstellende, sondern seiende Verhältnis der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft zum politischen Staat. Es versteht sich daher von selbst, daß die Wahl das hauptsächliche politische Interesse der wirklichen bürgerlichen Gesellschaft bildet. In der unbeschränkten sowohl aktiven als passiven Wahl hat die bürgerliche Gesellschaft sich erst wirklich zu der Abstraktion von sich selbst, zu dem politischen Dasein als ihrem wahren allgemeinen wesentlichen Dasein erhoben. Aber die Vollendung dieser Abstraktion ist zugleich die Aufhebung der Abstraktion. Indem die bürgerliche Gesellschaft ihr politisches Dasein wirklich als ihr wahres gesetzt hat, hat sie zugleich ihr bürgerliches Dasein, in seinem Unterschied von ihrem politischen, als unwesentlich gesetzt; und mit dem einen Getrennten fällt sein Andres, sein Gegenteil. Die Wahlreform ist also innerhalb des abstrakten politischen Staats die Forderung seiner Auflösung, aber ebenso der Auflösung der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft 39.«”翻译为中文","output":"在这一背景下，我们看到了马克思对§308的批评。黑格尔拒绝了这样一种要求，即“所有人都应单独参与对国家的普遍事务的讨论和决策，因为这些都是国家的成员，而国家的事务是所有人的事务”，他将这种要求视为一种希望将“没有任何理性形式的民主元素引入国家机体，而只有通过这种形式，它才是国家”的观念。相对此，马克思实质上反驳说，在当前条件下，这种民主元素确实只能以不完善的形式被纳入国家机体，因为该机体已经在没有这种民的元素的情况下存在。然而，目标必须是，这种民主元素获得适当的现实性，“在整个国家机体中呈现其理性形式”。因此，马克思也只能将“所有人单独”参与立法权力或通过代表来参与的问题视为一个问题，如果以这种二选一的方式讨论，那就是在抽象的政治国家内的讨论：“这是一个抽象的政治问题”。因为在给定的条件下，人无法以此种抽象性获得公民的存在：民主的观念本身仍然是有限的，仍然是市民的，因为将市民世界作为人的唯一客观现实性纳入这一要求。这在这里不再进一步阐述，但意指的是 —— 也在黑格尔的拒绝中 —— 对抽象法人的政治性延伸，这种法人被清除了所有特殊性，是流通领域的成员，这正是激进民主观念的基础。这是一种自相矛盾的要求，因为它希望人类拥有另一个世界，一个不同的国家，但同时把市民人绝对化，因此这种民主只是应该，因为将要改变的东西的表述中同时将其作为一个不可改变的东西纳入。市民社会是否应通过代表进入政治生活或“所有人单独”参与，只是这个问题的另一种表达：是所有个人都做还是作为少数人、非所有人做——这最终是数量上的非本质差异。因为通过所有人单独行动成为公民的本质，抽象的个体性、单一性，并不因为所有个人参与公民活动而改变。 然而，在尚待建立的国家中，其中民主元素才真正获得理性形式，正如马克思所说，情况可能恰恰相反：“所有人不应单独参与对国家普遍事务的讨论和决策，因为‘个体’作为‘所有人’，即作为社会的成员和社会的组成部分，参与讨论和决策国家的普遍事务。不是所有人单独，而是个体作为所有人。”这种将所有特殊性剥离、简化为单一形式的抽象个体——更精确地说：以这种自我分裂形式出现的主体与其将所有要素作为其知晓并控制的存在的理性之理性状态，这种对立还将被进一步精确化：即在从市民社会到新的民主共同体的转变中——在这一点上，\\"参与国家\\"的人数差异实际上非常重要。因为政治国家在其全体中就是立法权，处于政治国家与市民社会分离的状态（并作为这种分离的表达）时，它只能是代表性权力。市民社会只能通过代表参与政治国家。因此，“所有人单独”参与立法权的要求无法在这些条件下实现。相反，它代表了市民社会所有成员的意愿，将自己转变为真正的公民，即从市民社会中的现实性中解放出来，并使政治存在成为他们真正的存在。因此，总体状态同时改变 —— 如果所有人都成为立法者，那么国家与市民社会的分离必须消失；只有从市民社会分离出来才作为政治存在的国家，失去了其政治的特定质量，市民社会失去了市民的形式。“在这种状态下，立法权作为代表性权力的意义完全消失。立法权在这里是代表性的，正如任何功能都是代表性的，例如，鞋匠因为他完成了一项社会需要而是我的代表，如同任何特定的社会活动作为种类活动只代表种类，即代表我的本质的一个决定，如同每个人都是他人的代表。他在这里不是通过某个他所代表的东西而是通过他所是和所做的成为代表。”作为普遍事务的“为自己存在”的政府或议会活动，已经以“自在存在”的形式存在于政府和官僚体系中，这种形式同时又是对实际普遍事务的不透明处理，再次成为其“自在存在”，在民主制中获得“为自己存在”的形式。因此，要求所有市民社会成员广泛参与这种对普遍事务的异化形式的处理，也是对政治国家基本观念内的代表性原则的“质疑”，是对国家和社会分离的不透明要求的提出，是一种新的普遍与特殊统一的不透明表达。马克思以这种方式解释了争取普选权的斗争：“选举是真实市民社会与立法权力的市民社会、代表性元素之间的真实关系。或者说，选举是市民社会与政治国家之间直接的、直观的、不仅是代表性的而是存在性的关系。因此，自然而然，选举构成了真实市民社会的主要政治兴趣。在无限制的既有主动权又有被动权的选举中，市民社会才真正将自身提升为对自身的抽象，将政治存在作为其真正的普遍本质存在。但这种抽象的完成同时也是抽象的消除。当市民社会确实将其政治存在视为其真正的本质时，它同时将其市民存在，作为与政治存在不同的存在，视为非本质的；随着其中一个分离的方面的消失，其对立面也一同消失。因此，在抽象的政治国家内，选举改革是解散它的要求，但同样也是解散市民社会的要求。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Bei näherer Betrachtung dieser frühen Hegelkritik zeigt sich also, daß die Marxsche Staatstheorie (wenn man hier schon von einer solchen sprechen will) mehrere Aspekte aufweist, die sich als inein-andergreifende Momente einer in sich geschlossenen Konstruktion deuten lassen, deren Geschlossenheit allerdings erkauft ist um den Preis des Idealismus. Wir wollen nun nicht die weitere Entwicklung in allen Details verfolgen, sondern lediglich auf einige Stellen in den folgenden Schriften erläuternd hinweisen. Völlig ungebrochen reproduziert Marx diese idealistische Geschichtsauffassung in dem berühmten Brief an Arnold Rüge, wo er das der ganzen Geschichte zugrunde liegende abstrakt-menschliche Wesen als Vernunft identi-fiziert, die immer schon existiert habe, »nur nicht immer in der vernünftigen Form«. Unter dieser Voraussetzung kann dann die Kritik auch an jede Gestalt der unwahren Wirklichkeit anknüpfen, da sie sich in der Kritik als sich selbst undurchsichtige Existenzweise des wahrhaft menschlichen Zustandes erweisen muß. Da sich die Geschichte als Abfolge verschiedener Verstellungen des Bewußtseines »erweist«, ist auch die Form der Praxis vorgeprägt: »Unser Wahlspruch muß also sein: Reform des Bewußtseins nicht durch Dogmen, sondern durch Analysierung des mystischen, sich selbst unklaren Bewußtseins, trete es nun religiös oder politisch auf. Es wird sich dann zeigen, daß die Welt längst den Traum von einer Sache besitzt, von der sie nur das Bewußtsein besitzen muß, um sie wirklich zu besitzen 40.« Und auch in der Abhandlung Zur Judenfrage bleibt Marx noch völlig im Bannkreis der Hegelkritik. Die Feudalität wird ebenso gedeutet wie in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts - als alte bürgerliche Gesellschaft, die durch eine unmittelbare Einheit des politischen und bürgerlichen Lebens charakterisiert ist. Erst die politische Revolution hob den politischen Charakter dieser feudalen Gesellschaft auf, indem sie den politischen Staat schuf. »Sie zerschlug die bürgerliche Gesellschaft in ihre einfachen Bestandteile ... Sie entfesselte den politischen Geist, der gleichsam in die verschiedenen Sackgassen der feudalen Gesellschaft zerteilt, zerlegt, zerlaufen war; sie sammelte ihn aus dieser Zerstreuung, sie befreite ihn von der Vermischung mit dem bürgerlichen Leben und konstituierte ihn als die Sphäre des Gemeinwesens, der allgemeinen Volksangelegenheit in idealer Unabhängigkeit von jenen besonderen Elementen des bürgerlichen Lebens . . . 41.« Marx wiederholt hier lediglich Theoreme, die wir schon kennen, allerdings ohne den Hinweis, daß diese alte bürgerliche Gesellschaft in dieser spezifischen Gestalt der unmittelbaren Einheit der beiden Momente nur durch die entfaltete Form hindurch sich dem Blick erschließt. Die Darstellung des Auseinandertretens hebt hier fast ausschließlich den emanzipatorischen Aspekt hervor: die Konstitution des politischen Staates als Emanzipation des Menschen unter der - noch - bornierten Form des Politischen. »Die feudale Gesellschaft war aufgelöst in ihren Grund, in den Menschen. Aber in den Menschen, wie er wirklich ihr Grund war, in den egoistischen Menschen42.« Da jetzt erst der bürgerliche Mensch freigesetzt ist, kann sich die menschliche Emanzipation nur in dieser spezifisch politischen Form vollziehen - Marx deutet den »Idealismus des Staates« hier völlig im Sinne des sich selbst noch nicht durchsichtigen demokratischen Gemeinwesens. »Der wirkliche Mensch ist erst in der Gestalt des egoistischen Individuums, der wahre Mensch erst in der Gestalt des abstrakten citoyen anerkannt 4S.« Die wirkliche Emanzipation des Menschen kann nur in der Weise erfolgen, daß er sich von seiner bürgerlichen Wirklichkeit selbst befreit und damit zugleich auch die politische Form des Gemeinwesens auf die wahre Gestalt zurückführt. »Erst wenn der wirkliche Mensch den abstrakten Staatsbürger in sich zurücknimmt, in seiner individuellen Arbeit, in seinen individuellen Verhältnissen Gattungswesen geworden ist, erst wenn der Mensch seine forces propres als gesellschaftliche Kräfte erkannt und organisiert hat und daher die gesellschaftliche Kraft nicht mehr in der Gestalt der politischen Kraft von sich trennt, erst dann ist die menschliche Emanzipation vollbracht44.« Marx geht hier, wie erwähnt, nicht über die in der Hegelkritik entwickelten Gedanken hinaus, außer mit dem Hinweis, daß die wirkliche Emanzipation den Arbeitsprozeß einzuschließen hat. Für die nächstfolgenden Schriften ist das eigentümliche Changieren verschiedener Ansätze charakteristisch. Einerseits wird der menschliche Arbeitsprozeß für die Selbstkonstitution der Menschheit immer mehr in den Vordergrund gerückt und damit implizit der Feuerbachsche »Kultus des abstrakten Menschen« verlassen; andrerseits wird die Staatstheorie noch in idealistischen Formulierungen dieses »Kultus« vorgetragen, zugleich aber eine wesentliche Modifikation eingeführt: wird jetzt vom Wesen des Staates gesprochen, so ist nicht mehr die Demokratie als die wahre Einheit des Allgemeinen und Besonderen gemeint, sondern der moderne demokratische Repräsentativstaat, durch dessen Form hindurch - wie vorher bei der Demokratie - die anderen Gestalten erst in ihrer spezifischen Qualität erkennbar werden. So heißt es in der Heiligen Familie: »Weit entfernt, das Wesen der politischen Emanzipation kritisiert und sein bestimmtes Verhältnis zum menschlichen Wesen ergründet zu haben, wäre sie (die junghegelianische Kritik, H. R.) erst bei dem Faktum der politischen Emanzipation, bei dem entwickelten modernen Staat angelangt, also erst da, wo die Existenz des modernen Staates seinem Wesen entspricht, wo daher auch die nicht nur relativen, sondern absoluten, die sein Wesen selbst konstituierenden Gebrechen angeschaut und charakterisiert werden können 45.« Dieses unvermittelte Nebeneinander verschiedener Ansätze, die sich nicht mehr in ein einheitliches Konstrukt zwanglos integrieren lassen, ist auch noch in der Deutschen Ideologie vorhanden. Der Prozeß der Auseinandersetzung zwischen Mensch und Natur ist jetzt in seinen einzelnen Momenten soweit begrifflich fixiert, daß dieser Aspekt zur Grundlage einer materialistischen Geschichtsschreibung werden kann. Schon in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts wird die bürgerliche Existenzweise als - aufzuhebendes - Prinzip des Individualismus apostrophiert, dem alle Tätigkeit, alle Arbeit, aller Inhalt lediglich als Mittel seiner eigenen Durchsetzung erscheint - eine Existenzweise also, in der die menschliche Arbeit der gesellschaftlichen Daseinsform äußerlich ist. Doch daraus den Schluß zu ziehen, daß eben aus diesem Grunde auch bei der theoretischen Verarbeitung der geschichtlichen Entwicklung der Menschheit vom Arbeitsprozeß abstrahiert werden könne, hieße diese Äußerlichkeit lediglich zu verdoppeln und sich letzten Endes den Zugang zur wirklichen Geschichtsschreibung versperren. Die Ausblendung des Arbeitsprozesses führt notwendig zum Idealismus: »Die ganze bisherige Geschichtsauffassung hat diese wirkliche Basis der Geschichte entweder ganz und gar unberücksichtigt gelassen oder sie nur als Nebensache betrachtet, die mit dem geschichtlichen Verlauf außer allem Zusammenhang steht. Die Geschichte muß daher immer nach einem außer ihr liegenden Maßstab geschrieben werden; die wirkliche Lebensproduktion erscheint als urgeschichtlich, während das Geschichtliche als das vom gemeinen Leben Getrennte, Extra-Überweltliche erscheint. Das Verhältnis des Menschen zur Natur ist hiermit von der Geschichte ausgeschlossen, wodurch der Gegensatz von Natur und Geschichte erzeugt wird. Sie hat daher in der Geschichte nur politische Haupt- und Staatsaktionen und religiöse und überhaupt theoretische Kämpfe sehen können und speziell bei jeder geschieht- liehen Epoche die Illusion dieser Epoche teilen müssen . . .46.« Dieser Zirkel, in dem Gesellschaftliches selbst noch als Bornierung des Bewußtseins in die Theorie eingeht, wird nur überwunden, wenn diese der bügerlichen Daseinsweise wesentliche Äußerlichkeit des Arbeitsprozesses auch als eine dieser Existenzform wesentliche Äußerlichkeit dechiffriert wird und vom Theoretiker in dieser spezifischen Formbestimmtheit bewußt in die Konzeption des geschichtlichen Verlaufs aufgenommen wird. Das tut Marx in der Deutschen Ideologie, so daß sich abstrakt zwei Momente unter-scheiden lassen: einmal die menschliche Geschichte als eine perma-nent wechselnde Subjekt-Objekt-Konstellation innerhalb des Na-turganzen, in der beide Pole im Arbeitsprozeß miteinander vermittelt werden und sich jeweils in anderer Gestalt darbieten. Indem die Menschen die Natur bearbeiten, verändern sie sich selbst mit der sie umgebenden Natur. Es ist dies die abstrakteste Formulierung für den komplexen Begriff der menschlichen und natürlichen Produktivkräfte als dem eigentlich treibenden Prinzip der geschicht-lichen Entwicklung. Das zweite Moment ist die besondere, dieser Subjekt-Objekt-Konstellation korrespondierende gesellschaftliche Existenzweise der Menschen, die Marx mit jenen Kategorien zu fassen sucht, die sich ihm aus den zuvor geführten Auseinanderset-zungen ergaben. ”翻译为中文","output":"仔细考察这早期对黑格尔的批判显示，马克思的国家理论（如果此时就可以这么说的话）展现了好几个方面，可以被理解为相互关联的构成要素，组成了一个内在完整的结构，尽管这种完整性是以理想主义为代价的。我们现在不追踪它的进一步发展的所有细节，而只是简要地指出后续著作中的一些地方。马克思在致阿诺德·鲁格的著名信件中原封不动地复制了这种理想主义的历史观，他将贯穿整个历史的抽象人类本质识别为理性，理性“总是存在的，只是不总是以理性的形式存在”。在这个假设下，批判可以针对不真实现实的任何形态，因为它在批判过程中必须表明自己是不透明的存在方式，是真正的人类状态。“历史展示为不同错觉的意识形态序列”，因此，实践的形式也是预设的：“我们的口号因此必须是：通过对神秘的、自身不清楚的意识的分析而非凭借教条来改革意识，无论它是以宗教形式还是政治形式出现。这将显示，世界早已拥有一个梦想，只需拥有意识就能真正拥有它。” 在《论犹太问题》的论文中，马克思仍完全在黑格尔批判的范围内。封建制度被解释为与《黑格尔的国家法批判》中一样 —— 作为旧市民社会，由政治与市民生活的直接统一所特征。正是政治革命消除了这个封建社会的政治特征，通过创立政治国家。“它将市民社会打碎成其基本成分......它释放了政治精神，这种精神在封建社会的不同死胡同中被分割、解散；它从这种分散中收集它，从与市民生活的融合中解放它，并将其构建为共同体领域的世界、普遍的国民事务的理想独立性......”马克思这里仅重复我们已经知道的理论，但没有指出，这种旧市民社会特有的两个方面的直接统一形态，只能通过发展的形式才能看清。分化的呈现几乎完全突出了解放的方面：作为人类解放的政治国家的构建 - 在政治形式的还有限制的形式下。“封建社会被解散成其基础，即人类。但在人类中，如他真正是其基础，即自私的人。”现在只有释放了市民人，人类解放只能在这种特定的政治形式中实现 - 马克思完全从民主共同体自我不透明的角度解读了“国家的理想主义”。“只有在自私个体的形式中才承认了真正的人，只有在抽象的公民形式中才承认了真正的人。”人类的真正解放只能通过自我从市民现实中解放出来，从而将政治共同体的形式回归到真正的形态。“只有当真实的人将抽象的国家公民吸收回自身，在其个体工作、个体关系中成为种族本质时，只有当人将自己的特有力量作为社会力量认识并组织起来，并因此不再将社会力量以政治力量的形式与自己分离时，人类解放才得以完成。”马克思在这里，如前所述，并没有超越在黑格尔批评中发展的思想，除了指出真正的解放必须包括工作过程。对于接下来的著作，特点是不同方法的独特变化。一方面，人类工作过程越来越多地成为人类自我构成的焦点，从而隐含地离开了费尔巴哈的“抽象人崇拜”；另一方面，国家理论仍以这种“崇拜”的理想主义表述提出，但同时引入了一个重要的修改：现在谈到国家的本质时，不再指民主作为普遍与特殊的真正统一，而是指现代民主代表国家，通过其形式 - 如先前在民主制中 - 其他形态的特有质量才能被识别。因此，《圣家》中说：“远非批评了政治解放的本质，并探究了它与人的本质的特定关系，它（青年黑格尔批判，译者注）才达到政治解放的事实，到了现代国家的发达程度，也就是现代国家的存在与其本质相匹配的地方，因此也可以观察和描述不仅是相对的，而且是绝对的、构成其本质本身的缺陷。”"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He yawned, stretching his arms so wide you’d think they were auditioning for a role in Stretch Armstrong’s biopic. “I’ve dreamt of feasts so lavish, not even a food channel marathon could compare!” Mr. Greedy exclaimed to literally no one, showcasing the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for discovering a forgotten chocolate bar in your pocket. Descending the stairs with the grace of a tumbleweed in a gentle breeze, Mr. Greedy made himself the most enormous breakfast. We’re talking pancakes stacked taller than the Eiffel Tower and eggs more scrambled than the plot of this story. “Balance? Never heard of her,” Mr. Greedy muttered, eyeing his tower of carbs with the kind of fervor typically seen in treasure hunters or people spotting a celebrity at a grocery store. Post-breakfast, Mr. Greedy, now moving at the speed of a sedated sloth, decided a walk was in order. Not for health reasons, mind you, but because the plot demands a semblance of movement. Upon stumbling into a cave that clearly flunked the course on cave dimensions, Mr. Greedy discovered everything was larger than life—including the food. “Ah, because ordinary gluttony just isn’t enough,” he quipped, questioning both his life choices and the author's creativity. It was then a giant appeared, holding a pie so big, it could’ve served as a decent-sized UFO. “You must eat all this, for reasons that will only make sense to someone who’s been binge-watching fantasy movies while high on sugar,” the giant declared with the seriousness of a late-night infomercial host. Mr. Greedy, displaying the decision-making prowess of a lemming on the edge of a cliff, agreed. Cut to several hours later, and our not-so-little friend felt like he might burst at any moment, a feeling readers might empathize with after digesting this plot. The giant, now somehow the moral compass of this tale, proclaimed, “You shall go free if you promise never to be greedy again. Because, as we know, drastic life changes happen instantaneously in these stories.” Mr. Greedy, now sweating more than a politician during a scandal, nodded so vigorously you’d think his head was a bobblehead. “I promise,” he gasped, the sincerity of his words as thin as the plot of this parody. In a twist that shocked absolutely no one, Mr. Greedy kept his promise. He was now a thinner oval, a transformation that dieticians and physics professors around the world would dispute until the cows come home—and considering the size of everything in that cave, those cows would probably be the size of skyscrapers. And so, our tale comes to an end, leaving readers with many questions, none of which are about Mr. Greedy's dietary habits, but rather, about the decisions that led them to read a story that takes place in a universe where logic is as absent as calorie counts in Mr. Greedy’s breakfast. “Remember, kids,” the narrator chimed in, with the kind of forced moralizing usually saved for after-school specials, “gluttony is bad...unless you’re in a giant cave with oversized food, in which case, it’s an adventure, apparently.” And they all lived absurdly ever after.

As if on autopilot, he swanked downstairs, his anticipation for breakfast palpable. “Behold, the feast that defies all known health recommendations!” he declared, facing down a breakfast that could feed a small village or one moderately peckish giant. Having not learned his lesson from the previous ordeal—which is on-brand for characters in these tales—he wandered outside for a stroll. With a stunning lack of surprise, he found himself at the entrance of a cave, its size consistency still not approved by any respectable physicist. “Back again, I see. Do caves have a loyalty program I’m unaware of?” he pondered, stepping inside to discover, yet again, an alarming amount of oversized food. “Ah, a buffet where the croutons are the size of boulders. Because normal food is for the weak,” he quipped, showcasing the kind of gallows humor only someone trapped in a loop of bizarre nutritional choices could. The giant, who frankly was starting to question his own role in these stories, loomed over him with an amused grin. “Didn’t expect to see you back so soon. Got a frequent diner card for you this time,” the giant joked, presenting an actual card that made one wonder about the economic system of giant-kind. “Let the feast begin! Although, at this point, it’s less of a feast and more of a twisted Groundhog Day,” Mr. It-Starts-With-Binge-Eating sighed, digging into a pie so large it had its own weather system. Hours, or perhaps weeks later—who could tell in this cave of wonders and dietary nightmares—our not-so-little protagonist verged on eruption. “I thought I was Mr. Greedy, not Mr. About-to-Explode,” he groaned, voicing a level of introspection that was meta at worst, and at best, mildly amusing. The giant, now doubling as a life coach with questionable qualifications, laid down the law. “Promise me you won’t be greedy again, or I’ll… I don’t know, write you into a story that makes even less sense.” Mr. It-Starts-With-Binge-Eating, faced with the prospect of an even more ludicrous narrative, nodded solemnly. “I promise, oh giant life coach of ambiguous morals. Mainly because I’m not sure I can survive another plot twist.” True to his word, by the tale's end, our character found himself slender, taking on the shape of a thin oval, a transformation that sparked debate among geometricians about the ethics of using shapes as metaphors for body types. “Looks like I’m keeping my promise. Really narrows down my character development, doesn’t it?” Mr. It-Starts-With-Binge-Eating quipped, acknowledging his own change with the reluctant acceptance of someone who knows they’re trapped in a series that takes delight in absurdity. “And thus concludes our tale,” the narrator chimed in, vaguely aware that they might be the only constant in this ever-shifting narrative. “Where we learned… well, I’m not entirely sure what we learned, but weren’t the giant foods impressive?” Indeed, they all muddled on, in a world where lessons are dubious, and caloric intake is an otherworldly adventure.

Trudging downstairs, Mr. Greedy prepared for a breakfast that was, by all accounts, thoroughly ‘meh’. “Where’s the pancake mountain? The river of syrup? This is breakfast for ants,” he lamented, staring down at what could only be described as a culinary disappointment. In a shocking twist that surprised precisely no one, Mr. Greedy found himself meandering towards a cave, the allure of potential oversized foods too tempting to resist. “Here we go again. You’d think I’d learn. Or buy a map,” he noted, stepping into the familiarly disproportionate cave. The cave, consistent only in its inconsistency, presented Mr. Greedy with a bowl so vast it could be mistaken for a small lake. “Great. Now how am I supposed to find the cereal box for this?” Mr. Greedy quipped, illustrating a remarkably lax attitude toward the surreal situation unfolding. Enter the giant, the moral compass in a story severely off its bearings, looming over Mr. Greedy with a sense of déjà vu thick enough to cut with a knife. “We really need to stop meeting like this. What would the neighbors say?” the Giant teased, offering a playful wink that did nothing to alleviate the absurdity of the situation. “Do I even get a say in this? Or should I just brace myself for the inevitable inexplicable growth spurt?” Mr. Greedy inquired, exhibiting the casual demeanor of a man who’s undergone this routine one too many times. The Giant, chuckling, ushered Mr. Greedy towards the colossus bowl. “You know the drill. You eat, you learn, you explode. Quite the character arc, isn’t it?” As Mr. Greedy was force-fed a banquet fit for ten giants, his size increased exponentially, a visual gag that would have physicists scratching their heads and nutritionists running for the hills. “At this rate, I’ll need my own zip code,” Mr. Greedy joked, moments before achieving an explosive size that redefined personal space. “Promise me you won’t be greedy again,” the Giant demanded, a script so repetitive it could be sold as a sleep aid. “Or we’ll run out of cave.” Mr. Greedy, now somehow reconstituted as Mr. Zedna, a name change that seemed as arbitrary as the plot itself, solemnly swore off his greedy ways. “I promise,” he said, the solemnity of his vow undermined only by the audience's skepticism and the echoing laughter of the Giant. In a conclusion that felt as inevitable as a sequel to a blockbuster film, Mr. Zedna maintained his promise, his figure now slimmed down to an elegant oval. “Look at me, the epitome of moderation,\\" Mr. Zedna remarked, viewing his new form with a mix of pride and existential confusion. “And thus we close another chapter in the endless anthology of Mr. Greedy’s dietary escapades,” the narrator concluded, their tone suggesting they were as bewildered by the proceedings as the audience. Despite every bizarre twist, redundant moral, and inexplicable name change, the characters strolled into the sunset, ready to face whatever inexplicable adventure awaited them next. For in the world of Mr. Greedy, Mr. It-Starts-With-Binge-Eating, Mr. Zedna, or whatever identity he might adopt next, the only constant was change — and an insatiable appetite for comedy.

Кроме того, очень важно регулярно проводить инструктажи и учения по эвакуации, чтобы убедиться, что все знают, что делать в случае пожара."},{"instruction":"код по окз монтажник","output":"Стандарты классификации занятий, включая ОКЗ (Общероссийский классификатор занятий), периодически обновляются и могут отличаться в зависимости от страны. По состоянию на момент моего последнего обновления в 2023 году, для поиска конкретного кода занятия монтажника в рамках ОКЗ (или аналогичных классификаторов в других странах, таких как ISCO по международной классификации) важно обращаться к актуальной версии этого классификатора. Монтажники могут работать в различных областях – от строительства и установки внутренних систем (например, вентиляции, отопления) до сборки оборудования на производстве. В зависимости от сферы деятельности и специфики работы, монтажники могут быть классифицированы под разные коды. Например, в России существует Общероссийский классификатор занятий ОК 010-2014 (ОКЗ), который предусматривает разделение трудовой деятельности по различным категориям и подкатегориям. Для более точного определения классификации занятия монтажника необходимо уточнять специализацию и область деятельности, так как код может отличаться. Например, монтажники систем вентиляции, лифтов, оборудования на производственных линиях и т.д., могут иметь различные коды в зависимости от их конкретной рабочей функции.

Digital rectal examination ,it shows size of the prostate (not compatible with severity of the symptoms)In BPH ,it reveals smooth ,firm , elastic enlargement of the prostate ( in carcinoma , the prostate is hard and nodular).","output":"**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)** is a common condition as men get older. It involves enlargement of the prostate gland, which can lead to urinary symptoms due to the gland pressing on the urethra. The specific signs and symptoms of BPH can vary, but generally they revolve around changes in urinary habits due to this increased pressure and obstruction. **Signs and Symptoms of BPH include:** 1. **Increased Urinary Frequency:** The need to urinate more often than usual, especially at night (nocturia). 2. **Urgency:** A sudden and compelling need to urinate. 3. **Difficulty Starting Urination:** Hesitancy or trouble initiating the urinary stream. 4. **Weak Urine Stream:** A stream that is weaker than normal or varies in strength. 5. **Dribbling at the End of Urinating:** Inability to completely empty the bladder, leading to dripping at the end of urination. 6. **Incomplete Emptying:** The sensation that the bladder is not entirely empty after urination. 7. **Straining While Urinating:** Having to exert extra effort to urinate. **Neurological Examination:** A neurological examination may be warranted in the diagnosis and management of BPH for several reasons: - **Why?** To rule out neurological conditions that can mimic or contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as those seen in BPH. Conditions like Parkinson's disease, stroke, or spinal cord injuries can affect bladder function. - **By What?** This involves evaluating the nervous system's performance to ensure that the symptoms are not caused by a neurological condition. Assessments include testing reflexes, sensation, strength, nerve function, and potentially bladder function. - **Where and When?** This can take place in a healthcare setting during the initial evaluation for urinary symptoms or any time during the management of BPH if symptoms suggest a possible neurological cause. **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE):** The DRE is a critical component of the physical examination when evaluating a patient with suspected BPH. As you've mentioned, it involves a healthcare provider gently inserting a finger into the rectum to palpate the prostate gland. - **Findings in BPH:** The prostate may feel enlarged but remains smooth, firm, and elastic. As noted, the size of the prostate as felt through DRE does not always correlate with the severity of the symptoms. This means a man can have a significantly enlarged prostate with mild symptoms or a modestly enlarged prostate with severe symptoms. - **Comparison with Prostate Cancer:** Unlike BPH, if the prostate feels hard, nodular, or has irregularities during the DRE, it may suggest the possibility of prostate cancer, prompting further investigation. Overall, these diagnostic tools and evaluations help differentiate BPH from other conditions with similar symptoms, guiding appropriate management and treatment strategies."},{"instruction":"how much rbc and wbc in vessel and how much are not and where they so ?","output":"Understanding the distribution and location of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and White Blood Cells (WBCs) requires a grasp of basic human physiology and hematologic norms. # In the Vascular System: - **RBCs**: A typical range for RBC count in the bloodstream per microliter (μL) of blood is about 4.7 to 6.1 million for men and 4.2 to 5.4 million for women. These cells predominantly reside within the vascular system (arteries, veins, and capillaries) to facilitate their primary role of transporting oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs for exhalation. - **WBCs**: The normal range for WBC count in the bloodstream is roughly 4,500 to 11,000 cells per microliter. Unlike RBCs, WBCs can move out of the bloodstream to patrol for signs of invaders or infections; this process is called diapedesis. They play essential roles in defending the body against both infectious disease and foreign materials. # Outside the Vascular System: - **RBCs** are generally confined to the vascular system under normal conditions. They don't typically leave the bloodstream to enter tissues, except in cases of injury or pathological conditions that lead to hemorrhage or bleeding. - **WBCs**, on the other hand, are found both in and out of the vascular system. They are an integral component of the body's immune system and can be found throughout the body, including in the lymphatic system (which includes lymph nodes, the spleen, and the thymus), bone marrow, mucous membranes, and skin. Upon detecting an infection or cellular distress, WBCs can exit the bloodstream through a process known as extravasation or diapedesis to reach affected tissues. This enables them to engage pathogens or damaged cells more directly. # Locations and Functions: - **Bone Marrow**: is a primary site where both RBCs and WBCs are produced before they are released into the bloodstream. For WBCs, the bone marrow is also a site of maturation for certain types. - **Lymphatic System**: WBCs, particularly lymphocytes, are distributed within the lymphatic system. They play a crucial role in identifying and eliminating pathogens. This distribution ensures that RBCs efficiently transport oxygen to where it's needed, while WBCs are strategically positioned to respond to infections or injuries throughout the body and within the bloodstream."},{"instruction":"Leukocytes and its name in each tissue where it found ?with the functions and notes","output":"Leukocytes, or white blood cells (WBCs), play a fundamental role in the immune system, protecting the body against both infectious diseases and foreign invaders. These cells circulate in the blood and lymphatic system but can also be found in many tissues across the body where they perform crucial immune functions. Leukocytes can be classified into two main groups: granulocytes (which include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and agranulocytes (which include lymphocytes and monocytes). Below, we detail where each type of leukocyte can be found, their functions, and some additional notes. # Neutrophils - **Found in:** Blood and can migrate to tissues where infection is present. - **Functions:** Primarily involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria and fungi. - **Notes:** Making up 50-70% of all white blood cells, they are the most abundant type of WBCs and are among the first responders to microbial infection. # Eosinophils - **Found in:** Primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, but also in blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. - **Functions:** Involved in the body’s defense against parasitic worms and other infections; also play a role in allergic reactions. - **Notes:** They make up about 1-4% of WBCs in the blood. Their numbers increase during allergic reactions and parasitic infections. # Basophils - **Found in:** Blood and can be recruited into tissues. - **Functions:** Release histamine contributing to inflammation, and play a role in allergic responses. - **Notes:** The least abundant of the WBCs (<1%), they share some function with the mast cells, a type of tissue cell. # Lymphocytes - **Found in:** Blood, lymphoid tissues (like lymph nodes, spleen), mucosal linings of the digestive and respiratory tracts, and throughout the body's tissues. - **Functions:** They are key players in the immune response, with B-lymphocytes producing antibodies, T-lymphocytes killing virus-infected cells and orchestrating the immune response, and natural killer (NK) cells killing virus-infected cells and tumor cells. - **Notes:** They account for approximately 20-40% of all white blood cells in the bloodstream. They are central to adaptive immunity, the process through which the immune system adapts its response to specific pathogens. # Monocytes - **Found in:** Blood; they differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells when they migrate into tissues. - **Functions:** Phagocytosis (engulfing and then digesting cellular debris and pathogens) and presenting parts of pathogens to T cells so that the pathogens may be recognized again and killed. - **Notes:** They constitute about 2-8% of WBCs in the blood. As macrophages, they are critical in wound healing and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system. # Locations and Notes on Distribution: While most leukocytes are produced in the bone marrow, they function in various parts of the body — circulating in the bloodstream, patrolling within lymphatic fluid, or residing in tissues awaiting signals of infection or damage. Their distribution is tightly regulated by the body, ensuring that immune responses can be efficiently mounted wherever they are needed. Importantly, the presence of certain leukocytes in specific tissues goes beyond their mere detection in blood, as their function and state can adapt based on the local environment, the presence of cytokines, and the specific challenges posed by pathogens."},{"instruction":"no i meant names of Leukocytes in blood and bone and liver and the others with the functions","output":"Ah, I see. You're interested in how specific leukocytes might be referred to or function differently across various tissues such as the blood, bone marrow, liver, and others. While the primary types of leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) are consistent across the body, their roles and presence can vary depending on the tissue context. Let's explore their presence and functions within these specific tissues: # Blood - **Leukocytes in Blood**: All five primary types circulate in the bloodstream. - **Function**: Serve as a mobile army to fight infections; each type has specific roles, from attacking bacteria to fighting parasites and participating in allergic responses. # Bone Marrow - **Leukocytes in Bone Marrow**: All types are found here since bone marrow is their production site. - **Function**: Bone marrow is the primary hematopoietic organ, where leukocyte development and maturation occur. It acts as a reservoir for certain types of leukocytes. # Liver - **Leukocytes in Liver** (specifically Kupffer cells which are specialized macrophages): - **Function**: These cells play a significant role in filtering blood, removing old or damaged red cells, bacteria, and other pathogens. The liver also hosts lymphocytes as part of its immune function, partaking in the surveillance against pathogens and tumor cells. # Specific Locations and Functional Highlights: - **Neutrophils, Eosinophils, and Basophils** maintain their roles in inflammatory response and pathogen defense across the tissues but might be specifically recruited from the blood to areas of infection or tissue damage. - **Monocytes** in the blood migrate into tissues and differentiate into **macrophages** or **dendritic cells**: - **In tissues**: Macrophages are critically involved in phagocytosis and initiating immune responses by presenting antigens to T cells. Their names can change based on the tissue (e.g., Kupffer cells in the liver, microglia in the brain). - **In bone marrow**: Serve as precursors waiting to be differentiated and mobilized. - **Lymphocytes**: - **In blood and lymphatic system**: Circulate to survey for specific antigens, mounting immune responses accordingly. - **In secondary lymphoid organs** (lymph nodes, spleen): Encounter antigens and become activated. - **Tissues (e.g., mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue, liver)**: Reside as tissue-specific cells ready to defend against localized pathogens. In the liver, T cells can attack infected cells directly, while B cells produce antibodies specific to pathogens encountered. It's important to note that while leukocytes have specific names and generalized functions, their role can be highly specialized based on the tissue context, local microenvironment, and specific threats encountered. This adaptive capability is critical for the immune system's ability to offer tailored defenses against a wide array of challenges throughout the body."},{"instruction":"macrophages and its name in each tissue where it found ?with the functions and notes","output":"Macrophages are versatile cells found throughout the body, indispensable to both innate and adaptive immunity. They derive from monocytes that leave the bloodstream and differentiate into macrophages within various tissues. These cells are highly specialized depending on their localization, adapting to the microenvironments of different tissues and performing unique functions accordingly. Below is a closer look at macrophages named for specific tissues, their functions, and some additional notes. # Central Nervous System: Microglia - **Functions:** Monitor and maintain the health of neural cells; phagocytose dead cells and pathogens; involved in neuroinflammation and repairing injuries. - **Notes:** Microglia are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, playing a key role in the maintenance of the central nervous system's integrity and homeostasis. # Liver: Kupffer Cells - **Functions:** Filter and destroy bacteria and red blood cells in the blood; involved in the production of inflammatory mediators. - **Notes:** Kupffer cells are critical in liver's detoxifying activity and defense against gut-derived pathogens. # Bone: Osteoclasts - **Functions:** Break down bone tissue during growth and healing; involved in bone resorption and remodeling. - **Notes:** Osteoclasts are unique in that they originate from monocyte/macrophage precursors but are primarily involved in bone rather than immune system maintenance. # Skin: Langerhans Cells - **Functions:** Present in the skin's epidermis; capture and present antigens to T cells, initiating the skin’s immune response. - **Notes:** Langerhans cells are especially important for recognizing skin pathogens and allergens, functioning as sentinels in the skin's immune defense. # Lung: Alveolar Macrophages - **Functions:** Clear the alveoli of infectious agents, particulate matter, and dead cells; involved in the immune response to respiratory pathogens. - **Notes:** These macrophages are crucial for maintaining the cleanliness and health of the air spaces, directly impacting respiratory health. # Peritoneal Cavity: Peritoneal Macrophages - **Functions:** Guard the peritoneal cavity against infection; involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria and dead cells. - **Notes:** These macrophages play a significant role in the defense mechanisms of the abdominal cavity. # Spleen and Lymph Nodes: Dendritic Cells - **Functions:** Though not macrophages in the traditional sense, dendritic cells originate from the same precursors and perform closely related functions; they capture antigens and present them to T cells. - **Notes:** These cells are pivotal in initiating and regulating the adaptive immune response. # General Functions of Macrophages: - **Phagocytosis:** Engulfment and degradation of pathogens, dead cells, and cellular debris. - **Antigen Presentation:** Acting as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), they process and present antigens to T cells, bridging innate and adaptive immunity. - **Production of Inflammatory Mediators:** Release cytokines and chemokines that recruit other immune cells to sites of infection or injury and regulate inflammation. - **Tissue Remodeling:** Involved in the repair and remodeling of tissues following injury. # Notes: Macrophages are highly plastic, meaning their phenotype and function can be altered by the local tissue environment, making them capable of a wide range of responses from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory depending on the context. This plasticity allows them to participate in a wide array of bodily functions including defense against pathogens, removal of dead cells, and support of tissue development and homeostasis."},{"instruction":"dime las definiciones basicas en una linea de propiedades periódicas: sobre todo, radio, energía de ionización y electronegatividad.

It serves several important functions, including: 1. **Accessing Global Variables**: When a local variable in a function shadows a global variable, you can use the \`::\` operator to access the global variable. For example, if there's a global variable named \`x\` and a local variable within a function also named \`x\`, you can use \`::x\` to refer to the global \`x\`. 2. **Defining Member Functions Outside the Class Definition**: In C++, you can define member functions of a class outside of the class definition by using the \`::\` operator. This tells the compiler that the function being defined is a member of the class. For example, if you have a class \`MyClass\` with a member function \`myFunction\`, you could define it outside of the class like this: \`\`\`cpp void MyClass::myFunction() { // function definition } \`\`\` 3. **Accessing Class Static Members**: The \`::\` operator is used to access static members of a class, since they are not tied to any specific instance of the class. You refer to the static member using the class name followed by \`::\` and then the member name. For example: \`\`\`cpp MyClass::staticMemberFunction(); \`\`\` 4. **Access to Namespaces**: It allows access to elements (like variables, functions, or other types) defined within a specific namespace. This prevents naming conflicts by clearly specifying which namespace's element you are referring to. For example, if there are two namespaces \`A\` and \`B\` both defining a function \`foo\`, you would call them as \`A::foo()\` and \`B::foo()\` respectively to avoid ambiguity. 5. **Access to Enumerators in Scoped Enumerations**: In modern C++, scoped enumerations (\`enum class\`) are used to define enumerations that don’t implicitly convert to \`int\`, and where the enumerator names are local to the \`enum\` and must be qualified with the \`enum\` type name. For example: \`\`\`cpp enum class Colors { red, green, blue }; Colors myColor = Colors::red; \`\`\` In summary, the scope resolution operator \`::\` is a powerful feature in C++ that helps manage the scope and namespace of variables, functions, and types, aiding in the organization of code and the prevention of naming conflicts."},{"instruction":"Hi do you know how to fix Codeium defaule setting that is responsible for this [ERROR]: [deadline_exceeded] context deadline exceeded","output":"To fix the \\"deadline exceeded\\" error in Codeium, you can try the following steps: 1.

The \`Sinh_np\` procedure is designed to generate all 0-1 strings of length \`n\` and uses a secondary procedure, \`Try\`, to recursively generate these strings and apply the \`kt\` filter to them. Please note: - The global variable \`m\` is used to count and index valid sequences in the \`luu\` array. Make sure that the scope and manipulation of global variables, especially within recursive procedures, are handled with care to avoid unintended behavior. - The example assumes a maximum of 1,000,000 valid sequences, as per the dimension of the \`luu\` array. Keep in mind that generating all sequences of a given length exponentially increases the number of sequences, and not all of them will be valid per the \`kt\` function, so adjust \`m\` and \`luu\` size based on your specific needs. - The main block demonstrates calling \`Sinh_np\` and printing the number of valid sequences.

Der Prozeß der Auseinandersetzung zwischen Mensch und Natur ist jetzt in seinen einzelnen Momenten soweit begrifflich fixiert, daß dieser Aspekt zur Grundlage einer materialistischen Geschichtsschreibung werden kann. Schon in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts wird die bürgerliche Existenzweise als - aufzuhebendes - Prinzip des Individualismus apostrophiert, dem alle Tätigkeit, alle Arbeit, aller Inhalt lediglich als Mittel seiner eigenen Durchsetzung erscheint - eine Existenzweise also, in der die menschliche Arbeit der gesellschaftlichen Daseinsform äußerlich ist. Doch daraus den Schluß zu ziehen, daß eben aus diesem Grunde auch bei der theoretischen Verarbeitung der geschichtlichen Entwicklung der Menschheit vom Arbeitsprozeß abstrahiert werden könne, hieße diese Äußerlichkeit lediglich zu verdoppeln und sich letzten Endes den Zugang zur wirklichen Geschichtsschreibung versperren. Die Ausblendung des Arbeitsprozesses führt notwendig zum Idealismus: »Die ganze bisherige Geschichtsauffassung hat diese wirkliche Basis der Geschichte entweder ganz und gar unberücksichtigt gelassen oder sie nur als Nebensache betrachtet, die mit dem geschichtlichen Verlauf außer allem Zusammenhang steht. Die Geschichte muß daher immer nach einem außer ihr liegenden Maßstab geschrieben werden; die wirkliche Lebensproduktion erscheint als urgeschichtlich, während das Geschichtliche als das vom gemeinen Leben Getrennte, Extra-Überweltliche erscheint. Das Verhältnis des Menschen zur Natur ist hiermit von der Geschichte ausgeschlossen, wodurch der Gegensatz von Natur und Geschichte erzeugt wird. Sie hat daher in der Geschichte nur politische Haupt- und Staatsaktionen und religiöse und überhaupt theoretische Kämpfe sehen können und speziell bei jeder geschieht- liehen Epoche die Illusion dieser Epoche teilen müssen . . .46.« Dieser Zirkel, in dem Gesellschaftliches selbst noch als Bornierung des Bewußtseins in die Theorie eingeht, wird nur überwunden, wenn diese der bügerlichen Daseinsweise wesentliche Äußerlichkeit des Arbeitsprozesses auch als eine dieser Existenzform wesentliche Äußerlichkeit dechiffriert wird und vom Theoretiker in dieser spezifischen Formbestimmtheit bewußt in die Konzeption des geschichtlichen Verlaufs aufgenommen wird. Das tut Marx in der Deutschen Ideologie, so daß sich abstrakt zwei Momente unter-scheiden lassen: einmal die menschliche Geschichte als eine perma-nent wechselnde Subjekt-Objekt-Konstellation innerhalb des Na-turganzen, in der beide Pole im Arbeitsprozeß miteinander vermittelt werden und sich jeweils in anderer Gestalt darbieten. Indem die Menschen die Natur bearbeiten, verändern sie sich selbst mit der sie umgebenden Natur. Es ist dies die abstrakteste Formulierung für den komplexen Begriff der menschlichen und natürlichen Produktivkräfte als dem eigentlich treibenden Prinzip der geschicht-lichen Entwicklung. Das zweite Moment ist die besondere, dieser Subjekt-Objekt-Konstellation korrespondierende gesellschaftliche Existenzweise der Menschen, die Marx mit jenen Kategorien zu fassen sucht, die sich ihm aus den zuvor geführten Auseinanderset-zungen ergaben. Es ist daher nicht verwunderlich, wenn er zuerst einmal den Begriff der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft in einer schon fast frühbürgerlichen, die gesamte zivilisierte Welt einbegreifenden Weise überdehnt: »Die durch die auf allen bisherigen geschichtlichen Stufen vorhandenen Produktionskräfte bedingte und sie wiederum bedingende Verkehrsform ist die bürgerliche Gesellschaft. ... Es zeigt sich hier, daß diese bürgerliche Gesellschaft der wahre Herd und Schauplatz aller Geschichte ist, und wie widersinnig die bisherige, die wirklichen Verhältnisse vernachlässigende Geschichtsauffassung . . . ist47.« Zugleich ist sich Marx der Problematik dieser Überdehnung bewußt und weist darauf hin, daß es ihm vorwiegend um ein strukturelles Prinzip geht, das er mangels anderer Terminologie nur mit diesem Namen bezeichnet hat: »Die bürgerliche Gesellschaft als solche entwickelt sich erst mit der Bourgeoisie; die unmittelbar aus der Produktion und dem Verkehr sich entwik- kelnde gesellschaftliche Organisation, die zu allen Zeiten die Basis des Staats und der sonstigen idealistischen Superstrukturen bildet, ist indes fortwährend mit demselben Namen bezeichnet worden 48.« So changiert die Begriffsbildung und es ist nicht immer zweifelsfrei auszumachen, ob Marx den Begriff gleichsam als ein methodisches Organisationsprinzip gebraucht oder aber in der Weise, wie das etwa in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts oder der Abhandlung Zur Judenfrage, wo die mittelalterliche Gesellschaft als alte bürgerliche Gesellschaft bezeichnet wird. Jedenfalls formuliert Marx die schon in der Hegel-Kritik angedeuteten Gedanken hier ausdrücklich mit Hilfe dieses Begriffs als materialistische Geschichtsauffassung: »Diese Geschichtsauffassung beruht also darauf, den wirklichen Produktionsprozeß, und zwar von der materiellen Produktion des unmittelbaren Lebens ausgehend, zu entwickeln und die mit dieser Produktionsweise zusammenhängende und von ihr erzeugte Verkehrsform, also die bürgerliche Gesellschaft in ihren verschiedenen Stufen, als Grundlage der ganzen Geschichte aufzufassen und sie sowohl in ihrer Aktion als Staat darzustellen, wie die sämtlichen verschiedenen theoretischen Erzeugnisse und Formen des Bewußtseins, Religion, Philosophie, Moral etc. etc., aus ihr zu erklären und ihren Entstehungsprozeß aus ihnen zu verfolgen . ..40.« Wir wollen an dieser Stelle die Marxschen Vorstellungen nicht im einzelnen nachvollziehen, sondern auf ein zentrales methodisches Prinzip hinweisen, das in der Deutschen Ideologie zum ersten Male erörtert wird: die Unterscheidung zwischen Abstraktion und Darstellung. Daß Marx gerade in der Deutschen Ideologie diese Unterscheidung einführt, ist jedoch keineswegs zufällig. Wird der Prozeß der Auseinandersetzung der Menschen mit der Natur in seinen einzelnen Momente fixiert und zur Grundlage der materialistischen Deutung des geschichtlichen Verlaufs, so drängt sich diese Differenzierung von selbst auf. Soll nämlich der Entwicklungsprozeß der Menschen in seinem wirklichen Ablauf geschildert werden, so müssen die verschiedenen Momente, die sich als eine Vielfalt von Produktivkräften begreifen lassen, in ihrer jeweiligen Bestimmtheit empirisch erforscht werden - oder aber man bleibt bewußt bei einer »Abstraktion« dieses Geschichtsprozesses stehen. Das tut Marx in der Deutschen Ideologie: »Da, wo die Spekulation aufhört, beim wirklichen Leben, beginnt also die wirkliche, positive Wissenschaft, die Darstellung der praktischen Betätigung, des praktischen Entwicklungsprozesses der Menschen. . . . Die selbständige Philosophie verliert mit der Darstellung der Wirklichkeit ihr Existenzmedium. An ihre Stelle kann höchstens eine Zusammenfassung der allgemeinsten Resultate treten, die sich aus der Betrachtung der historischen Entwicklung der Menschen abstrahieren lassen. Diese Abstraktionen haben für sich, getrennt von der wirklichen Geschichte, durchaus keinen Wert. Sie können nur dazu dienen, die Ordnung des geschichtlichen Materials zu erleichtern, die Reihenfolge seiner einzelnen Schichten anzudeuten. Sie geben aber keineswegs, wie die Philosophie, ein Rezept oder Schema, wonach die geschichtlichen Epochen zurechtgestutzt werden können. Die Schwierigkeit beginnt im Gegenteil erst da, wo man sich an die Betrachtung und Ordnung des Materials, sei es einer vergangenen Epoche oder der Gegenwart, an die wirkliche Darstellung gibt. . . . Wir nehmen hier einige dieser Abstraktionen heraus, die wir gegenüber der Ideologie gebrauchen, und werden sie an historischen Beispielen erläutern M.« Was wir in der Deutschen Ideologie vorfinden, sind also lediglich Kurzfassungen der materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung, recht eigentlich Anweisungen zum wirklichen Studium der Geschichte, deren Darstellung. Man sollte das nicht aus dem Auge verlieren, um die vielen Hinweise und Bemerkungen, die zum Teil Wiederholungen der sich nun als Abstraktionen erweisenden Gedankengänge aus den früheren Schriften sind, nicht überzubewerten und als ganze Wahrheit zu nehmen. Oft sind sie in polemischer Absicht hingeworfen, und der Materialismus geht darin nur soweit, wie er »benötigt« wird, um die idealistische Geschichtsauffassung der Junghegelianer zurückweisen zu können. Gleichwohl wollen wir den Versuch unternehmen, die Deutsche Ideologie unter dem Aspekt zu untersuchen, ob sich Hinweise finden, in welcher Form die in der Deutschen Ideologie noch nicht durchgeführte Darstellung zu erfolgen hat und welche Elemente der Staatstheorie, wie wir sie bisher kennengelernt haben, wiederholt werden, umformuliert werden, welche neu hinzukommen, und welche verschwinden.”翻译为中文","output":"这种不同方法论的突然并置，不再能够轻松地整合进一个统一的结构中，这一点在《德意志意识形态》中仍然存在。现在，人与自然之间的对抗过程在其各个方面已经被概念化，以至于这一方面可以成为唯物主义历史写作的基础。在《黑格尔法哲学批判》中，资产阶级的存在方式被标榜为个人主义的原则——所有的活动、所有的工作、所有的内容仅仅作为其自身实现的手段——一种存在方式，其中人的劳动对于社会生活形式是外在的。然而，从中得出的结论是，正因为如此，在历史发展的理论处理中也可以抽象出劳动过程，这将仅仅是将这种外在性加倍，并最终阻止了通往真实历史写作的路径。对劳动过程的忽视必然导致理想主义：“迄今为止的所有历史观念要么完全忽视了这个历史的真实基础，要么只将它视为一种次要的东西，认为它与历史进程没有任何联系。因此，历史必须总是根据一个外在的标准来编写；实际的生产生活则显现为原始历史，而历史性则作为与普通生活分离的、超凡的存在。这样，人与自然的关系就从历史中排除了，由此产生了自然与历史的对立。因此，它在历史中只能看到政治主要行动和国家行动以及宗教和理论斗争，并且在每个历史时期都必须共享这个时期的幻想......”。这个社会性本身还作为意识形态限制进入理论的循环只有通过解读这种对资产阶级生活方式本质的外在性，并且在这种特定的形式确定性中被理论家有意识地纳入历史进程的构想，才能被克服。马克思在《德意志意识形态》中就是这样做的，因此可以抽象地区分两个时刻：一是人类历史作为自然整体中的一个不断变化的主体-客体配置，在劳动过程中两极被相互调解，并以不同形态呈现。通过劳动处理自然，人们自己与他们周围的自然一同变化。这是对人类和自然生产力作为历史发展实际推动原则的最抽象表述。第二个时刻是与这种主体-客体配置相对应的人类特定的社会存在方式，马克思试图用从之前的争论中提炼出的类别来捕捉它。因此，并不奇怪，当他首先以一种几乎是早期资产阶级、包含整个文明世界的方式过度扩展资产阶级社会的概念时：“...它显示出，这个资产阶级社会是所有历史的真正中心和舞台，以及忽视了实际关系的以往的历史观念是多么荒谬...”。同时，马克思意识到这种扩展的问题，并指出他主要关注的是一个结构性原则，他不得不用这个名称来称呼它，因为缺乏其他术语：“资产阶级社会作为这样的社会，只是随着资产阶级的发展而发展；直接从生产和交流中产生的社会组织，始终是国家和其他理想主义超结构的基础，但它一直用同一个名称被称呼……”。因此，概念形成是变化的，而且并不总是可以明确区分马克思是以一种方法论的组织原则使用这个概念，还是以在《黑格尔法哲学批判》或《论犹太问题》的论文中，那样的方式使用，其中中世纪社会被称为古老的资产阶级社会。无论如何，马克思在这里明确地用这个概念提出了他在黑格尔批判中暗示的想法作为唯物主义的历史观：“因此，这种历史观就是基于发展实际生产过程的基础上，特别是从物质生产的直接生活出发，发展这种生产方式以及由此产生的交通形式，也就是资产阶级社会的不同阶段，作为整个历史的基础，并在其作为国家的行动中展现它，以及从中解释所有不同的理论产品和意识形态形式，宗教、哲学、道德等等，并追踪它们的产生过程......”。在这里，我们不打算逐一追踪马克思的思想，而是指出在《德意志意识形态》中首次讨论的一个核心方法论原则：抽象与表达之间的区别。马克思在《德意志意识形态》中引入这种区分决不是偶然的。如果将人们与自然的交互过程在其各个方面固定下来，并以此作为唯物主义解释历史进程的基础，那么这种区分自然而然地显现出来。因为如果要描述人类发展过程的真实进程，那么可以被理解为各种生产力多样性的不同方面必须在其特定的确定性中经验性地研究——或者人们意识地保持在这种历史过程的“抽象”上。马克思在《德意志意识形态》中正是这样做的：“所以，当推测停止，在实际生活中，真实的、积极的科学开始，即人类的实际活动、实际发展过程的表现......独立的哲学随着现实的展现失去了其存在媒介。取而代之的最多只能是一种概括，即从人类历史发展的考察中抽象出来的最一般结果。这些抽象本身，从实际历史中分离出来，根本没有价值。它们只能用来简化历史材料的排序，指示其各个层次的顺序。但它们绝不像哲学那样，提供一个处方或模式，按照这个模式可以修剪历史时期。相反，困难实际上开始于，当人们开始考虑和安排材料，无论是过去的时代还是现在，开始进行真实的表述......我们在这里提取一些这样的抽象概念，我们用来对抗意识形态，并将通过历史实例来阐释它们。”我们在《德意志意识形态》中发现的，因此只是唯物主义历史观的简要版本，实际上是关于真实研究历史的指示和表述。我们不应忽视这一点，以免过于重视那些部分是以先前著作中展现为抽象概念的思想途径的重复的评论和备注，认为它们是整个真理。它们经常是出于争论的目的而随意提出的，而其中的唯物主义只是在需要的时候才会被引进，以便能够回应年轻黑格尔主义者的理想主义历史观。尽管如此，我们还是要尝试研究《德意志意识形态》以查看是否找到了指示，关于尚未在《德意志意识形态》中完成的表述应如何进行，以及我们迄今为止所了解的国家理论中的哪些元素被重复、改写、新增以及哪些元素消失的提示。"},{"instruction":"请将“Bleiben wir vorerst bei den die Methode betreffenden Fragen. Marx hält Hegel in der Kritik des Staatsrechts wiederholt vor, daß er unkritisch das empirisch Gegebene aufnehme und unter ein fertiges kategoriales Gerüst subsumiere und womöglich noch zurechtstutze. Soweit Hegel lediglich beschreibend verfährt, akzeptiert ihn Marx, sobald er den Anspruch einer streng methodischen Entwicklung und Ableitung erhebt, kritisiert er ihn. Hegel »entwickelt sein Denken nicht aus dem Gegenstand, sondern den Gegenstand nach einem mit sich fertig und in der abstrakten Sphäre der Logik mit sich fertig gewordnen Denken« 51, nicht »die Logik der Sache, sondern die Sache der Logik ist das philosophische Moment. Die Logik dient nicht zum Beweis des Staates, sondern der Staat dient zum Beweis der Logik« S2. Aus den zitierten Passagen geht zugleich hervor, daß Marx eine immanente Gesetzlichkeit der Sache unterstellt, der sich die Methode gleichsam anzuschmiegen hat. Doch welche Sache ist es, und in welcher Weise erfolgt deren Entwicklung und Ableitung, wie Marx sie - mit denselben Worten - bei Hegel fordert? Wie wir gesehen haben, ist die Hegelsche Rechtsphilosophie für Marx unter dem Aspekt empirischer Geschichtsschreibung völlig unproblematisch. Er übernimmt deren Beschreibung der Trennung von Staat und Gesellschaft als korrekte Wiedergabe der Empirie und scheint keinen Gedanken über die Methodik der Nachzeichnung dieser Form der Diremtion zu verschwenden. Aber so scheint es nur. Bei genauerer Betrachtung zeigt sich, daß Marx seine eigene Geschichtskonstruktion als theoretischen Ausdruck der »Logik der Sache« konzipiert, im Widerspruch zwischen Wesen und Existenz der Staatsverfassung das treibende Prinzip sieht, das die Geschichte bewegt. Ableitung oder Entwicklung kann dann aber nur Nachzeichnung der Veränderung des Bewußtseins heißen. Die staatsbürgerliche Tätigkeit des Einzelnen, die von Marx als einzig mögliche Form menschlicher Emanzipation gedeutet wird angesichts der Tatsache, daß die ganze gegenständliche Wirklichkeit in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft liegt, ist die sich selbst undurchsichtige, unter abstrakt-politischer Form praktizierte Vorwegnahme des wahren Gemeinwesens. Der öffentliche Mensch, der citoyen, ist der sich von der schlechten gegenständlichen Wirklichkeit der bürgerlichen Welt emanzipierende Mensch, der als diese sich selbst unbewußte Vorwegnahme der wahren Einheit des Allgemeinen und Besonderen im Gegensatz und Widerspruch zur bürgerlichen Gesellschaft steht. Wenn wir daher in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts Formulierungen finden, die auf den Widerspruch zwischen privater und öffentlicher Existenz hinweisen und die Ausbildung des politischen Staates auf diesen Widerspruch zurückführen, so sind sie ausnahmlos vor diesem Hintergrund zu lesen. Wie stellen sich nun methodische Probleme in der Deutschen Ideologie dar, der theoretische Nachvollzug der Konstitution eines von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft unterschiedenen politischen Staates, wenn die idealistische Prämisse wegfällt angesichts der Präzisierung des Arbeitsbegriffs und der damit einhergehenden Formulierung des Widerspruchs zwischen Produktivkräften und (damals noch) Verkehrsformen als Motor der geschichtlichen Entwicklung, selbst wenn diese in Begriffen zu fassen versucht wird, die sich fast ausschließlich dem Studium der neuzeitlichen bürgerlichen Gesell-schaft verdanken? Grundsätzlich ist festzuhalten, daß Marx bei manchen Bemerkungen über den Staat nicht wesentlich über das hinausgeht, was wir schon aus seiner Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts kennen. So zum Beispiel im Feuerbachkapitel: »Durch die Emanzipation des Privateigentums vom Gemeinwesen ist der Staat zu einer besonderen Existenz neben und außer der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft geworden « Es wird auf die gleichzeitige Genesis beider hingewiesen: mit dem reinen Privateigentum, das »allen Schein des Gemeinwesens abgestreift«, hat, nimmt das Gemeinwesen des Privateigentums, die gemeinschaftlichen Interessen der Privateigentümer, eine von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft unterschiedene Gestalt an, die »aber weiter Nichts (ist) als die Form der Organisation, welche sich die Bourgeois sowohl nach außen als nach innen hin zur gegenseitigen Garantie ihres Eigentums und ihrer Interessen notwendig geben« 54. Die Explikation des Klassencharakters des Staates, auf den schon damals hingewiesen wurde und nicht völlig einsehbar mit der Konzeption des (an Feuerbachs Philosophie orientierten) menschlichen Wesens vermittelt war, wird jetzt in den Vordergrund gerückt: der bürgerliche Staat ist in dieser spezifischen Form der Trennung von der Gesellschaft Klassenstaat. Politischer Staat ist er nur vermöge des Ausschlusses eines Teils der Gesellschaft von der staatsbürgerlichen Tätigkeit. Mit der Verallgemeinerung des Wahlrechts, daran hält Marx fest, wie das aus einem Hinweis im Notizbuch aus jener Zeit hervorgeht, verschwindet der Staat und damit zugleich auch die bürgerliche Gesellschaft55. Weiterhin heißt es: »Diesem modernen Privateigentum entspricht (von mir gesperrt, H. R.) der moderne Staat . . . 5S.« Ebenfalls eine Formulierung, die wir kennen: »Der moderne Staat, in dem die allgemeine Angelegenheit; wie die Beschäftigung mit derselben ein Monopol ist und dagegen die Monopole die wirklichen allgemeinen Angelegenheiten sind, hat die sonderbare Erfindung gemacht, die allgemeine Angelegenheit; als eine bloße Form sich anzueignen. (Das Wahre ist, daß nur die Form allgemeine Angelegenheit ist.) Er hat damit die entsprechende (von mir gesperrt, H. R.) Form für seinen Inhalt gefunden, der nur scheinbar die wirkliche allgemeine Ange-legenheit ist57.« Daß es sich bei dieser von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft getrennten selbständigen Form des Staates gleichwohl aber um keine Selbständigkeit des Staates handelt im Sinne einer über der Gesellschaft stehenden, von ihr unbeherrschten Institution, wird ausdrücklich hervorgehoben. Es ist dies höchstens der Fall in einer Konstellation, in der die alte ständische Gesellschaft noch nicht völlig verschwunden und die neue kapitalistische noch nicht völlig zur Herrschaft gekommen ist: »Die Selbständigkeit des Staates kommt heutzutage nur noch in solchen Ländern vor, wo die Stände sich nicht völlig zu Klassen entwickelt haben, wo die in den fortgeschrittneren Ländern beseitigten Stände noch eine Rolle spielen und ein Gemisch existiert, in denen daher kein Teil der Bevölkerung es zur Herrschaft über die übrigen bringen kann. Dies ist namentlich in Deutschland der Fall. Das vollendetste Beispiel des modernen Staats ist Nordamerika. Die neueren französischen, englischen und amerikanischen Schriftsteller sprechen sich Alle dahin aus, daß der Staat nur um des Privateigentums willen existiere, so daß dies auch in das gewöhnliche Bewußtsein übergegangen ist 58.«”翻译为中文","output":"关于方法论问题，我们先暂时停留在这里。马克思在对黑格尔的《法哲学批判》中反复指责黑格尔，认为他是在未经批判地接受经验所给，并将其归入一个既定的范畴框架之下，可能还会对其进行修剪。就黑格尔仅仅描述性地行进而言，马克思接受他；但一旦黑格尔声称进行严格的方法论发展和推导，马克思就批评他。黑格尔“不是从对象出发发展其思想，而是根据一个已经在逻辑的抽象领域完成的思考来看待对象”，不是“事情的逻辑，而是逻辑的事情构成哲学时刻。逻辑不是用来证明国家的，而是国家用来证明逻辑”。从引述的段落中也可以看出，马克思假设了事物的内在规律性，方法必须要某种程度上贴合这些规律。但是，究竟是什么事物，以及其发展和推导是如何进行的，如马克思所要求的，用黑格尔的话来说呢？正如我们所见，对于马克思而言，黑格尔的法哲学在经验性历史写作方面完全不成问题。他接受了其对国家与社会分离的描述作为对经验的正确反映，并似乎不关心追溯这种分离形式的方法论。但这只是表面上的。仔细考察后发现，马克思将自己的历史构建视为“事情逻辑”的理论表达，在国家宪法的本质与存在之间的矛盾中看到推动历史的原动力。那么，推导或发展只能意味着对意识变化的追踪。鉴于整个客观现实位于资产阶级社会之内的事实，马克思将个人的公民活动解释为人类解放的唯一可能形式，这是对真正公共事务的抽象政治形式下的实践预设。公共人，citoyen，是从资产阶级世界的恶劣客观现实中解放出来的人，作为这种对一般与特殊真正统一的自我不自觉的预设，与资产阶级社会形成对立和矛盾。因此，当我们在对黑格尔的《法哲学批判》中找到指向私人与公共存在之间矛盾的表述，并将政治国家的形成归因于这种矛盾时，应当完全在这种背景下理解它们。 《德意志意识形态》中呈现出怎样的方法论问题呢，当理想主义前提在劳动概念被精确化以及随之而来的生产力与（当时的）交往形式之间的矛盾被表述为历史发展的驱动力的背景下消失，尽管这些尝试被诠释为几乎完全来源于对近代资产阶级社会的研究？基本上，值得注意的是，马克思对国家的一些评论并没有本质上超出我们已经从他对黑格尔《法哲学批判》的批评中知道的范围。例如，在费尔巴哈章节：“通过将私有财产从公共团体中解放出来，国家成为了一个在资产阶级社会之外和之旁的特殊存在”。这同时指出了它们共同的起源：随着纯粹私有财产“摆脱了所有公共团体的假象”，私有财产的公共团体，即私有财产所有者的共同利益，呈现出与资产阶级社会不同的形态，这“不过是资产阶级无论是对外还是对内为了相互保证其财产和利益而必须给予的组织形式”。对国家的阶级性质的说明，这已经被指出，并且与（基于费尔巴哈哲学的）人类本质的概念完全融合起来，现在被突出显示：资产阶级国家是这种社会分离的特定形式下的阶级国家。政治国家只是通过排除社会一部分人从公民活动中才成为政治国家。马克思坚持认为，随着普选权的推广，如那时笔记中提及，国家以及资产阶级社会将随之消失。进一步说：“这种现代私有财产对应（由我强调，H.R.）现代国家……”。这也是我们知道的一个表述：“现代国家，其中一般事务及其处理成为一项垄断，而反之垄断则是真正的一般事务，发明了这样一种奇怪的办法，即将一般事务作为一种纯粹的形式来占有。（真相是，只有形式才是一般事务。）它因此找到了与其内容相应的（由我强调，H.R.）形式，这个内容只不过表面上是真正的一般事务”。明确指出这种与资产阶级社会分离的独立国家形式实际上并不意味着国家作为一个凌驾于社会之上、不受其控制的机构的独立。这最多只在一种特定的情况下发生，那就是旧的等级社会还未完全消失而新的资本主义社会还未完全掌握权力时：“国家的独立性如今只在那些等级未完全发展成为阶级的国家中出现，在这些国家，被先进国家消除的等级仍然占有一席之地且存在一个混合体，在这种情况下，因此，没有任何一个社会群体能够统治其他群体。这特别是在德国的情况。现代国家的最完美示例是北美。近期的法国、英国和美国的作家都表达了这样的观点，即国家的存在仅仅是为了私有财产，如此这个观点也进入了普通的意识中”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Von dieser wirklichen Selbständigkeit des Staates ist die schein- hafte Selbständigkeit zu unterscheiden, die Täuschung über den wirklichen Charakter des Staates. Die Marxsche Kritik hinsichtlich dieser »verkehrten Vorstellung« setzt in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts ein und bleibt sich strukturell gleich bis hin zu den späten ökonomiekritischen Werken. So heißt es in der Kritik des Staatsrechts: »Welches ist also die Macht des politischen Staates über das Privateigentum? Die eigne Macht des Privateigentums, sein zur Existenz gebrachtes Wesen. Was bleibt dem politischen Staat im Gegensatz zu diesem Wesen übrig? Die Illusion, daß er bestimmt, wo er bestimmt wird 59.« Die Ursache dieses verkehrten Bewußtseins, dieser Illusion, sieht Marx in der dem Theoretiker selbst nicht bewußten Verkehrung des Privateigentiimers zum natürlichen Menschen schlechthin, die theoretische Rücknahme einer wirklichen Verkehrung an der Basis selbst; das sagt er dort noch mit anderen Worten: »Das Privateigentum ist nicht mehr ein bestimmtes Objekt der Willkür, sondern die Willkür ist das bestimmte Prädikat des Privateigentums60.« Da der Privateigentümer (für den bürgerlichen Denker) mit dem natürlichen Menschen unmittelbar zusammenfällt, muß er sich zugleich über den Charakter des Staates täuschen: dieser kann ihm nur noch als ein Selbständiges und Selbst-setzendes erscheinen, das die Zielsetzungen seiner Tätigkeit »aus sich selbst schöpft« oder sich an Bestimmungen dieses natürlichen Menschen orientiert. Die prätendierte Überzeitlichkeit und Allgemeinheit von bestimmten Normen läßt sich hier schon als Ideologie in einem strengen Sinne abstrakt entlarven, indem ihre Genesis aufgewiesen wird: dieser Nachweis besteht darin, daß gezeigt wird, wie sich dem Theoretiker der bürgerliche Mensch zum Menschen schlechthin verkehrt, und ihm deswegen alle Bestimmungen dieses spezifisch geschichtlichen Menschen unableitbar werden. In der Abhandlung Zur Judenfrage wird dieses ideologiekritische Theorem ebenfalls expliziert. Nachdem Marx ausführlich dargelegt hat, daß keines der »sogenannten Menschrechte« über den egoistischen Menschen der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, den auf seine Privatwillkür, sein Privatinteresse zurückgezogenes Individuum hinausgeht, bezeichnet er es als »rätselhaft, daß ein Volk, welches eben beginnt, sich zu befreien, . . . ein politisches Gemeinwesen zu gründen, daß ein solches Volk die Berechtigung des egoistischen . . . Menschen feierlich proklamiert« 61. Wie erwähnt, fällt für den Marx der Judenfrage die Konstitution des politischen Gemeinwesens unmittelbar zusammen mit dem Akt der mensch-lichen Emanzipation unter bornierter, eben der politischen Form, sodaß diese Proklamation nur als Rückschritt in der Geschichte der Menschheit erscheinen kann. Noch einen Schritt weiter in dieser verkehrten Welt gehen die »politischen Emanzipatoren«, wenn sie dieses politische Gemeinwesen zum Mittel für die Erhaltung der Menschenrechte herabsetzen und damit den emanzipierten Men-schen zum Diener des Bourgeois machen: »Also selbst in den Mo-menten seines noch jugendfrischen und durch den Drang der Um-stände auf die Spitze getriebenen Enthusiasmus erklärt sich das politische Leben für ein bloßes Mittel, dessen Zweck das Leben der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft ist62.« Doch das ist die Theorie - die revolutionäre Praxis steht dazu im Widerspruch. Die Sicherheit, ein Menschenrecht, wird verletzt, indem die Verletzung des Brief-geheimnisses auf die Tagesordnung gesetzt wird; die Pressefreiheit, eine Konsequenz des Menschenrechts, wird vernichtet. Allgemein: das Menschenrecht hört auf, ein Recht zu sein, sobald es mit dem politischen Leben in Konflikt gerät. Das politische Leben wird zum Zweck, das bürgerliche erscheint als Mittel. Doch diese Praxis ist die Ausnahme, bei deren Betrachtung gleichwohl zu klären bleibt, warum »im Bewußtsein der politischen Emanzipatoren das Verhältnis auf den Kopf gestellt ist und der Zweck als Mittel, das Mittel als Zweck erscheint. Diese optische Täuschung ihres Bewußtseins wäre immer noch dasselbe Rätsel, obgleich dann ein psychologisches, ein theoretisches Rätsel 63.« Die Antwort kennen wir: »Der wirkliche Mensch ist erst in der Gestalt des egoistischen Individuums, der wahre Mensch erst in der Gestalt des abstrakten citoyen anerkannt64.« Da es uns hier lediglich auf eine ideologiekritische Argumentation als eines besonderen Aspekts der Staatsheorie ankommt, wollen wir an dieser Stelle nicht weiter untersuchen, inwiefern die Marxsche Formulierung des gesamten Sachverhalts nicht selbst noch durch den Idealismus seiner eigenen Geschichtskonstruktion beeinflußt ist. In der Deutschen Ideologie geht Marx ebenfalls, wenn auch nur mit wenigen und zudem dunklen Sätzen auf dieses verkehrte Bewußtsein und seinen Ursprung ein. Sie sind letztlich nur verständlich vor dem Hintergrund der oben angedeuteten und in der Deutschen Ideologie nicht immer explizit entwickelten Konzeption. Zugleich sind diese Hinweise in der Deutschen Ideologie als implizite Kritik an seiner eigenen, noch vor kurzer Zeit vertretenen Auffassung zu begreifen, die davon ausgeht, daß das Volk von der Verfassung, dem Gesetz, also abstrakten Allgemeinheiten beherrscht wurde. Diese Auffassung ging, wie wir sahen, mit einer idealistischen Geschichtsauffassung einher, und wird jetzt als Formulierung des objektiven Scheins zurückgewiesen: »Alle Verhältnisse können in der Sprache nur als Begriffe ausgedrückt werden. Daß diese Allgemeinheiten und Begriffe als mysteriöse Mächte gelten, ist eine notwendige Folge der Verselbständigung der realen Verhältnisse, deren Ausdruck sie sind. Außer dieser Geltung im gewöhnlichen Bewußtsein erhalten diese Allgemeinheiten noch eine besondere Geltung und Ausbildung von den Politikern und Juristen, die durch die Teilung der Arbeit auf den Kultus dieser Begriffe angewiesen sind und in ihnen, nicht in den Produktionsverhältnissen, die wahre Grundlage aller realen Eigentumsverhältnisse sehen 65.«”翻译为中文","output":"关于国家的这种真实独立性，必须将其与表面上的独立性区分开来，后者是对国家实际性质的误解。马克思的批判从对黑格尔《法哲学批判》开始，一直贯穿至晚期经济学批判作品中在结构上保持一致。因此，在《法哲学批判》中，他写道：“那么，政治国家对私有财产有何权力呢？那就是私有财产自己的权力，它的本质实现了。与这个本质相对，政治国家剩下什么呢？剩下的是幻觉，认为自己在决定事物，实际上是被决定的。”这种错误意识、这种幻觉的原因，马克思认为是理论家自己未意识到的将私有财产所有者倒错为自然人本身，实际上是对基础本身出现的倒错的理论性回归；他用不同的话说：“私有财产不再是任性的特定对象，而任性是私有财产的特定属性。”因为私有财产所有者（对于资产阶级思想家来说）直接与自然人重合，所以他必须对国家的性质产生误解：国家只能在他眼中显现为一个独立自主、自我设定的实体，从它自己“汲取”其行为目标，或依据这个自然人的规定进行。特定规范的假定的超历史性和普遍性在这里可以以一种严格意义上的意识形态被抽象地揭示，通过展示它们的起源：这种证明在于展示理论家如何将资产阶级人逆转为人本身，导致他对这个特定历史人的所有决定都变得无法推导。在《论犹太问题》中，这一意识形态批判理论同样被阐明。马克思详细阐述了所有“所谓的人权”都仅限于资产阶级社会的自私人即退缩至个人私欲、个人利益的个体，他称之为“奇怪的是，一个刚开始解放自己……建立政治共同体的人民，会庄严宣告自私……人的权利。”正如提到的，对于《论犹太问题》中的马克思来说，政治共同体的构建与人的解放行为直接相关，但局限于政治形式，因此这种宣告只能作为人类历史的一次倒退出现。在这个倒置的世界中，“政治解放者”更进一步，他们将这个政治共同体降低为维护人权的工具，从而将解放的人变成资产阶级的仆人：“因此，即使在其青春洋溢且由形势所推动的热情时刻，政治生活也声明自己仅仅是一个手段，其目的是资产阶级社会的生活。”然而，这是理论——革命实践与之相矛盾。安全（一项人权）被侵犯，因为邮件隐私的侵犯成为议程；出版自由，人权的一项后果，被摧毁。总的来说：一旦人权与政治生活冲突，它就不再是一项权利。政治生活变成了目的，资产阶级生活似乎成为了手段。但这种实践是例外，在考虑这种情况时，仍需澄清“为什么在政治解放者的意识中关系被颠倒，目的被视为手段，手段被视为目的。这种意识的视觉错觉即使仍是同一个谜题，虽然那时是一个心理学的、理论上的谜题。”答案我们已知：“真实的人首次以自私的个体的形式得到承认，真正的人首次以抽象citoyen的形式得到承认。”由于我们在此只关注作为国家理论特定方面的意识形态批判论证，我们将不再进一步探讨马克思对整个事实的表述是否仍受其自己历史构造的理想主义所影响。 在《德意志意识形态》中，马克思也讨论了这种错误意识及其来源，尽管只是以少量且相对晦涩的句子。这些句子最终只能在上述暗示的背景下理解，在《德意志意识形态》中并不总是显式发展。同时，这些提示在《德意志意识形态》中作为对他自己不久前持有的观点的隐含批判来理解，这种观点认为人民受到宪法、法律，即抽象普遍性的统治。正如我们所见，这种观点与一种理想主义的历史观相伴随，并且现在作为对客观表象的表述被拒绝：“所有关系只能以概念的形式在语言中表达。这些普遍性和概念被视为神秘力量，是对现实关系自我孤立的必然结果，这些概念是其表达。除了在普通意识中的这种认可之外，这些普遍性在政治家和法学家中还获得了特殊的认可和发展，他们因劳动分工而依赖于这些概念的崇拜，并且在这些概念中，而不是在生产关系中，看到了所有现实财产关系的真实基础。”"},{"instruction":"请将“In der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie wird dieser verkehrte Schein nun explizit im Rahmen der systematischen Behandlung des Fetischproblems entwickelt. Vorstellungen, wie sie sich im Römischen Recht oder ausdrücklich juristischen Geldtheorien finden, werden von Marx nicht abstrakt zurückgewiesen, sondern selber noch in seiner Theorie »aufgehoben«. So stellt er in der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie aus dem Jahre 1859 die erste Funktion des Geldes dar bis hin zur begriffslos sachlichen, einfach gesellschaftlichen Form des Geldnamens und entwickelt in diesem Zusammenhang das Einsetzen staatlicher Tätigkeit: »Da die Bestimmung der Maßeinheit, ihrer aliquoten Teile und deren Namen einerseits rein konventionell ist, andererseits innerhalb der Zirkulation den Charakter der Allgemeinheit und Notwendigkeit besitzen muß, mußte sie gesetzliche Bestimmung werden. Die rein formelle Operation fiel also den Regierungen anheim 66.« Wird die Regierungstätigkeit nicht in dieser Erhebung eines naturgemäß konventionellen zu einem Allgemeinen innerhalb dieser notwendigen Fortentwicklung des Geldes zum Geldnamen gesehen, so entsteht allerdings die Illusion, als ob das Geld selbst durch den Staat geschaffen wird, wie es sich etwa bei A. H. Müller darstellt, den Marx zitiert: »Nach unseren Vorstellungen hat jeder unabhängige Souverän das Recht, das Metallgeld zu ernennen, ihm einen gesellschaftlichen Nominalwert, Rang, Stand und Titel beizulegen67.« Analoges kritisiert bei Marx bei der Entwicklung der nächsten Geldfunktion. Die Darstellung der immanenten Gesetzlichkeit der Warenzirkulation ist nicht abzutrennen von der Darstellung des bürgerlichen Verkehrungsprozesses auf einer konkreteren Ebene: »Wenn der Formwechsel der Waren als bloßer Stellenwechsel des Geldes erscheint, und die Kontinuität der Zirkulationsbewegung ganz auf die Seite des Geldes fällt ... so scheint die ganze Bewegung vom Gelde auszugehen . . . Das Geld scheint also die Waren zu zirkulieren, indem es ihre Preise realisiert . . . Die Formbewegung der prozessierenden Waren erscheint daher als seine eigene, den Austausch der an sich bewegungslosen Waren vermittelnde Bewegung. Die Bewegung des Zirkulationsprozesses stellt sich also dar in der Bewegung des Geldes als Zirkulationsmittel - im Geldumlauf. ... Wie die Warenbesitzer die Produkte ihrer Privatarbeiten als Produkte gesellschaftlicher Arbeit darstellten, indem sie ein Ding, Gold, in unmittelbares Dasein der allgemeinen Arbeitszeit und darum in Geld verwandelten, so tritt ihnen jetzt ihre eigene allseitige Bewegung, wodurch sie den Stoffwechsel ihrer Arbeiten vermitteln, als eigentümliche Bewegung eines Dings gegenüber, als Umlauf des Goldes68.« Diese Verkehrung, als nichtdurchschaute schließlich in quantitätstheoretischen Formulierungen zum Ausdruck gebracht, potenziert sich bei der Ersetzung des Goldgeldes durch Papiergeld mit Zwangskurs. Da im Zirkulationsprozeß das Geld ausschließlich als Realisieret des Preises funktioniert, kann sich das funktionelle Dasein des Geldes gegenüber seiner Metallgestalt verselbständigen und sich (in einem Prozeß der Idealisierung, wie Marx ihn in der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie nennt) zum abstrakten Wertzeichen fortentwickeln. Da nun das Geld in dieser zweiten Bestimmung selbst nur das beständige Verschwinden ist, Zeichen seiner selbst, so kann es scheinen, daß der Tauschwert nur als gedachter existiert und keine eigene Wirklichkeit außer den Waren selbst besitzt. »Es scheint daher, als ob das Wertzeichen den Wert der Waren unmittelbar repräsentiere, indem es nicht Zeichen von Gold, sondern als Zeichen des im Preis nur ausgedrückten, aber in der Ware allein vorhandenen Tauschwerts sich darstellt. Dieser Schein ist aber falsch 69.« Das Wertzeichen, so führt Marx aus, ist unmittelbar nur Goldzeichen und auf diesem Umweg Zeichen des Werts der Ware. Hinsichtlich der umlaufenden Geldmenge bedeutet dies, daß die Quantität der Papierzettel bestimmt ist durch die Quantität des Goldgeldes, das sie in der Zirkulation vertreten. Angesichts dieser objektiven Scheinhaftigkeit, die mit den Gesetzen der Warenzirkulation verbunden ist, können sich verkehrte Vorstellungen über die Reichweite und Macht staatlicher Tätigkeit entwickeln: »Die Einmischung des Staats, der das Papiergeld mit Zwangskurs ausgibt ... scheint das ökonomische Gesetz aufzuheben. Der Staat, der in dem Münzpreis einem bestimmten Goldgewicht nur einen Taufnamen gab, und in der Münzung nur seinen Stempel auf das Gold drückte, scheint jetzt durch die Magie seines Stempels Papier in Gold zu verwandeln. Da die Papierzettel Zwangskurs haben, kann niemand ihn hindern, beliebig große Anzahl derselben in Zirkulation zu zwängen und beliebige Münznamen . . . ihnen aufzuprägen . .. Indes ist diese Macht des Staates bloßer Schein. Er mag beliebige Quantität Papierzettel mit beliebigen Münznamen in die Zirkulation hineinschleudern, aber mit diesem mechanischen Akt hört seine Kontrolle auf. Von der Zirkulation ergriffen, fällt das Wertzeichen oder Papiergeld ihren immanenten Gesetzen anheim 70.« Marx zitiert in diesem Zusam-menhang aus Mandevilles Voyages and Travels, der diesem Schein vollständig aufsitzt: »Dieser Kaiser (von Cattay oder China) kann so viel ausgeben, wie es ihm beliebt, ohne Beschränkung. Denn er ist nicht abhängig und macht Geld nur aus bedrucktem Leder oder Papier .. .71.« Wir wollen uns an dieser Stelle mit diesen Hinweisen begnügen. Systematisch entfaltet, hätte dieser verkehrte Schein hinsichtlich der Macht des Staates bei jeder einzelnen ökonomischen Kategorie entwickelt werden müssen.”翻译为中文","output":"在《政治经济学批判》中，这种错觉现象在对物神化问题的系统处理中被明确提出。马克思没有抽象地拒绝罗马法或明确的法律货币理论中的观念，而是在他的理论中将它们“上升”消解。因此，在1859年的《政治经济学批判》中，他描述了货币的第一功能，直至无概念的、单纯的社会形式的货币名称，并在此背景下发展了国家活动的介入：“由于度量单位、其等分以及它们的名称一方面完全是约定俗成的，另一方面在流通中必须具有普遍性和必要性的特征，因而必须成为法定规定。因此，这一纯形式的操作归于政府。”如果不是在这种将天然约定性的事物提升为流通中必要的普遍性的必要发展过程中看到政府活动，那么就会产生一种幻觉，好像是国家本身创造了货币，正如马克思引用A.H.穆勒的观点所示：“据我们的观念，每一个独立的主权者都有权命名金属货币，赋予它们一个社会名义价值、地位、级别和头衔。”类似地，在马克思发展货币的下一个功能时也进行了批判。对商品流通的内在规律性的描述与对资产阶级逆转过程在更具体层面的描述是不可分割的：“如果商品形态的变化仅仅出现为货币的位置改变，流通运动的连续性全部归于货币一方...那么，整个运动似乎是由货币发起的...因此，货币似乎是通过实现它们的价格来流通商品...商品过程中的形态变化因此看似是它自己的、调节本身不动的商品交换的运动。因此，流通过程的运动表现为货币作为流通手段的运动——货币流通...正如商品所有者通过将某物，即黄金，转化为直接存在的一般劳动时间，从而转化为货币，来表现其私人劳动产品为社会劳动产品一样，现在他们自己的全面运动，通过它们调节各自劳动的物质交换，对立于他们作为某物的特有运动，作为黄金流通。”这种未被透视的逆转最终在数量理论的表述中被加倍，当金钱被强制流通的纸币所替代时。由于在流通过程中货币仅作为价格的实现者而功能，货币的功能存在可以独立于其金属形态，并可以（如马克思在《政治经济学批判》中所称的那样的理想化过程中）发展为抽象的价值符号。既然货币在这第二个定义中本身只是持续消失的存在，是自身的符号，那么似乎交换价值只是作为一种想象存在，没有自己的现实性，除了商品本身之外。“因此，似乎价值符号直接代表了商品的价值，因为它不是黄金的符号，而是作为价格中仅表达但仅存在于商品中的交换价值的符号。但这种幻觉是错误的。”价值符号，正如马克思所阐述，直接只是黄金符号，通过这种方式成为商品价值的符号。关于流通中的货币数量，这意味着纸币的数量是由它们在流通中代表的黄金货币的数量决定的。鉴于与商品流通法则相连的这种客观的表面性，有关国家活动的范围和力量的逆转观念可能会发展：“国家的干预，它以强制流通发行纸币...似乎废除了经济法则。国家，在给定一定重量的黄金命名并在铸币时只是在黄金上盖上自己的印章的情况下，现在似乎通过其印章的魔力将纸转变为黄金。由于纸币具有强制流通性，没有人可以阻止它强行将任意数量的纸币推向流通并给予它们任意的货币名...但这种国家的力量只是表面现象。它可以将任意数量的纸币以任意的货币名称投入流通，但这种机械行为结束后，它的控制也就结束了。被流通所接纳，价值符号或纸币就受制于它们内在的法则。”马克思在这个背景下引用了Mandeville的《旅行与探险》，他完全陷入了这种幻觉：“这位皇帝（来自Cattay或中国）可以尽其所愿地发行货币，没有限制。因为他是不受约束的，并且仅用印有图案的皮革或纸来制造货币...”在这里，我们仅持这些提示即可。系统地展开，这种关于国家力量的逆转错觉需要在每个经济类别上都进行发展。"},{"instruction":"решать надо в excel, просто напиши как и что делать куда какие формулы и тд.

Thomas was recognized by everyone in the village for his radiant smile and contagious laughter. To him, every day was a new adventure, a new opportunity to find joy and spread it among those he met. However, the true secret to Thomas's happiness lay at the crest of the great mountain that stretched up and touched the skies above their village. One sunny morning, with the sky a brilliant shade of blue and not a cloud in sight, Thomas decided it was the perfect day for his cherished activity. He laced up his sturdy boots, filled his backpack with essentials, and embarked on the journey up the mountain. This was a path he had traversed many times before, yet each climb filled him with a unique sense of excitement and peace. As he ascended, Thomas greeted every creature and admired every plant he passed, believing that happiness grows not by seeking it for oneself but by sharing it with others, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. The birds seemed to sing a little sweeter as he walked by, and even the trees appeared to sway more gently in the breeze, as if they too were happy to see him. The journey was arduous, as mountain trails often are, with steep inclines that challenged even the fittest of travelers. But Thomas's heart was light, and his spirit unyielding. He often paused to help fellow hikers, sharing his water, offering a snack, or simply encouraging them with his infectious laugh, leaving a trail of smiles in his wake. As the sun traveled across the sky, painting the world in golden hues, Thomas reached the summit. The view from the top was breathtaking - a vast expanse of nature's finest work, with forests, rivers, and the village below looking like a miniature paradise. Here, standing at the top of the world, Thomas felt a profound peace flood through him. It was as though the mountain whispered secrets of happiness that flowed like the wind, wild and free. Thomas sat there for hours, lost in the beauty of the world and the quiet joy it brought him. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold, he realized why he was truly happy. It wasn't just the climb, or the spectacular view, or even the peace he found at the mountain's peak. His happiness came from within, from his ability to see beauty in every step, to find joy in the journey, and to share that joy with every soul he encountered on his path. As darkness began to envelop the world below, Thomas made his way back down the mountain, a journey that was just as important as the ascent. His heart was full, knowing that real happiness doesn't come from reaching the top but from the love and joy we spread on our way there. When he returned to the village, the people were drawn to the light of his happiness like moths to a flame. They gathered around to hear him speak of his latest journey, hanging on his every word. But Thomas always relayed the same message, that happiness is a journey, not a destination, and it's a path that is infinitely richer when shared with others. And so, Thomas, the happy man on the mountain, continued to live his life, spreading joy wherever he went, a living testament to the power of happiness to transform not just one's own life but the lives of everyone around them."},{"instruction":"make a document clear \\"To enable the gopro USB stream it’s required to install the gopro lab firmware into the gopro.

Marx spricht mehrere Male von der »illusorischen Gemeinschaftlichkeit«, den »Surrogaten der Gemeinschaft, dem Staat« 72 von der »den Individuen gegenüber verselbständigten scheinbaren Gemeinschaft (Staat, Recht)« 73 und aus dem Gesamtzusammenhang geht sehr deutlich hervor, daß nur der Verdopplungsbegriff der früheren Hegelkritik (und wie er in der Judenfrage ausschließlich vorgetragen wurde), gemeint sein kann, ohne daß die Frage gestellt wird, inwiefern dieses Theorem aufrechterhalten werden kann unter der - neuen - Voraussetzung des Widerspruchs zwischen Produktivkräften und Produktionsverhältnissen als Motor der geschichtlichen Bewegung. Gerade in diesem Zusammenhang muß jedoch darauf hingewiesen werden, wie uneinheitlich die Deutsche Ideologie insgesamt ist. Wir haben schon oben darauf aufmerksam gemacht, daß Marx den geschichtlichen Prozeß in Kategorien der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft zu fassen versucht, doch bleibt der in diesem Kontext eingeführte Widerspruch zwischen Produktivkräften und Verkehrsformen durchaus auf der Ebene reiner Versicherung. Marx sieht dies letztlich selbst, wenn er eingesteht: »Wir gingen bisher von den Produktionsinstrumenten aus, und schon hier zeigte sich die Notwendigkeit des Privateigentums für gewisse industrielle Stufen. In der Industrie extractive fällt das Privateigentum mit der Arbeit noch ganz zusammen; in der kleinen Industrie und aller bisherigen Agrikultur ist das Eigentum notwendige Konsequenz der vorhandenen Produktionsinstrumente; in der großen Industrie ist der Widerspruch zwischen dem Produktionsinstrument und Privateigentum erst ihr Produkt, zu dessen Erzeugung sie bereits sehr entwickelt sein muß. Mit ihr ist also auch die Aufhebung des Privateigentums erst möglich 74.« Insbesondere aus dieser Passage geht hervor, daß Marx von einem bestimmten geschichtlichen Resultat her argumentiert, das er seinerseits wieder mit der uns schon bekannten Konzeption des geschichtlichen Verlaufs als einer Aufeinanderfolge von Emanzipationsschwellen verkoppelt, die in ihrer Gesamtstruktur erst vom Endpunkt der Geschichte einsehbar wird. Wurde in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts die abstrakt politische Emanzipation als ein Vorgang gedeutet, in welchem sich die Individuen in der einzig möglichen Form von ihrer bornierten gegenständlichen Wirklichkeit, ihrer Besonderheit in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft befreien und zu einer, wenn auch beschränkten Gestalt demokratischer Gemeinschaft zusammenschließen können, sich ihrem wahren Gemeinwesen »nä-hern«, in welchem sie dann auch als Individuen zu ihrem Recht kommen, so wird dieser Gedankengang jetzt auf die Gestalt des Reproduktionsprozesses übertragen und die große Industrie als Produktionsweise gedeutet, in der die Individuen sich von der vor-angegangenen Beschränktheit der Produktionsinstrumente emanzi-piert haben (eine Beschränktheit, die als entsprechende Verkehrsform das Privateigentum notwendig hervorbrachte) und nun zum ersten Male frei von aller bornierten Besonderheit miteinander verkehren können: »In keiner früheren Periode hatten die Produktivkräfte diese gleichgültige Gestalt für den Verkehr der Individuen als Individuen angenommen, weil ihr Verkehr selbst noch ein bornierter war. Auf der andern Seite steht diesen Produktivkräften die Majorität der Individuen gegenüber, von denen diese Kräfte losgerissen sind und die daher alles wirklichen Lebensinhalts beraubt, abstrakte (gesperrt von mir, H. R.) Individuen geworden sind, die aber dadurch erst in den Stand gesetzt werden, als Individuen miteinander in Verbindung zu treten73.« Ebenso wie eine bestimmte Emanzipationsschwelle in den früheren Schriften zum Angelpunkt der Gesamtkonstruktion wurde, wird in der Deutschen Ideologie diese letzte, dem kapitalistischen Produktionsprozeß eigentümliche Trennung der Produzenten von den Produktionsmitteln zum entscheidenden Ausgangspunkt der Interpretation des vorangegangenen geschichtlichen Verlaufs: die bestimmte Form der Produktionsinstrumente geht einher mit einer bestimmten Verkehrsform der Individuen, innerhalb deren sich die Individuen in ihrer Auseinandersetzung mit der Natur weiter entfalten können, bis ihnen diese Form des Verkehrs zur Fessel wird, von der sie sich durch gesellschaftliche Eruptionen befreien müssen, um einer neuen Form Platz zu machen, die ihnen nun als ein Zustand der Freiheit erscheinen muß. Diese muß ihnen solange als ein Zustand der Freiheit erscheinen, solange er der Entwicklung ihrer Persönlichkeit angemessen ist - mit der weiteren Entfaltung der Produktivkräfte wird auch diese neue Form mehr und mehr als Fessel empfunden und schließlich abgestreift. Der Prozeß endet mit jener Produktionsweise, in der die Produktionsinstrumente derartigen Umfang angenommen haben, daß sie nur noch gesellschaftlich eingesetzt werden können und deshalb auch das Privateigentum als Ausdruck und notwendige Verkehrsform des kleinen, nicht gesellschaftlich anwendbaren Produktionsinstruments verschwinden muß. Diese Geschichtskonstruktion mit dem realen geschichtlichen Verlauf zu vermitteln, fällt Marx in der Tat nicht leicht, und wir wollen hier auf den Versuch verzichten, die Marxsche Konkretion nachzuvollziehen. Wesentlich ist uns hier, wie sich Marx den Übergang aus einer zur Fessel gewordenen Form des Verkehrs in eine neue, dem Entwicklungsstand der Individuen angemessenere Form vorstellt; denn das ist der Schlüssel zum Verständnis des Begriffs der »illusorischen Gemeinschaft« in der Deutschen Ideologie: der den Produktivkräften angemessene und von den Individuen als Freiheit empfundene Zustand ist der Staat, der von der beherrschten Klasse, dem jeweiligen Träger der sich weiter entwickelnden Produktivkräfte, seinerseits als Fessel aufgefaßt wird: »Erst in der Gemeinschaft mit Andern hat jedes Individuum die Mittel, seine Anlagen nach allen Seiten auszubilden; erst in der Gemeinschaft wird also die persönliche Freiheit möglich. In den bisherigen Surrogaten der Gemeinschaft, im Staat usw. existierte die persönliche Freiheit nur für die in den Verhältnissen der herrschenden Klasse entwickelten Individuen und nur, insofern sie Individuen dieser Klasse waren. Die scheinbare Gemeinschaft, zu der sich bisher die Individuen vereinigten, verselbständigte sich stets ihnen gegenüber und war zugleich, da sie eine Vereinigung einer Klasse gegenüber einer andern war, für die beherrschte Klasse nicht nur eine ganz illusorische Gemeinschaft, sondern auch eine neue Fessel. In der wirklichen Gemeinschaft erlangen die Individuen in und durch ihre Assoziation zugleich ihre Freiheit70.«”翻译为中文","output":"我们转向国家理论的另一个方面，即在《德意志意识形态》之后撰写的论著中完全消失的方面，讨论它是否不应被视为理想主义的残余，侵入了唯物史观的第一个更为一致的表述中。马克思多次提到“虚幻的共同体”、“州这种共同体的替代品”、“对个体具有独立性的表面上的共同体（国家、法律）”，从整体上可以非常清楚地看出，这里指的仅仅是早期对黑格尔批判中的复制概念（并且如在《犹太人问题》中独家提出的那样），而不提出这个理论在新前提下——生产力和生产关系之间的矛盾作为历史运动的驱动力——是否可以维持的问题。不过，在这个背景下，必须指出《德意志意识形态》整体上的不一致性。我们已经提到马克思试图用资产阶级社会的范畴来把握历史过程，但在这个背景中引入的生产力与交通形式之间的矛盾仍然停留在纯粹的说辞上。当马克思承认：“我们迄今从生产工具出发，此处已显示出对某些工业阶段所需的私有财产的必要性。在提取性工业中，私有财产与劳动完全一致；在小型工业和所有迄今为止的农业中，财产是现有生产工具的必然后果；在大工业中，生产工具与私有财产之间的矛盾才是它的产物，要生成这种矛盾，它必须已经高度发展。因此，只有与此相伴，私有财产的废除才成为可能。”特别是从这一段可以看出，马克思是从某个特定的历史结果来论证的，而这个结果又与我们已知的历史进程观念相联系，这一观念将历史视为一系列解放的阶梯的接续，其总体结构只能从历史的终点来理解。在对黑格尔国家法的批判中，被解释为个人在资产阶级社会的有限的具体现实中脱离其局限性达到真实共同体——当它们以个体获得权利的形式聚合在一起时，他们能够“接近”自己的真实共同体——这样一种民主社群的有限形态的抽象政治解放过程，现在被转移到生产过程的形态上，并将大工业解释为一种生产方式，在这种方式中，个体从以前生产工具的局限性中解放出来（这种局限性作为相应的交通形式必然产生了私有财产），并且首次能够在完全摆脱所有有限特殊性的前提下自由交往：“在任何早期时期，生产力对个体作为个体的交往都没呈现出这种冷漠形态，因为他们的交往本身还是受限的。另一方面，这些生产力与那些从中剥离的大多数个体相对立，因此被剥夺了所有真实生活内容，成为了抽象的（由我强调，H. R.）个体，但正是通过这种方式，它们才首次能够作为个体相互联系。”正如在早期著作中的特定的解放阶梯成为整体构造的中心，如此在《德意志意识形态》中，这种生产者与生产手段的特殊分离成为解释之前历史进程的决定性起点：特定形式的生产工具伴随着个体交往的特定形式，个体在其中可以继续与自然的互动中发展，直到这种交往形式成为他们的桎梏，他们必须通过社会爆发摆脱它，为一种新形式让路，这种新形式现在必须呈现为自由的状态。这种状态必须被视为自由的状态，只要它适合他们个性的发展——随着生产力的进一步发展，这种新形式也越来越被视为桎梏并最终被摒弃。这一过程以那种生产工具已经达到只能社会性使用的规模的生产方式结束，因此作为小型、非社会性应用生产工具的表达和必要交通形式的私有财产也必须消失。将这一历史构造与实际的历史进程对接，对马克思来说确实不容易，我们在这里不试图追踪马克思的具体表述。我们这里关键要了解马克思如何想象从一种成为桎梏的交通形式到一种更适合个体发展水平的新形式的过渡；因为那是理解《德意志意识形态》中“虚幻共同体”概念的关键：符合生产力并被个体作为自由感知的状态是国家，这个状态被被统治阶级——即不断发展生产力的各个承载者——视为桎梏：“只有在与他人的共同体中，每个个体才有手段从各个方面发展其才能；因此，只有在共同体中个人自由才成为可能。在以往的共同体替代物中，在国家等中，个人自由仅存在于在统治阶级关系中发展的个体中，且仅存在于他们作为这一阶级的个体的范围内。到目前为止，个体联合起来形成的表面上的共同体总是独立于他们之外，并且，由于它是一种阶级对另一阶级的联合，对于被统治阶级来说，它不仅仅是一种完全虚幻的共同体，而且还是一种新的桎梏。在真实的共同体中，个体在其协会中获得他们的自由。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Angesichts dieser kaum vermittelten, noch durchaus mystischen Fassung der Beziehung zwischen Produktivkräften und Produk-tionsverhältnissen mit der Abfolge von Emanzipationsstufen stellt sich allerdings das Problem, ob die Frage nach einer methodisch strengen Ableitung dieses schillernden Begriffs des Staates als einer von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft unterschiedenen Form der Orga-nisation noch ernsthaft diskutiert werden kann. Würde Marx in den Grundrissen nicht explizit die Analogie zwischen der Ableitung der Geldform und der Form des Staates erwähnen, und damit implizit daran erinnern, daß die spezifische Ableitungsform in der Geldtheorie auch im Hinblick auf die Staatstheorie von Bedeutung sein könnte, würde man die wenigen Hinweise in der Deutschen Ideologie kaum unter diesem Aspekt lesen. So heißt es beispielsweise: ». . . und eben aus diesem Widerspruch des besonderen und gemeinschaftlichen Interesses nimmt das gemeinschaftliche Interesse als Staat eine selbständige Gestaltung, getrennt von den wirklichen Einzel- und Gesamtinteressen, an, und zugleich als illusorische Gemeinschaftlichkeit . . .77.« Wird diese Bemerkung nicht vorab unter der ausschließlich emanzipatorischen Perspektive gedeutet, sondern in dem Zusammenhang gesehen, in dem Marx die Konstitution der öffentlichen Gewalt diskutiert - »Das Faktum, daß die herrschende Klasse ihre gemeinschaftliche Herrschaft zur öffentlichen Gewalt, zum Staat konstituiert...78«, oder »Wenn die Bourgeois, überhaupt alle Mitglieder der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft genötigt sind, sich als Wir, als moralische Person, als Staat zu konstituieren, um ihre gemeinschaftlichen Interessen zu sichern . . . 79« - so läßt sich allerdings eine Verbindung zur Darstellungsmethode in der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie herstellen. Der Gedankengang ist dort - in wenigen Worten - folgender: Die Waren müssen als Waren erscheinen. Sie müssen also einen Preis haben, vermöge dessen sie als einheitliche (vor aller quantitativen Verschiedenheit) Ausdrücke einer gesellschaftlichen Einheit erscheinen können. Wie geht nun Marx bei der Ableitung dieser ersten Geldfunktion vor? Die Ware, so führt er zu Beginn aus, ist unmittelbare Einheit von Gebrauchswert und Wert, zweier sich widersprechender Momente, die - eben weil sie in der Form un-mittelbarer Einheit nicht zu existieren vermögen - zur Verdopplung der Ware in Ware und Geld treiben. »Die Ware«, sagt Marx am Ende des ersten Kapitels der Erstauflage des Kapitals, »ist unmittelbare Einheit von Gebrauchswert und Tauschwert, also zweier Entgegengesetzten. Sie ist daher ein unmittelbarer Widerspruch. Dieser Widerspruch muß sich entwickeln, sobald sie nicht wie bisher analytisch . . . betrachtet, sondern als ein Ganzes wirklich auf andere Waren bezogen wird . . . 80.« Nun wird der Bürger von Marx in der Deutschen Ideologie analog und gleichsam als Verlängerung dieses Widerspruchs bis in die Person hinein als ein Doppeltes gesehen, als ein Mensch, dessen Brust zu eng für zwei Herzen ist. »Der Bourgeois verhält sich zu den Institutionen seines Regimes wie der Jude zum Gesetz; er umgeht sie, sooft es tunlich ist, in jedem einzelnen Fall, aber er will, daß alle Andern sie halten. Wenn sämtliche Bourgeois in Masse und auf Einmal die Institutionen der Bourgeois umgingen, so würden sie aufhören, Bourgeois zu sein - ein Verhalten, das ihnen natürlich nicht einfällt und keineswegs von ihrem Wollen und Laufen abhängt. . . 81.« Da jeder Bürger gleich geartet ist wie »alle Andern«, jeder Bürger der Bürger ist, so ist er im beständigen Widerstreit mit sich selbst, bis sich schließlich sein allgemeineres Ich eine besondere Gestalt gibt. Marx sieht das in der Deutschen Ideologie so: »So wenig es von ihrem idealistischen Willen und Willkür abhängt, ob ihre Körper schwer sind, so wenig hängt es von ihm ab, ob sie ihren eignen Willen in der Form des Gesetzes durchsetzen und zugleich von der persönlichen Willkür jedes Einzelnen unter ihnen unabhängig setzen. Ihre persönliche Macht beruht auf Lebensbedingungen, die sich als Vielen gemeinschaftliche entwickeln, deren Fortbestand sie als Herrschende gegen andere und zugleich als für Alle geltende zu behaupten haben. Der Ausdruck dieses durch ihre gemeinschaftlichen Interessen bedingten Willens ist das Gesetz. Gerade das Durchsetzen der voneinander unabhängigen Individuen und ihrer eignen Willen, das auf dieser Basis in ihrem Verhalten gegeneinander notwendig egoistisch ist, macht die Selbstverleugnung im Gesetz und Recht nötig. Selbstverleugnung im Ausnahmefall, Selbstbehauptung ihrer Interessen im Durchschnittsfall. . . 82.« Leider hat es mit diesen Hinweisen in der Deutschen Ideologie, sofern man sie vorwiegend unter systematischen Gesichtspunkten liest, sein Bewenden. Gleichwohl stellt sie, auch dem Marxschen Selbstverständnis nach, den Abschluß des Frühwerks dar: entschei-dende Theoreme der neuen Geschichtsauffassung sind formuliert - die weitere Arbeit, so scheint es jedenfalls, kann nur in ihrer »Anwendung« und Präzisierung bestehen. An dieser Stelle müssen wir allerdings betonen, daß nur dann von einem ernsthaften Versuch einer Rekonstruktion marxistischer Staatstheorie gesprochen werden kann, wenn ein zentrales Postulat der Dialektik nicht unerörtert bleibt: daß nämlich ein wesentliches Verhältnis zwischen Methode und Inhalt besteht. Dadurch eröffnet sich zugleich die Möglichkeit, Rekonstruktion nicht nur durch das Zusammenstellen der vielfältigen expliziten Äußerungen über den Staat verbürgt zu sehen (und eventuell resignieren zu müssen, wenn sich diese als zu arm erweisen), sondern anhand methodologischer Hinweise extrapolierend den Weg zu zeigen, der bei diesem Versuch einzuschlagen ist. Doch was heißt hier wesentliches Verhältnis von Inhalt und Methode? Ist das nicht ein Zusammenhang, der ohnehin nur um den Preis des Idealismus einzukaufen ist? Im Marxschen Frühwerk, insbesondre in der Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts, war dies zweifelsohne der Fall. Marx kritisiert Hegels Verfahrensweise als Vortäuschung einer »Ableitung und Entwicklung«, als eine Methode, die als fertig Vorausgesetzte an ihr äußerliche Inhalte herangetragen wird, statt auf die »Logik der Sache« selbst einzugehen, doch er unterläßt es, uns positive Auskunft zu geben. Aus dem Zusammenhang geht jedoch hevor, daß Marx unter »Ableitung und Entwicklung« kaum anderes denkt als die theoretische Nachzeichnung der Logik des geschichtlichen Emanzipationsprozesses der Menschheit, die Entwicklung hin zur Demokratie. Mit der Einsicht in die Bedeutung des Arbeitsprozesses für den Geschichtsverlauf bricht diese idealistische Position auf und weicht einer, wie wir sie genannt haben, materialistischen Spekulation. Ein überdehnter Begriff bürgerlicher Gesellschaft soll im Kontext einer globalen Geschichtskonzeption den jeweiligen institutionellen Rahmen bezeichnen, der durch den Entwicklungsstand der Produktivkräfte bedingt ist. »Die durch die auf allen bisherigen geschichtlichen Stufen vorhandenen Produktionskräfte bedingte und sie wiederum bedingende Verkehrsform ist die bürgerliche Gesellschaft. . . 83«, heißt es in der Deutschen Ideologie. Die abgelaufene Geschichte wird - vom Resultat her konstruiert - als Geschichte der sich entwickelnden Produktivkräfte interpretiert, die - in ihrer abnehmenden Borniertheit, oder positiv, zunehmenden Gesellschaftlichkeit — mit einer ihnen entsprechenden Verkehrsfern einhergehen. Dieser Verallgemeinerung einiger aus der bisherigen Auseinandersetzung mit dem bürgerlichen Denken gewonnener Theoreme zu einer universellen Geschichtstheorie, die mit einer Konzeption des Arbeitsprozesses »verkoppelt« wird, dem auf dieser Entwicklungsstufe der materialistischen Theorie ausschließlich die vorwärtstreibende Kraft zugesprochen wird, entspricht eine Akzentverschiebung im Begriff der Methode. Dem Hegel-Kritiker Marx konnte zur Zeit seiner Auseinandersetzung mit der Rechtsphilosophie die empirische Geschichtsschreibung als ein sekundäres Problem erscheinen (wir wissen, daß er Hegels Beschreibung der Empirie als angemessene Wiedergabe akzeptierte), methodisch belangvoll wurde sie erst, wenn es galt, die darin waltende Vernunft zu entdecken und in ihrer widersprüchlichen Beziehung zur unangemessenen Existenz als treibendes Prinzip, als »Logik der Sache« adäquat zu »entwickeln«. In der Deutschen Ideologie sieht es anders aus. Wenngleich nicht säuberlich auszumachen ist, was in dieser Schrift der Zurückweisung abstrakt-junghegelianischer Spekulation zuzuschreiben ist und was als Weiterentwicklung des eigenen Selbstverständnisses gedeutet werden muß, ist die Überbetonung detailliert empirischen Vorgehens charakteristisch für diese Periode. ”翻译为中文","output":"在生产力与生产关系之间以及解放阶段相继的关系尚未得到充分调和、仍然充满神秘色彩的表述面前，的确存在一个问题：关于一个系统性严格推导出这一闪烁不定的概念——国家作为与资产阶级社会不同的组织形式的可能性，是否还能被认真讨论。如果马克思在《 Grundrisse》中没有明确提到金钱形式和国家形式之间的类比，从而暗示了在金钱理论的特定推导形式对国家理论可能同样重要，我们可能很难从这个角度阅读《德意志意识形态》中的零星提示。例如，书中提到：“...正是由于特殊与共同利益的这一矛盾，共同利益作为国家获得了独立的形态，与真实的个体和集体利益相分隔，并同时作为虚幻的共同体...”。如果这一评论不是预先仅从解放的视角来解释，而是放在马克思讨论公共权力构成的背景中 - “统治阶级将他们的共同统治构建为公共权力、即国家...”，或是“当资产阶级，事实上所有资产阶级社会的成员都被迫作为我们、作为道德人、作为国家来构建自己，以保障他们的共同利益...” - 那么确实可以与《政治经济学批判》中的表现方法建立联系。那里的论述——简而言之——是这样的：商品必须作为商品出现。因此，它们必须有一个价值，通过这个价值它们能作为社会统一的统一表达出现，而不管数量上的不同。那么马克思是如何推导这个金钱的第一个功能的呢？他在开头指出，商品是使用价值和价值的直接统一体，是两个相反因素的统一，就因为它们以直接统一体的形式存在是不可能的，它们促成了商品向商品和货币的分裂。“商品”，马克思在《资本论》第一卷首版的最后说，“是使用价值和交换价值的直接统一，因此是两个对立面。它因此是一个直接的矛盾。这个矛盾必须发展，一旦它不像以往那样被分析考察，而是真正地关联到其他商品上...”现在，马克思在《德意志意识形态》中将资产阶级描绘为具有相似的并延伸到个人内部的矛盾，作为一种双重性，作为一个胸中不能容纳两颗心的人。“资产者对待他的政权机构就像犹太人对待法律一样；他尽可能在每个单独的案例中绕过它们，但他希望所有其他人都遵守它们。如果所有资产者群体一起和同时绕开资产者的机构，他们就不再是资产者了——这种做法他们自然不会想到，也绝不取决于他们的意愿和努力...”由于每个公民都像“所有其他人”一样，每个公民都是公民，因此他不断与自己冲突，直到他的更普遍的我给自己一个特殊的形式。马克思在《德意志意识形态》中这样看：“他们的身体之重不取决于他们的理想主义意愿和任性，他们是否以法律的形式强制执行自己的意愿，同时使之独立于他们每个人的个人任性，也不取决于此。他们的个人权力基于生活条件，这些条件作为许多人的共同发展，他们作为统治者需要设法维持它们，同时作为适用于所有人的条件。这种由他们的共同利益决定的意愿的表达是法律。正是独立个体及其自己的意愿之间的相互行为在这基础上必然自私的实现，促成了在法律和权利中的自我否定需要。在特殊情况下自我否定，而在一般情况下维护他们的利益...” 遗憾的是，如果主要从系统性的角度来阅读《德意志意识形态》中的这些提示，事情就到此为止了。然而，按照马克思本人的理解，这本书确实标志着早期作品的结束：新的历史观的关键理论已经形成——接下来的工作，看起来，只能在它们的“应用”和精确化中进行。然而，我们必须强调，只有当不忽略辩证法的一个核心假设——方法和内容之间存在本质关系——时，才能谈论对马克思主义国家理论的认真尝试重构。这同时为重构打开了可能性，不仅仅通过汇编关于国家的各种明确表述来保证（并且可能需要放弃，如果这些证明是太贫乏的），而是通过方法论提示来推测此尝试应当遵循的道路。但是，方法和内容之间的本质关系是什么意思呢？难道这不是一个只能以理想主义的代价才能建立起来的关系吗？在马克思的早期作品中，特别是在对黑格尔国家法的批判中，这无疑是这样的。马克思批评黑格尔的处理方法作为“推导和发展”的假象，作为一种将预设的内容强加于外在内容的方法，而不是深入“事物本身的逻辑”，但他没有给我们提供正面的信息。然而，从上下文可以看出，马克思所想的“推导和发展”与其理论重现人类历史解放进程的逻辑、向民主发展的过程没有什么不同。随着对劳动过程对历史进程的重要性的理解的深入，这种理想主义立场被打破，并被我们所称的唯物主义推测所取代。在全球历史概念的背景下，一个被过度扩展的资产阶级社会概念应当指示受生产力发展水平影响的各种制度框架。“...到目前为止历史上所有阶段上存在的生产力所决定和反过来又决定它们的交通形式是资产阶级社会...”，《德意志意识形态》中这样说。过去的历史——从结果来构建——被解释为发展中的生产力的历史，它们——在其日益减少的局限性，或者积极地说，日益增长的社会性——伴随着与之相应的交通形式。这一对从与资产阶级思想的之前争执中获得的一些理论的概括为一种普遍的历史理论，与一个“联系在一起”的劳动过程观念相结合，这个劳动过程在这一唯物主义理论发展阶段被赋予了唯一的推动力，这对方法概念的重视发生了变化。在与法哲学争论时期的黑格尔批评者马克思看来，经验历史编纂作为一个次要问题似乎是合理的（我们知道，他接受了黑格尔对经验的描述作为合适的再现），方法上它变得重要是在发现其中的理性并以其与不适当的存在的矛盾关系作为驱动原理，作为“事务的逻辑”来适当地“发展”。在《德意志意识形态》中情况看起来不同。尽管无法清楚地区分这部著作中是对抽象的青年黑格尔主义思潮的拒绝还是自我理解的进一步发展，但强调详细的经验性做法对这一时期是特征性的。"},{"instruction":"请将“Der frühere Begriff der »Entwicklung und Ableitung« weicht hier der Darstellung des gesamten Entwicklungsprozesses der Menschheit, dessen Ablauf nun zentral bestimmt erscheint vor allem durch die sich verändernden Produktionsinstrumente - ein Sachverhalt, dessen Gesamtdarstellung ohne akribisches Studium der Empirie kaum möglich scheint. Daß er die von der Darstellung unterschiedene Kurzfassung der materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung als Zusammenfassung einiger »Abstraktionen« apostrophiert, ist dabei kein Zufall: mit der Entdeckung des wirklichen Motors der Geschichte kann der, jeglicher in der Geschichte waltenden »immanenten Vernunft« abschwörende, nur noch »wirkliche, positive Wissenschaft« 84 betreibende Materialist Marx lediglich Produkte abstrahierender Denktätigkeit sehen - verständige Abstraktionen, die - abgezogen von der wirklichen Geschichte - »keinen anderen Wert« haben als »die Ordnung des geschichtlichen Materials zu erleichtern, die Reihenfolge seiner einzelnen Schichten anzudeuten« 85. Eine nachträgliche Korrektur dieser - in einer ohnehin unver-öffentlichten Schrift formulierten - Auffassung hat Marx nicht vorgenommen. Vielmehr findet sie sich sinngemäß in verschiedenen programmatischen Äußerungen, die Marx auch nach der Nie-derschrift des Rohentwurfs des Kapitals abfaßte, ohne darauf ein-zugehen, daß er mit dieser ersten systematischen Fassung der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie eine Logik der Kapitalentfaltung nach-vollzogen hat, die - soweit es die Motorik des geschichtlichen Prozesses betrifft - mit den früheren Vorstellungen nicht mehr bruchlos in Übereinstimmung zu bringen sind. Diese veränderte Auffassung läßt sich an der modifizierten Bedeutung des Begriffs der Darstellung ablesen, die, wie man zuerst vermuten könnte, etwa jenen methodologischen Status angewiesen erhält, der früher den »Abstraktionen« zukam. Das »Kapital im Allgemeinen«, als dessen Darstellung sich das ökonomiekritische Spätwerk nahezu aus-schließlich erweist, erscheint, wie er im Rohentwurf sagt, zuerst »nur als eine Abstraktion« 86, welche spezifische Differenzen des Kapitals im Unterschied zu anderen Formen des Reichtums entwickelt; bei genauerem Hinsehen zeigt sich jedoch, daß sich hinter dieser Abstraktion mehr und anderes verbirgt als das Produkt eines in der Dialektik nicht sonderlich hoch geschätzten verständigen Denkens: es ist der theoretische Nachvollzug der »negativen Vernünftigkeit« des Kapitalismus, die adäquate begriffliche Verarbeitung einer wirklichen Subjekt-Objekt-Verkehrung, die in ihrer Gesamtheit selbst eine durch menschliches Handeln vermittelte Systematik von Abstraktionen darstellt, in der sich ein Produziertes, der Wert, das Geld, zu einem Ersten verkehrt und den Stoffwechsel zwischen Mensch und Natur und die Beziehungen zwischen den Menschen selber noch strukturiert. Wenn Widerspiegelungstheoreme sinnvoll im Rahmen des Marxschen Materialismus diskutiert werden sollen ohne sich gleich dem Vorwurf des naiven Realismus aussetzen zu wollen, dann kann es nur in diesem Zusammenhang geschehen; bezeichnenderweise charakterisiert Marx den Kapitalbegriff als »abstraktes Gegenbild« 87 des wirklichen Kapitals, die dialektische Methode ist die Darstellung der machthabenden Abstraktion einer von den Menschen hervorgebrachten Objektivität, die theoretische Nachzeichnung einer verkehrten Welt aus ihren Ursprüngen bis hin zu ihren zentralen Gesetzlichkeiten. Im Gegensatz zum Frühwerk unterscheidet Marx in der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie streng zwischen zwei gesellschaftlichen Strukturprinzipien: bürgerlichen und vorbürgerlichen. Bei aller Mannigfaltigkeit vorbürgerlicher Gesellschaftsformationen kann er sie negativ - Engels prägte für diesen Sachverhalt den Ausdruck negative politische Ökonomie - abheben, indem er darauf hinweist, daß nur in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft der Reichtum eine von seiner konkreten Naturalform unterschiedene gesellschaftliche Form annimmt. Mit anderen Worten: nur in dieser Gesellschaft wird den Menschen ihre eigne Vergesellschaftung buchstäblich gegenständlich - »ihre eigne gesellschaftliche Bewegung«, so heißt es im berühmten Abschnitt über den Fetischcharakter der Ware, »besitzt für sie die Form einer Bewegung von Sachen, unter deren Kontrolle sie stehen, statt sie zu kontrollieren« 88. Die Wissenschaft darf sich daher nicht darauf beschränken, die Gesetzlichkeiten des gesellschaftlichen Reproduktionsprozesses in und hinter dieser verselbständigten Eigenbewegung von Sachen zu entdecken, sondern hat darüber hinaus zu zeigen, warum sich menschliche Beziehungen überhaupt in der Form einer, wie Marx es nennt, gespenstigen Dinghaftigkeit, einer abstrakten Wertgegenständlichkeit darstellen. Wiewohl uns Marx keine Definition der materialistischen Dialektik hinterläßt, geht man sicherlich nicht an seinem späteren Selbstverständnis vorbei, wenn man die Feststellung trifft, daß das Kapital die Definition der Dialektik ist; so wenig es - überspitzt formuliert - möglich ist, eine kürzere Definition des Kapitals zu formulieren als wir sie in diesen drei Bänden vorfinden, kürzer geht es nicht - so wenig ist es möglich, die materialistische Dialektik abgelöst von ihrer inhaltlichen Durchführung zu definieren: sie ist die Methode der Darstellung dieser sich zu immer neuen Gestaltungen abstrakter Gegenständlichkeit verdinglichenden gesellschaftlichen Beziehungen in ihrer Eigengesetzlichkeit, die schließlich den gesamten Stoffwechsel zwischen Mensch und Natur umfaßt und strukturiert. Es ist dies ein Materialismusbegriff, der erhebliche Veränderungen und Präzisierungen gegenüber der Konzeption im Frühwerk aufweist. Bezeichnenderweise erbringen gerade Forschungsvorhaben, die sich an programmatischen Äußerungen über das Verhältnis von Produktivkräften und Produktionsverhältnissen im Sinne der Deutschen Ideologie orientieren, insbesondre für vorbürgerliche Formationen detailliert begründete Belege für bestimmte Zusammenhänge dieser Art89; bei der Analyse der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft hingegen scheint dieser Ansatz zu versagen. Beim Nachvollzug der kategorialen Darstellung zeigt sich auch, daß Marx anders verfährt: als bestimmende Dynamik wird die Logizi- tät der Wertentwicklung gesehen, der Übergang des in der Sphäre der Zirkulation entspringenden Kapitals in jene der Produktion, wobei Marx die logische Darstellung zugleich als kategorialen Ausdruck eines in der Geschichte ablaufenden Prozesses betrachtet: »Diese Bewegung erscheint in verschiednen Gestalten, sowohl historisch als zur Wertproduzierenden Arbeit führend, wie auch andrerseits, innerhalb des Systems der bürgerlichen, d. h. der Tauschwert setzenden Produktion selbst90.« Nicht unähnlich dem Hegelsehen Weltgeist (den der junge Marx schon als Hieroglyphe für den Weltmarkt bezeichnet), breitet sich diese Kapitalbewegung aus und bemächtigt sich überkommener Gesellschaftsformationen, die sie nach eigener »Logik« umstrukturiert: »Wenn im vollendeten bürgerlichen System jedes ökonomische Verhältnis das andre in der bürgerlich-ökonomischen Form voraussetzt und so jedes Gesetzte zugleich Voraussetzung ist, so ist das mit jedem organischen System der Fall, Dies organische System selbst als Totalität hat seine Voraussetzungen, und seine Entwicklung zur Totalität besteht eben darin, alle Elemente der Gesellschaft sich unterzuordnen, oder die ihm noch fehlenden Organe aus ihr heraus zu schaffen. Es wird so historisch zur Totalität. Das Werden zu dieser Totalität bildet ein Moment seines Prozesses, seiner Entwicklung 91.« Das ist nicht im Sinne eines gradlinig verlaufenden Prozesses aufzufassen, der mit innerer Notwendigkeit zum industriellen Kapitalismus führt - sonst hätte, wie Marx ausführt, das »alte Rom, Byzanz etc. mit freier Arbeit und Kapital seine Geschichte geendet oder vielmehr eine neue Geschichte begonnen. Auch dort war die Auflösung der alten Eigentumsverhältnisse verknüpft mit Entwicklung des Geldvermögens, des Handels etc. Aber statt zur Industrie, führte diese Auflösung in fact zur Herrschaft des Landes über die Stadt92.« Marx begreift vielmehr die geschichtliche Entwicklung als wiederholt einsetzenden Prozeß, der nur unter bestimmten Bedingungen zum industriellen Kapitalismus führt: »Dies ist, was man die zivilisierende Wirkung des auswärtigen Handels nennt. Es hängt dann ab, teils von der Intensität dieser Wirkung von außen, teils von dem Grade, worin die Elemente der inländischen Produktion - Teilung der Arbeit etc. - schon entwickelt sind, inwieweit die Tauschwert setzende Bewegung das Ganze der Produktion angreift. In England z. B. im 16. Jahrhundert und Anfang des 17. macht die Einfuhr der niederländischen Waren das Surplus von Wolle, das England im Austausch zu geben, wesentlich entscheidend.”翻译为中文","output":"这里的“发展与衍生”的早期概念让位于对人类整个发展过程的描述，这一过程现在似乎主要由变化的生产工具所决定 - 这一事实的全面描述似乎离不开对实证研究的严密研究。他将唯物史观的简明表述作为一些“抽象概念”的总结，这并非偶然：随着历史的真正动力的发现，完全拒绝历史中“内在理性”的、只从事“真实、积极科学”的唯物主义者马克思，只能看到抽象思维的产物 - 明智的抽象，这些抽象一旦从真实历史中抽离，“其它价值就没有了，除了为整理历史材料提供便利，指示其各个层次的顺序”。 马克思没有对这一观点进行事后修正，这一观点是在一个本来就未发表的著作中表达的。相反，这一点在他在《资本论》草稿之后撰写的各种规划性声明中有所体现，而不考虑他用这一政治经济学批判的第一次系统表述所遵循的资本展开逻辑 - 至少就历史过程的动力机制而言 - 与早期观念不再完全一致。这种改变的观念可以从“表述”概念的改变的含义中看出，这种含义可能首先被认为是之前“抽象”所具有的那种方法论地位。正如他在草稿中所说，“资本一般”，作为其经济批判晚期著作几乎唯一的表述对象，起初“只是一个抽象概念”，它发展了资本与其他形式财富的特定差异；但仔细看来，这种抽象背后隐藏的不仅仅是简单认知中不被特别重视的产物：它是对资本主义的“负面理性”的理论性追溯，是对真实的主体-对象颠倒的恰当概念处理，整体上它自身呈现为人类行为介导的抽象系统，在此系统中，产出物、价值、货币被置于首位，还构造了人与自然的物质交换以及人与人之间的关系。如果要在马克思的唯物主义框架内有意义地讨论反映论，而不想立即被指责为朴素现实主义，那么只能在这个背景下进行；马克思特意将资本概念描述为真实资本的“抽象反面图像”，辩证法是对由人类创造的客观性的强势抽象的表达，是对颠倒的世界从其起源到其中心规律的理论性描述。 与早期作品相比，马克思在政治经济学批判中严格区分了两种社会结构原则：资产阶级和前资产阶级原则。尽管前资产阶级社会形态多种多样，他可以通过指出，只有在资产阶级社会中，财富才具有与其具体自然形态不同的社会形式这一点来从负面区分它们 - 恩格斯为这一现象创造了“负面政治经济学”这一表达。换句话说，只有在这种社会中，人们的社会化活动才以事物的运动形式变得具体化，“对他们来说，他们自己的社会活动具有物的运动的形式，是控制着他们而不是被他们控制的”。因此，科学不应局限于发现社会再生产过程的规律性，在这种自发的事物运动之中和之后，它还必须显示出为何人类关系会以一种所谓幽灵般的物质性、一种抽象的价值客体形式出现。虽然马克思没有留下唯物辩证法的定义，但如果我们认为资本定义了辩证法，这并不是对他后期自我理解的偏离；就像我们无法用比这三卷书更短的定义来表述资本一样——无法更简短了——我们也无法脱离其内容实现来定义唯物辩证法：它是那种把社会关系以逐渐具体化为抽象客体形式的自主法则表现出来的方法，这最终涵盖并构造了人与自然的整个物质交换。这是一种唯物论概念，相较于早期作品中的构想，它表现出了重大变化和精确化。值得注意的是，那些以德意志意识形态中关于生产力与生产关系关系的规划性声明为导向的研究项目，尤其是对于前资产阶级形态，为这种特定联系提供了详细的证据；然而，在对资产阶级社会的分析中，这种方法似乎失效了。在跟踪类别表述时，也显示出马克思采取了不同的做法：作为决定性动力的是价值发展的逻辑性，资本从流通领域过渡到生产领域，马克思将逻辑表述同时视为对历史过程中发生的过程的类别表达：“这一运动以不同的形式出现，既有历史上导致价值生产性劳动的形式，也有在资产阶级生产系统内自身，即置换价值生产的形式内的形式。” 马克思所理解的历史发展不是一种线性发展过程，即不是内在必然性导致工业资本主义——否则，如马克思所述，“古罗马、拜占庭等就会以自由劳动和资本结束其历史，或者说开始一段新历史。那里旧的财产关系的解体也与货币财富、贸易等的发展相关。但这种解体事实上导致了农村对城市的统治，而不是导致工业。”马克思更多地看到历史发展作为一个反复启动的过程，只在特定条件下才会导向工业资本主义：“这就是所谓外贸的文明作用。这取决于外界影响的强度，部分也取决于国内生产要素——劳动分工等——已经发展到何种程度，置换价值运动在多大程度上影响了整个生产。例如，在16世纪和17世纪初的英国，荷兰商品的进口使英国在交换中给出的羊毛过剩变得至关重要。”"},{"instruction":"Эти люди разговаривают- переведи на корейский используя неформальный вежливый стиль и грамматику V -는 중이다","output":"이 사람들이 대화하고 있어요."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

the procedures of angioplasty and stent replacement need to be repeated","output":"The need for repeating procedures like angioplasty or stent placement varies greatly from one individual to another, depending on factors like the reason for the initial procedure, the type of stent used, the patient's lifestyle, and how well they follow post-procedure recommendations regarding medication, diet, and exercise. # Angioplasty Alone For angioplasty without stent placement (which is less common today), the arteries can re-narrow (a process called restenosis) within 6 months after the procedure. However, the advent of stent placement has greatly improved the durability of angioplasty. # Stent Placement **Bare-Metal Stents (BMS):** Early versions of stents, known as bare-metal stents, have a higher rate of restenosis compared to newer drug-eluting stents. With bare-metal stents, restenosis requiring a repeat procedure occurs in about 15% to 30% of cases, most often within the first 6 months. **Drug-Eluting Stents (DES):** These stents release medication that helps prevent the artery from getting blocked again. The rate of restenosis with drug-eluting stents is significantly lower, around 5% to 10%, and when it does occur, it may happen over a longer period than with bare-metal stents. **Lifestyle Factors:** It's also essential to consider that the underlying causes of the artery blockage, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking, need to be managed to prevent new blockages in the stented artery or elsewhere. Patients who make lifestyle changes and faithfully take prescribed medications (such as antiplatelet drugs) to prevent blood clots around the stent can have better outcomes. # Long-Term Outlook Most modern stents, especially drug-eluting ones, are designed to last a lifetime. The goal of these stents is not only to physically keep the artery open but also to promote good healing of the artery around the stent, minimizing the chance of the artery getting narrow again. The need for another procedure can also be dictated by the development of blockages in different arteries or the progression of disease within the same artery but outside the treated segment. Because heart disease is a chronic condition, a key component to extending the life of any treatment is continual management of risk factors. Patients should work closely with their healthcare providers to monitor their heart health and take any prescribed medications as directed. Regular checkups can help identify new or recurring blockages before they become serious, potentially reducing the need for additional procedures."},{"instruction":"When you said \\" it may happen over a longer period than with bare-metal stents\\", what do you mean be by \\"longer period\\"? Please illustrate with numbers","output":"Apologies for any confusion. To clarify regarding the timing and comparison between bare-metal stents (BMS) and drug-eluting stents (DES): # Bare-Metal Stents (BMS) - **Restenosis Period**: With bare-metal stents, the process of restenosis (the re-narrowing of the artery) typically occurs within the first 6 months after the procedure. The majority of cases that are going to happen will manifest during this time frame due to the rapid growth of neointimal tissue inside the stent. # Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) - **Restenosis Period**: For drug-eluting stents, the medication released by the stent reduces the speed of tissue growth that could block the artery again. This means that restenosis, if it happens, usually occurs at a slower pace compared to BMS. While significant reductions in restenosis rates are seen—down to 5% to 10% from the 15% to 30% of BMS—the time frame for observing potential restenosis could extend beyond the first 6 months and may occur over a period of several years. The critical difference is that the incidence rate is lower, and the onset of possible restenosis is more gradual due to the medication's effect on inhibiting cell proliferation. # Illustration with Numbers: - **BMS Restenosis**: Most cases of restenosis occur within **0-6 months** post-procedure. - **DES Restenosis**: Reduced rate of restenosis that may extend gradually over a period beyond 6 months, significantly lowering within the first year but still possible over **several years** post-implantation. It is important to note that while DES are associated with a lower risk of restenosis, they require a longer duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis, a serious complication where a blood clot forms inside the stent. The exact duration of DAPT can vary based on the type of stent used, the patient's risk of bleeding, and other individual factors."},{"instruction":"what happened 7 years ago today","output":"As of today, September 28, 2023, seven years ago would be September 28, 2016.

The concept behind MyWikiBiz initially was to provide a platform where users could freely create content that might be considered non-notable or promotional for inclusion in Wikipedia, which has strict guidelines against promotional content and requires subjects to meet a notability criterion. MyWikiBiz was founded by Gregory Kohs in 2006. The site generated some controversy and debate in the Wikipedia community when it was first launched, primarily because Kohs initially offered a paid service where he would create Wikipedia articles on behalf of paying clients. This practice was in conflict with Wikipedia's policies against paid editing without disclosure and against creating promotional content. Following the controversy, MyWikiBiz shifted its model away from directly editing Wikipedia and focused more on allowing users to create their content on its platform. The site positions itself as a more inclusive alternative for content that might not meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines.

By minimizing this discrepancy, the network learns to adjust its parameters, thereby approximating the generated shape to the target shape as closely as possible. In tasks such as medical image segmentation and other shape generation tasks, the choice of an appropriate loss function directly impacts network performance. In this study, we have opted for the DICE loss function as the primary training loss function. DICE loss, a statistical tool for assessing the similarity between two samples, is particularly suited for dealing with imbalanced datasets, such as the imbalance between positive and negative samples in medical image segmentation. This loss function measures the similarity between the generated shape and the target shape by calculating the ratio of twice the intersection of the samples to the union of the samples. The advantage of utilizing DICE loss lies in its direct focus on the overlapping areas between shapes, making it highly suitable for shape alignment and matching tasks. Moreover, DICE loss facilitates overcoming the class imbalance issue by optimizing the model performance considering all positive samples (that is, the pixels or voxels of the target shape) rather than just the number of correctly classified samples. This feature renders DICE loss an ideal choice for medical image segmentation, especially in the precise identification of tissue or organ boundaries. In summary, the use of the DICE loss function enables the network to focus more on the spatial alignment and pixel-level similarity between the generated and target shapes during the training process, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy and robustness in shape generation tasks."},{"instruction":"使用adam优化器来优化网络魔性的参数，初始学习率设置为0.0001，每个epoch之后学习率按照一定比例进行衰减。Weight decay设置为0.001，以限制网络参数。 请帮我学术化 扩充这段话并且学术化的进行翻译（附上中文）","output":"In the process of optimizing the parameters of a neural network model, the Adam optimizer is employed due to its adaptive learning rate abilities, which can significantly improve the convergence speed and stability of model training. Initially, the learning rate is set to a value of 0.0001, striking a balance between the rate of convergence and the risk of overshooting the minimum of the loss function. To further refine the model's training process and ensure a smooth convergence trajectory, the learning rate undergoes a proportional decay after each epoch. This approach allows the optimizer to make large adjustments to the weights at the early stages of training, where the error is likely to be larger, and progressively smaller adjustments as the model begins to converge, thereby preventing oscillations or divergences in the loss landscape. Additionally, a weight decay regularization term with a coefficient of 0.001 is integrated into the loss function to mitigate the risk of overfitting. This regularization technique, also known as L2 regularization, imposes a penalty on the magnitude of the network parameters, encouraging the model to maintain smaller weight values. By doing so, it effectively reduces the model's complexity, making it more generalized and less likely to fit the noise in the training data, thus enhancing the model's predictive performance on unseen data. By meticulously calibrating the learning rate and employing weight decay regularization, we aim to foster a training environment that promotes robust learning, minimizes overfitting, and ensures that the optimized network parameters yield high generalization capabilities. --- 在优化神经网络模型参数的过程中，本研究采用Adam优化器，原因在于其能够自适应地调整学习率，显著提高模型训练的收敛速度和稳定性。初始学习率被设置为0.0001，这一设置旨在平衡收敛速度与超越损失函数最小值风险之间的关系。为了进一步精炼模型的训练流程并确保平滑的收敛轨迹，学习率在每个训练周期（epoch）之后按一定比例衰减。此方法允许优化器在训练初期进行较大的权重调整——在此阶段，误差可能较大，随着模型开始收敛，逐步减小调整幅度，从而防止在损失函数的变化景观中出现振荡或发散。 此外，通过将权重衰减正则化项的系数设置为0.001，集成到损失函数中以限制网络参数过度拟合的风险。这种正则化技巧也称为L2正则化，它通过对网络参数的大小施加惩罚，鼓励模型保持较小的权值。如此操作有效降低了模型的复杂度，使其更具泛化性，减少对训练数据噪声的拟合，从而提高对未见数据的预测性能。 通过精密调整学习率并采用权重衰减正则化，我们旨在促进一个促进稳健学习、最小化过度拟合并确保优化后的网络参数具有高泛化能力的训练环境。"},{"instruction":"我现在需要画网络模型结构图（学术论文），请帮我推荐合适的网站和软件","output":"为了绘制学术论文中的网络模型结构图，您需要的软件或网站应该能够支持精准而清晰的图形表达，以准确展示模型的各个层级和连接。下面列出了一些常用的工具，这些可以帮助您创建专业的网络模型结构图： 1. **Graphviz**：Graphviz是一款强大的图形可视化软件，通过DOT语言描述图形，适合绘制复杂网络结构图。它支持多种输出格式，包括PDF、PNG等，非常适合用来创建学术论文中的模型结构图。 2. **draw.io（现改名为diagrams.net）**：draw.io是一个免费的在线图表制作工具，支持多种图表类型，包括流程图和网络结构图等。它直观易用，支持导出多种格式，非常适合没有编程背景的研究人员。 3. **Microsoft Visio**：作为Microsoft Office套件的一部分，Visio是一个专业的图表绘制工具，它提供了丰富的形状库和模板，适合绘制精细的网络模型结构图。Visio支持高度自定义和细节调整，适合需要详尽展示模型内部结构的场合。 4. **Lucidchart**：Lucidchart是一个云端绘图工具，提供了丰富的模板和形状库来帮助用户快速绘制网络结构图。它支持团队协作，非常适合团队项目。此外，Lucidchart也支持导入和导出Visio文件。 5. **LaTeX with TikZ/PGF package**：如果您熟悉LaTeX，可以使用TikZ包来创建高质量的科学图表。TikZ是LaTeX的一个宏包，允许用户生成矢量图形，特别适合于需要在论文中插入图形的学术工作。TikZ绘图相对复杂，但能够提供极高的自由度和精确控制。 选择哪个工具取决于您的具体需求、预算、以及是否希望在线协作。例如，如果您希望免费并简单地在线创建图表，draw.io是一个好选项；如果您需要一个功能更为全面的解决方案并且不介意付费，Visio或Lucidchart可能是更好的选择；如果您是LaTeX用户并且追求高度自定义的图表，TikZ是最佳选择。"},{"instruction":"人工智能 论文 结构图 模版网站","output":"在准备人工智能相关的学术论文时，设计清晰且专业的结构图对于展示研究结果和解释模型架构非常关键。虽然创建这些图形可能看起来挑战重重，但有许多资源和模板网站可以帮助简化这个过程。以下是一些提供人工智能论文结构图模板或可用于创建这类图形的推荐资源： 1. **draw.io (diagrams.net)** - 网站: [https://www.diagrams.net/](https://www.diagrams.net/) - 简介: draw.io是一个免费的、基于web的图形编辑工具，提供了丰富的图形和图表模板，包括用于软件架构和系统设计的模板。用户可以直接在浏览器中使用它来创建各种图形，包括复杂的人工智能模型结构图。 2. **Lucidchart** - 网站: [https://www.lucidchart.com/](https://www.lucidchart.com/) - 简介: Lucidchart是一款强大的在线绘图工具，提供了广泛的模板和设计元素，用于创建专业的图表和图形，包括网络架构、流程图和人工智能模型结构图。它支持在线协作，并且可以导入导出多种格式。 3. **Canva** - 网站: [https://www.canva.com/](https://www.canva.com/) - 简介: Canva是一款图形设计工具，它以其易用性和多样化的设计模板而著称。在Canva中，尽管它不是专为技术图表设计的，但您可以通过调整现有模板或使用设计元素来创建简洁的人工智能模型结构图和其他科学图表。 4. **Overleaf (使用TikZ库)** - 网站: [https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/) - 简介: Overleaf是一个基于LaTeX的在线协作写作和出版系统。借助TikZ库，用户可以创建高质量的图形和结构图。虽然TikZ学习曲线较陡，但它能提供极高的自定义能力，非常适合制作学术论文中的复杂结构图。 5. **Microsoft Visio** - 简介: 虽然Microsoft Visio不是一个免费工具，也不基于网页，但它是一款非常强大的图表和流程图设计软件，提供了大量的模板和设计工具，用于创建详细的结构图和架构图。对于有Visio许可的用户，这是创建复杂人工智能模型结构图的一个优选。 使用这些工具和网站，即使是对设计不太熟悉的研究人员和学生也能创建出既专业又引人注目的人工智能论文结构图。选择最适合您需求的平台，可以极大地提升您论文的表现力和专业度。"},{"instruction":"Who is ljucpo in wikipedia?","output":"As of my last knowledge update in September 2023, there is no notable reference or topic on Wikipedia specifically identified as \\"ljucpo\\".

Die Agrikultur ward an gewissen Punkten selbst rein durch die Zirkulation bestimmt, in Tauschwert setzende Produktion verwandelt. Damit wurde die Produktionsweise nicht nur verändert, sondern alle alten Populationsund Produktionsverhältnisse, ökonomische Verhältnisse, die ihr entsprachen, aufgelöst. So war der Zirkulation hier vorausgesetzt eine Produktion, die nur als Überschuß Tauschwerte schuf; aber sie ging zurück in eine Produktion, die nur noch mit Beziehung auf die Zirkulation stattfand, in Tauschwerte als ihren ausschließlichen Inhalt setzende Produktion93.« Im strikten Gegensatz zur früheren Konzeption werden hier nicht die sich gleichsam naturwüchsig weiter entwickelnden Produktivkräfte als treibendes Moment betrachtet, sondern das Kapital als in einem wörtlichen Sinne Geschichte machende Eigenbewegung, die sich in vorbürgerliche Gesellschaftsformationen hineindrängt, diese auflöst und umformt. Der Entwicklungsstand der Produktivkräfte bildet in diesem Prozeß eine der Voraussetzungen, von denen es abhängt, ob er gelingt oder lediglich die »alte Produktionsweise verelendet« - die Produktionsweise kann die gleiche bleiben, »nur wird sie härter für den Arbeiter« 94. »Wieweit aber dieser Prozeß die alte Produktionsweise aufhebt, wie dies im modernen Europa der Fall war, und ob er an ihrer Stelle die kapitalistische Produktionsweise setzt, hängt ganz von der historischen Entwicklungsstufe und den damit gegebenen Umständen ab 9S.« Aber einmal etabliert, ist es das Kapital selbst, das die Produktivkräfte permanent revolutioniert, ja ohne diese Veränderung selbst nicht existieren könnte. Schon im Rohentwurf des Kapitals weist Marx darauf hin, daß die reelle Subsumtion der Arbeit unters Kapital schließlich zu einer stofflichen Form des Kapitals führt, dessen Daseinsweise - als Maschinerie - dem Begriff des Kapitals entspricht. Die Maschinerie, vom Kapital selbst hervorgebracht, muß folglich auch innerhalb der Darstellung des »Kapitals im Allgemeinen« entwickelt werden: »Das Hereinkommen der Maschinerie zu entwickeln aus der Konkurrenz, und dem von ihr aufgelösten Gesetz der Reduktion der Produktionskosten, ist leicht«, sagt Marx hauptsächlich gegen Ricardos unzureichende methodische Einführung der Maschinerie. »Es handelt sich hier darum, sie aus dem Verhältnis des Kapitals zur lebendigen Arbeit, ohne Rücksicht auf andres Kapital, zu entwickeln 96.« Der hier nur sehr verkürzt wiedergegebene Gedankengang der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie läßt deutlich werden, daß der Marxsche Geschichtsmaterialismus keineswegs schon mit dem Theorem über den Zusammenhang von Produktivkräften und sozialen Verhältnissen zureichend charakterisiert ist, sondern man vielmehr davon auszugehen hat, daß der Materialismus erst dann präzis entfaltet ist, wenn die Differenz zum Idealismus nicht ohne Mühe anzugeben ist. Die von so unterschiedlichen Autoren wie Schumpeter und Rosa Luxemburg als subjektive Zutat bezeichnete, an Hegels Philosophie orientierte Sprache des Marxschen Spätwerks, die für die »eigentliche Substanz« der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie ohne Relevanz sei, ist Ausdruck einer zunehmenden Exaktheit der Einsicht in die Strukturprinzipien der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft. Wenn Marx in der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie bewußt an Hegels Werk anknüpft, so deshalb, weil diese Philosophie gerade wegen ihres absoluten Idealismus der verkehrten Welt des Kapitals gerechter wird, als es sich eine Soziologie auszumalen wagt, die sich auf ihren Realitätssinn so viel zugute hält. Die im Frühwerk unter idealistischem Vorzeichen postulierte Einheit von Methode und Inhalt wird im Kapital wieder praktiziert, diesmal aber als Resultat langjähriger Auseinandersetzung mit einer Form gesellschaftlicher Objektivität, die in ihrer realen Verkehrtheit einem wirklichen Idealismus gleichkommt, dessen theoretische Verarbeitung und Darstellung allein in dieser Weise adäquat erfolgen kann. Aus den Aufbauplänen, die uns erhalten sind, geht hervor, daß die drei Bände des Kapitals nur als Anfang einer umfassenderen Darstellung zu betrachten sind, in der Marx die Objektivität der bürgerlichen Welt, die er in bestimmter Form strukturiert dachte, in ihrer inneren Systematik nachzuzeichnen beabsichtigte. Nicht nur das Kapital selbst, sondern die gesamte Darstellung hat die Kategorien in einer Reihenfolge zu entwickeln, die »bestimmt (ist) durch die Beziehung, die sie in der modernen bürgerlichen Gesellschaft aufeinander haben« 97, in der offensichtlich jede Formbestimmtheit ihren besonderen Stellenwert und Platz hat, den die dialektische Darstellung als theoretischer Nachvollzug der Eigengesetzlichkeit dieser realen Subjekt-Objekt-Verkehrung aufzuspüren vermag. Eine Kritik, die aus diesen Überlegungen die Folgerung ableitet, die gesamte bürgerliche Empirie aus dem Begriff des Kapitals zu deduzieren, argumentiert wie ein Traugott Krug, der vom Idealismus nicht weniger verlangen wollte als ihm seine Schreibfeder a priori zu konstruieren. Sowenig Hegel den Anspruch erhoben hat, jedes kontingente Faktum bis hin zu einzelnen Schreib-geräten aus dem Geist deduzieren zu wollen, sowenig will Marx jede Einzelheit aus einem zentralen Prinzip ableiten. Darstellung gesellschaftlicher Objektivität heißt nicht wirkliche Geschichts-schreibung, sondern begriffliche Entfaltung einer Totalität objektiv-bürgerlicher Formbestimmtheiten, innerhalb derer auch der bürger-liche Staat seinen bestimmten Ort hat, wie das aus dem Arbeitsplan hervorgeht, den Marx im Zuge der ersten Niederschrift der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie zu Papier bringt. Erst nach dieser allgemeinen Arbeit, bei der weder »das Mikroskop . . ., noch chemische Reagentien« dienen können, sondern »die Abstraktionskraft . . . beide ersetzen« «s muß, scheint die empirische Erforschung bestimmter nationaler Existenzweisen des Kapitals und des bürgerlichen Staates allererst sinnvoll und möglich zu sein. In diesem Sinne läßt sich eine Bemerkung von Marx in der Kritik des Gothaer Programms deuten, wo Marx gegen die Hypostasierung des Staates in der deutschen Sozialdemokratie polemisiert und sie mit starken empirischen Gewichten wieder auf den Boden der bürgerlichen Realität herunterholt, aber dennoch nicht vergißt, auf das objektive Strukturmoment hinzudeuten: »Die »heutige Gesellschaft» ist die kapitalistische Gesellschaft, die in allen Kulturländern existiert, mehr oder weniger frei von mittelalterlichem Beisatz, mehr oder weniger durch die besondre geschichtliche Entwicklung jedes Landes modifiziert, mehr oder weniger entwickelt. Dagegen der »heutige Staat» wechselt mit der Landesgrenze. Er ist ein andrer im preußisch deutschen Reich als in der Schweiz, ein andrer in England als in den Vereinigten Staaten. »Der heutige Staat» ist eine Fiktion. Jedoch haben die verschiednen Staaten der verschiednen Kulturländer, trotz ihrer bunten Form Verschiedenheit, alle das gemein, daß sie auf dem Boden der modernen bürgerlichen Gesellschaft stehn, nur einer mehr oder minder kapitalistisch entwik- kelten. Sie haben daher auch gewisse wesentliche Charaktere gemein. In diesem Sinne kann man von »heutigem Staatswesen» sprechen, im Gegensatz zur Zukunft, worin seine jetzige Wurzel, die bürgerliche Gesellschaft, abgestorben ist99.« Die materialistische Geschichtsauffassung, so läßt sich in einer programmatischen Charakterisierung festhalten, ist der methodische Ausdruck des naturähnlich verlaufenen Entwicklungs- und Lebensprozesses der geschichtlichen Menschheit, und sie hat solange Gültigkeit, wie diese naturähnliche Unbeherrschtheit der Vergesellschaftung andauert. Soll aber unter diesem Aspekt die abgelaufene und gegenwärtig ablaufende Geschichte konkreter erfaßt werden, so gerät die Theorie in Schwierigkeiten. Obgleich Marx im Spätwerk seine Geschichtsauffassung präzisiert hat, ist sie nicht nur nicht ein Fragment geblieben hinsichtlich der weiteren Fortsetzung der Darstellung in dem Sinne, wie wir es oben angedeutet haben, sondern Marx läßt den Leser überdies im unklaren darüber, in welcher Weise mit Hilfe dieser (nicht zu Ende gebrachten) Darstellung die wirk-liche Geschichte zu schreiben ist.”翻译为中文","output":"为了增产羊毛，将农田转变为牧场，打破了小规模租赁系统等，并进行了地产清理等。农业在某些地方甚至完全由市场循环决定，转变为以交换价值为目的的生产方式。这不仅改变了生产方式，而且瓦解了所有旧的人口和生产关系，以及与之相对应的经济关系。这样，在此之前，市场循环假定为只产生交换价值的剩余的生产，但它退化为仅与市场循环有关的生产，在其中以产生交换价值为其唯一内容的生产。与先前的观念形成鲜明对比的是，这里不再将自发发展的生产力视为驱动力，而是将资本视为在字面意义上创造历史的自我运动，它闯入前资本主义社会形态，将其解构和转型。生产力的发展水平在这一过程中是成功与否的前提之一，如果失败，只会导致“旧的生产方式贫困化”——生产方式可能保持不变，“只是对工人来说变得更加严酷”。 但是，这个过程在多大程度上废除了旧的生产方式，正如在现代欧洲的情况，以及它是否代之以资本主义生产方式，完全取决于历史的发展阶段和相应的条件。但一旦确立，资本本身就会持续革命化生产力，若无这种改变，资本自身就无法存在。在《资本论》的初稿中，马克思指出，劳动力最终被资本实质性地吞并，导致资本形成一种物质形式——作为机械，这与资本的概念相符。由资本本身产生的机械，必须在“关于资本一般”的讨论中展开：“从竞争中发展出机械的引入，以及由此解构的生产成本降低的法则，是容易的”，马克思主要批评Ricardo对机械的方法论引入不足。“这里的问题是，不考虑其他资本，仅从资本与活劳动的关系中发展出机械。” 这里简要概述的政治经济学批判思想清楚地表明，马克思的历史唯物主义决不仅仅能以生产力与社会关系之间的关系定理充分表征，更应该认为，唯物主义的精确展开是在指出与唯心主义的差异时不费吹灰之力的。由如Schumpeter和Rosa Luxemburg等不同作者指出的，定位于黑格尔哲学的马克思晚期作品语言中的“主观成分”，对政治经济学批判的“实质内容”而言不具有相关性，这反映出对资本主义社会结构原则的逐渐精确洞见。当马克思在政治经济学批判中有意继承黑格尔的著作，是因为这种哲学正因其绝对唯心主义，对资本的颠倒世界做到了正义，超越了那些对其现实感十足自豪的社会学想象得到的。早期作品在唯心主义旗帜下宣称的方法与内容的统一，在《资本论》中再次实践，但这次是作为与现实社会客观性形式长期斗争的结果，这种现实社会客观性在其真实的颠倒中等同于真正的唯心主义，其理论处理和呈现只有以这种方式才能恰当进行。从我们所获得的结构计划中可以看出，《资本论》的三卷仅是更广泛陈述的开始，在其中马克思打算按照它们在现代资本主义社会中相互关系的特定形式，追踪资本主义世界的客观性及其内在系统性。不仅是资本本身，整个陈述都必须按照一个“由它们在现代资本主义社会中彼此的关系所确定”的顺序开展，显然每种形式决定性都有其特定的位置和地方，这一点可以通过揭露这些现实主体-客体颠倒的自身法则的辩证描述来发现。批判从这些考虑中得出的结论是，从资本的概念中演绎出整个资本主义经验，这种论证就像一个Traugott Krug，他并不比从唯心主义那里要求少，即要求它先验地构造出他的笔。就如黑格尔没有要求从精神演绎出每一个偶然的事实，直到单个的书写工具，马克思也不意味着从一个中心原则中推导出每一个细节。表现社会客观性不意味着真实的历史书写，而是概念性地展开资本主义社会形式决定性的总体，在其中资本主义国家也有其特定的位置，正如马克思在撰写政治经济学批判的第一稿时所提出的工作计划所显示的那样。只有在这项一般工作之后，既没有“显微镜...，也没有化学试剂”可以服务，“抽象能力...必须替代它们”，才似乎有可能并且有意义地进行资本和资本主义国家特定国家存在方式的实证研究。在这个意义上，可以解读马克思在《哥达纲领批判》中的一条评论，其中马克思反驳德国社会民主党对国家的高度抽象概念，并以强大的实证数据将其重新拉回到资本主义现实的基础上，但仍不忘指出客观结构时刻：“「现代社会」是存在于所有文化国家中的资本主义社会，或多或少地摆脱了中世纪的附加物，或多或少地受到每个国家特定历史发展的影响，或多或少地发展。相对而言，「现代国家」随着国界的变化而变化。它在普鲁士德意志帝国中是一个，而在瑞士是另一个，在英国又是另一个，在美国又是另一个。\\"现代国家\\"是一种虚构。然而，不同文化国家的不同政府，尽管它们形式上的多种多样，但都有一个共同点，那就是它们立足于现代资本主义社会之上，只不过是在更或少发达的资本主义基础上。因此，它们也有一些基本特征相同。在这个意义上，我们可以谈论\\"现代国家机器\\"，与未来形成对比，到那时它现在的根基，资本主义社会，已经死亡。”材料主义历史观，可以总结为一个计划性的特征，是历史人类自然类似的发展和生活过程的方法论表达，并且只要这种自然类似的社会化无政府状态持续存在，它就是有效的。但是，如果想要在这个方面更具体地把握已经发生的和正在发生的历史，那么理论就会陷入困难。尽管马克思在晚期作品中精确化了他的历史观，但它不仅就进一步继续展示而言保留了不完整性，如我们上面所暗示的那样，而且马克思还让读者对如何利用这个（未完成的）展示来书写真实历史保持模糊不清。"},{"instruction":"请将“Materialistische Geschichtsdarstellung bedeutet, bezogen auf ta- ges- und zeitgeschichtliche Problemstellungen, daß die Ebene der Reproduktion realer gesellschaftlicher Erscheinungen - egal ob sich dieser »Positivismus« nun gegenüber den herrschenden Interessen kritisch oder affirmativ geriert - überschritten werden soll. Ausgehend von der in der »Deutschen Ideologie« 1845/46 von Marx und Engels formulierten »materialistischen Spekulation« (H. Rei- chelt) ist materialistische Geschichtsdarstellung somit primär eine Absichtserklärung, eine Intention und ein Arbeitsprogramm ab-strakt-allgemeiner Art, das sich bei der begrifflichen Darstellung konkreter Situationen methodisch zu bewähren hat. Eine materialistische Darstellung von Geschichte intendiert immer mehr als die bloße Zuordnung politischer und ökonomischer Handlungen, Meinungen und Verhaltensweisen zu einem Begriff gesellschaftlicher Interessen. Dieses Zuordnen würde erst einen Be-griff von Forschung, von Geschichte (auf der Tatsachenebene der »res gestae«), einlösen, der die Stufe der detaillierten und differen-zierten Aneignung eines noch selbstgenügsamen Objekts - etwa der Politik oder des ökonomischen Verhaltens von Fraktionen »des« Kapitals und »der« Arbeiterbewegung bezüglich »des« Staates - bezeichnet. Im dialektischen »Verbund« 1 mit derartiger Forschung steht aber die Ebene der Darstellung, der Logizität historischer Abläufe. Darstellung aber ist intendiert als Produkt eines kritisch motivierten Prozesses des Abarbeitens, sie ordnet und verwertet das durch Forschung gewonnene analytische Wissen um die »Oberfläche« von Gesellschaft nicht nach der Struktur des Objekts, sondern, worauf Alfred Schmidt hinweist, »fußend auf dem analytisch gewonnenen Wissen« konstruiert sie dialektisch »die Gegenwart der Gesellschaft als Geschichte«. Darstellung bedeutet ihrer Intention nach, »die stoffliche Mannigfaltigkeit zu vereinheitlichen, das konkrete Ganze zu reproduzieren, das in den einzelwissenschaftlichen Resultaten nur einseitig >erscheint<, nicht auf seinen Begriff gebracht wird«; Darstellung heißt also auch und zuerst die Anstrengung des Begriffs. Interpretatorisch will materialistische Geschichtsschreibung eine Einheit von Logik und Geschichte herausstellen, die sie im Prozeß menschlicher Emanzipation bis hin zur Möglichkeit einer nicht mehr ausgebeuteten und entfremdeten vermenschlichten Gesellschaft assoziierter Individuen als Abschluß der menschlichen Vorgeschichte sieht. Die Arbeit der tagespolitischen Schriften besteht nun darin, die Hemmnisse dieses Entwicklungsprozesses aufzuarbeiten, um sie der Arbeiterklasse als Informationen über ihren politischen Feind oder als Einsichten in eigenes Versagen oder auch in eigene Modelle wie beispielsweise die »Commune« zu vermitteln (womit gleich angedeutet werden soll, daß die tagespolitischen Schriften dem hohen Anspruchsniveau materialistischer Geschichtsdarstellung nur sehr bedingt entsprechen). Materialistische Geschichtsdarstellung bedeutet, daß über und durch die Analyse konkreter Erscheinungen der politischen und ökonomischen Zirkulationssphäre das Wesen der Produktion gesell-schaftlicher Prozesse eruiert werden soll. Über die Stufe eines »kri-tischen Positivismus« und/oder »linken Historismus« soll damit intentional hinausgegangen werden. Der analytische Prozeß der Darstellung von Geschichte endet dann auch nicht mit der Bestim-mung der gesellschaftlichen Interessen und Interessenträger als den Subjekten und Objekten von Politik und Ökonomie. Auf einer solchen Ebene der Forschung ist zwar entschieden die Forderung nach möglichst umfassenden, vielschichtig-dimensionierten, differenzie-renden und detaillierten Analysen real einzulösen, aber die so ge-wonnenen Einsichten in Manifestationen, latente Gehalte und In-tentionen gesellschaftlicher Interessen müssen, um ihr Wesen zu erfassen, noch auf die inhaltliche und formale Vermittlung durch Gesetzmäßigkeiten der sozioökonomischen Entwicklung, der Pro-duktion von Gesellschaft befragt werden. Der Begriff des Interesses kann daher nicht der letzte und wesentliche Zuordnungs- und Er-klärungspunkt materialistischer Geschichtsdarstellung bleiben. Zu fragen ist vielmehr nach denjenigen objektiven gesellschaftlichen Konstellationen, welche die formbestimmten Inhalte manifester und latenter Interessenartikulation im politischen, ökonomischen und kulturellen Prozeß notwendig hervorbringen. Materialistische Geschichtsdarstellung bemüht sich somit als radikale und konse-quente Einheit von Forschung und Darstellung, in den »inneren Zusammenhang der ökonomischen Kategorien oder den verborgenen Bau des bürgerlichen ökonomischen Systems« 2 einzudringen. Die analytische Stufe der Beschäftigung mit Interessen und den konkreten Konflikten zwischen Produktionsverhältnissen und Produktivkräften wird durch die Darstellung der »Gesellschaftlichkeit der Privatinteressen«3 in Politik und Ökonomie positiv aufgehoben, weil auf dieser Ebene die letzte Tiefe der begrifflichen Verarbeitung gesellschaftlicher Gegebenheiten gesehen wird. Wie die Ware, so ist auch das Bild einer historischen Situation, wenn es dargestellt werden soll, ein »sehr vertracktes Ding . . ., voll metaphysischer Spitzfindigkeit und theologischer Mucken«; denn auch für die Darstellung geschichtlicher Begebenheiten ist wesentlich die Formbestimmtheit konkreter Vorkommnisse in Politik, Ökonomie und Kultur, die dazu beiträgt, daß sich beispielsweise der gesellschaftliche Antagonismus als Konflikt von Interessen artikuliert. Die Ursachen für Inhalt und vor allem auch für die Ausformung des Inhaltes von Interessen rücken damit noch mehr ins Zentrum wissenschaftlicher Arbeit als die Reduktion einer Summe politischer Ereignisse auf einen dann doch in sich selbstgenügsamen und letztendlichen Interessenbegriff: »Es ist in der Tat viel leichter, durch Analyse den irdischen Kern der religiösen Nebelbildungen zu finden, als umgekehrt aus den jedesmaligen wirklichen Lebensverhältnissen ihre verhimmelte Form zu entwickeln. Die letztre ist die einzig materialistische und daher wissenschaftliche Methode.«4 Von der Ebene der Erscheinungen, der Zirkulation, des Überbaus zu derjenigen des Wesens, der Produktion, der Basis vorzudringen - besser: vordringen zu wollen empirische Mannigfaltigkeiten theoretisch auf ihren Begriff bringen zu wollen, das heißt zwar, daß die »Autonomie« politischer, sozialer und kultureller Ereignisse relativiert wird; es impliziert andererseits aber grundsätzlich nicht, daß politische, ökonomische und überhaupt soziale Mannigfaltigkeit analytisch unberücksichtigt bleiben, kann, daß sie auf der Ebene von Forschung nicht als ein für die Darstellung aufgegebenes Problem existiert. Diejenige Art materialistischer Geschichtsdarstellung, die ihren Anspruch nicht aufgeben und nicht zu einer idealistischen sowie dogmatischen Setzung geschichtlicher Abläufe degenerieren will, kann grundsätzlich keine »Subsumtion einer Masse von >Cases< under a general principle« 5 beinhalten. Diese Verfahrensweise - gegenwärtig als analoger und paralleler Ausdruck von Theorie- losigkeit und »dogmatischer« Praxis unter dem (falsch verstandenen) Begriff »Ableitung« weit verbreitet und viel gefordert6 - kapituliert vor dem Problem, Logik und Geschichte aufeinander zu beziehen bzw. das Wesentliche eines Kapitalismus im besonderen oder einer konkret existierenden und sinnlich erfahrbaren kapitalistischen Gesellschaft aus der Analyse gerade dieser besonderen Realitäten heraus zu gewinnen. Kategorien der Darstellung des Kapitals im allgemeinen bzw. des Kapitalismus, »so wie er seinem Begriff entspricht« 7, werden von einer derartig um die Austragung der Spannungen von Forschung und Darstellung gebrachten Geschichtsdeduktion als konstanter Ausdruck des Wesens von Kapitalismus im besonderen verstanden und projizierend verwendet. Kategorien wie die »Verwertungsschwierigkeiten des Kapitals« und die »Krisenhaftigkeit der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft« werden so angewendet, daß jede Betrachtung empirischer Vorfälle ausscheidet, weil das Versatzstück Empirie lediglich als Material für die Subsumtion unter eben diese Kategorien existiert. Der kapitale Fehler - wechselseitig verbunden ist er mit »dogmatischer« Theorie und »spontaneistischer« Praxis (»Aktionismus«) - besteht darin, die beiden wissenschaftlichen Ebenen der Forschung und der Darstellung nicht zu unterscheiden, um dann aus dem Primat kategorialwesenhafter Darstellung der Logizität die Unnötigkeit empirischer Analysen abzuleiten. Zu diesem Zweck wird zum Beispiel die Ebene des »theoretisch-konstruktiven« Geschichtsbegriffs bruchlos mit derjenigen des »historiographisch-narrativen« Begriffes von Ge-schichte 8 identifiziert. Damit aber wird Geschichte nicht so dargestellt, wie sie logisch, hinter der Oberfläche aller Erscheinungen, existiert.”翻译为中文","output":"唯物主义的历史陈述意味着，针对当前和时代问题，要超越再现实际社会现象的层面——不管这种“实证主义”对于统治利益是批判性的还是肯定性的。基于马克思和恩格斯在1845/46年《德意志意识形态》中提出的“唯物主义推测”（H. Reichelt），唯物主义的历史陈述因此首先是一个意图声明，一个意向和一个抽象-通用的工作计划，这在概念上展示具体情况时必须在方法上证明其价值。 唯物主义的历史展示总是意图超越仅仅将政治和经济行为、意见和行为方式归因于一个社会利益概念之上。这种归纳首先实现了一种研究和历史（在“发生的事”层面）的概念，它标志着对某个自足对象（如政治或“资本”和“工人运动”关于“国家”的经济行为）的详细和差异化掌握的阶段。在这种研究的“联合”下是呈现历史逻辑性过程的层面。但陈述被视为一个批判性驱动过程的产物，它并不是根据对象的结构而是基于分析获得的知识对社会“表面”的排序和利用，如Alfred Schmidt所指，“基于分析获得的知识”，它以对立的方式将“社会的现状作为历史”来构建。从其意图来看，陈述意味着“统一物质多样性，再现单科学结果中仅片面‘出现’的具体整体，未被归纳为其概念的整体”；因此，陈述也首先是概念的努力。在解释上，唯物主义历史写作企图展现逻辑与历史的统一，它在人类解放过程中看到了这一统一，直到作为人类预史终结的非剥削和非异化的个体联合社会的可能性。日常政治文章的工作就是处理阻碍这一发展过程的障碍，以便将其作为关于他们政治敌人的信息或对自身失败的洞察，或者是对自己模型如“公社”的理解传达给工人阶级（这也意味着日常政治文章只是非常有限地符合唯物主义历史陈述的高要求）。 唯物主义的历史陈述意味着通过和通过分析政治和经济循环领域的具体现象，应探求社会过程生产的本质。因此，这一意图要超越“批判性实证主义”和/或“左翼历史主义”的阶段。历史的分析性展示过程不仅以政治和经济学中的社会利益和利益主体作为政治和经济主体和对象的确定为结束。在这种研究层面上，确实要求尽可能全面、多层次-多维度、区分和详细的分析，但为了把握其本质，对社会利益的显现、潜在内容和意图的所获得的见解还必须根据社会经济发展的法则、社会的生产来质询其内容和形式上的中介。因此，利益概念不能是唯物主义历史陈述的最终和基本的归因和解释点。更应该询问哪些客观的社会配置必然产生政治、经济和文化过程中表现和潜在利益表达的形式性内容。因此，唯物主义历史陈述作为研究和呈现的彻底和一贯统一，努力深入“经济范畴的内在联系或资本主义经济系统的隐藏结构”。以“私人利益的社会性”在政治和经济中的表述的呈现来积极超越对利益和生产关系与生产力之间的具体冲突的分析阶段，因为在这一层面上看到了对社会事实的概念性处理的最终深度。 就像商品一样，如果要陈述一个历史情境的画面，它是一个“非常棘手的东西……，充满了形而上学的巧妙和神学的小妙招”；因为对历史事件的呈现也本质上是政治、经济和文化中具体事件的形式性，这有助于社会对立作为利益冲突的表达。因此，利益内容及其形式的原因比将一系列政治事件简化为自足和最终的利益概念更加成为科学工作的中心：“的确，通过分析找到宗教幻象的地球核心要容易得多，而不是反过来从现实的生活条件中发展其天堂化的形式。后者是唯一的唯物主义，因此是科学的方法。” 由表象层面、循环、上层建筑到本质、生产、基础层面的深入——更好地说，希望深入将经验多样性理论归纳为其概念，虽然这意味着政治、社会和文化事件的“自治”被相对化；但另一方面，这基本上不意味着政治、经济和总体社会多样性在分析上被忽略，它们在研究层面上不作为一个待解决的问题存在。 那种不放弃其要求且不退化为理想主义及教条式历史过程设定的唯物主义历史陈述，原则上不能包含将许多“案例”归入一个总体原则的“归属”。这种方法——目前作为理论缺乏和“教条”实践的类似和平行表达，在（误解的）“衍生”概念下广泛流行和大量要求——在将逻辑与历史相关联或从特殊的资本主义现实分析中获得资本主义或具体存在且可感知的资本主义社会的本质面前投降。将一般资本或资本主义的呈现类别，即“其概念所对应的”，理解并投射性使用为资本主义本质的恒定表达，是这样的历史演绎所带来的紧张处理。 类别如“资本的增值困难”和“资本主义社会的危机性”被应用到排除对经验事件的任何考察，因为经验片段仅作为归入这些类别的材料存在。这一重大错误——与“教条”理论和“自发主义”实践（“行动主义”）相互联系——在于不区分科学的两个层面：研究和呈现，然后从类别本质性呈现的逻辑性优先地引申出经验分析的非必要性。例如，无缝地将“理论-构造性”历史概念的层面与“叙述性-历史学”历史概念的层面相同化。但是，这样并没有表现出历史在所有表象背后逻辑性地存在的方式。"},{"instruction":"Write about empire ruled by edgelord","output":"An empire ruled by an edgelord—a term often colloquially used to describe someone who adopts a subculture's extreme or controversial aspects, usually in a superficial way to impress or shock—would present a unique and complex scenario. This hypothetical empire, let's call it the Edgelordian Empire, would embody the darker, more brooding characteristics associated with edgelords, influencing its governance, culture, military, and international relations. # Governance and Politics In the Edgelordian Empire, the central authority, an Emperor or Empress of Edges, would likely espouse principles and enact policies that reflect their persona of depth and nonconformity. This might manifest as a government structure that ostensibly rejects the norms and traditions of other nations, creating a system meant to be seen as more enlightened or liberated, but could potentially be just as authoritarian or hierarchical under the surface. The ruling edgelord's policies might focus on promoting arts and culture that align with their views, potentially leading to a state where only certain expressions are encouraged, creating a dark, brooding aesthetic across the empire. Governance might be characterized by dramatic gestures, such as grandiose declarations and unconventional diplomacy, meant to unsettle more traditional states and assert the empire's unique identity. # Military The Edgelordian military might mirror the aesthetic and values of their ruler, adopting intimidating uniforms, unconventional tactics, and a focus on psychological warfare intended to unsettle their enemies. Their strategy could involve operations and campaigns that other military forces consider too risky or dishonorable, aiming to gain an edge through unpredictability and a willingness to breach convention. # Culture Culturally, the Edgelordian Empire would be a haven for those who align with the edgelord archetype. Art, literature, and media might predominantly explore themes of existential angst, dystopia, and a rejection of mainstream values. Public spaces could be designed to reflect the ruler's tastes, with architecture and monuments that embrace an aesthetic of grandiosity and melancholia. # International Relations Internationally, the Edgelordian Empire would likely be a polarizing figure. On one hand, it could attract like-minded individuals and states, forming alliances based on shared values of anti-conformity. On the other, its provocative policies and the ruler's penchant for dramatic flair could strain relationships with more traditional or conservative states, potentially isolating the empire. # Challenges Despite its strong identity and unique culture, the Edgelordian Empire would face significant challenges. The very traits that define it could lead to internal and external conflicts, economic instability due to unpredictable policies, and a potential for leadership crisis if the ruler's persona overshadowed effective governance. Furthermore, the emphasis on a specific subculture could alienate parts of the population who do not align with edgelord values, leading to social fragmentation and unrest. Additionally, the empire's confrontational stance in international politics could result in sanctions, conflicts, or diplomatically isolating itself from potential allies and trade partners. # Conclusion An empire ruled by an edgelord presents an interesting thought experiment, offering insights into how subcultural traits might influence the structure and function of a state. While it could foster a strong, distinct identity and culture, it also poses significant governance and diplomatic challenges. This hypothetical explores the balance between a ruler's persona and their effectiveness, and the impact of extreme ideologies when applied to the intricate realities of running a state."},{"instruction":"Напиши эффективную программу тренировок для набора мышечной массы на неделю","output":"Программа тренировок для набора мышечной массы может быть следующей: День 1: ноги и ягодицы 1.

cycle starts with the mining of uranium and ends with the disposal of spent Fuel and other radioactive waste as the first step of the nuclear fuel cycle uranium recovery focuses on mining natural uranium ore from the earth the minded uranium ore is crushed and chemically treated to separate the uranium which is called Milling this process leaves us with yellow cake the powder form of uranium oxide in general conversion is a process in which the uranium is converted to a form suitable for enrichment natural uranium only contains 0.71% of uranium 235 the isotope that maintains a nuclear reactor's chain reaction to increase the concentration of uranium 235 the yellow cake must be converted into uranium hexafluoride gas gas as most nuclear reactors require fuel with a uranium 235 concentration of 3 to 5% the proportion of the uranium 235 isotope must be increased this process is known as enrichment this is done by introducing the uf6 gas into fast spinning cylinders known as centrifuges where heavier Isotopes are pushed out to the cylinder walls enriched uf6 is converted to uranium dioxide powder and formed into small solid cylindri pellets these are packed in long metal tubes which are grouped in fuel assemblies controlled fishing or splitting of u235 atoms generates heat the heat produces steam at extremely high temperatures and pressure the steam then spins a turbine to generate electricity nuclear fuel is typically used in the reactor for 3 to 5 years after removal it is stored underwater which provides both with Cooling and radiation shielding later it can also be stored dry in shielded buildings or cks material in spent fuel can also be recycled to produce more energy some countries chemically reprocess spent fuel to separate the usable material

manner.","output":"The nuclear fuel cycle is a complex, multi-step process that converts uranium into electricity in nuclear power reactors while managing the resulting radioactive waste. Here's a simplified overview of the steps involved in the nuclear fuel cycle: 1. **Uranium Recovery:** The cycle begins with mining uranium, an abundant metal found in the Earth’s crust. This can be conducted through traditional mining methods or in-situ leaching, a process that dissolves uranium in the ground and pumps it to the surface. 2. **Milling:** The extracted uranium ore is processed in a mill, where it is crushed and chemically treated to extract the uranium, resulting in a concentrated product known as \\"yellowcake\\" (U3O8). 3. **Conversion:** The yellowcake is then converted into uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas, a step required to prepare the uranium for enrichment. This is because UF6 is suitable for the enrichment process due to its gaseous state at relatively low temperatures. 4. **Enrichment:** Natural uranium contains only about 0.7% uranium-235 (U-235), the isotope necessary for sustaining a nuclear reaction. Enrichment increases the concentration of U-235 to between 3% and 5% for use in commercial reactors. This is achieved by spinning the UF6 gas in centrifuges, where the heavier isotopes are separated out, leaving enriched UF6. 5. **Fuel Fabrication:** The enriched UF6 gas is then converted to uranium dioxide (UO2) powder and pressed into small, solid ceramic pellets. These pellets are loaded into metal tubes to form fuel rods, which are then assembled into fuel assemblies ready for use in a nuclear reactor. 6. **Electricity Generation:** Within the reactor, controlled fission of U-235 atoms generates heat, which is used to produce steam. This steam drives turbines, generating electricity. 7. **Spent Fuel Management:** After use, nuclear fuel is removed from the reactor and stored underwater in cooling pools to provide shielding from radiation and to allow the spent fuel to cool down. After sufficient cooling, it may be transferred to dry storage casks. Some countries opt to reprocess spent fuel to recover usable materials, such as plutonium and unused uranium, for new fuel. 8. **Final Disposal:** Ultimately, high-level radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel that will not be reprocessed, needs to be securely disposed of. The preferred method involves encapsulating the waste in durable containers and burying them in geologically stable formations deep underground, ensuring long-term safety and minimal environmental impact. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays a key role in supporting member states in safely, securely, and sustainably using nuclear technologies throughout this cycle. As the understanding of and technologies for nuclear fuel management continue to advance, efforts are being made to enhance the efficiency of each step of the cycle while ensuring the highest standards of safety and minimizing environmental impacts."},{"instruction":"Which one accounts for the highest percentage of electrical energy?","output":"As of my last update in 2023, coal remains the largest single source of electrical energy generation worldwide, although its share has been decreasing over the years due to environmental concerns and the global shift towards cleaner energy sources. However, the specific fuel that accounts for the highest percentage of electrical energy generation can vary significantly by country and region depending on local resources, policies, and economic factors. For example, in countries with abundant hydropower potential, such as Norway, hydroelectric power dominates electricity generation. In contrast, France relies heavily on nuclear power for its electricity needs, illustrating how nuclear can be the largest source in specific contexts. Meanwhile, some countries with significant investments in renewable energy, such as wind and solar, are seeing these sources account for an ever-larger share of their electricity generation mix. Globally, the mix also includes significant contributions from natural gas and, increasingly, from renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. The International Energy Agency (IEA) and similar organizations periodically release data and projections about energy production and consumption, which can provide up-to-date information about the leading sources of electrical energy generation worldwide. As the global community continues to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources is expected to grow, potentially changing the current rankings in the near future."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],M={key:0},G={key:1};function W(a,e,h,f,o,s){const m=p("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(i(!0),n(y,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(i(),v(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),n("div",I,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
