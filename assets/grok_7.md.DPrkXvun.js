Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic.

Q: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report.

Blend the sugar and cinnamon mixture evenly onto the flattened dough: This will ensure that the flavors are well-distributed throughout the final product. 2. Roll up the dough tightly from one end to the other: Rolling the dough will create the signature spiral pattern seen in many types of pastries, such as cinnamon rolls or strudels.

Seal the edge of the rolled dough: Pressing the edge of the dough gently will help to keep it securely wrapped and prevent the filling from spilling out during baking. 4. Slice the roll into equal portions: Cutting the roll into individual portions will make it easier to serve and allow for more even baking. 5. Arrange the portions on a baking sheet: Space the portions evenly on a baking sheet to ensure they have enough room to expand during baking. 6. Bake the dish according to the recipe's instructions: Following the recipe's baking time and temperature will ensure that the dish cooks properly and achieves the desired texture. 7. Allow the dish to cool slightly before serving: Giving the dish some time to cool will make it easier to handle and often enhances the flavors.

I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That’s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the “nice sweatshirt” bit was what really got me. I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it.

A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the question I need to find the term for the zone in a body of water where there is not enough sunlight for photosynthesis to occur. Step 2: Recall relevant information Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into organic compounds, primarily glucose. Sunlight penetration into a body of water decreases with depth due to absorption and scattering by water, dissolved substances, and suspended particles.  Step 3: Determine the answer The zone in a body of water where there is too little sunlight for photosynthesis is called the \\"aphotic zone.\\" This is the part of a body of water where sunlight is not available for photosynthesis, typically below a certain depth.

The population density was 914.5 persons per square mile (353.0/km²). There were 2,702 housing units at an average density of 392.3 per square mile (151.4/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 75.33% White (U.S. Census), 22.38% African American (U.S. Census) or Race (United States Census), 0.24% Native American (U.S. Census), 0.57% Asian (U.S. Census), 0.08% Pacific Islander (U.S. Census), 0.24% from Race (United States Census), and 1.16% from two or more races. Hispanic (U.S. Census) or Latino (U.S. Census) of any race were 0.89% of the population. Question: How many people in terms of absolute number in the city were not either White or African American? Answer:","output":"To find the number of people who were not either White or African American, we first need to find out the percentage of people who were not part of these two racial groups. We know that 75.33% of the population were White and 22.38% were African American. To find the remaining percentage, we can add these two percentages together and then subtract from 100%: 100% - (75.33% + 22.38%) = 100% - 97.71% = 2.29% Now we know that 2.29% of the population were not either White or African American. To find the absolute number of these people, we can multiply this percentage by the total population: 6,299 people (total population) x 2.29% (percentage of other races) = 144.2461 Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round this number to the nearest whole number: 144 people (approximately) So, there were approximately 144 people in the city who were not either White or African American."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who said Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Mussorgsky, and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music?  Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen's music. He believed that terms such as \\"tonal\\", \\"modal\\" and \\"serial\\" are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Claudio Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Richard Wagner, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie (\\"Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong\\"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (\\"gold and brown\\") to the highly detailed (\\"blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant\\").When asked what Messiaen's main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, \\"I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential, ... rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, ... the fundamental material of the music itself.\\" Answer:","output":"The name of the person who said Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Mussorgsky, and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music is Messiaen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what is a prism used to refract?\\" with the following options:  - Something that can be auburn  - basic building blocks of life  - mirrors  - our nearest star  - wavelengths and photons  - microwaves  - triangles  - focusing a lens The answer is:","output":"Wavelengths and photons. A prism is a transparent, usually geometrical, object with flat, polished surfaces that are capable of refracting light. When light passes through a prism, it is bent—or refracted—due to the change in speed as it moves from one medium (e.g., air) into another (e.g., glass). This refraction effect causes the light to split into its individual color components, which are spread out into a spectrum. This occurs because different colors of light have different wavelengths, and these wavelengths are refracted by different amounts as they pass through the prism. Fact 1 states that a prism is used for refracting light. This is important because it establishes the primary purpose of a prism—to manipulate and alter the path of light as it passes through. Prisms are widely used in various applications for this purpose, such as in optics, cameras, telescopes, microscopes, and spectroscopy, where they can help resolve light into its different wavelengths or colors. Fact 2 mentions that light can be described both as wavelengths and photons. This fact highlights the dual nature of light, with both a wave-like characteristic (wavelengths) and particle-like characteristic (photons). Wavelengths are a measure of the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a light wave, while photons are the smallest, most elementary particles of light. When a prism refracts light, both of these aspects come into play; the prism interacts with the different wavelengths by bending each color uniquely, and it does so through the interaction with the photons that comprise the light source. Given these two facts, it is clear that a prism is used to refract wavelengths and photons. While other options mentioned, such as microwaves and focusing a lens, may have some general relation to light, they do not specifically relate to what a prism is utilized to refract. Thus, the answer is wavelengths and photons. By refracting light, prisms separate and disperse the individual colors and/or wavelengths, enabling further analysis, manipulation, or appreciation of these properties."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: An unprecedented pattern of extinction in the oceans today that selectively targets large-bodied animals over smaller creatures is likely driven by human fishing, according to a new Stanford-led study.      Go to the web site to view the video.      Mark Hanlon Stanford Earth professor Jon Payne puts modern extinction in context by comparing them with Earth’s five previous mass extinctions.      “We’ve found that extinction threat in the modern oceans is very strongly associated with larger body size,” said Jonathan Payne, a paleobiologist at Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences. “This is most likely due to people targeting larger species for consumption first.”      In a new study, to be published in the Sept. 16 issue of the journal Science, Payne and his colleagues examined the association between extinction threat level and ecological traits such as body size for two major groups of marine animals – mollusks and vertebrates – over the past 500 years and compared it with the ancient past, stretching as far back as 445 million years ago and with a particular emphasis on the most recent 66 million years.      “We used the fossil record to show, in a concrete, convincing way, that what is happening in the modern oceans is really different from what has happened in the past,” said study co-author Noel Heim, a postdoctoral researcher in Payne’s lab.      Paleobiologist Jonathan Payne holds a whale vertebra. His research group recently found that large body size is strongly associated with higher extinction threat in living marine animals and that this pattern is distinct from extinction selectivity patterns in the marine fossil record. It appears most likely to reflect a distinct signature of human hunting and fishing. (Image credit: Ker Than)      Specifically, the authors found that the modern era is unique in the extent to which creatures with larger body sizes are being preferentially targeted for extinction. “What our analysis shows is that for every factor of 10 increase in body mass, the odds of being threatened by extinction go up by a factor of 13 or so,” Payne said. “The bigger you are, the more likely you are to be facing extinction.”      The selective extinction of large-bodied animals could have serious consequences for the health of marine ecosystems, the scientists say, because they tend to be at the tops of food webs and their movements through the water column and the seafloor help cycle nutrients through the oceans.      Judy Skog, program director in the National Science Foundation’s Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research, said the findings should be incorporated into decisions about how we manage ocean resources like fisheries. “These results show that larger marine animals are poised to disappear from the seas faster than smaller ones,” Skog said. “Studies of the fossil record indicate that this trend didn’t exist in the past – it’s a new development in today’s world.”      While Payne and his colleagues did not directly examine why large modern marine animals are at higher risk of extinction, their findings are consistent with a growing body of scientific literature that point to humans as the main culprits. “It is consistent with the tendency for fisheries to first exploit larger species and subsequently move down the food web and target smaller species,” said study co-author Matthew Knope, a former postdoc in Payne’s lab who is now an assistant professor of biology at the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo.      As big animals go extinct, so do the benefits they offer humans, Stanford scientists find Biologist Rodolfo Dirzo is one of dozens of researchers from around the world urging action toward the conservation of large mammals that provide substantial biologic and economic values.      It’s a pattern that scientists have seen before. On land, for example, there is evidence that ancient humans were responsible for the massacre of mammoths and other megafauna across the globe. “We see this over and over again,” Heim said. “Humans enter into a new ecosystem, and the largest animals are killed off first. Marine systems have been spared up to now, because until relatively recently, humans were restricted to coastal areas and didn’t have the technology to fish in the deep ocean on an industrial scale.”      If there is one silver lining in the troubling new findings, it’s that there is still time for humans to change their behavior, Payne said. “We can’t do much to quickly reverse the trends of ocean warming or ocean acidification, which are both real threats that must be addressed. But we can change treaties related to how we hunt and fish. Fish populations also have the potential to recover much more quickly than climate or ocean chemistry,” Payne said. “We can turn this situation around relatively quickly with appropriate management decisions at the national and international level.”      Other co-authors on the study, titled “Ecological selectivity of the emerging mass extinction in the oceans,” include Andrew Bush of the University of Connecticut and Doug McCauley of the University of California, Santa Barbara. ||||| The sixth mass extinction—the one that seven billion humans are doing their darnedest to trigger at this very moment—is shaping up to be like nothing our planet has ever seen. That’s the conclusion of a sweeping new analysis, which compared marine fossil records from Earth’s five previous mass extinction events to what’s happening in the oceans right now.      “There is no past event that looks biologically like what’s happening today,” lead study author Jonathan Payne, of Stanford University, told Gizmodo. Unlike the past, Payne said, “processes like warming and ocean acidification are not the dominant cause of threat in the modern ocean.”      Advertisement      Instead, the dominant threat is people. It’s the nets, harpoons, and trawlers that are systematically emptying the oceans of fish and other marine life forms. Whereas the mass extinctions of the past tended to target organisms in certain environments, the sixth mass extinction is poised to hit the biggest animals the hardest. And that could have have profound implications for how our planet’s future unfolds.      A paleontologist by training, Payne and his research group started compiling data on modern marine organisms several years back, in order to study how body size and ecological traits have changed over evolutionary time. Payne, who has studied the End Permian extinction event that wiped out more than 95 percent of all marine species 250 million years ago, soon realized that his dataset—which included living and extinct members of nearly 2500 marine genera—could serve another purpose.      “To claim we’re in a sixth mass extinction is something very enormous. It is a possibility. It is not the reality yet.”      Advertisement      “We thought the data we had would allow us to examine extinction in the modern [era] in a way that would be very comparable to the fossil record,” Payne said. “Our hope was that we might be able to identify past events that biologically were most similar to the extinction threat the oceans are facing today.”      So that’s exactly what the researchers did. By comparing the extinction threat faced by modern marine genera (as indicated by their official conservation status) with their ancestral counterparts, Payne and his colleagues discovered that modern extinction threat is more strongly associated with body size. Larger animals face a greater risk of disappearing than smaller animals.      In past mass extinction events, body size didn’t matter that much. Instead, it was an organism’s habitat that dictated its fate. Animals that lived in the open ocean, or pelagic zone, went extinct at a higher rate than benthic creatures living on the seafloor.            Advertisement      This difference in “extinction selectivity” can be explained by different drivers. During the End Permian, changes in ocean chemistry triggered by microbes, volcanoes, or some combination of the two are thought to have created a toxic environment for most marine life. At the end of the Cretaceous period, an enormous asteroid impact followed by supervolcano eruptions sent plumes of dust into the sky, choking out sunlight and cutting off the energy supply at the bottom of the food chain. In both cases, organisms that lived in more isolated, sheltered environments away from the ocean’s surface fared better.      Today, the dominant driver of marine extinction is people, and people aren’t terribly selective about which environments they pluck animals from. We go for the biggest game, fishing down the food web and removing top predators. Within species, too, we tend to hunt the largest individuals, which is why North Atlantic cod and Chesapeake oysters were historically much larger. “In a sense, we’re driving evolution [toward smaller individuals],” Payne said.      Advertisement      There are a few big caveats to the analysis. For the sake of comparison, Payne and his co-authors only analyzed marine genera that have fossil counterparts, which means certain soft-bodied organisms that don’t preserve well (like octopods) were excluded. What’s more, they only looked at organisms whose extinction risk has been assessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). That creates a rather serious bias toward big, charismatic groups—fish, sea turtles, marine mammals, and the like. There are countless species of marine invertebrates that we simply don’t have enough data on to do a proper threat assessment.            Perhaps most significantly, the study excluded corals, which are currently in the midst of a catastrophic, global die-off. As habitat for roughly a quarter of all marine species, the loss of coral reefs due to global warming and ocean acidification would be a major blow to the health of the oceans overall.      “This study largely does not address the impact we are having on ocean ecosystems through global climate change,” Mark Eakin, a biological oceanographer with NOAA who was not involved with the study told Gizmodo. “Our increases in atmospheric CO2 will add to the impacts found by the authors to broaden our species’ destructive reach.”      Advertisement      Even considering the omissions, the pattern the authors uncovered implies that the trajectory of the sixth mass extinction could be unique. The loss of large animals tends to cause what ecologists call a “tropic cascade,” basically, a ripple effect down the food chain. Larger organisms also play an outsized role in global nutrient cycling—whale poop fertilizes the oceans with iron, for instance, while salmon migrations bring nitrogen and phosphorus upstream and even onto the land.      It’s unclear whether the loss of these ecosystem services will make it harder for marine life to recover, but it’s certainly a possibility. The study minces no words to this point: “The preferential removal of the largest animals from the modern oceans, unprecedented in the history of animal life, may disrupt ecosystems for millions of years.”      There is, however, a bright spot: things haven’t gotten too terrible yet. In Payne’s dataset, there is only one genus that has actually gone extinct in the past 500 years. While more species have gone extinct, and some genera are too poorly studied to be sure, we’re at best on the precipice of a sixth mass extinction. We can still turn this sinking ship around.      Advertisement      “We have the opportunity to totally avert this, if we make the right decisions,” Payne said. “Even on the land, where we have lost a bunch of large species, almost everything at the genus level is still here.”            “To claim we’re in a sixth mass extinction is something very enormous,” he continued. “It is a possibility. It is not the reality yet.”      [Science]      This article has been updated to include comments from Dr. Mark Eakin. ||||| The authors found that during the mass extinction events, smaller animals were a tad more likely than larger animals to go extinct. In addition, animals that could swim were more likely to be wiped out during all but the last mass extinction event compared with those that were stationary, and marine animals that lived in the open water were more likely to die off than those who made their homes on the ocean floor. |||||Summary:","output":"A new study from Stanford University has shown that human fishing is causing large sea animals to die off faster than smaller ones.

To provide a more accurate and detailed response, here is the correct information regarding John Adams's children: John Adams, the second President of the United States (1797-1801) and one of the country's Founding Fathers, had six children with his wife, Abigail Adams: 1. Abigail \\"Nabby\\" Amelia Adams (1765-1813) - She married William Stephens Smith and had four children. Tragically, she passed away from breast cancer. 2. John Quincy Adams (1767-1848) - He followed in his father's footsteps, becoming the sixth President of the United States (1825-1829). He also had a distinguished career in diplomacy and served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. John Quincy married Louisa Catherine Johnson and had four children. 3. Susanna Adams (1768-1770) - She died at a young age, only two years old. 4. Charles Adams (1770-1800) - Charles struggled with alcohol addiction throughout his life. He worked as an attorney and married Sarah \\"Sally\\" Smith, with whom he had two children. Sadly, Charles died at 30 due to complications resulting from alcoholism. 5. Thomas Boylston Adams (1772-1832) - He also practiced law and served in various roles, including as a Massachusetts state legislator, town moderator, and as chief justice of the Circuit Court of Common Pleas. Thomas married Ann Harrod and had seven children. 6. Elizabeth Adams (stillborn in 1777) - She, unfortunately, did not survive birth. So, in conclusion, the original suggested answer does not directly address the question about John Adams's children, and you should not validate it. Instead, you may refer to the provided information above concerning his six children: Abigail Amelia, John Quincy, Susanna, Charles, Thomas Boylston, and Elizabeth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who was posing for Moore? ?  On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein.  1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London.  In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.

Given the question: Information:  - Some of Coleridge's contemporaries denounced the poem and questioned his story of its origin. It was not until years later that critics began to openly admire the poem. Most modern critics now view \\"Kubla Khan\\" as one of Coleridge's three great poems, along with \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" and \\"Christabel\\". The poem is considered one of the most famous examples of Romanticism in English poetry. A copy of the manuscript is a permanent exhibit at the British Museum in London.  - Romantic poetry is the poetry of the Romantic era, an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century. It involved a reaction against prevailing Enlightenment ideas of the 18th century, and lasted from 1800 to 1850, approximately,   - Biographia Literaria, or in full Biographia Literaria; or Biographical Sketches of My Literary Life and Opinions, is an autobiography in discourse by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which he published in 1817, in two volumes.  - Samuel Taylor Coleridge (21 October 177225 July 1834) was an English poet, literary critic and philosopher who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets. He wrote the poems \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" and \\"Kubla Khan\\", as well as the major prose work \\"Biographia Literaria\\". His critical work, especially on Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including suspension of disbelief. He was a major influence on Emerson and American transcendentalism.  - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.  - William Cowper ( / kupr / KOO - pr ; 26 November 1731 -- 25 April 1800 ) was an English poet and hymnodist . One of the most popular poets of his time , Cowper changed the direction of 18th century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside . In many ways , he was one of the forerunners of Romantic poetry . Samuel Taylor Coleridge called him \`\` the best modern poet '' , whilst William Wordsworth particularly admired his poem Yardley - Oak . He was a nephew of the poet Judith Madan . After being institutionalised for insanity in the period 1763 -- 65 , Cowper found refuge in a fervent evangelical Christianity , the inspiration behind his much - loved hymns . He continued to suffer doubt and , after a dream in 1773 , believed that he was doomed to eternal damnation . He recovered and wrote more religious hymns . His religious sentiment and association with John Newton ( who wrote the hymn \`\` Amazing Grace '' ) led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered . His poem \`\` Light Shining out of Darkness '' gave English the phrase : \`\` God moves in a mysterious way / His wonders to perform . '' He also wrote a number of anti-slavery poems and his friendship with Newton , who was an avid anti-slavery campaigner , resulted in Cowper being asked to write in support of the Abolitionist campaign . Cowper wrote a poem called ' The Negro 's Complaint ' ( 1788 ) which rapidly became very famous , and was often quoted by Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. during the 20th century civil rights movement . He also wrote several other less well known poems on slavery in the 1780s , many of which attacked the idea that slavery was economically viable .    What is the relationship between 'william cowper' and 'romanticism'? The answer is:","output":"William Cowper was an English poet and hymnodist, considered one of the forerunners of Romantic poetry.

Background: Arthur Antunes Coimbra (Portuguese pronunciation: [aR'tuR a'tunis ko'ibra], born 3 March 1953 in Rio de Janeiro), better known as Zico (['ziku]), is a Brazilian coach and former footballer, who played as an attacking midfielder. Often called the \\"White Pele\\", he was a creative playmaker, with excellent technical skills, vision, and an eye for goal, who is considered one of the most clinical finishers and best passers ever, as well as one of the greatest players of all time. Arguably the world's best player of the late 1970s and early 80s, he is regarded as one of the best playmakers and free kick specialists in history, able to bend the ball in all directions. Context: An episode related to Brazil national football team almost made Zico give up on his career. He made his international debut in the South American Qualifier to the 1972 Summer Olympics playing 5 matches and scoring the qualifying goal against Argentina. Despite this fact, he wasn't called up to the Munich games. He felt extremely frustrated and told his father in dismay he wanted to stop playing football. He even got absent from training at Flamengo for 10 days, being later convinced otherwise by his brothers.  In the opening group match of the 1978 World Cup against Sweden, Zico headed a corner kick into the goal in the final minute of the match, apparently breaking a 1-1 tie. However, in a call that became infamous, the Welsh referee Clive Thomas disallowed the goal, saying that he had blown the whistle to end the match while the ball was still in the air from a corner. In the secound round, he scored from a penalty in a 3-0 win over Peru. Zico eventually won a bronze medal with Brazil at the tournament, defeating Italy in the 3rd place final. Zico also won another bronze medal with Brazil in the 1979 Copa America.  The 1982 World Cup would see Zico as part of a fantastic squad, side by side with Falcao, Socrates, Eder, Cerezo and Junior. In spite of his 4 goals and the great amount of skill in that squad, the team was defeated 3-2 by Paolo Rossi and Italy in the final match of the second round group stage.  He played in the 1986 FIFA World Cup while still injured, and missed a penalty during regular time in the quarter-final match against France. The match ended in a tie which led to a shootout. Zico then scored his goal, but penalties missed by Socrates and Julio Cesar saw Brazil knocked out of the tournament.  Having been cleared of all the tax evasion charges by Italian officials in 1988, Zico decided to pay a tribute to Udine, the city that had madly welcomed him six years before, and played his farewell match for the Selecao in March 1989 losing 1-2 to a World All-Stars team at Stadio Friuli. Question: Did he have a certain style?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Zico had a certain style of play. He was often called the \\"White Pele\\" and was known for being a creative playmaker with excellent technical skills, vision, and an eye for goal. He is considered one of the most clinical finishers and best passers ever, as well as one of the greatest players of all time. Zico was also regarded as one of the best playmakers and free-kick specialists in history, with the ability to bend the ball in all directions.

Back home we refer to carbonated drinks as cold drinks. So, when he asked me to have a pop,I thought he was referring to popcorn. I said,very politely,\\"No,thank you.I am not hungry.\\" He had a puzzled look on his face, one that I did not figure out for at least a week or so until somebody pointed out to me that pop meant soda and had nothing to do with corn.

I ordered my meal and finally asked for a Pepsi.The waitress handed me an aluminum can. Now,back home we have only bottled pop drinks,and the only time I was exposed to a can was on an airplane. However,those cans were a bit different because one could open it by pulling on the tab,which came off.Imagine my embarrassment as I tried to use the same technique at the restaurant.Obviously,the tab would not come off when I struggled with the can,and I spilled the pop all over the table. My fellow Bangladeshi students and a few others at the nearby tables got a good laugh out of this.Finally,one of them showed me how to use that device.

He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a \\"fascist theocracy\\".In early 1990, Zappa visited Czechoslovakia at the request of President Václav Havel. Havel designated him as Czechoslovakia's \\"Special Ambassador to the West on Trade, Culture and Tourism\\". Havel was a lifelong fan of Zappa, who had great influence in the avant-garde and underground scene in Central Europe in the 1970s and 1980s (a Czech rock group that was imprisoned in 1976 took its name from Zappa's 1968 song \\"Plastic People\\").

The power of social media platforms and crowdfunding websites has undeniably transformed the way projects are backed and funded, empowering creators to connect directly with potential supporters. As such, it is essential to know how to effectively leverage these tools to maximize engagement, foster interest in your project, and ultimately secure the funding you seek. In this article, we will explore some essential strategies for using social media and crowdfunding to your advantage. Talking to Friends and Family In the initial stages of promoting your project, your immediate network of friends and family is a valuable resource. These individuals are more likely to be invested in your success and can provide not only financial support but also valuable feedback. Start by personally reaching out to your close connections and sharing information about your project, including its goals, the progress you have made, and what you hope to achieve. Not only will this lay a strong foundation of initial support, but it can also create a ripple effect by encouraging others to share the opportunity with their networks. Drumming Up Interest on Social Media Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram are invaluable resources for getting the word out about your project. Start by creating a strong and consistent online presence – this means setting up project-specific pages or profiles on various platforms and actively promoting them. Share updates, images, and engaging content to showcase the development and value of your project, and be sure to tailor your messages to each platform's unique audience. Encourage your friends and family to share your project across their social media channels as well. Engaging with influencers or relevant communities within your niche can also help amplify your project’s visibility. Pro-tip: Make use of relevant hashtags and keyword targeting to ensure your content reaches the right audiences and sparks their interest. Providing Incentives for Likes or Follows Widening your network is crucial in securing the support needed for your project. To motivate new viewers to follow or like your project's social media pages, consider offering incentives. This can include discounts on the final product or service, exclusive access to behind-the-scenes content, or entry into a giveaway. These incentives will not only foster engagement but also create a sense of exclusivity around your project, encouraging users to become invested in its success. Utilizing Crowdfunding Sites Platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe have revolutionized how projects can be funded, giving individuals the power to make their visions a reality through the collective efforts of many supporters. Research and select the platform that best suits your project and funding needs, and create a compelling campaign that clearly conveys what your project is, the impact it will have, and the rewards for backers. Updates on both your social media channels and your crowdfunding campaign are crucial to maintain the momentum and keep supporters engaged. Regular updates not only show your audience that their contribution is directly impacting the progress of the project, but also give them reasons to share and advocate for your cause beyond their initial involvement. Conclusion Harnessing the full potential of social media and crowdfunding platforms can create a snowball effect of support for your project. By talking to friends and family, creating a strong online presence, providing incentives for engagement, and utilizing crowdfunding sites, you will foster the interest and backing needed to see your project through to successful completion. Remember to lean on your network, maintain open lines of communication, and express gratitude for the support you receive – you never know just how far your project will go."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Q: Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity. Answer should be yes or no. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Team Trump is Neutral . As Hanson explains  using a document paid for by the Clinton campaign (the discredited Russian dossier)  the Obama administration engaged in an unprecedented abuse of power through the FISA courts as a means to spy on the  Trump  campaign  and  as we now know  this of course included actual wiretaps. This brazen spying and the overall Russia hoax was almost certainly the âinsurance policyâ Strzok and Page discussed with McCabe in the event of an unlikely  Trump  victory. But even if  Trump  had lost  that policy was still going to be used by President Hillary and  her  minions within the media and federal law enforcement as a bludgeon to personally destroy  Trump  as a Russian stooge â and by extension  to destroy his MAGA movement  which terrifies the political and media establishment even more than the Tea Party. However   Trump  did win  and as we now know  almost immediately after this victory the âinsurance policyâ was given the green-light. The first wave of this insurance policy came in the form of unceasing leaks to the Deep Stateâs most reliable co-conspirators â a compliant media. If they did not already know  it was through these illegal leaks that the media learned that the Obama administration had spied on  Team Trump  both during and after the election. Although they now regret reporting this fact  we know the media knew about Obamaâs spying because  time and again and again  the media gleefully reported the fact that the Obama administration had spied on  Team Trump  (these media reports are all documented in detail here). You see  in their own fevered minds  the media seemed certain that if the public was told that  Trump âs collusion with the Russians was so serious  his  team had to be surveilled by federal law enforcement   his  presidency would be over even before it began. Hence  the insurance policy. What the Deep State and its media collaborators did not count on  though  was  Trump . On March 4  early on a Saturday morning   Trump  tweeted  âTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my âwires tappedâ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!â â and this tweet blew the #ReleaseTheMemo scandal wide open. So soothed were media provincials by the velvet-lined bubbleâs reassurance that  Trump  had no chance of becoming president  they did not plan far enough about what to do if  Trump  won. And so  after  Trump  did win  for two whole weeks  the media did something it had not done for eight years  albeit accidentally â told the truth about the Obama administrationâs unprecedented politicization of the surveillance state.

Quidditch is a fast-paced game played on broomsticks, known for its magical and thrilling nature. It is played across the wizarding world including at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where students passionately participate in the House Cup competitions. In Quidditch, there are three types of balls, six goal hoops, and seven players on each team composed of three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker. The objective of the game is to score points and ultimately catch the Golden Snitch. The Quaffle is a red, leather-covered ball used by the Chaser, like Alicia in the given scenario, to score goals. Each goal scored with the Quaffle is worth 10 points. The Keeper, in this case, Oliver, is responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring by guarding the three goal hoops mounted on poles of varying heights. The Beaters are tasked with protecting their teammates from incoming Bludgers—two rogue balls that can cause injuries—by warding them off using a bat. Lastly, the Seeker's primary role is to catch the elusive, winged Golden Snitch, which earns their team 150 points and typically, but not always, results in victory. In the passage provided, the intensity of the game is evident as the Chaser, Alicia, attempts to score by dodging and changing direction. Meanwhile, the Keeper, Oliver, strives to prevent the opposing team from scoring by lunging towards the Quaffle.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From a political perspective the region is said to be unipolar with South Africa as a first regional power.  - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).  - Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world.  - In the geologic timescale, the Capitanian is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the uppermost or latest of three subdivisions of the Guadalupian epoch or series. The Capitanian lasted between and . It was preceded by the Wordian and followed by the Wuchiapingian.  - Tapinocephalia is one of the major groups of dinocephalian therapsids and the major herbivorous group. Tapinocephalia is thought to consist of three clades: Styracocephalidae, Titanosuchidae, and the very successful Tapinocephalidae. Notable tapinocephalians include \\"Moschops\\", \\"Tapinocephalus\\", and \\"Titanosuchus\\".  - In the geologic timescale, the Wuchiapingian or Wujiapingian (from in the Liangshan area of Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province) is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the lower or earlier of two subdivisions of the Lopingian epoch or series. The Wuchiapingian spans the time between and million years ago (Ma). It was preceded by the Capitanian and followed by the Changhsingian.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.  - Keratocephalus ( \`\` horned head '' ) is an extinct genus of tapinocephalian therapsid from the early Capitanian age of South Africa . It was found in the Lower and Middle Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone of the Karoo deposits , in the Lower Beaufort Beds in Beaufort West .  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46.7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 252.2 Mya. It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm.  - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian.   - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used.  - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety. Along the way, they encountered a dying Chinese woman, and Ruth agreed to care for her child as well. Moved by her personal story and her beautiful singing voice, Tom is soon smitten with the young woman. The answer is:","output":"Ruth Kirke was sent south with eight European children. She was a young idealistic schoolteacher who was responsible for transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta. Ruth faced numerous challenges along the way, including the torpedo attack on their steamship Tollare, which led to the need for rescue by the steamship Westonia, and the ensuing struggle to obtain financial assistance for the orphans in San Francisco. Despite these hardships, Ruth remained steadfast in her mission to ensure the children's safety and well-being, ultimately interacting with and moving the heart of Thomas Spencer Holliday III, the grandson of the commodore whose ship sank in the attack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Seeing all kinds of recent shooting incidents,I think it should be controlled more strictly than now. Somebody said that the person who has it in mind to kill another can do it without a gun,so the causes of murders are not guns but the trend of despising   life in the US. And they also insist that there is no clear evidence that the increasing number of murders is connected with possession  of guns,so the personal rights should not be restricted  by the reason that there is not enough evidence. Several months ago,I agreed with that partly. But as we know,the private groups like NRA have used the public opinion and persuaded the government to protect their profit. Other weapons such as knives,razors ,bats are made for their own usage. But guns are made for only one reason--to kill someone. Of course,there are people who have guns to protect themselves from the criminals. But crime is getting more cruel and severe nowadays,so actually even if someone has a gun,it is impossible to guard himself completely. As a substitute ,I think,if the possession of guns is controlled more strictly,people can live safer lives than now. There are other reasons to oppose the gun control (e.g.the possession of guns is historical inheritance  and represents that people's resistance  will be against tyrannical   government),but none of them can justify and explain today's serious situation in the US.

Understand that an asexual person can be intimate. Don’t expect an asexual person to change.\\"","output":"Title: Understanding and Navigating Asexual Relationships: Communication, Intimacy, and Acceptance Introduction In today's diverse and evolving world, it is important to recognize that there are different types of relationships that individuals can participate in, one of which is asexual relationships. It is crucial to understand the unique aspects of these relationships, such as the importance of open communication, intimacy, and respecting the boundaries of an asexual partner. This article will delve into understanding asexuality and the key elements necessary to maintain a healthy, loving relationship with an asexual person. Understanding Asexuality Asexuality is an orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction towards others, regardless of their gender. Contrary to popular belief, asexuality is not disorder nor is it limited to celibacy. It is a genuine and valid relationship orientation that exists on a spectrum, ranging from completely asexual to demisexual or gray-asexual (those who may experience limited or conditional sexual attraction). It is essential to respect and acknowledge an asexual person's identity, as it is just as valid as any other sexual orientation.  Importance of Communication Open communication is vital in any relationship, and it is even more crucial in an asexual relationship. It is essential to discuss and clarify boundaries when it comes to physical intimacy, emotional needs, and any other pertinent aspects of the partnership. It might be helpful to engage in an ongoing dialogue about each person's preferences and limitations, as they may evolve over time. For optimal communication, it is necessary to create a safe and supportive space where both partners feel comfortable sharing their feelings without fear of judgment or consequences. Additionally, engaging in active listening can help build a stronger connection and ensure that both partners' needs are understood and respected. Intimacy in Asexual Relationships There is a common misconception that asexual individuals are incapable of forming intimate connections with others, but this is far from the truth. Asexuality is solely concerned with sexual attraction and should not be associated with an inability to engage in intimacy. In fact, many asexual individuals desire deep emotional connections that may or may not involve various levels of physical intimacy. Emotional intimacy can manifest in various ways, such as through heartfelt conversations, shared interests, and supportive gestures. For some people, physical intimacy can be expressed through non-sexual acts like hugging, holding hands, or cuddling. The key is to find and appreciate the depth of intimacy that both partners are comfortable with and to establish a mutual understanding of how the boundaries will be maintained. Respecting an Asexual Person's Identity A vital aspect of a healthy asexual relationship is acknowledging and respecting the asexual person's identity. Under no circumstances should anyone expect or pressure an asexual person to change their orientation in order to conform to societal norms or fulfill their partner's desires. While it is natural for sex to be an integral component in most relationships, it is essential to recognize and respect the comfort and needs of an asexual partner. Final Thoughts Navigating an asexual relationship is not significantly different from any other form of relationship. The key lies in fostering open communication, exploring and understanding intimacy, and respecting each person's unique identity. By building a foundation of trust, love, and mutual support, both partners can create a lasting and fulfilling relationship, regardless of their sexual orientation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Want evidence that China is still making inroads in sub-Saharan Africa? Look no further than Zimbabwe, where the finance minister just announced a plan to begin using the Chinese yuan as an official currency within the southern African nation — part of a deal in which Beijing will also cancel about 40 million in debt. \\"There cannot be a better time to do this,\\" Zimbabwean Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa explained in a statement. The news is just the latest wild twist for the Zimbabwean currency. Six months ago, Zimbabwe's central bank announced that it was finally phasing out the local currency, the Zimbabwean dollar, after years of hyperinflation had left the currency virtually worthless. Zimbabweans were told that they would be able to exchange bank account balances of up to 175,000,000,000,000,000 Zimbabwean dollars for just 5 U.S. dollars – a heartbreaking sum, given that it was many people's life savings. In practice, the Zimbabwean dollar (and the 100 trillion notes that it eventually required) had already become little more than a kitsch souvenir. By 2008, foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the South African rand had become de facto currencies thanks to a booming black market. The following year, the government announced that it would officially allow businesses to use these currencies, effectively abandoning the Zimbabwean dollar. The new agreement would add the yuan to the list of currencies used for public transactions, and the Zimbabwean government said it would encourage its use. In the first stages of the plan, Reuters reports, Chinese tourists would be allowed to use the yuan to pay for services, and Zimbabwe would begin paying back its loans to China in the currency. The new switch may have other side effects, too: In recent months, some Zimbabwean economists had argued that the country should increase its use of the Chinese currency in a bid to get around U.S. sanctions. The move carries important symbolic weight in China. In recent years, the Beijing has pushed to internationalize its currency, with a fair degree of success. Late last month, the International Monetary Fund’s Executive Board voted in favor of acknowledging the yuan as one of the world's top currencies. However, the move's practical effect on the average Zimbabwean is hard to predict. At present, the majority of transactions in the country take place with U.S. dollars, though the situation (and supply of hard cash) varies across different regions. If anything, the deal is further evidence of the lengths that strongman Robert Mugabe, long isolated by much of the Western world, is willing to go to secure the future of his relationship with China. The Chinese government, which touts its \\"non-interference policy\\" in trade and aid relationships, has given Zimbabwe more than 1 billion in low-interest loans in the past five years, and Mugabe has considerable personal ties to Hong Kong. Zimbabwe was the first stop on Chinese President Xi Jinping's tour of Africa this month, and Mugabe greeted him by saying, \\"China is Zimbabwe's all-weather friend.\\" Notably, a Chinese group with murky ties to the government awarded Mugabe the Confucius Peace Prize – considered the Chinese version of the Nobel Peace Prize – in October, despite the Zimbabwean leader's long-standing reputation for human rights abuses. Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe wins China’s version of the Nobel Peace Prize Zimbabwe’s Mugabe says his people failed to protect Cecil the lion Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

Please answer the following question: Background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  Paragraph: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which parcel of land had soil with faster rates of decomposition? Answer:","output":"The parcel of land with faster rates of decomposition would be Bill's grassland-covered land.  Step 1: Understand the background information provided: - Forested land has well-developed soil with thick humus layers, slow rates of decomposition, and significant chemical weathering. - Forests have an excess of water due to higher precipitation than evapotranspiration. - This excess water causes podzolization, leaching Mg, Fe, and Al from the soil layers. Step 2: Compare the difference between Tom's forested land and Bill's grassland land: - Tom's land is characterized by slow rates of decomposition due to its forested nature. - Bill's land is covered with grasslands, which are not mentioned to have slow decomposition rates. Step 3: Determine which land has faster rates of decomposition: - Since the only information provided about decomposition rates is that forested lands have slow rates, we can infer that Bill's grassland-covered land would have faster rates of decomposition compared to Tom's forested land."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In 1978, I was 18 and was working as a nurse in a small town about 270 km away from Sydney, Australia. I was looking forward to having five days off from duty. Unfortunately, the only one train a day back to my home in Sydney had already left. So I thought I'd hitch a ride . I waited by the side of the highway for three hours but no one stopped for me. Finally, a man walked over and introduced himself as Gordon. He said that although he couldn't give me a lift, I should come back to his house for lunch. He noticed me standing for hours in the November heat and thought I must be hungry. I was doubtful as a young girl but he assured(...) me I was safe, and he also offered to help me find a lift home afterwards. When we arrived at his house, he made us sandwiches. After lunch, he helped me find a lift home. Twenty-five years later, in 2003, while I was driving to a nearby town one day, I saw an elderly man standing in the glaring heat, trying to hitch a ride. I thought it was another chance to repay someone for the favor I'd been given decades earlier. I pulled over and picked him up. I made him comfortable on the back seat and offered him some water. After a few moments of small talk, the man said to me, \\"You haven't changed a bit, even your red hair is still the same.\\" I couldn't remember where I'd met him. He then told me he was the man who had given me lunch and helped me find a lift all those years ago. It was Gordon. Question: What does the author want to tell the readers through the story?

The answer is:","output":"B: Giving sometimes produces nice results. Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks what the author wants to convey through the story. Step 2: Identify key points in the article - The author accepted help from a stranger (Gordon) in 1978. - The author helped an elderly man (who turned out to be Gordon) in 2003. Step 3: Compare key points with answer choices A: The story isn't only about giving rides. It's about giving help and kindness in general. B: The story shows how both author and Gordon benefitted from acts of giving. This answer aligns with the key points. C: Good manners are not the main focus of the story. D: The story doesn't advocate that everyone should offer free rides to others.

Please answer a question about the following article about Pharmaceutical industry: By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist).

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic. In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class. Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal.

It was some days later that Chebron and Amuba again paid a visit to the temple by moonlight. It was well-nigh a month since they had been there; for, save when the moon was up, the darkness and gloom of the courts, lighted only by the lamps of the altars, was so great that the place offered no attractions. Amuba, free from the superstitions which influenced his companion, would have gone with him had he proposed it, although he too felt the influence of the darkness and the dim, weird figures of the gods, seen but faintly by the lights that burned at their feet. But to Chebron, more imaginative and easily affected, there was something absolutely terrible in the gloomy darkness, and nothing would have induced him to wander in the silent courts save when the moon threw her light upon them.  On entering one of the inner courts they found a massive door in the wall standing ajar.  \\"Where does this lead to?\\" Amuba asked.  \\"I do not know. I have never seen it open before. I think it must have been left unclosed by accident. We will see where it leads to.\\"  Opening it they saw in front of them a flight of stairs in the thickness of the wall.  \\"It leads up to the roof,\\" Chebron said in surprise. \\"I knew not there were any stairs to the roof, for when repairs are needed the workmen mount by ladders.\\"  \\"Let us go up, Chebron; it will be curious to look down upon the courts.\\"  1.

Make sure to soak the fabric thoroughly, that way you loosen up the material and remove as much dirt, grime, and gunk as possible. If you’d like, you can use a power washer instead of a hose. Just make sure to hold the nozzle at least 2 ft (24 in) away from the soft top to avoid damaging it. Spray the soft top thoroughly with either auto shampoo, like Chemical Guys Foaming Soap, or a vehicle fabric cleaner, like Ammo Shag Fabric Cleaner. Then, rub the solution with an interior cleaning brush to agitate it. When you’re finished, rinse off the shampoo with clean water.  For the best results, move your brush in straight line motions. To get dirt out of a corner or seam, tap the area with the end of your brush. For most jeeps, a thorough cleaning should take around 20 minutes. You can purchase auto shampoo and vehicle fabric cleaner at auto supply stores. Over time, stubborn patches of soil, bird droppings, or green mold may stain your jeep’s soft top fabric. To remove these patches, shampoo the affected areas and gently scrub them with a stiff bristle brush. This will force the stains up, creating a paste-like substance that you can rinse off with water.  As with your interior cleaning brush, move the stiff bristle brush in straight line motions for the best results. Use this technique sparingly to avoid damaging the material. To dry the fabric, purchase a shammy cloth like The Absorber or Mighty Cleaner. Then, press the towel down into your soft top fabric to dry it off. When you’ve removed as much water as you can, park your jeep in a warm place so it can finish drying.  To prevent mold, only air dry your jeep after you’ve removed as much water as possible. If you’d prefer, you can use a microfiber towel instead. However, make sure you use and wash the cloth a few times beforehand, otherwise it may leave unwanted particles on the hood. Do not use a terry towel or paper towels to dry your hood. Doing so will leave small amounts of residue that are difficult to remove. Summary:","output":"1.

Read this article and answer this question In 1877 the price of British-grown wheat averaged 56 shillings and 9 pence a quarter and for the rest of the nineteenth century it never reached within 10 shillings of that figure. In 1878 the price fell to 46 shillings and 5 pence. In 1886 the wheat price decreased to 31 shillings a quarter. By 1885 wheat-growing land declined by a million acres (4,000 km²) (28½%) and the barley area had dwindled greatly also.  Britains dependence on imported grain during the 1830s was 2%; during the 1860s it was 24%; during the 1880s it was 45%, (for wheat alone during the 1880s it was 65%.) The 1881 Census in the United Kingdom showed a decline of 92,250 in agricultural labourers in the ten years since 1871, with an increase of 53,496 urban labourers. Many of these had previously been farm workers who migrated to the cities to find employment, despite agricultural labourers wages being higher than those of Europe.

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .  Now, I have a new situation: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D.  Answer this question please: Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B? Answer:","output":"According to Bohr's model, Cat B - the electron with lower energy - would be positioned closer to the nucleus. Bohr hypothesized that electrons with less energy are found at lower energy levels or shells, which are closer to the nucleus. In this situation, the energy levels are like concentric spheres circling around the nucleus. The innermost spheres have lower energy levels and are closer to the nucleus while the outer spheres represent higher energy levels and are farther from the nucleus. Borrowing from Bohr's electron shell model, you can visualize Cat B (sections with lower energy) as being located in the inner circles close to the nucleus, due to its lower energy level. On the other hand, Cat A which represents electrons with higher energy, would be in an outer shell that is farther from the nucleus due to its higher energy state. To reiterate, the location of electrons in Bohr's model is fundamentally tied to their energy status. The lower the energy, the closer the electron is to the nucleus, and the higher the energy, the farther it is. Therefore, according to Greg's categories, Cat B (electrons with lower energy) would be closer to the nucleus than Cat A (electrons with higher energy)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Those rules require UK banks to be able to meet long-term capital requirements. The bank, in which the Co-operative Group still has a 20% stake, was rescued from the brink of collapse by a group of hedge funds in 2013. In a statement, the bank also said talks were continuing over the separation of its pension fund from the Co-operative Group's scheme. Under the current arrangement, the bank must carry a share of the Co-op Group's Â£8bn pension liabilities, something which is proving unattractive to potential investors. Meanwhile, the bank said that as well as exploring potential recapitalisation it was also proceeding with its sale process. Earlier this year it reported its fifth annual loss in a row, although the Â£477m deficit for 2016 was an improvement on the Â£610m loss recorded in 2015. When it offered itself for sale, the Co-op Bank blamed low interest rates and the higher-than-expected cost of its turnaround plan for its failure to meet the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) rules.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: We are surrounded by mixed messages about mistakes: we're told we earn by making them, but we work hard to avoid them. So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make mistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't. Experiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were praised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward usually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than being smart-far more often selected the more difficult task. If we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in order to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to make mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being perfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went wrong and how to get better. We don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us that if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the underlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out. Mistakes need to be seen not as a failure to learn, but as a guide to what still needs to be learned.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned areas along the coast within 60 miles of the earthquake epicenter to be aware of the possibility of a tsunami and take appropriate action, a statement read. The US Geological Survey said the quake struck off the east coast of Honshu, some 267 miles northeast of Tokyo, at a depth of 6.2 miles. A 24-inch tsunami reached the coastal town of Ofunato, in Iwate prefecture, shortly after noon. The meteorological agency warned that a tsunami of about 20 inches would hit the coast. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said a Pacific-wide tsunami was not expected. \\"We have confirmed that small tsunami have come up on the shores, but we have no reports of damage at this point,\\" said Shinobu Nagano, an emergency and disaster response official in Iwate prefecture. \\"We are still trying to determine the impact of the quake.\\" Some train lines in the area were temporarily stopped after the quake, but they were restarted shortly after noon.

Select from: [I] description; [II] entity; [III] abbreviation; [IV] human; [V] numeric; [VI] location;","output":"The answer to this question would be [V] numeric. The temperature setting for an oven is typically stated as a numeric value, usually in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius.  When baking Peachy Oat Muffins or any type of bake, it's crucial to preheat your oven to the right temperature. The suggested temperature for each recipe will vary depending on several elements such as the size of the muffins, the type of oven used (whether it's gas, electric, convection, etc.), the ingredients in the recipe, and the desired texture and color of the muffins. Incorrect oven temperature can lead to uneven baking, with the outside of the muffin getting burned while the inside remains undercooked, or the muffins not rising properly. If we use the conventional oven baking standards as a starting point, most muffins are usually baked at 375-400 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 190-200 degrees Celsius). However, this might vary slightly depending on the specific Peachy Oat Muffins recipe you follow. In addition, it's essential to note that oven temperatures are not always accurate. Variations in temperature can occur due to the oven's age, the oven's calibration, or other factors. Therefore, an oven thermometer can be a useful tool to check your oven's actual temperature. To prevent the muffins from baking unevenly, you can also rotate the muffin tin halfway through the recommended baking time. This helps to ensure that all the muffins are exposed to the same amount of heat. Remember, baking is both a science and an art. As you gain more experience, you may find that you need to adjust the suggested oven temperatures and baking times to suit your personal preference and your particular oven.

After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellant, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City (Joker, Penguin, Riddler, and Catwoman). The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a penguin, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch).

Context: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Why is Trump trying to pass this tax plan? Options:  A. He hates he middle class  B. not enough information  C. He wants America to fail  D. He and his friends will benefit greatly from it The answer is:","output":"D.

Trump argues that these tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. However, Democrats criticize the tax plan for disproportionately benefiting the wealthy and corporations at the expense of working middle-class families.

Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less.  and a hint : A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The first thing you should include is the amount of the loan and the interest rate. Your state has probably set a maximum interest rate you can charge as well, which you can find online.  If you want to charge interest, research your state and federal laws. For example, the IRS requires that you charge a minimum interest rate, otherwise, they may interpret the loan as a “gift” for tax purposes. Sample language could read: “Lender promises to loan 5,000 USD to Borrower. Borrower promises to pay back this amount to Lender, with interest payable on the unpaid principal at a rate of 4% per annum, calculated yearly not in advance.” You should include the date the loan will be paid in full. You also might want to attach to your payment agreement a schedule listing when monthly payments are due. On your schedule, list the day of each payment and the amount that the borrower should pay. If you aren’t charging interest, then divide the amount by the number of monthly payments. Sample language could read: “Borrower will make payments as set forth on Schedule I. The Loan will be repaid in full on August 12, 2016.” The borrower might find that he or she can pay off the loan early. You should explain in the payment agreement whether this is allowed. Generally, prepayment is a good deal for the lender because he or she will get the money paid back early; however, the lender would lose out on some interest. A sample prepayment provision could read: “Borrower has the right to make payments of principal before they are due. Borrower may make a full prepayment or partial prepayments without penalty, provided Borrower gives advance notice of its intent to prepay. Lender will use prepayments to reduce the amount of principal. If Borrower makes a partial prepayment, there will be no change to the due date or in the amount of the monthly payment unless Lender agrees.” The seller might want to charge a penalty or additional interest if the borrower is late with payment. You should explain what the late charge will be and how you will calculate it. For example, if you want to charge a percentage penalty, you could write: “If Lender has not received full amount of any monthly payment within 15 calendar days after the date it is due, Lender may assess a late charge to Borrower of 1% of any overdue payment.” “Default” occurs when the borrower does not follow the terms of the payment agreement. Typically, the borrower will default when he or she misses a payment. However, the lender usually reserves the right to declare a default.  The lender usually reserves the right to immediately demand payment of all outstanding principal and interest. Sample language: “If Borrower defaults in the performance of any obligation under this Agreement, Lender may declare the principal amount owing and any interest due immediately due and payable.” With this provision, the lender doesn’t have to declare a default, but he or she has the option if payment is missed.

Overheating would not be a concern in this situation. b). feel warm - Feeling warm in such a cold environment is also unlikely unless the person has adequate clothing or shelter to keep themselves insulated from the frigid temperatures. c). fly - This answer does not make sense as it is not related to the consequences of being stranded in a cold environment.

Despite 423 passing yards&#8212;including a franchise-record 98-yard touchdown pass to receiver Brandin Cooks&#8212;and four touchdowns from Drew Brees, the Raiders came from behind to win 35-34. The Raiders scored a touchdown with 47 seconds remaining in the game to bring them within one point. Instead of kicking an extra point, Raiders coach Jack Del Rio ordered a two-point conversion, which quarterback Derek Carr successfully converted with a pass to receiver Michael Crabtree. The Saints received the kickoff and Brees led the team down the field in two plays to give kicker Wil Lutz a chance at a game-winning 61-yard field goal, but the kick went wide left.

The new model could be used by movie marketers to change marketing tactics before a box-office failure. Article:","output":"Title: Google's Box-office Predictions: A Game-Changer for Movie Marketing Google, the internet search giant, has recently announced that it can predict box-office takings with an impressive accuracy of 94 per cent. This innovative forecasting ability takes place as early as four weeks before a movie's opening weekend. The implications of this newly developed model can potentially revolutionize the movie marketing industry, allowing marketers to alter their tactics before facing a box-office failure. To achieve this level of precision, Google analyzes massive search data to make its predictions. The company conducted extensive research which revealed that moviegoers consult an average of 13 sources before making a decision on which film to watch. By carefully monitoring search trends related to these sources, Google can effectively gauge public interest in an upcoming movie release, thus providing valuable insights on expected box-office performance weeks in advance. This groundbreaking predictive model presents significant opportunities for movie marketers, who can use the information to adapt their marketing strategies accordingly. If a movie's projected box-office performance seems to be underwhelming, this early-warning system allows marketers to modify their tactics and generate increased public interest. On the other hand, if a movie is anticipated to do well, this projection can help reaffirm marketing strategies and boost producers' confidence in the success of their film. In summary, Google's ability to predict box-office takings with unparalleled accuracy has the potential to transform the movie marketing landscape. The new model can serve as an essential tool for marketers to effectively adjust their promotional tactics, ultimately helping movie producers and studios to avoid financial losses from box-office failures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To find the value of \\"p\\", we will divide both sides by 6: (6 * p) / 6 = 0 / 6 This simplifies to: p = 0 This means that if you put 0 stickers on each toy car, both sides would have the same amount of stickers!

More than 100 women took part in the protest at Aventura Mall after mom Kristie Quinones was asked to leave, according to TMZ. Nicole described being involved as 'an honor' and again posted a photo of herself breastfeeding to Instagram. It drew scrutiny and backlash from people who deemed it innapropriate, prompting the 'boob haters' who had lashed out at","output":"her to further intensify their criticism. Undeterred by the negativity, Ashley Nicole continued to stand her ground, asserting her right to breastfeed her child in public as a natural and entirely appropriate act. As the protest gained momentum, the Aventura Mall management issued an official statement, admitting that they had made a mistake in asking Kristie Quinones to leave and promising to train their staff more effectively on the rights of breastfeeding mothers. They also emphasized their commitment to creating a safe and welcoming environment for all shoppers, including nursing mothers. The protest not only sparked a significant conversation about public breastfeeding but also led to multiple online forums and platforms becoming breeding grounds for discussions on the topic. Advocates for breastfeeding in public argued that the act should be regarded as a normal part of motherhood and that the onus was on society to become more accepting and supportive of it. Meanwhile, opponents opined that public breastfeeding is a private act that should be conducted behind closed doors. Despite the controversial nature of the issue, the protest at the Aventura Mall ultimately served as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for one's rights and challenging outdated notions of propriety. By bringing together like-minded individuals in solidarity, the protest highlighted the potential for change that can arise from collective voices and action. Furthermore, it encouraged society at large to continue engaging in an open and respectful dialogue on the matter of breastfeeding in public spaces and the extent to which it should be tolerated. In conclusion, the right ending to this passage sees Ashley Nicole and fellow protesters emerging as catalysts for change and greater acceptance of public breastfeeding through their determined stance against societal stigma and outdated beliefs. Their efforts contributed to the fostering of a more inclusive and supportive environment for breastfeeding mothers, paving the way for future understanding and acceptance of this critical aspect of motherhood, ultimately leading to greater awareness and empathy."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

The first option provides a relevant alternative method to request recommendations and adds information about the importance of the recommender's connections and accomplishments. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - The second option talks about a sheet of paper with selected options, which is irrelevant to the context of requesting a LinkedIn recommendation. - The third option focuses on finding a contact and mentioning \\"@linkedin,\\" which doesn't make sense in the context of asking for a recommendation. - The fourth option introduces the concept of two types of recommendations (friend and non-friend), but it doesn't provide a clear way to continue the process of asking for a recommendation.

Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 - June 10, 2004), known professionally as Ray Charles, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and composer. Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called \\"Brother Ray\\". He was often referred to as \\"The Genius\\". Charles was blind from the age of seven. Charles's renewed chart success, however, proved to be short lived, and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations. The rise of psychedelic rock and harder forms of rock and R&B music had reduced Charles' radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his masters had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: people either liked them a lot or strongly disliked them. His 1972 album A Message from the People included his unique gospel-influenced version of \\"America the Beautiful\\" and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of \\"America the Beautiful\\" because it was very drastically changed from the song's original version.  In 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit \\"Living for the City\\" later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album True to Life, remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as Aretha Franklin, were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show Saturday Night Live.  In April 1979, his version of \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" was proclaimed the state song of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature. Although he had notably supported the American Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the Sun City resort in South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott protesting that country's apartheid policy.

Combine the constant terms on the right-hand side of the equation. 0 = 182k + (9745 - 3921) 2. Subtract 3921 from 9745. 9745 - 3921 = 5824 So now the equation becomes: 0 = 182k + 5824 3. The goal is to isolate k, so subtract 5824 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 5824 = 182k + 5824 - 5824 -5824 = 182k 4.

However, three hours after those reports had surfaced and emergency crews mobilized a massive search and rescue operation, the Coast Guard was unable to find any evidence of a damaged boat or any victims. The search was officially suspended late tonight, and the Coast Guard said it is investigating whether the initial distress call was a hoax.      As of 7:30 p.m., dozens of EMS crews, ambulances and helicopters at Gateway National Recreation Area had left the scene without treating any passengers.      \\"Basically there are no patients coming,\\" said John Grembowiecz, the New Jersey EMS Task Force leader from the scene. \\"It has not been verified, so we are demobilizing now.\\"      The six medevac helicopters, 15 ambulances and two medical buses with the capacity to carry 20 patients were all released from Sandy Hook, he said.      The initial report of an explosion came in around 4:20 p.m. about 17 miles out to sea, the Coast Guard said. At the time, the agency said 21 people had jumped ship. Some escaped on lifeboats, the Coast Guard said.      Nine people were reported injured, according to Gateway National Recreation Area spokesman John Warren. The Coast Guard asked the Gateway National Recreation Area help arrange transportation for the injured, Warren said.      View full size      As of 5:50 p.m., the Coast Guard had not yet found any debris or lifeboats. The agency said the initial emergency call they received said the boat, a yacht named the Blind Date, exploded and sank in the Atlantic Ocean.      Two Coast Guard helicopters, three 47-foot motor life boats, three New York Police Department helicopters and a Nassau County helicopter responded to the scene. Two good Samaritan boats in the area of the accident were also assisting, a Coast Guard spokesman said.      The N.J. State Police had two medevac helicopters docked in the area waiting to assist in the rescue effort, according to Sgt. Brian Polite, a spokesman for the agency.      A large staging was set up on a fenced-off field at the Fort Hancock area of Sandy Hook. Six helicopters and numerous emergency vehicles, including trucks, SUVs and fire trucks were at the staging area, waiting for the victims to arrive. Vehicles were from as far away as North Brunswick.      View full size      As of around 6:50 p.m. three of the helicopters took off from the staging area, appearing to be headed inland without any of the passengers.      Of the 10 ambulances on the scene, seven were seen leaving the area. Several ambulance drivers said they had been released. Fire engines were also leaving, creating a caravan of emergency vehicles snaking away from Sandy Hook.      Max Ross, an emergency medical technician from Rumson said all rescue crews that had gathered at the staging area were released as of around 7:15 p.m. except for crews from Sea Bright and Highlands.      \\"At this time (the report of an explosion) is unfounded.\\" Ross said. \\"They're still treating it as if it's real, but they haven't found anything.\\"      This case is now being investigated as a possible hoax call, the Coast Guard announced late tonight. The agency said it offers a reward of up to 1,000 \\"for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of anyone responsible for making a false distress or hoax call to the U.S. Coast Guard.\\"      Making a false distress call is a federal felony with a maximum penalty of five to 10 years in prison, the Coast Guard added, along with a 250,000 fine and reimbursement to the Coast Guard for the cost of performing the search.

Recently, he visited two countries, France and Germany. He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other.  But I can use this background: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units.

Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, the cause of the mutiny was not conclusively established.

But Spurs need firepower with strikers Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado not performing in the Premier League. Tottenham's interest cooled in the England man after his injury. But a return in January could be on the cards for the Spurs boss. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Tottenham's Pursuit of Jay Rodriguez: A Long-Awaited Return After a long-term absence due to a cruciate ligament injury, rumors are swirling about Jay Rodriguez potentially making a return to football in January, with Tottenham Hotspur showing renewed interest in the striker. The Spurs have been desperate for additional firepower as their current strikers, Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado, have continued to underperform in the Premier League, leaving the team at a disadvantage. Jay Rodriguez initially caught the attention of Spurs due to his impressive performance in the 2013/2014 season with Southampton. Scoring 15 Premier League goals in 33 appearances, Rodriguez was quickly making a name for himself in English football. As a result, Tottenham's interest was piqued, with the club considering him as a suitable option to bolster their attacking options. Unfortunately, Rodriguez experienced a devastating blow in April 2014 when a severe cruciate ligament injury sidelined him for an extended period, causing Tottenham to put their pursuit of the striker on hold. However, recent developments seem to signify that Spurs' interest in Rodriguez has not waned, and that they may potentially be rekindling their pursuit of the talented forward to boost their strike force in the Premier League. In light of Adebayor and Soldado's continued lackluster performances, the acquisition of Rodriguez could provide a much-needed boost to the team's offensive capabilities. His return to football in January might signify a turning point for Tottenham's season, allowing them the opportunity to climb up in the league standings. Although the club's interest in Rodriguez had cooled down after his injury, their current situation signals the necessity for a striker of his caliber. Regaining his pre-injury form may prove to be a challenge, but if Rodriguez can successfully overcome this hurdle, there is no denying the potential impact he could bring upon his return to the pitch. With a revitalized Tottenham squad eager to gain momentum in the league, the acquisition of Rodriguez may be the key to unlocking their potential. The prospect of the England man joining the London club could reignite their pursuit for success and inspire a sense of unity among teammates, fans, and staff alike. Football, after all, is a game of comebacks - not only for teams, but also for individual players. Spurs' manager undoubtedly recognizes the distinct advantages that Rodriguez could offer the team. As January approaches, fans eagerly wait for news of the official transfer and hope that this decision will enable Tottenham to realize their top-flight aspirations. A resurgence in Rodriguez's career paired with the invigorated Tottenham attack could pave the way to future success in both domestic and European competitions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Answer the question below:   Sally is pulling two wagons.

Maureen Stapleton plays his sickly mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss, and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how he came to own the pet store. He turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation (49.95, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name \\"Dangerously\\" in the mobster world. There are some hilarious scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny's foul-mouthed mother who needs ever organ in her body replaced. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, as does Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA who won't \\"play ball\\" with crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a standout as Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry face. The movie gets a little tired toward the end, but it's well worth seeing, and Keaton is terrific as good boy/bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underrated when it was released, and like Keaton's other gem, \\"Night Shift,\\" you don't hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find \\"Johnny Dangerously\\" immensely enjoyable. Now, what is this review like? Pick from: [i] negative; [ii] positive;","output":"This review is largely positive.

They mention that the movie may lose steam towards the end, but ultimately they find it worth watching and \\"immensely enjoyable.\\" The reviewer also points out that this film, along with Keaton's other film \\"Night Shift,\\" may have been underrated during its release and doesn't receive much attention today, but it seems they feel it deserves more recognition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Christopher was a skilled cook and had known Dennis, his roommate and friend of five years, long enough to know the food that warmed his heart the most – Bisquick biscuits. Over the years, they had shared countless meals at their small kitchen table, each time weaving threads of memory with each bite, coffee sip, and laughter. Ironically, it wasn't the elaborate holiday meals or the exotic dishes they experimented with on weekends that Dennis loved the most. It was Bisquick biscuits, a simple, heartwarming dish that reminded him of his childhood. For Dennis, Bisquick biscuits were more than a food item, intertwining nostalgia, comfort, and the homely simplicity of baking together. Every small crumb was reminiscent of early weekend mornings, streaming sunshine through the kitchen window, the aroma of his mother’s baking, and the sheer joy radiating in the house when these biscuits were baked. Christopher knew this well, hence he made the biscuits, not just to satisfy a craving or to present a menu item, but to evoke fond memories and feelings of warmth and home for Dennis. Baking the biscuits was a ritual for Christopher. He started by preheating the oven to the right temperature. He had mastered the ratio of Bisquick mix to milk through experience and a fine touch. The way he kneaded the dough, softly and with care, was a testament to the fact that he was doing this out of love for his friend. Then he gently rolled it out on a clean, flour-dusted surface, ensuring it was the perfect thickness before cutting out each biscuit. Then came the most crucial part - baking them to perfection. Christopher knew exactly how to control the heat and timing to ensure they didn't burn or stay undercooked. As he placed the biscuits in the oven, the anticipation begun to build. The kitchen filled with a sweet, buttery aroma that made their mouths water and had a way of coaxing Dennis out of whatever corner of the house he was in.  Once golden brown and just right, Christopher took them out from the oven, letting them cool enough to be eagerly devoured yet remain warm enough to melt butter. The sights and smells were almost as important as the taste itself. With each biscuit Christopher served, he served a tangible manifestation of their friendship, their shared memories, and a story that was uniquely their own. Over these biscuits, both men often engaged in profound conversations, sometimes jovial, sometimes bitter, sometimes a dissection of worldly philosophies, while at other times simply a recap of their day. These Bisquick biscuits reinforced their bond. So, whether it was a cold winter evening, a lazy Sunday morning, or an attempt to cheer up Dennis after a tough day, the answer was often found in Christopher’s meticulously prepared, hot Bisquick biscuits. Because Dennis loved eating Bisquick biscuits, and Christopher loved creating these moments with his cooking and companionship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He cryptically promises his father he will \\"bring him home.\\" Rama joins a heavily armed 20-man elite police squad, including Officers Bowo and Dagu, Sergeant Jaka, and Lieutenant Wahyu, for a raid on a high-rise apartment block in Jakarta's slums. The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi, who, along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block and lets criminals around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the SWAT van, and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors.

Chad Pennington found Jerricho Cotchery on a 28-yard completion and rookie running back Leon Washington picked up 23 yards on a sweep around end before Washington scored on a 5-yard touchdown run. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma.

Context: WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said. Harris spoke after touring a detention facility and speaking with several mothers.​ Trump's call for Congress to postpone action came as House Republican leaders failed to garner enough support for two bills that would overhaul U.S. immigration laws and bolster border security.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? is a really special walk in the woods .","output":"The sentiment of the sentence, \\"is a really special walk in the woods,\\" can be considered positive. This is due to a few factors that contribute to the positive tone found within the sentence. Firstly, the term \\"really\\" acts as an intensifier for the adjective \\"special,\\" amplifying the positive sentiment behind it. When something is described as \\"special,\\" it typically signifies a unique, enjoyable, or extraordinary quality about it. This adjective helps communicate that the walk in the woods stands out in a positive way from other walks one might have experienced. Additionally, the setting of the sentence, \\"the woods,\\" can also contribute to the positive sentiment. For many people, the woods are a serene and calming environment, offering peace and tranquility away from the noise and chaos of daily life. A walk in the woods can evoke feelings of relaxation, contemplation, and closeness to nature – all of which tend to be positive. Moreover, choosing a positive perspective can also lead to this interpretation. The sentence does not convey any negative emotions, such as sadness, fear, or anger. It appears to focus on a peaceful, lovely experience. As such, the positive interpretation seems more fitting. Taking into account these factors, the sentiment of the sentence, \\"is a really special walk in the woods,\\" can reasonably be seen as positive. This is because the words and context within the sentence evoke feelings of joy, uniqueness, and connection to nature, which are all associated with positive emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some say that Scottish and English writers used the expression a long time ago. Others say it was first used in the northeastern American states known as New England. The housewives of New England cut their apples in even slices. Then they filled pie pans with them in an organized way, row upon row. As one writer said, the women of New England loved to have everything in its place. This perhaps explains why it generally is believed that the expression \\"apple-pie order\\" began in New England. Another old expression, \\"apple of discord\\", comes from ancient mythology ,however. The myth says that all the gods and goddesses were sitting around the table tocelebrate the marriage of Thetis and Peleus. One of the goddesses-Discord-was a troublemaker. She threw away a golden apple on the table to be given as a prize to the most beautiful goddess. At one time, the tomato was called a love apple. That was a mistake. This is how the mistake happened: In the sixteenth century, Spain brought the tomato from South America after Spanish explorers had landed there. Spain then sold the tomato to Morocco.  Italian traders carried it on to Italy. The Italian name for the tomato was \\"pomo di Moro\\"-apple of the Moors. When French growers brought it in from Italy, they thought \\"di Moro\\" meant\\"d'amour\\"-the French word for love. And so \\"pomo di Moro\\" became the apple of love. People believe many things about the apple. One belief is that it has great power of keeping people healthy. A very common expression is \\"an apple a day keeps the doctor away. \\" Another belief is based on fact.  The expression is \\"one rotten apple spoils the barrel. \\"When an apple begins to go bad, it ruins all the other apples around it in the container. The expression has come to mean that one bad person in a group can cause everyone to act bad. Question: Which of the following expressions is about health? Yes or no, is the answer \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the expression \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\\" is about health. This proverb suggests that eating an apple every day may contribute to maintaining good health and potentially prevent the need for frequent visits to the doctor. The saying emphasizes the importance of consuming fruits, particularly apples, as part of a healthy diet to promote overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the next sentence. Victoria was always ahead on her bills but Elena was not because","output":"Elena often struggled with managing her finances due to a combination of factors, including her impulsive spending habits, lack of financial education, and a tendency to prioritize her social life over her fiscal responsibilities. This contrast between the two friends' financial behaviors resulted in a dynamic that sometimes caused tension in their relationship, as Victoria tried her best to provide guidance and support to Elena without seeming overly critical or judgmental. Elena's impulsive spending habits often led her to make purchases without considering the long-term consequences or how they would affect her overall financial situation. Whether it was a spontaneous shopping spree, or dining out at a fancy restaurant she could hardly afford, Elena's spending often reflected her emotional state, as she sought comfort and excitement in material things. This behavior not only left her finances constantly in a fragile state, but also made it incredibly difficult for her to save for the future or establish any sort of financial cushion. One of the core reasons behind Elena's struggles was her lack of financial education. She never took the time to learn about budgeting, saving, or investing, which made it nearly impossible for her to develop a solid financial plan or stick to it. To make matters worse, her parents never emphasized the importance of financial stability, leaving her ill-prepared to face the challenges of adulthood and financial independence. Additionally, Elena's social life played a significant role in her financial troubles. Always eager to join friends for a night out or weekend getaway, Elena frequently overspent on experiences and social activities, believing that maintaining her social life was more important than establishing financial stability. She was often consumed by the fear of missing out (FOMO), which only exacerbated her tendency to overspend. In stark contrast, Victoria had an excellent grasp on her own finances, thanks to a strong foundation in financial education and a history of good financial habits. She practiced disciplined spending and saving, which allowed her to stay ahead on her bills and steadily build her savings. Recognizing the struggles her friend faced, Victoria tried her best to share her knowledge with Elena, encouraging her to attend financial seminars and offering to help her create a budget. While Victoria's intentions were nothing but genuine, Elena often felt judged and criticized by her friend, which made it hard for her to embrace the lessons and adopt better financial habits. Despite their differing views on personal finance, both friends recognized the value of their friendship and continued to support and learn from each other, hoping that one day, Elena could find a balance between her social life and financial stability that would allow her to live a more secure and fulfilling life. In conclusion, the contrast between Victoria's careful financial management and Elena's lack thereof provides a clear illustration of the impact that financial education, family background, and personal habits can have on monetary stability. As they navigate their way through life, both women ultimately find value in learning from their differences and sharing their experiences to help each other grow and thrive in their respective journeys."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  a malicious spirit  for the following movie plot:  Darma (Pierre Andre) is traumatised by the mysterious death of his fiancee, Rose (Intan Ladyana) who had killed herself.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Do an inventory of your energy usage, your consuming habits, and your reliance on unsustainable products and make a list of ways you intend to curb your unsustainable activities and habits and replace them with sustainable ones. Set yourself a timeline to meet, with harder changes coming at the end of the timeline. For instance, consider eating meat-free meals twice a week. You could also make a point of turning off lights and electronics when not in use. Another idea is to commit yourself to walking to work or the market as often as possible. Read the labels of origin and manufacture of your goods, and decide if you can make better choices. Find out if your products are certified as sustainable, organic, locally made, or Fair Trade. There are lots of things a label can tell you if you choose to read it.  Sustainable products include those that are sustainably obtained, for example, all forest products with the FSC logo are logged using sustainable forestry practices. Organic products, such as cotton clothing, cause much less environmental damage than non-organic methods, such as conventional cotton-growing practices. Locally made products decrease the impact on the environment because they travel less miles, which means less emissions, to make it to the consumer. Fair Trade products are ethically produced, and take into account the native people as well as the environmental resources, in the areas they are produced. If you can’t find a label, email or post a message on Facebook to the company, retailer, or manufacturer responsible for the product. Facebook is a great method because lots of other people will check out your question and be waiting for the answer! Make a choice to use public transportation more often than you do already to cut back on the amount of noxious fumes introduced into the environment. Carpooling is also a great way to reduce emissions. You can also ride your bicycle or walk to close destinations. Today is a great day to sign up and get involved with people who are doing rather than talking or reading. Sign up to help restore an old building in town, or join a local water conservation group. If you have a yard or garden that sits empty, make a plan to plant fruits, veggies, and herbs for personal use, or even bee-friendly flowers. Growing your own food helps reduce strain on the environment. Things you can do that will make the most of your garden include:  Compost your scraps. Use this compost to boost the garden's production. Create a part of it that is edible, and plant seasonal crops. For those of you with merely a balcony or a tiny plot, you can still grow food such as a potato in a bag and small sprout gardens in your windowsill. You could also join a community gardening project. Grow herbs and spices that add flavor to your food, look beautiful in the garden, and that also have medicinal, beauty, healing, spiritual, or other uses. Borrow a book from the library to learn more about herb and spice use. These plants don't need much space, and they can be grown on a windowsill or balcony. Encourage beneficial and friendly wildlife to your garden through careful planting and shelter creation. Learn to make your own garden sprays using items that are toxic to bugs and mildew but not to people and pets! Refuse to buy unsustainable products, reduce your consumption, reuse items and materials around your home, and recycle everything you can. All that clutter has to go somewhere, so make a choice not to bring in into the house to begin with and if it has to leave, make good choices about where it's going to end up! Think about borrowing, sharing, donating, time-sharing, etc., instead of buying for keeps. Or pass it on after you've read/used/watched/worn/enjoyed it. Summary:","output":"To transition to a more sustainable lifestyle, start by inventorying your energy usage, consumption habits, and dependence on unsustainable products. Develop a list of ways to decrease your unsustainable activities and replace them with eco-friendly alternatives. Set a timeline for achieving these goals, with more challenging changes scheduled for later. Some actions to consider include eating meat-free meals, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, walking or biking to work, and paying closer attention to product labels for certification as sustainable, organic, locally-made, or Fair Trade. Reach out to companies if you need more information or look for alternatives if necessary. Utilize public transportation or carpool to reduce emissions. Get involved in local projects or groups that focus on sustainability, such as water conservation or building restoration. Transform your garden or balcony into a source of fresh produce and herbs, incorporating composting and eco-friendly gardening practices. Encourage beneficial wildlife and learn about natural pest control methods.  Finally, practice the principles of refusing, reducing, reusing, and recycling to minimize waste, and explore alternate means of ownership like borrowing, sharing, and donating.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: Which sea bird found around the shores of Britain is a larger relative of the Shag?","output":"The larger relative of the Shag amongst the seabirds found around the shores of Britain is the Cormorant. Both the Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and the Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) belong to the family Phalacrocoracidae under the order Suliformes. Although they share several characteristics - most notably they are both black seabirds with an affinity for coastal areas, their wildlife habitats, and with similar diets largely comprised of fish and marine invertebrates - there are certain attributes that set them apart, and one of these distinctions is size. The Cormorant has a size advantage over the Shag. Cormorants are larger birds and can reach a body length of approximately 70 to 100 centimeters, translating to a wingspan of about 120 to 160 centimeters. Adult males are especially big and can weigh from 2 to 2.5 kg. Females are slightly smaller than males. They also possess a sturdy body shape with a long neck and a strong bill that curves towards the tip. In comparison, the Shag is quite small and more delicate. Adult Shags generally measure between 68 to 78 centimeters in length, sporting a wingspan of 95 to 110 centimeters. Their body weight ranges from 1 to 1.5 kg, so they are lighter compared to the Cormorant. Apart from the size difference, there are other distinctions between the two species. Cormorants have a broader distribution range than Shags. They are found virtually worldwide, in coastal and inland waters of Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australasia, while Shags are typically confined to the cooler coastal areas of Western and Northern Europe, including the UK.  Cormorants also have more variety in terms of habitat preferences. They can adapt to a variety of environments including estuaries, marshes, lagoons, rivers, and lakes, both with either fresh or saltwater conditions, whereas Shags prefer rocky coastlines and islands for their nesting grounds, away from human disturbance. In behavioural differences, the Cormorant is known to fly in a straight, direct path, often just above water level and they can often be seen standing with their wings outstretched to dry, whereas Shags fly in less orderly groups, often low over water and there is a heavy steady flight action with faster wing beats than the Cormorant. In conclusion, while the Shag and the Cormorant share many similarities due to them belonging to the same family of sea birds, they have distinct features and the Cormorant stands out for its larger size compared to the Shag, making it the largest relative within the bird species found around the shores of Britain."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – Roddie Edmonds is the first US soldier to receive Israel's Righteous Among the Nations honor, 70 years after he risked his life to save 200 Jews. The native of Knoxville, Tenn., was captured in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 and held at German POW camp Staleg IXA, according to Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum. When the Nazis ordered all Jewish-American POWs to step forward on Jan. 27, 1945, Edmonds—the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer at the camp—ordered 1,000 US soldiers to do so, regardless of their religion, per the AP. \\"They cannot all be Jews!\\" a German commander said, per Yad Vashem. \\"We are all Jews here,\\" Edmonds replied, adding soldiers didn't need to divulge their religion under the Geneva Conventions. The commander then put a gun to Edmonds' head. He said, \\"'I'll give you one more chance. Have the Jewish men step forward or I will shoot you on the spot,'\\" Edmonds' son, the Rev. Chris Edmonds, tells NPR. \\"They said my dad paused, and said, 'If you shoot, you'll have to shoot us all.'\\" The commander yielded. Chris Edmonds believes his dad's move saved 200 lives. Edmonds died in 1985 and his untold story nearly died with him. How it surfaced is fascinating: Some time after his father's death, Chris Edmonds read an article about Richard Nixon's purchase of a tony Manhattan townhouse from a man named Lester Tanner—who mentioned that Edmonds saved his life. The son then embarked on a quest to find Tanner. Edmonds was honored on Wednesday as only the fifth American to receive the Israeli honor, the country's highest for non-Jews who undertook heroic acts in WWII. He is now being considered for a Medal of Honor. (Read about another WWII hero.) Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a brave soldier named Roddie Edmonds. He was from Knoxville, Tennessee and fought in a big war called World War II. During the war, he was captured and taken to a place called Stalag IXA by the German soldiers. There were many American prisoners with Roddie, and some of them were Jewish. The German soldiers wanted to find out who the Jewish soldiers were, so they could treat them badly. But Roddie did something very brave and clever. He told all the American soldiers to step forward and say they were Jewish, even if they weren't. This made it very hard for the German soldiers to find out who was really Jewish. When the German commander saw this, he got very angry and threatened Roddie. But Roddie was not scared. He told the commander that if he wanted to hurt the Jewish soldiers, he would have to hurt all the Americans. This made the commander stop, and Roddie ended up saving about 200 Jewish lives.  For many years, Roddie's brave story was a secret. But one day, Roddie's son, Chris, found out about it. He learned that his dad was a hero and had saved many people. Because of this, Roddie was given a special award from the country of Israel called the Righteous Among the Nations honor. This is a very important award for people who were not Jewish but were heroes during World War II. Roddie was the first American soldier to receive this award, and now people everywhere know about his bravery and kindness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As they drive to the game in Henry's car, Eddie asks Henry to stop at an ATM. But Eddie, and two acquaintances also in the car, instead rob the Buffalo Savings Bank, and Henry is arrested as an accomplice. Rather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There he is celled with the irrepressible Max, a con man who has grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his \\"idyllic\\" life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in Henry's mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream. Debbie decides to divorce him, and she marries Joe, one of the acquaintances. Upon his release eighteen months later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootlegger's tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole â to help stage a robbery of the bank.

Typically, all member universities in a university system share a common component among all of their various names. Usually, all member universities of a university system are governed by a system-wide governing body, such as a board of trustees or a board of regents. In fact, university systems are so common in post-World War II United States that most states have one or two state university systems under which many of their publicly funded universities are aligned, both in name and in governance.

It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity.

Police used water cannons to disperse protesters who tore down barricades near the Royal Palace. On Saturday, talks between Mr Rainsy and Prime Minister Hun Sen failed to resolve the political deadlock. Analysts say Hun Sen, 61, faces one of the biggest tests of his 28-year rule. The prime minister has repeatedly vowed to stay in power until he is in his seventies. In the July vote, his People's Party (CPP) won 68 seats, compared with 55 for the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The national election committee confirmed the results earlier this month. But Mr Rainsy and his followers accuse Prime Minister Hun Sen of rigging the vote. With all state institutions - including the election commission - under the thumb of Hun Sen, protests are the only way opposition supporters can challenge the result, correspondents say. Up to 20,000 activists, workers and monks gathered in a public park in Phnom Penh under the watchful eye of riot police on Sunday. Rural protesters were transported to the capital in large convoys of buses and trucks. Marchers carried signs reading \\"Where is my vote?\\" and \\"Long live democracy\\". Many also held lotus flowers symbolising peace in what organisers described as a protest based on Buddhist prayer. The rally was planned to last three days, and Mr Rainsy warned more would follow until election irregularities were properly investigated. \\"The demonstrations will continue if our demands are not met,\\" he said. \\"[People's] ballots were stolen and they are asking for justice.\\" The Ministry of Interior said Sunday's rally had to end by early evening, local media reports. But many protesters defied the order and stayed in the streets, raising the prospect of a possible forced removal. Around 200 demonstrators clashed with police near the Royal Palace, which had been sectioned off with barbed wire barricades and roadblocks. Security forces used water cannons and smoke grenades to disperse the protesters, who threw rocks and shoes. But most of the rally was peaceful, correspondents say.

Article: In the rush to get to school, you drop a piece of toast on the floor. Do you throw it away or dec ide it' s still OK to eat? If you're like most people, you eat it. Maybe you follow the \\"5-second rule\\", which claims foods are safe to eat if you pick them up within 5 seconds after dropping them. But you might want to think again. Scientists now say that 5 seconds is all it takes for foods to become polluted with enough bacteria  to make you sick. Bacteria can cause many kinds of illnesses. Some kinds of bacteria can grow on food. If you eat foods on which these bacteria are growing, you can become sick. One of these food-borne bacteria is Salmonella. It makes 1.4 million people sick every year. Salmonella is often found in raw eggs and chicken. Cooking kills these bacteria, which is why it is so important to cook eggs, chicken, and other foods thoroughly. But how long does it take these bacteria to pollute food? A team of scientists in South Carolina did an experiment. First, they placed an amount of Salmonella on three surfaces; wood, tile  , and carpet. They placed a piece of bread and a piece of bologna  on each surface for 5,30, or 60 seconds. After just 5 seconds, both the bread and the bologna picked up enough bacteria to make you sick. So forget the 5-second rule. If your toast drops on the floor, throw it away and get another piece of clean toast. This time, be careful not to drop it!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Have you seen The Graduate? It was hailed as the movie of its generation. But A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before Dustin Hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia, Norman Maclean and his brother Paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world. But how could a place like post WW1 Montana be a showcase for the American family, at a time when the Wild West still was not completely gone? Just what has Maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves? As the movie opens, Norman is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course his own life has taken. The movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness, against time's current and back to when he was a boy. He and his younger brother Paul were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. The boys ponder what they will be when they grow up. Norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad. Given the choice, little Paul would be the boxer, since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't even exist. The boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks, fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do, all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing. They are at similar points in their lives before college. But when Norm returns from his six years at Dartmouth, things are very different. Paul is at the top of his game. Master flyfisherman. Grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench. Norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life, even as his father grills him about what he intends to do. You're left feeling that at least to Pops, God will call you to your life's work. But you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life. Father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate God's eternal words. \\"Listen,\\" their father urges. It's both Zen and Quakerly. Pretty radical for a stoic clergyman. But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. Maclean's family is unraveling? Paul is true perfection as he fishes the river, but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed. Mom, Dad and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help. Pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm. But the junior brother is losing his grip. Norman starts getting his life on track, finding love and career, but Paul continues to slide. The family that loves him watches helplessly. Mother, Father, Brother flounder in their own ways trying to help, but none very effectively. How can a family that loves each other so much be so ill-equipped to handle this? How can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in God's nature, yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that God's peoples have made for themselves? These are all questions Norman will ponder his entire life. The eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him, yet keep their secrets. The movie is beautiful to watch. This is certainly God's country, and filming it won an Oscar. Director Robert Redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting, and it works well. But do go back and read the book, too. You'll see Norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it, leading into the unknown.

This is Life, all right, but we do treat it like a rehearsal and, unhappily, we do miss so many of its best moments. We take jobs to stay alive and provide homes for our families, always making ourselves believe that this style of life is only a temporary state of affairs along the road to what we really want to do. Then, at 60 or 65, we are suddenly given a clock and several grandchildren and we look back and realize that all those years waiting for Real Life to come along were in fact real life. In America they have a saying much laughedat by the English: \\"Have a nice day.\\" They speak slowly and seriously in their shops, hotels and sandwich bars. I think it is a wonderful phrase, making us remember, in effect, to enjoy the moment: to value this very day.

Since we don't necessarily want to add sugar, we're going to think about using something naturally sweet. Imagine fruits, like bananas and apples. They are sweet because of something called 'natural sugars'. Therefore, if we want to make the Golden Milk sweeter, we can use these fruits! Like blending ripe bananas into the milk, or stewing some apples and adding them in.  Honey is another way to sweeten your milk. Remember how yummy it tastes when spread on a bread slice? The same honey can be mixed into Golden Milk! Another option is vanilla extract. You know the yummy smell of cookies and cakes? That's often because of vanilla. This can be added into our Golden Milk to give it some sweetness.  And lastly, we have a magical plant called Stevia. It is really, really sweet - much more than sugar, but it doesn't have any bad stuff like sugar does. We can add a little bit of stevia to our Golden Milk. Just remember, sweeteners should be added carefully according to your liking and health needs, always ask your mom or dad to help you with these things."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An Egyptian... (Associated Press)      In a sign that his ailment might not be very serious, however, Justice Minister Mohammed el-Guindi said the former president was now being questioned in the hospital.      The 82-year-old former president was deposed Feb. 11 after 18 days of popular protests and has been under house arrest in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the last two months. The public prosecutor announced Monday he was under investigation.      Dozens of demonstrators picketed the hospital, denouncing the president and carrying a sign reading \\"Here is the butcher.\\" They scuffled with supporters of Mubarak amid a massive security presence.      El-Guindi said Mubarak was being investigated over his role in the violence against protesters during the uprising. The investigation into corruption charges would be carried later by the Justice Ministry's anti-corruption department.      An investigation of Mubarak's son, Gamal, is also underway in Sharm el-Sheikh, the minister said in comments carried by Egypt's state news agency. A security official at the hospital said both father and son were questioned in the hospital suite.      Deciding on the site for the interrogation was a dilemma for the authorities who wanted to grant the ailing president a degree of privacy and security.      Two security officials said Mubarak arrived under heavy police protection to the main hospital and, according to two doctors in the hospital, he stepped out of his armored Mercedes unaided and was taken to the presidential suite in the pyramid-shaped building.      The officials and doctors spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.      The protest movement that deposed Mubarak is now pushing for him to be brought to justice for what they say are decades of abuse and since Friday, hundreds have reoccupied parts of Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo.      The protesters had criticized the army for being too close to the old regime and not swiftly bringing Mubarak to trial.      On Tuesday, however, a scuffle broke out when some residents tried to break up the four-day sit-in, removing barbed-wire and barricades. The army then moved in and took control of the square and cordoned off the once grassy roundabout that had been the center of many demonstrations.      Sanaa Seif, a 17-year-old on the scene, said she saw the army forcibly remove people. Egypt's state news agency reported that the military police had detained a number of \\"outlaw thugs\\" at the square.      Mubarak has been suffering for a number of ailments and underwent gallbladder surgery in Germany in March last year.      He has kept a low profile since he was ousted, living on his compound in Sharm el-Sheikh. He was banned from traveling and his assets have been frozen. Many of his senior aides have already either been questioned or detained pending investigations.      Egypt's state TV reported that Safwat el-Sherif, a senior aide of Mubarak and one of the most powerful men in his regime, was ordered detained for an additional 15 days pending investigation into his role in attacks on protesters during the uprising.      El-Sherif had already been remanded into custody for 15 days pending corruption investigations.      On Sunday, Mubarak defended himself in a pre-recorded message saying he had not abused his authority, and investigators were welcome to check over his assets.      It was his first address to the people in the two months since he stepped down. Shortly after, the prosecutor general issued a summons for Mubarak to appear for questioning. ||||| Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak addresses the nation in this still image taken from video February 10, 2011.      CAIRO |      CAIRO (Reuters) - Hosni Mubarak was in hospital after suffering heart problems under questioning, following protests by hard-core reformists who said he was being protected from prosecution by Egypt's military rulers.      The former Egyptian president fell ill on Tuesday during an inquiry into the killing of protesters in a revolution that toppled him and into corruption in his administration.      Egypt's generals, in charge since Mubarak quit on February 11, have faced increasingly loud calls from protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square for Mubarak and his allies to stand trial.      Soldiers on Tuesday broke up a five-day sit-in at the square, which became the epicenter of the uprising in January.      There were conflicting reports about Mubarak's condition. One report said he was in intensive care after a \\"heart crisis\\" during questioning. Another said he was fit enough to be questioned in hospital in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.      Mubarak, 82, was ousted after a popular uprising against repression and corruption during his 30-year rule. More than 380 people were killed in mass demonstrations that police and pro-Mubarak thugs failed to crush.      The timing of his health setback may prompt skepticism among hard-core protesters who have complained about the failure of the military to pursue Mubarak and his allies more swiftly and argue that they are protecting one of their own.      There are many in Egypt's establishment who argue the elderly leader should be able to bow out with dignity after overseeing years of stability, but protesters criticize his rule by emergency law and say he encouraged a rich and poor divide.      \\"We want our money. We want the thief to be tried,\\" chanted dozens of people gathered near the hospital in the glitzy resort where Mubarak spent more and more time before leaving office.      The public prosecutor summoned Mubarak on Sunday for questioning over the killing of protesters and embezzling of public funds. His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, were also added to the list of ex-ministers and officials now under investigation.      In his first public comment since stepping down, broadcast on Al Arabiya on Sunday, Mubarak denied wrongdoing.      State television said Mubarak suffered a \\"heart crisis\\" during questioning and said he had been taken into intensive care. But Al Arabiya television quoted a hospital manager as saying that Mubarak was fit enough to be questioned.      The state-owned Al Ahram newspaper reported Mubarak had been summoned to appear in a Cairo court. Its website later said the ex-president may not now have to travel because of his illness.      A judicial source said Mubarak's two sons were questioned in South Sinai, where Sharm el-Sheikh is located. Gamal, 47, Mubarak's younger son, held a top post in the ruling party and many Egyptians believed he was being groomed for high office.      CALLS FOR SWIFT TRIAL      Mubarak has suffered from health problems in recent years and went to Germany for gall bladder surgery in March 2010. There were frequent rumors about his health as he aged, particularly after his last bout of surgery.      Mubarak had vowed to die in Egypt when he addressed the country's 80 million people shortly before he stepped down.      Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians gathered again in Tahrir on Friday for one of the biggest demonstrations since Mubarak was ousted, many of them angry at the army's failure to put Mubarak and his allies on trial swiftly.      Soldiers and police used tasers and batons to try to drive out the protesters on Friday night. In resulting clashes, medical sources said 13 men were wounded by gunfire and two died. The army denied using live ammunition.      Angry protesters demanded the army hand power to civilians, but soldiers moved in on Tuesday to end the sit-in. A Reuters photographer saw hundreds of troops in the middle of Tahrir and in military vehicles at every entrance to the normally busy thoroughfare.      Troops with machineguns rounded up several young men and pushed them into vans. Others hauled coils of barbed wire used by demonstrators, and makeshift barriers erected during the protest, onto military trucks.      By early evening traffic was flowing through Tahrir, a major junction of roads that was the focus of the protests. Many ordinary Egyptians are tired of the protests that have hammered the economy and disrupted their lives.      A youth coalition that helped organize the uprising said it had persuaded the remaining protesters to reopen Tahrir because they were doing the country no good by staying.      \\"We met with the (ruling) military council yesterday and discussed opening Tahrir. We agreed to end the protest and give the army a chance to proceed,\\" said Mohamed Sukri, a member of the Revolutionary Youth Coalition.      Mohamed Zaidan, who said he belonged to no group and was in the square when the army arrived, gave a different account.      \\"We didn't agree with anyone to clear Tahrir,\\" said the 25-year-old. \\"We were attacked by rock-throwing people who wanted to force us out and then the army came, didn't speak to us and suddenly moved in to force us out of the square.\\"      (Additional reporting by Dina Zayed, Asmaa Waguih and Marwa Awad; Writing by Edmund Blair; editing by Tim Pearce) |||||Summary:","output":"Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was hospitalized on April 12, 2011, due to heart problems during an investigation into allegations of corruption and violence against protesters.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Jafar, the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, and his parrot Iago, seek the lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders but is told that only a âdiamond in the roughâ may enter. Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy. Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine, who has run away from the palace, unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love, but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended, tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated. Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu, taking them to the Cave and promises to reward them if they retrieve the lamp. Inside, Aladdin befriends a magic carpet. Abu greedily tries to steal a jewel, despite the Caveâs request, and it collapses. Trapped underground, Aladdin rubs the lamp, releasing the Genie trapped inside, who explains Aladdin has become his master and will grant him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the Cave without wasting a wish, and then uses his first to become a prince to be near Jasmine. Jafar, on Iagoâs suggestion, plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine, but Aladdin parades into the city as âPrince Ali of Ababwaâ. However, Jasmine is unimpressed with Aladdinâs bravado.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  and the situation: Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course.  They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.

After traveling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant.

What Irish airline proposed charging passengers to use the bathroom?","output":"The Irish budget airline that proposed charging passengers to use the bathroom is Ryanair. The airline's controversial CEO, Michael O'Leary, first brought up the idea in 2009 as part of his vision to continually lower air fares and bolster the company's profits. The idea was to charge passengers £1, or approximately 1.30, to use onboard bathrooms. This plan was informally dubbed as a \\"spend a penny\\" scheme. The move had been justified as another method of increasing ancillary revenue, which in addition to reducing airfares, would also encourage passengers to use the facilities in the airport before boarding or after the flight, hence shortening the bathroom queues during the journey. Moreover, Michael O'Leary proposed to reduce the number of bathrooms on their fleet aircraft from three to one, to make room for six more seats. He was considering working with Boeing to redesign future aircraft with only one bathroom. The proposal, however, was met with harsh criticism from different entities including the public, regulatory bodies, and passenger rights groups. They argued that it was taking the 'no frills' model of aviation too far, impacting passenger comfort and rights. Rival airlines also criticized the move. Southwest Airlines' then-CEO stated his company had no plans to charge for bathrooms and was not considering following Ryanair's lead. Authorities warned Ryanair that it may be in breach of regulations; certain laws mandate airlines to offer free access to toilets for health and safety reasons. Due to the heavy backlash faced, the idea turned out to be what Mr. O'Leary would later describe as 'throwing the cat among the pigeons'. It did not come to fruition, and Ryanair announced in 2011 that they had ultimately dropped this widely protested \\"pay-per-pee\\" proposal. Though Ryanair is known for its ultra-low-cost approach and innovative revenue-generation techniques (for example, it was one of the first airlines to charge for checked luggage), the proposal to charge for onboard bathroom use proved a step too far, demonstrating the line between the company's cost-cutting measures and passenger considerations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is Blair's job? Movie plot title: The Thing Movie plot: In the Antarctic, a Norwegian helicopter pursues an Alaskan Malamute to an American research station. Upon landing, the passenger accidentally drops a thermite charge, which destroys the helicopter and kills the pilot when he tries to retrieve it. The passenger pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin. Inside, they find a corpse with its throat and wrists slashed in the radio room. Outside, they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces, which they bring back along with some video tapes. Their biologist, Blair, performs an autopsy on the corpse, finding a normal set of human internal organs. Clark kennels the Malamute with the station's sled dogs; it soon metamorphoses and attacks them. When he hears the commotion, MacReady pulls the fire alarm, and Childs incinerates the creature. Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other organisms. The Norwegians' records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the station's geologist, Norris, hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old. Blair becomes increasingly paranoid and withdraws, calculating that if the alien escapes to a civilized area, all life on Earth will be assimilated within a few years.

Article: If you’re replacing an old floor with a new one, your first task will be to get rid of the outdated flooring material. Use a pry bar to pull up hardwood floors one section at a time, or unfasten carpet or laminate and roll it up from one end. This will expose the subfloor underneath, which is where most leveling problems lie.  You can leave linoleum or sheet vinyl in place if it’s difficult to remove or if removal would damage the sub-floor. Apply bonding agent and floor leveling compound on top of the existing floor. Stripping tile can be a messy, laborious, time-consuming job. Unless you’re an experienced contractor, it may be best to leave tile removal to the professionals. To remove carpet, cut it into smaller pieces using a razor knife. Then, pull it up. If you’re installing a new floor, skip to checking the level and making a note of where the foundation should be worn down or built up. Set down a 6 ft (1.8 m) level every few feet from one end of the room to the other. This will give you an idea of how much work you’ve got cut out for you, and where it’s needed most. A good general rule of thumb is that the foundation shouldn’t slope more than 3⁄16 inch (0.48 cm) every 10 feet (3 m).  If the area is very large, use a long, straight 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) board and set your level on top of it. If the floor is uneven, lift up the board until it is level so you’ll know how much flooring compound you’ll need to even it out. Floors are rarely perfectly level. It’s okay if the angle is off by a fraction of an inch in either direction. Keep in mind that “flat” isn’t the same thing as “level.” Minor defects may not be noticeable to the eye, but they will be to your level. More often than not, sagging or slanted flooring materials are responsible for off-level floors. Occasionally, however, there will be humps that cause the foundation to rise above a specified height. These can be dealt with by sanding down wooden subfloors with an electric sander, or by grinding them with a motorized angle grinder. Sanding and grinding produces a lot of dust. Be sure to wear eye protection and a facemask or ventilator while wearing down uneven subflooring. Once the subflooring is exposed and free of high spots, prepare it for the new flooring by removing any remaining dust and debris. Vacuum the entire room, especially around the corners where dust particles tend to collect. Mop concrete subfloors with diluted muriatic acid to clear away traces of oil, wax, or adhesive that may be clinging to the surface.  Fill cracks in concrete subfloor and make sure the filled areas are level before cleaning the subfloor. A thorough cleaning is also necessary to get the subflooring ready to accept the liquid bonding agent. Starting with the edges of the room along the molding, spread on a thin coat with a wide, soft-bristled paintbrush. Work your way about a foot out from each wall, then use a roller or mop to apply the bonding agent to the larger area in the center.  The bonding agent will create a chemical connection with the leveling compound to help it set up more securely and last longer. Wear gloves, waders, and old clothing when working with liquid bonding agents and leveling compound. Once these materials get on something, they can be nearly impossible to get off. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, when replacing an old floor with a new one, first remove the outdated flooring material using the appropriate tools. Next, expose and assess the subfloor for leveling issues. If necessary, fix any sloping or unevenness in the foundation by sanding or grinding high spots. Clean the subfloor thoroughly to prepare for the application of bonding agent and leveling compound. Finally, apply these materials according to the instructions to create a secure and even base for your new flooring."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon that he could have a harmonica if he came to Edinburgh the following day; the harmonica had been stored in the Edinburgh bus depot after a passenger had inadvertently left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \\"Imagine\\", described as his best-known solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\". In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a Mellotron keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" in 1967.

I love that when you fly a lot, the airport social media staff say 'hello' on Twitter when you arrive and the cabin crew on your home route (or even on the Brisbane-Dubai non-stop route) recognise you from last time. I like getting great service, and see so many things about systems-thinking that work well in airlines, that I'm happy to forgive small indiscrepancies when they occur. All that said, flying strangles our planet as much as eating too much red meat, and for many, many reasons, I've wanted to stop flying quite so much, while not restricting the spread and growth of the ideas from our firm, NoTosh. I'm quite sure that nobody reading this blog really cares about how much I travel, but keeping an annual count on it has become a new year habit. When I started working at Channel 4, and then continuing when I created NoTosh, I wanted to keep track of what seemed like an interminable number of miles on the road and in the air. By 2012, 2013 and last year, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever be able to get the number of miles down when they seemed to represent even more trips to the moon and back each and every year. When you run a company based in Edinburgh with a great team living in Melbourne, you could easily spend your life on a plane - one flying to Melbourne feels better than two or more flying to Edinburgh. Indeed, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 it felt like I really did spend my life on a plane, as I went to the moon and back in my annual travel, with anything up to seven trips a year to Australia.

Input: Abstract: Blood flow through and chlormethiazole extraction ratios across lungs, liver, kidneys and gut were measured in awake unrestrained sheep (controls) and with the same animals anaesthetized with 1.5% halothane or whilst undergoing high thoracic subarachnoid blockade with amethocaine. In the control-drug studies, chlormethiazole infused to sub-sedative blood concentrations produced no significant changes in haemodynamics or in the kinetics of iodohippurate (renal and hepatic blood flows). Chlormethiazole was eliminated predominantly by the liver (mean extraction ratio and clearance, respectively, 0.90 and 1.3 litre min-1) and lungs (0.15; 0.6 litre min-1). Renal clearance was absent or negligible (greater than 0.1 litre min-1). Because of pulmonary clearance, mean total body clearance was derived from analysis of pulmonary arterial concentrations. Under general anaesthesia, there were significant reductions in mean cardiac output, hepatic and renal blood flow (to 54%, 63% and 43% of control); chlormethiazole mean hepatic extraction ratios and clearance were reduced, respectively, to 82% and 56% of control, and its pulmonary and renal clearances were abolished. With subarachnoid anaesthesia there were no significant changes in haemodynamics or in chlormethiazole extraction ratios or clearances.   Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: A sheep preparation for studying interactions between blood flow and drug disposition. VI: Effects of general or subarachnoid anaesthesia on blood flow and chlormethiazole disposition. option2: Medium-depth chemical peeling: digging beneath the surface [editorial] Output:","output":"A sheep preparation for studying interactions between blood flow and drug disposition.

Review: in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This particular movie review sentence, \\"in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way,\\" can be interpreted as either positive or negative, depending on the context in which it is used. The interpretation boils down to the intended tone and the circumstances surrounding the statement. Positive interpretation: In a positive sense, this comment can be viewed as praising the film (or a performance in the film) for its impressive, Oscar-worthy quality. The statement suggests that the movie (or a specific performance) is of such a high caliber that it deserves an Academy Award. In this context, the reviewer is complimenting the outstanding work put into the film, recognizing the potential for Oscar success. Negative interpretation: On the flip side, this statement can also be seen as negative if the reviewer intends to convey a sense of arrogance or overconfidence expressed through the film or by the actors. It can be interpreted as mocking the movie (or a performance) for desperately seeking an Oscar, implying that the film tries too hard to be a winner. In this case, the statement would carry a sarcastic or critical tone, diminishing the movie's authenticity and potency. Without additional context or information about the tone the reviewer is using, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether this statement is negative or positive. It is crucial to examine the rest of the review or gather more knowledge about the reviewer's intentions to accurately determine the intended sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"High heat can negatively impact the growth and quality of grapes, which are essential to wine production. If high heat damages the grapes during their growing phase, it will likely result in less wine being produced. The process of producing wine goes through several steps, as outlined in the question: 1. Grapes are grown 2. A selection of grapes are gathered 3. The grapes are washed 4. The stems are removed from the grapes 5. The grapes are crushed and added to a fermentation container 6. Yeast is added to the container 7. The yeast eats the sugar in the grape, releasing alcohol The perturbation of high heat occurs at the first step, during grape growth. As high heat damages grapes, there will be a smaller selection of healthy grapes to be gathered in step 2. This directly influences the next steps, as fewer healthy grapes mean that there will be less grapes washed, stemmed, crushed, and used for fermentation. The second effect mentioned is the yeast eating the sugar and releasing alcohol. If the amount of grapes is reduced due to high heat damage, it directly influences the second effect by leaving less grape material for the yeast to consume and produce alcohol. This results in a smaller quantity of wine and a potential decrease in quality. In conclusion, high heat damage to grapes has a negative effect on wine production, resulting in less wine being produced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather.  and a hint : Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine.  Please answer this question : Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","output":"The truck would do worse in hot weather and a hot engine compared to the car. This is because Rob put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. As the hint mentions, antifreeze can also be called “antiboil” because it raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. In hot weather conditions, combined with a hot engine, the temperature of the water in the radiator can easily rise above 100°C - the boiling point of pure water.  When the water in the radiator boils, it can lead to the engine overheating and incurring serious damage. However, if antifreeze is added to the water, the boiling point becomes much higher. For instance, a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129°C, thereby making it less likely for the water to boil and cause damage to the engine. Since Rob added antifreeze to the car radiator, the car's engine is more protected against potential overheating in hot weather conditions. As a result, it would be able to handle the heat more effectively. On the other hand, the truck without the antifreeze is more susceptible to engine overheating, water boiling, and potential damage, making it the vehicle that would fare worse in hot weather and a hot engine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...into which sea or ocean does the amazon river flow??","output":"The Amazon River, which is regarded as the largest river in the world by volume and discharge, flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The river has its origins in the Andes Mountains in Peru and stretches over a remarkable distance of approximately 6,400 km (4,000 miles) as it meanders through various South American countries, including Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. As the Amazon River courses through the continent, it accumulates enormous quantities of water from its vast network of tributaries, which are spread across the immense Amazon Basin. This basin spans a staggering 7.05 million square kilometers (2.72 million square miles) and is considered the largest river basin globally, accounting for roughly one-fifth of the world's total river flow. When the Amazon River eventually reaches the northeastern part of Brazil, it empties into the Atlantic Ocean, forming an extensive estuary. The point at which the river flows into the ocean is commonly referred to as the Amazon River Delta or the Amazon River Mouth, which can be found between the Brazilian states of Amapá and Pará. The Amazon River's incredible volume, coupled with its vast discharge, plays a crucial role in the Atlantic Ocean's ecology. The vast amount of freshwater and nutrients brought in by the Amazon River significantly impacts the ocean's salinity levels and marine ecosystems. As the nutrient-rich water enters the ocean, it encourages the growth of algae, which in turn supports the marine food chain, affecting the marine life around the Amazon River Delta and beyond. The Amazon River and its basin are also instrumental in regulating the global climate, as they store large amounts of carbon and produce immense amounts of oxygen through dense rainforest regions. The river and its tributaries play an essential role in providing resources and habitats for a vast array of species that call the Amazon region their home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate \\"Just humour me.\\" to Czech?","output":"\\"Just humour me.\\" in Czech can be translated as \\"Jen mě pobav.\\" In this phrase, \\"Jen\\" means \\"just\\", \\"mě\\" translates to \\"me\\" and \\"pobav\\" is an imperative form of the verb \\"pobavit\\" which means \\"to humor/amuse\\".  However, there's a bit more to just directly translating words when bridging languages. Language isn't just about translating exact words, but also about conveying cultural context, emotional intent, and other nuances. The phrase \\"Just humour me\\" is typically used in English to request someone's indulgence or patience, usually when the speaker realizes they might sound unreasonable or is asking something that may seem strange or unnecessary. So, to replicate the intention behind \\"Just humour me\\" in Czech, you might also say \\"Humoruj mě, prosím\\", which could be translated back into English as \\"Please humor me\\". This phrase is perhaps a more accurate equivalent when taking into account not just word-for-word translation, but also the tone and cultural context in which it's being used.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded?, using the article: Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The person who Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded was her father, Antoine. Antoine was the one who had married Marie of Lorraine, and their union produced two daughters, one of them being Princess Louise-Hippolyte. Given the constitutional rule in Monaco at that time, only the Grimaldi family could ascend to the throne. Therefore, Louise-Hippolyte's father Antoine was keen on securing a marriage between her and a Grimaldi cousin. Nevertheless, circumstances dictated differently, leading to Louise-Hippolyte marrying Jacques de Goyon Matignon, instead of a Grimaldi family member. Despite the unexpected turn of events, Louise-Hippolyte still took over the sovereign rule of Monaco in 1731 after her father's reign, but unfortunately, her rule was brief as she died just a few months later.

Please briefly summarize this news article: SPONGEBOB HOOKS A BIG NICK ORDER By MARISA GUTHRIE DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Thursday, November 10th 2005, 7:19AM SpongeBob SquarePants will be flipping burgers well into 2007. Nickelodeon programmers have ordered 20 more episodes of the cartoon, bringing the total series count to 100. \\"SpongeBob\\" is the network's toprated show. It's been translated into 25 different languages and has generated 4 billion in merchandise revenue since it premiered four years ago. \\"It's pretty amazing,\\" said Marjorie Cohn, vice president for development and original programming at Nickelodeon. Creator Stephen Hillenburg started working on new episodes after he finished writing last year's \\"SpongeBob\\" movie. According to Cohn, there's no reason why SpongeBob and the rest of the underwater denizens that frequent the Krusty Krab shouldn't have a long tenure on the kids' network. \\"I look at 'SpongeBob' as having emerged into the classic arena,\\" said Cohn. \\"Our kids' audience renews itself every couple of years, so I don't see why kids 10 or 15 years from now wouldn't find it funny.\\" But it's not just kids who think SpongeBob is the cat's pajamas. \\"Twenty-five percent of our viewers on Friday night [when original episodes air] are actually adults,\\" said Cohn. The cross-generational appeal has certainly helped make the \\"SpongeBob\\" product line a cash cow. \\"It is pretty astounding,\\" said Cohn. \\"You can't go anywhere without seeing kids with 'SpongeBob' backpacks - and the adults are wearing the 'SpongeBob' T-shirts.\\" Some of those adults are celebrities - Tony Hawk lends his voice to tomorrow's episode. Other recognizable voices have included Ernest Borgnine, Charles Nelson Reilly, filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, Marion Ross, Sara Paxton and John O'Hurley. The show, said Cohn, has achieved its icon status because it's smart and original with just the right amount of sweetness. \\"'SpongeBob' has that unique voice that's a little off the beaten path,\\" she said. \\"It's not some cynical, jaded look at the world. It's optimistic. SpongeBob, if I can say this, is human. He's got his annoying qualities. He's got his faults. But his heart is in the right place.\\"","output":"The popular cartoon \\"SpongeBob SquarePants\\" will continue its successful run with Nickelodeon ordering 20 more episodes, which will increase the series total to 100.

Is The US ended World War I with two 3-inch AA guns and improvements were developed throughout the inter-war period. a good answer to this question? Possible answers:  1). yes.  2). no.","output":"2). No. The answer is not accurate in describing when work began specifically on the 105 mm static mounting AA gun. While it is true that the United States developed anti-aircraft guns throughout the inter-war period, the statement does not provide any information on the development of the 105 mm gun. To provide a more detailed and accurate answer: The development of the 105 mm static mounting anti-aircraft (AA) gun, also known as the 105 mm Gun M3, began in the late 1930s in the United States. The need for a more potent AA gun was prompted by the advancements in military aviation technology and the growing vulnerability of ground forces to enemy aircraft attacks.  The U.S. Army started looking into a higher caliber AA gun that could engage enemy aircraft at longer ranges and with increased stopping power. When the European conflicts began intensifying, the U.S. Army's Ordnance Department focused its resources on the development of a 105 mm AA gun to address this need. The 105 mm Gun M3 was designed on a static mounting platform, which allowed for easier transportation and deployment, as well as providing increased stability for long-range engagements. Work on the 105 mm Gun M3 started in 1938, with the first prototype guns being completed in 1940. However, the development and testing phase took several years due to technical challenges that appeared during the development process and competition for resources with other weapon systems. Eventually, the 105 mm Gun M3 was adopted by the U.S. Army in limited numbers in 1944, mainly for static defense of strategic assets and locations. A mobile version, the M2 anti-aircraft gun, was also pursued during the war, but it faced similar developmental challenges and was not completed in significant quantities before the end of World War II. In conclusion, the work on the 105 mm static mounting AA gun began in the late 1930s, aiming to provide a more capable anti-aircraft defense system to the U.S. Army during World War II. Unfortunately, the gun's development encountered various issues, which delayed its deployment and limited its widespread adoption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? who played john boy walton on the waltons?","output":"The role of John-Boy Walton on the well-loved television series \\"The Waltons,\\" was originated by actor Richard Thomas. Richard Thomas's portrayal of the character, who was the eldest son of the Walton family and also the show's narrator, helped shape the series and contributed significantly to its popularity. Richard Thomas was born on June 13, 1951 in New York City. His parents were ballet dancers and owned the New York School of Ballet. Thomas started his professional acting career at an early age. Before he took on the role of John-Boy, he had already made numerous appearances on television in series including \\"1, 2, 3 Go!\\", \\"Winning Streak,\\" \\"As The World Turns,\\" and \\"A Flame in the Wind.\\" Richard Thomas was cast in \\"The Waltons\\" in 1971. The series, based on Earl Hamner Jr.'s book \\"Spencer's Mountain,\\" was about a family living in rural Virginia during the Great Depression and World War II. The character of John-Boy was a central figure in the show as he was shown to aspire to be a writer and often narrated episodes with entries from his journal. While the show was a drama series, it was filled with warmth and a deep sense of family which resonated with audiences. Thomas played the role of John-Boy Walton from 1971 to 1978, spanning over 100 episodes, and he earned an Emmy Award in 1973 for his performance. He left the series after the fifth season to seek out new acting challenges, although he did make a few appearances as John-Boy in later years. The role of John-Boy was later taken over by actor Robert Wightman. Post-The Waltons, Richard Thomas continued to maintain a successful career both in television and on stage. He has appeared in numerous TV shows, made-for-TV movies, and has had a number of roles on Broadway. Yet, it is his portrayal of John-Boy Walton for which he continues to be most fondly remembered. Thomas brought a sincerity and vulnerability to his character that touched audiences. The show's portrayal of a family struggling through the Great Depression and World War II, yet maintaining their unity, faith, and resilience, touched a chord with viewers. Richard Thomas's convincing portrayal of the sensitive and ambitious John-Boy played no small part in this resonation and helped make \\"The Waltons\\" an endearing classic in the annals of TV history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway.

Context: The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\" Answer:","output":"The historical background behind To Kill a Mockingbird was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted.

Justification: Due to the ambiguity of the premise and the possibility that the street could be an indoor simulated environment, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.

Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. PUBLISHED:. 11:54 EST, 31 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:35 EST, 1 February 2013. Earl Attlee defended the level of train fares in the UK, before admitting they were 'just too expensive' and had forced him to cancel days out. A transport minister today claimed that he had been priced off the railways by sky-high fares. In a frank admission for someone accountable for rail policy, Earl Attlee declared that ticket prices ‘too expensive for me’, and have even forced him to cancel a day trip to a motor show. The 56-year-old Tory hereditary peer, who earns £63,537 as a spokesman in the House of Lords, said he ‘could not afford’ the prices charged for on-the-day tickets. And he admitted the complex web of different ticket types was baffling, telling peers: 'It must be difficult for ordinary passengers to understand how ticket pricing works.' Less than half of Britain's rail passengers think the railways are value for money, according to a survey this week. At the start of the year passengers were hit with average price rises of nearly 4 per cent. Today Lord Attlee said he had to scrap a planned trip to a motor show at the NEC in Birmingham because he could not afford the fare. He made the admission after being challenged in the Lords about the level of fares. The peer said a recent survey by Passenger Focus had reviewed UK rail fares and although the ‘overall picture was mixed’ the country compared favourably with other European countries ‘in respect of many ticket types particularly on longer distance tickets purchased in advance’. But Labour's Lord Campbell-Savours told him: ‘Tickets on the day of travel are invariably far more expensive that advanced travel tickets.’ Average fares rose by 4 per cent at the start of the year but campaigners say that since the beginning of the recession costs have risen faster than average wages. John Richard Attlee is a Conservative hereditary peer who happens to be the grandson of a Labour Prime Minister. Clement Attlee, who served in Churchill's war cabinet, was PM from 1945-51 and oversaw the creation of the National Health Service. John Attlee, the 3rd Earl, attended the private Stowe School where other alumni include the actor David Niven, the jazz musician George Melly and Prince Harry's Chelsy Davy. After a career in the vehicle repair industry, he entered the House of Lords in 1992 after the death of his father. He started as a non-political crossbencher but joined the Tory party in 1997. He has been a frontbench spokesman on several topics. His cousin Richard Attlee plays Kenton in radio soap The Archers. Lord Atlee, who is the grandson of. Labour prime minister Clement Attlee, replied confessed that he had. abandoned journeys after discovering what rail firms were charging. He. said: ‘When we look at just walking up to Euston and buying a ticket,. it is very expensive and we don't compare well with our continental. partners. ‘But when we look at advanced purchases we do compare quite well. ‘In my case, one day I wanted to go to the NEC to visit the motor show and I could not afford the walk-up fare. Just too expensive for me.’ He also grumbled that train firms have 'difficulty' policing quiet carriages. 'I like a quiet carriage, but some people do not adhere to the rules,' he said. Regulated fares, which include season tickets, increased by an average of 4.2 per cent, with the overall average rise for all tickets being 3.9 per cent. Transport minister Norman Baker outraged passengers this month when he insisted that despite overcrowding, disruption and inflationary fare rises commuters were getting a ‘premium service’. He said fares were not overly expensive when off-peak tickets – and not just the most costly rush-hour ones – were taken into account. Mr Baker accepted the above-inflation rises were ‘not ideal’ and wanted to end them as soon as possible, but did not put a timescale on it. He added: ‘You could argue people who are travelling in the rush hour are using the premium product and ought to pay something which reflects that.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"In this article, Earl Attlee, a transport minister, admits that train fares in the UK are too high and have even forced him to cancel a day trip to a motor show.

Vito (Marlon Brando), the head of the Corleone Mafia family, is known to friends and associates as \\"Godfather.\\" He and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the Corleone family lawyer, are hearing requests for favors because, according to Italian tradition, \\"no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.\\" One of the men who asks the Don for a favor is Amerigo Bonasera, a successful mortician and acquaintance of the Don, whose daughter was brutally beaten by two young men because she refused their advances; the men received minimal punishment. The Don is disappointed in Bonasera, who'd avoided most contact with the Don due to Corleone's nefarious business dealings. The Don's wife is godmother to Bonasera's shamed daughter, a relationship the Don uses to extract new loyalty from the undertaker. The Don agrees to have his men punish the young men responsible in return for future service if necessary.Meanwhile, the Don's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a decorated Marine hero returning from World War II service, arrives at the wedding and tells his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) anecdotes about his family, informing her about his father's criminal life; he reassures her that he is different from his family and doesn't plan to join them in their criminal dealings. The wedding scene serves as critical exposition for the remainder of the film, as Michael introduces the main characters to Kay. Fredo (John Cazale), Michael's next older brother, is a bit dim-witted and quite drunk by the time he finds Michael at the party. Sonny (James Caan), the Don's eldest child and next in line to become Don upon his father's retirement, is married but he is a hot-tempered philanderer who sneaks into a bedroom to have sex with one of Connie's bridesmaids, Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero).

Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children.  According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\".  Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group.  Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.  The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.

Question: What are negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine? Context: Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\" A:","output":"The negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine include promoting racist and classist points of view, chastising her for not adhering to traditional gender roles, and valuing superficial appearances over character. For instance, Mrs. Dubose criticizes Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, accusing her of ruining the family's reputation, while also attacking Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Some medications, such as prednisone, can cause facial numbness. Contact your doctor promptly if you believe you’re experiencing any side effects due to a medication. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you take and ask about their side effects or potential interactions. Ask them to recommend an alternative if you believe a medication is causing your lip numbness. Among other problems, a vitamin B-12 deficiency may lead to nerve damage which could cause tingling and numbness in your hands and feet, as well as muscle weakness. Ask your doctor if they recommend a blood test to diagnose a vitamin deficiency and whether you should take a supplement. You could be at risk of a vitamin B deficiency if you’re over 50, a vegetarian, have had weight-loss surgery, have a condition that interferes with food absorption, or take medications such as Nexium, Prevacid, or Zantac. If you consistently experience numbness in your face, hands, or feet, along with coldness or discoloration, ask your doctor if Raynaud’s disease is a possible cause. Raynaud’s disease occurs when small arteries that supply blood to the skin narrow, which leads to decreased blood circulation.  If your doctor suspects Raynaud’s disease, they’ll administer a physical exam and blood screening to make an accurate diagnosis. To manage Raynaud’s disease, you should avoid cold temperatures, wear hats and gloves, avoid smoking, and try to minimize emotional stress. While a local anesthetic following a dental procedure can cause lip numbness for two or three hours, prolonged numbness could indicate a complication. If you experience persistent numbness after a dental implant, filling, wisdom tooth extraction, or other dental procedure, schedule a follow-up visit with your dentist or oral surgeon as soon as possible. Numbness after an oral procedure could indicate nerve damage or an abscess. If you’re about to have a dental procedure, you can ask your dentist or oral surgeon for a medication to counteract the numbness that results after local anesthesia. OraVerse, or phentolamine mesylate, is an injectable medication that increases blood flow to soft tissues and helps to speed up the return of normal sensation. Tell your dentist or oral surgeon if you have a history of heart or blood vessel issues. It should not be used in patients with a history of cardiovascular disorders. Tingling in your lips could be a sign of both high and low blood pressure. Have your blood pressure checked regularly, or purchase a machine to check yourself at home. If you already know you have either high or low blood pressure, take your medication as prescribed, and let your doctor know if the problem persists. Many people report allergies to the red dyes used in cosmetics such as lipsticks. In addition to tingling, such an allergy may cause numbness and break-outs or bumps around the mouth. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your doctor to see if any treatment is necessary. While the area around your mouth heals, avoid wearing lipsticks or other cosmetics in the area impacted by the infection. Summary:","output":"So, this is about some reasons why your face or lips might feel numb. A medication like prednisone can sometimes do this. If you think a medicine is making your face feel numb, you should tell your doctor so they can find a different one for you. Also, if you don't have enough vitamin B-12, this might damage your nerves and make your hands, feet, and face feel tingly or numb. There's a disease called Raynaud's that could also do this, and for that, you need to stay warm, avoid getting too stressed, and avoid smoking. After you see the dentist, your mouth might stay numb for a little while, but if it stays numb for a long time, you should see the dentist again. There's some medicine that might help the numb feeling go away faster after a dentist visit, but people with certain heart problems can't take it. Also, tingling in your lips might mean your blood pressure is too high or too low, or it could be an allergic reaction. If your lips tingle and get bumps or feel numb after using lipstick, you might be allergic to it. Then, you'd need to stop using that lipstick and ask your doctor what to do."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Turn of the background layer. Save your image.","output":"**Title: Unlocking the Power of Background Layers: How to Edit and Save Images Like a Pro** In the world of digital art and graphic design, background layers can be a source of infinite creativity, but sometimes we need to take a step back and give our primary visuals room to shine. One way to achieve this is by turning off the background layer or removing it completely in your image editing software. In this article, we'll explore the ins and outs of background layers, revealing best practices for editing and saving your image like a pro. **1. Understanding Background Layers** Before diving into the process of turning off the background layer, it is crucial to understand its role in your image editing software. The background layer is the visual foundation upon which other layers and elements reside. By default, it is often locked, set to the lowest position, and comes with a 'background' name. This lock prevents accidental movement or editing of the layer, ensuring overall image stability. You can think of it as a digital canvas, a starting point on which you create a composition. **2. Benefits of Turning Off the Background Layer** You may wonder, why would you need to turn off the background layer? Removing or disabling background layers can dramatically change the look of your creation and offer several benefits: - *Transparency*: This allows you to save an image with a transparent background, which can be particularly helpful when creating logos, icons, or web elements that require a clean, invisible background. - *Design flexibility*: With less visual noise and fewer distractions, it becomes easier to focus on your primary design elements. Peeling back the background layer can help establish a clear visual hierarchy and improve the composition. - *Experimentation*: Turning off the background layer can reveal new perspectives and help you experiment with different styles, blending modes, or contrasting elements without committing to a specific background color or texture. - *File Optimization*: By removing unnecessary background layers, the overall file size is usually reduced, which can facilitate faster downloads and seamless integration of your image with other software or platforms. **3. How to Turn Off the Background Layer** Different image editing software applications work differently, but the process of turning off the background layer generally follows a similar pattern. Here are general steps you can follow, keeping in mind that the specific approach may vary depending on your preferred software: 1. Open your image or project file. 2. Locate the Layers panel in your software. This is usually displayed as a stack of layers on the side or bottom of your workspace. 3. Identify the background layer. It is typically located at the bottom of the layers stack and could be labeled as 'background', 'layer 0', or 'bottom layer', depending on the software. 4. Turn off the background layer by clicking on the 'eye' icon, or 'visibility' checkbox, usually located next to the layer's name. This action will hide the background, making it invisible in your image. 5. If desired, you can delete the background layer altogether by selecting it and pressing the Delete key or dragging it to the trash bin icon in the Layers panel. **4. Saving Your Image Without the Background Layer** Now that you have turned off or removed the background layer, you will want to save your image with the changes: 1. Go to your software's File menu and choose the 'Save As' or 'Export' option, depending on the application. 2. Select a file format that supports transparency, such as PNG or GIF. JPEG does not support transparency, so if you save your image as a JPEG, the software will likely fill the transparent area with a solid color (typically white). 3. Confirm your desired file settings and click on the 'Save' or 'Export' button to complete the process. **Conclusion** No longer confined to a static backdrop, the power of background layers can help elevate your digital artwork to new creative heights. With confidence in turning off and saving images without background layers, you can create dynamic visuals that maintain design flexibility and make a more significant impact. Whether you're a freelance artist, professional graphic designer, or just someone looking to improve their image editing skills, understanding how to remove or turn off background layers is an essential skill. By mastering this aspect of image editing, you'll be better equipped to handle future projects and produce eye-catching designs."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: Tony decided to cook a large amount of pasta for dinner, a meal that contains a high amount of glucose and will stimulate the release of insulin. Tony eats his meal on the couch, while sitting next to his sister Justine. Justine is not eating a meal, and is just quietly watching television.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who will more likely be expressing a higher amount of genes at that time?  Hint: Gene activation leads to other effects, since the protein products of many of the responding genes include enzymes and factors that increase gene expression. Gene expression factors produced as a result of a cascade can turn on even more genes. Therefore one stimulus can trigger the expression of many genes, and this in turn can lead to the activation of many complex events. In a multicellular organism these events include the increased uptake of glucose from the blood stream (stimulated by insulin), and the movement of neutrophils to sites of infection (stimulated by bacterial products). The set of genes and the order in which they are activated in response to stimuli are often called a genetic program. Answer:","output":"Tony will more likely be expressing a higher amount of genes at that time. This is because he is eating a meal high in glucose, which will stimulate the release of insulin.

In addition to the steps in Method 2, most states require additional steps if you want to change both your name and gender legally. Many states require a Change of Name and Gender form in addition to the state’s standard petition or order for a name change.  For example, in California, applicants must fill out Form NCC-200 in addition to the standard name-change document Form NC-110.  Other documents vary by state. Look into your local laws. Most states require a licensed physician to provide documentation that you have undergone the respective change of gender. Your doctor may be able to write his or her own note or use a form provided from the state.  In California, for instance, your physician can use the Declaration of Physician Attachment, which is officially Form NC-210.  Each state has different requirements for what constitutes change of gender. In California, Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., the clinical treatment does not necessarily need to be surgical. You’ll still file your forms in your jurisdiction’s civil court and attend your hearing as with Method 2. If the judge approves your request, then you will receive a court order allowing you to change not just your name but also your gender on state-issued documents. Again, each state differs on its approach to changing your name and gender when it comes to legal documents. Some states may not even allow a change of gender on particular documents.  For example, in California you do not need a court-ordered gender change to change your driver's license or birth certificate. Other states, such as Ohio, Idaho, and Tennessee, do not allow gender changes to birth certificates at all.  For a federal document, such as a social security card, you must provide a court-ordered name change document in order to be issued a new card. Gender details do not appear on social security cards, but to change you gender filed with the Social Security Administration, you can show a state-issued amended birth certificate, a physician’s letter certifying clinical treatment, or a ten-year U.S. passport showing the appropriate gender marker.  To receive a ten-year U.S. passport, your ID and passport photo must resemble your current appearance, and you must submit a letter from a physician certifying that you have completed your transition.","output":"To change your name and gender legally, each state has different steps and forms to fill out, and you usually need a doctor's note to show you've gone through a change of gender, but some states might not allow changing gender on certain documents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Put yourself in his shoes. Check-in when there are issues. Adjust any behaviors you agree are bad. Break up with him if he threatens to break up with you all the time. Reignite the spark. Give each other some space.","output":"Title: Navigating Relationships: Understanding Your Partner and Strengthening Your Bond Together Introduction A thriving relationship is built on a foundation of trust, understanding, and mutual respect. Navigating the complexities of human connections can be a challenge, but with a little effort and dedication, we can strengthen our bonds and relish a more profound, satisfying partnership. This article outlines six key recommendations on fostering a deeper understanding of your significant other, adjusting behaviors, and reigniting the passion, all essential factors in maintaining a strong, loving relationship. 1. Put Yourself in His Shoes Empathy is one of the most valuable aspects in a healthy relationship. It’s important to step outside our own perspectives and put ourselves in our partner's shoes, especially when they're going through difficulties. By understanding their emotions, thoughts, and experiences, we can communicate with them better and offer the necessary support. This approach allows us to be fully present with them and fosters a stronger connection. Remember, it isn't about fixing their problems but rather, being there for them by offering a listening ear, emotional support, and constructive feedback when needed. 2. Check-in When There Are Issues Effective communication is pivotal in maintaining a loving and supportive relationship. It's essential to be open and honest about our feelings, concerns, and needs. When issues arise, it's crucial to check in with our partners to discuss our feelings and work toward a solution. Instead of resorting to blame or passive-aggressive behavior, focus on constructive dialogue that encourages compromise and mutual understanding. Be willing to listen to your partner's point of view and, together, find a way to resolve any conflicts in a manner that benefits both parties. 3. Adjust Any Behaviors You Agree Are Bad No one is perfect, but it's important to recognize and be willing to change any harmful behaviors that our partners bring to our attention. By accepting our flaws and taking responsibility for our actions, we demonstrate commitment and care for the relationship. Work on self-awareness, and be open to feedback from your significant other. It is through self-growth and evolving together that relationships truly prosper. 4. Break Up with Him If He Threatens to Break Up with You All the Time Emotional blackmail and manipulation have no place in a healthy, loving relationship. If your partner frequently threatens to end the relationship as a means of controlling your behavior, this can be a significant red flag. Consistently using the possibility of a breakup as a weapon to achieve certain goals is emotionally damaging and indicates that your partner's priorities might not be rooted in mutual respect and love. In such cases, it may be best to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether it truly has the potential to grow into a nurturing, supportive partnership. 5. Reignite the Spark Over time, passion and affection can start to fade in any relationship. As a couple, it's important not to take each other for granted and to continue making an effort to reignite the spark that brought you together in the first place. Surprise your partner with small gestures of love, flirt with each other, and take the time to plan date nights just like in the beginning. Remember to celebrate special occasions, and always show appreciation and admiration for each other. Reigniting the passion demonstrates that you both still value and cherish the connection you share. 6. Give Each Other Some Space Maintaining personal space in a relationship is essential for individual growth, self-care, and personal pursuits. While spending quality time together is vital, it's equally important to allow each other time alone. Encourage your partner to engage in hobbies or activities they enjoy, and do the same for yourself. By giving each other the space necessary to grow and discover personal interests, you create a healthy balance that will ultimately lead to a stronger, more satisfying relationship. Conclusion Strengthening and nurturing a relationship requires constant effort, patience, and understanding. By employing empathy, addressing issues through open communication, adjusting behaviors, and finding ways to reignite the spark, we can deepen our connections with our significant others. Furthermore, acknowledging the need for personal space and setting healthy boundaries demonstrates mutual respect and contributes to the longevity of the relationship. In prioritizing these vital factors, we build the foundation for a strong and loving relationship that has the potential to thrive and grow over time."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Bailey would make it up after knowing the suffer of the opponent.

Q: Taylor stopped Bailey from getting an abortion because she felt like she was making an impulsive decision.  Given the context: What will happen to Taylor? The answer is:","output":"1. First, it is essential to consider the nature of the relationship between Taylor and Bailey, as it will influence how Bailey reacts to Taylor's intervention. 2. Assuming that Taylor and Bailey are close friends, it is likely that Bailey will initially react with a mix of emotions, including anger, frustration, and potentially appreciation that Taylor cares enough to step in. 3. In the short term, their friendship may be strained due to Taylor's actions. Bailey may feel that Taylor overstepped her boundaries and that the decision should have been left entirely up to her. 4. Taylor will need to communicate her reasons for stopping the abortion clearly and with empathy. She should emphasize that she did it out of concern for Bailey's well-being and explain the specific factors that made her think Bailey's decision was impulsive. 5. Over time, Bailey's reaction to Taylor's intervention will be shaped by the outcome of her decision. If Bailey ultimately decides to keep the pregnancy and feels satisfied with her choice, she may come to appreciate Taylor's actions and see them as providing helpful guidance when she was struggling. 6. However, if Bailey regrets not having the abortion, the incident may create lasting tension between the two friends, making it difficult for them to repair their relationship. 7. Both Taylor and Bailey will need to address the situation openly and honestly in order to navigate the challenges that arise from Taylor's actions. 8. In summary, what will happen to Taylor depends on the strength and nature of her relationship with Bailey, how she communicates her reasons for stopping the abortion, and Bailey's ultimate feelings about the decision she was prevented from making. Taylor may face immediate negative reactions and potential long-term consequences in her friendship with Bailey. However, if managed with care and understanding, the friendship could recover and even strengthen over time."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

(CNN) -- Music manager Allen Klein, whose clients included the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, died Saturday after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's disease, his publicist said. Klein was 77.  The son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary, Klein founded his firm Allen Klein & Co. in the late 1950s before the label evolved into ABKCO Music & Records in New York. The independent label holds the copyrights to music by the Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke, the Animals, the Kinks, Chubby Checker, Bobby Womack and hundreds of others.  Klein represented dozens of artists, including Sam Cooke, the Animals, Bobby Darin and Herman's Hermits. He changed the music industry when he represented Sam Cooke in negotiations with RCA, winning the artist control of his own master recordings.  Known for a tenacious and often blunt style in negotiations, Klein's greatest coups were inking contracts with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, though both relationships ended in legal battles.  ABKCO built up a catalog of copyrights to more than 2,000 songs, including much of the Stones' 1960s catalog. Klein retained ownership of those titles even after splitting with the Stones. In 1969, John Lennon persuaded the other Beatles that Klein should take over the group's business affairs, but Paul McCartney resisted the move and some music historians say the appointment hastened the Beatles' split.  Lennon later fell out with Klein, who was thought to be the target of the former Beatle's 1974 song \\"Steel and Glass.\\"  Defending his tough style, Klein told Playboy magazine in 1971: \\"The music business is about 99 percent no-talent losers who can't stand a winner in their midst.\\"  1.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Billy loved choose, but he didn't put it on his meal because he was watching his weight. He even used a low fat what? Possible A: lot of fat, salad dressing, strong odor, age to get better, age well  Why is \\"salad dressing\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Salad dressing\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it is related to food, making it relevant to the question, and it is a type of condiment or addition to a meal that can have a low-fat alternative. The question states that Billy loved cheese, but didn't put it on his meal as he was watching his weight. This implies that Billy is being conscious about his diet and making an effort to consume fewer calories or unhealthy fats. In this situation, using low-fat salad dressing showcases a food choice that aligns with Billy's goal of weight-watching. The other options listed - lot of fat, strong odor, age to get better, age well - don't make much sense in the context of the question.

If it’s your first time, it’s usually better to go with a color that is only slightly lighter or darker than your own hair color. But, the color you desire is ultimately your choice. You may want blonde streaks, or pink or purple streaks. If you're unsure what will look good in your hair, start small by streaking one piece of hair with your favorite color. If you love it, you can always add more.  Some people choose to have one pretty pink or purple streak running down the side. This adds a subtle beauty to your style. For a punk look, add a lot of streaks extending from the crown of your head down to the tips. Choose blue, green, or platinum blonde. If you want to go blonde or up to two shades lighter, you may not need a hair dye. You can get away with using bleach. Consider how many streaks you would like to put in your hair. You may want a few streaks for a subtle effect, or a head full of streaks to dramatically change your hair color. It’s important to plan what your desired outcomes is before beginning the dyeing process. If you aren’t confident about dyeing your hair on your own, it’s better to start with only a few streaks. The supplies you get will be partially determined by the natural color of your hair. If you have light hair and are planning to streak it with a darker color, you do not need to bleach your hair first.  If you have dark or medium hair and want a light or unnatural color, you'll definitely need to bleach before streaking to make sure the color comes out looking bright and beautiful. You can buy your supplies at a beauty supply shop, like Sally’s Beauty Supply. The supplies you will need are:  Bleach powder, which comes in either packets or tubs. If you're doing just a few streaks, you won't need much. Crème developer, which makes the bleach work. If your hair is already blonde or light brown, use a 20 or 30 volume developer. Never get a volume higher than 40, or you'll damage your hair. Red Gold Corrector is added to the bleach powder to increase its effectiveness, so you don't have to bleach twice.

Rouhani's diplomatic progress in Geneva keeps Iran's hardliners at bay Iranians burning American flags this week during a demonstration to mark the anniversary of the 1979 US embassy takeover. Photograph: Majid Saeedi/Getty From his room in Geneva's InterContinental hotel on Friday morning, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, could take in the sweeping view of Mont Blanc looming over Lake Geneva before an intensive day of diplomacy with his US and European counterparts. Many would take in this idyllic vista and think of skiing and hiking, but for Iran's most senior diplomat it might well suggest the \\"mountain of challenges\\" – as the Persian idiom has it – that he and President Hassan Rouhani face back home. As Zarif met the EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, and prepared to shake the hands of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, hardliners in Tehran made clear they were still opposed to the United States and feared any prospect of an agreement in Geneva. \\"Death to America,\\" chanted crowds sympathetic to the elite Revolutionary Guards and its voluntary Basij militia gathered at Tehran University in the centre of the city for Friday prayers. The Geneva talks were held on Thursday and Friday, the Iranian weekend, which is likely to have reduced the public backlash in Iran, but still the hardliners made their voices heard. The leader of Tehran's Friday prayers, Ayatollah Ali Movahedi Kermani, said in remarks broadcast live on national radio that any deal with the west would be detrimental to Iran. \\"It's harmful to underestimate the enemy because they do nothing but play tricks,\\" Kermani said. \\"Our enemy would not rest even for a moment. If we underestimate the enemy, we will definitely get hurt.\\" The imam was particularly critical of assurances Kerry gave to Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, before leaving Tel Aviv for Geneva. \\"The US secretary of state has promised Netanyahu that he will not do a bad deal with Iran,\\" he said. \\"This means that they will not agree to anything that is harmful for them – which means they will not make a good deal with Iran.\\" Reflecting remarks this week by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has said that he is not optimistic about the talks, Kermani said: \\"I don't think the talks will bear fruit. They [the enemy] are not going to stop their hostility towards us.\\" Despite Kermani's warning, Rouhani's diplomacy appears to have the support of Khamenei, who has ultimate power in all state matters. Khamenei has criticised those who labelled Iran's nuclear negotiators \\"compromisers\\", warning that they had a difficult mission and no one should \\"weaken an official who is busy with work\\". Iran's conservative-dominated parliament has so far been silent about the trajectory of the talks, although a group of MPs criticised Rouhani's team for keeping the details of a possible accord secret from the public and called them to parliament for questioning. Others said it was necessary the talks remained secret at this stage. On Friday, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, signalled his approval of the Geneva talks. He told the Isna news agency that the ground had been prepared for an agreement that would ease western sanctions and that it was compatible with Iran's national interests. Khamenei's backing of Zarif's team means many of the more hawkish fundamentalists have refrained from criticising the new government's diplomacy directly. Instead, they have warned against giving in to the west's demands. Before Rouhani's largely successful visit to the UN in New York in September, Khamenei gave him more authority by talking of \\"heroic flexibility\\". That visit brought a historic phone conversation between Rouhani and Barack Obama, the first direct talks between Iranian and US leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution. \\"Khamenei himself is also under lots of pressure,\\" an Iranian analyst said, asking not to be identified. \\"The hardliners in the Revolutionary Guards are surrounding him all the time and sabotaging Rouhani's diplomacy by injecting scepticism about Americans and their intentions.\\" As Rouhani passes his first 100 days in office, he can claim credit for a number of election promises that have been fulfilled. A number of leading activists have been released from prison and Tehran has taken serious steps to improve ties with the west, not least breaking the 34-year taboo of talking directly to the US at the highest level. A Tehran University professor, Sadegh Zibakalam, said by telephone that he anticipated a historic moment in Iran's relationship with the west. \\"We didn't expect this, but it seems that Rouhani's 'key' is opening many doors and a historic agreement may be under way,\\" he said, referring to the key Rouhani adopted as the symbol of his election campaign. \\"We don't know much about the details of this possible deal but to me what's important is that for the first time in 35 years since the 1979 Islamic republic, it appears Iran and the west are trusting each other despite sabotage by hardliners in Iran, in Washington or Tel Aviv. For the first time, it seems Iran has trusted the US and Europe's words that they are not seeking regime change and that the sole issue here is the nuclear programme. The west, on the other hand, seems to have taken Iran's word that it will open the doors to IAEA inspectors and have nothing to hide.\\" Zibakalam said hardliners in Tehran were driven by rivalry with Rouhani's moderate administration. \\"It is partly true that in general, hardliners don't want the Rouhani team to succeed. \\"They are even ready to sacrifice national interests for their political gains and internal rivalry,\\" he said. \\"There is also a third group of people who really don't believe we should have any sort of dialogue or relations with the west.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's diplomatic progress in Geneva helps to keep hardliners at bay, as he gains support from the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for his diplomacy efforts and continues to fulfill election promises. Despite resistance from conservative forces, Rouhani maintains trust in the West and seeks to resolve issues surrounding Iran's nuclear program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: There is a Web site called the \\"World Database of Happiness.\\" It combines and analyzes the results of hundreds of surveys from around the world that have been conducted on life satisfaction. Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are surprising. The database makes it clear that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche to say that money can't buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be supported by research. Many people still cling to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably mistaken. Studies have been carried out on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had worn off, people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they tended to revert to the way they felt before they became rich. Previously contented people continue to be contented, while those who were miserable before sink back into misery. If material wealth does not bring happiness, then what does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with where you live. The authorities at the World Database on Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different countries. Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy. Other surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships in particular seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that falling in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness. Nowadays people look to technology as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet rather than spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is accurate, time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money.

The statement has been released by the United Nations to mark UN Disaster Reduction Day. More people are made homeless by environmental disasters than by war,according to the research by the Red Cross. That reality is proved by the earthquake in Pakistan.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming.

Among the thousands of historic sites there are castles and factories, town halls and churches. Here we look at some of the places that most tourists might not know about. Roman Baths --- Chester These Roman baths are almost two thousand years old and a fascinating insight into the history of the city but they aren't often open to visitors because they are under a clothes shop and a shop that sells baked potatoes! In Open Days week, visitors can go downstairs to the basement of the shops and find a little piece of history. Tennis Club --- Birmingham Edgbaston Tennis Club opened in 1860 and is the oldest tennis club in the world. Visitors can see the club's collection of tennis clothes and equipment and learn about the game's rich history. Ardman Animation --- Bristol The studios that produced the famous Wallace and Gromit animated films open its doors to the public to let people find out more about how the films are made.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the release whose track listing included previously unreleased pop songs written by the Jaojoby in the 1970s and 1980s in French, Malagasy, Creole, and English?, using the article: Jaojoby's success and popularity attained new heights in 1998 with the release of E! Tiako. He was named \\"Artist of the Year\\" in Madagascar for two consecutive years (1998–1999), and the single \\"Malemilemy\\" received regular airplay across the island more than a year after the album was released. In July 1999, Jaojoby was named Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund and supported the United Nations' activities in Madagascar related to raising awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and other concerns relevant to the Malagasy youth population. The lyrics of his songs commonly address social issues, typified by a track on E! Tiako that encourages the use of condoms to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS.Aza Arianao was recorded over five days in the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which was recorded in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.The March 2008 release of Donnant-Donnant celebrated Jaojoby's roots as a cabaret performer of soul, funk, and other Western popular genres. The track listing included previously unreleased pop songs written by the artist in the 1970s and 1980s in French, Malagasy, Creole, and English. Later that year, in September, he became the second Malagasy musical act (after supergroup Mahaleo, in 2007) to perform at the prestigious and historic Olympia music hall in Paris.

Dana Boente, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was sworn in at 9 p.m. ET, per an administration official. A few hours later, Boente issued a statement rescinding Yates' order, instructing DOJ lawyers to \\"defend the lawful orders of our President.\\"      Trump didn't call Yates to dismiss her, she was informed by hand-delivered letter, according to a different administration official.

Yates' decision was always likely to be extremely short-lived as Sessions is scheduled for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.      White House policy director Stephen Miller, who helped craft the executive order, called Yates' decision \\"a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become.\\"      \\"It's sad that our politics have become so politicized, that you have people refusing to enforce our laws,\\" Miller said Monday night on MSNBC.

And Yates is such a person.\\"      Currently, there are cases filed in at least five states including Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, Washington and California that are challenging Trump's order.      The decision effectively grounds the executive order for the next few days until Sessions is sworn in.      \\"This will be moot.

In a written statement, Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch lauded Yates, calling her leadership \\"courageous.\\"      \\"(Yates) displayed the fierce intellect, unshakeable integrity, and deep commitment to the rule of law,\\" Lynch said.      Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN's Erin Burnett Monday the Justice Department decision reflects poorly on the Trump administration.      \\"When you do something as important as this, it can't be a Twitter-type of activity,\\" Schumer said. \\"This has to be thoroughly vetted ... and it's a very bad omen for this presidency.\\"      Activists who have led the fight against Trump's immigration ban lauded Yates' action Monday night.      \\"We took to the court room, people took to the streets and now principled federal officials are drawing a hardline on this shameful and unconstitutional act by President Trump.

Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued against the immigration ban in court in New York, praised Yates' decision and called on the next attorney general to \\"continue with that policy.\\"      \\"This ban will do irreparable damage to real people and to American values,\\" he said. ||||| poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201701/1822/1155968404_5304740684001_5304688046001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Trump fires defiant acting attorney general The Obama administration official serving as acting chief had instructed lawyers there not to defend President Trump's executive order.      President Donald Trump fired the nation's acting attorney general Monday night after she refused to defend an executive order he issued last week restricting immigration in the name of national security.      In an act of high political drama just 10 days after taking office, Trump replaced Obama administration appointee Sally Yates with Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney in Alexandria, Va.      Story Continued Below      \\"The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel,\\" a White House statement said. \\"Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\\"      Yates could not be reached for comment on Trump's attack, but a person close to her called the criticism from the White House absurd.      \\"That's preposterous. Everyone knows she's a career prosecutor for nearly three decades, well-respected by serious members of both parties,\\" said the Yates associate, who asked not to be named. \\"That dog won't hunt.\\"      A Trump aide accused Yates of seeking attention.      \\"She knew what she was doing and she knew she'd be fired. She just wanted the publicity,\\" said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.      Despite sharp criticism of the wisdom of Trump’s move, there appears to be little doubt that under federal law Trump has legal authority to install any Senate-confirmed member of the Justice Department as the acting attorney general.      Yates, who was the No. 2 official at the department before Trump's swearing-in and has been running the department since that time at Trump's request, sent a memo Monday saying she doubts the wisdom and the legality of the directive blocking immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries.      \\"My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,\\" Yates wrote in a memo released by the department earlier Monday.      \\"At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\\" the acting Justice Department head said. \\"For as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\\"      Some lawyers warned removing Yates could disrupt other department operations, including surveillance aimed at suspected terrorists. However, two officials said Monday night that as a Senate-confirmed official Boente could sign such orders.      Trump's first reaction to Yates' move came in a tweet earlier Monday evening.      \\"The Democrats are delaying my Cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.,\\" Trump wrote, apparently accusing Yates of blocking his agenda. He did not complete the thought.      Trump's removal of Yates had echoes of the so-called \\"Saturday Night Massacre\\" in 1973, when Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus both resigned rather than comply with President Richard Nixon's order to fire Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. Solicitor General Robert Bork assumed the role of acting attorney general and complied with Nixon's demand. The dismissal of someone who was investigating Nixon further undermined his credibility amid the burgeoning Watergate scandal.͝      Speaking on the Senate floor Monday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed Yates and dubbed her firing a \\"Monday night massacre.\\"      \\"She was fired because she would not enact, pursue the executive order on the belief that it was illegal, perhaps unconstitutional,\\" the New York Democrat said. \\"It was a profile in courage. It was a brave act and a right act.\\"      Schumer blasted the executive order as \\"evil\\" and faulted Trump aides for failing to clear the directive with relevant government agencies and top Cabinet officials. He also warned darkly of danger for the the country if the Trump continues to act rashly.      \\"You just can't sit down, Twitter something out, then think, 'OK, let's enact it.' This is a complicated country, and when you do something as major as what the president proposed in his executive order, you got to think it through. You got to talk to people,\\" Schumer said. \\"How can you run a country like this? ... If this continues, this country has big trouble.\\"      The top Democrat on the House Judicial Committee, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, also drew parallels to Nixon's actions more than four decades ago.            \\"President Trump has commenced a course of conduct that is Nixonian in its design and execution and threatens the long-vaunted independence of the Justice Department,\\" Conyers said in a statement. \\"If dedicated government officials deem his directives to be unlawful and unconstitutional, he will simply fire them as if government is a reality show. I call on my colleagues, regardless of party, to condemn this executive order and the reckless firing of our chief law enforcement officer. \\"      There was little reaction from Republican lawmakers Monday night , but Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas made it clear he backed Trump's move.      \\"It is fitting--and sad--that the very last act of the Obama DOJ is for the acting AG to defy the newly elected POTUS,\\" Cruz wrote on Twitter.      Dana Boente is now the acting attorney general. | AP Photo      Boente was sworn in at about 9 p.m. Monday, according to a White House official who did not immediately provide details on who carried out the ceremony.      Boente quickly reversed Yates’ DOJ memo Monday night on Trump’s executive order on immigration, saying the order was on solid ground.      “Based upon the Office of Legal Counsel’s analysis, which found the Executive Order both lawful on its face and properly drafted, I hereby rescind former Acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates January 30, 2017, guidance and direct the men and women of the Department of Justice to do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our President,” Boente said in a statement.      Boente, who has served as a Justice Department attorney for more than 30 years, was nominated by President Barack Obama as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2015 and confirmed later that year. He has embraced his new role leading the department, according to a statement issued by the White House.      “I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed. I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected,” Boente said. His statement did not address what stance he plans to take on Trump's executive order.      Boente had led a number of prosecutions of political figures, including former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife. McDonnell's bribery conviction was subsequently overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.      Boente may not be in the position for long. Trump's nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), is scheduled for a vote Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee. A floor vote on his nomination is expected in the following days, but the exact timing remains unclear.      Yates' firing seems certain to prompt fiery rhetoric at Tuesday's committee vote, which had been expected to go Sessions' way without too much drama. However, there was no immediate indication the dramatic episode caused Sessions to shed any support.      Sessions’ past comments to Yates at her confirmation hearing in 2015 also started getting attention overnight. The senator at the time pressed Yates about whether should would be willing to stand up to the president if he pushes the Justice Department to pursue policies or actions that don’t appear lawful.      \\"You have to watch out because people will be asking you to do things and you need to say no. You think the attorney general has the responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that's improper?\\" Sessions asked, adding, \\"But if the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no?\\"      Yates did not hesitate in her response, saying, \\"Senator, I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president.\\"      The executive order Trump signed Friday temporarily halts travel to the U.S. by residents of seven countries, suspends new refugee approvals for 120 days and indefinitely shuts down the admission of Syrian refugees to the U.S. Another provision in the order gives Christians and other religious minorities in largely Muslim countries priority to immigrate to the United States.      Yates memo suggested she viewed the order as legally suspect not solely because of its wording but also because of statements Trump and others have made about it. Trump indicated in an interview last week that the order was intended to give Christians an advantage in the immigration process. An outside adviser to Trump, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has said the order grew out of Trump's effort to find a \\"legal\\" way to follow through on his campaign trail promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.                  Yates' order would have left the government with no authorized courtroom representation in several lawsuits and dozens of other court actions challenging Trump's order and the way it was carried out by immigration authorities. At least one of the suits is currently seeking a broad restraining order against Trump's directive.      Some lawyers criticized Yates' memo, saying she had a legal duty to defend Trump's executive order unless she decided there was no reasonable argument for its legality. Her statement stops short of saying that, indicating that she had not been convinced the order was lawful.      \\"The typical standard for the Attorney General to defend an EO of the President is not whether she is convinced of its legality. Rather, the standard is something closer to the idea that she should defend the EO unless she is convinced of its illegality,\\" Harvard Law Professor and former George W. Bush Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith wrote on the Lawfare blog.      Goldsmith called her statement \\"unpersuasive\\" and said the better course for her would have been to resign over her disagreement with the policy laid out in the order.      Yates spent more than a decade as a career prosecutor in Atlanta, before being appointed as the U.S. Attorney there by President Barack Obama in 2010. Obama nominated her as deputy attorney general in 2014 and she assumed the role early the following year.      Most political appointees resigned or offered to resign with the change in administration, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch. However, the Justice Department announced a few days before Trump's inauguration that he asked Yates to stay on as acting head of the department until a new attorney general was confirmed.      Josh Dawsey contributed to this article. ||||| Summary:","output":"President Donald Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for not enforcing his executive order that temporarily banned people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Yates had told Justice Department lawyers not to make legal arguments defending Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees. Trump quickly replaced Yates with Dana Boente, who in a statement said that he would defend the lawful orders of the president. Several federal judges have ruled against Trump's order, but Trump's nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, is expected to defend the order if confirmed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the second sentence talks about \\"the three male leads churning up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome\\". This statement conveys a negative sentiment, criticising the performance and dialogue of the male leads. 3. The text then mentions, \\"The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat.

Finally, the last phrase \\"For fans of the stars only\\", implies that the only people who might enjoy the movie are those who are fans of the actors, suggesting a somewhat negative sentiment overall. In conclusion, there are moments of both positive and negative sentiment, but the predominant sentiment seems to be negative, based on comments about the performance of the leading actors, the tiresome dialogue, the overlength of the film, and the unsatisfying nature of the overall drama.

Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

This perception is derived from the choice of words and the way they are presented. Let's break down the sentence to understand this more clearly. 1. \\"Beautiful\\": The word \\"beautiful\\" is a commonly used adjective to describe something or someone possessing qualities that are visually pleasing, attractive, or having aesthetic appeal. In general, it is considered a positive attribute and conveys a feeling of admiration and happiness. Describing something or someone as beautiful typically means that they evoke warm and appreciative emotions in the observer. 2. \\"Quite\\": The use of the word \\"quite\\" with \\"beautiful\\" can impact the intensity of the sentiment. \\"Quite\\" can mean slightly, completely, or to a certain extent. In this context, it is used to amplify the sense of beauty or to emphasize that the subject of the sentence is not just beautiful but considerably beautiful. By adding the modifier \\"quite\\" to the sentence, it indicates that the observer is impressed and appreciative of the level of beauty they discern. When combining these two components, the sentiment of the sentence \\"quite beautiful\\" can be interpreted as an expression of positive appreciation for the considerable beauty of the person or object being described. This expression offers a sincere and genuine compliment that generates a sense of positivity, admiration, and delight in the receiver as well as the person conveying it. It reflects the speaker's willingness to acknowledge and share their positive emotions with others, thus creating an environment of warmth, happiness, and positivity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alongside the additional troops, Apache attack helicopters will be deployed for the first time against IS in Iraq. US Defence Secretary Ash Carter made the announcement during an unannounced visit to Baghdad, where he met with US military officials and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The US also plans to give Kurdish Peshmerga forces, which are fighting IS on the ground, more than 400m (Â£280m; â‚¬350m) in assistance. Co-operation between the two forces was evident on Monday when Kurdish officials said they had killed a senior IS commander in the south of Mosul in a joint raid with US special forces. According to the officials, the operation in Hamam Alil resulted in the death of Salman Abu Shabib al-Jebouri, a leading member of the IS military council, and two of his aides. Most of the additional 200 US troops will be special forces, according to the Associated Press. The remainder will include trainers, security forces for the advisers, and maintenance crews for the Apaches. The Apaches would help Iraqi forces to recapture the country's second city of Mosul from IS, Mr Carter said. The US is leading an international coalition that has been bombing IS targets since August 2014. IS seized large areas of Iraq, north and west of Baghdad, in 2014, but Iraqi forces have recaptured significant ground from the jihadists in recent months. The Pentagon has been arguing for some time that it should increase the numbers of troops and in particular special forces in Iraq. It now seems that Defence Secretary Ash Carter has got the White House to agree. The enlarged presence is likely to see the numbers of US troops close to the front line rise, as the advise and assist role they undertake means they work closely with their Iraqi counterparts involved in the fighting. Just last month, a US marine was killed in combat when the Islamic State Group fired Katyusha rockets at a base close to Mosul. This stepping up comes as the battle for Mosul starts to become a reality. Iraq's second largest city is seen as key in the war to squeeze IS out of Iraq and Syria. What was that article about?","output":"The article details the deployment of an additional 200 US troops in Iraq, which will increase the total number of US personnel in Iraq to about 4,100. Along with these troops, Apache attack helicopters will also be deployed for the first time against ISIS in Iraq. The US Defense Secretary Ash Carter made this announcement during an unannounced visit to Baghdad, meeting with US military officials and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The US also plans to provide over 400 million in assistance to Kurdish Peshmerga forces fighting ISIS on the ground. A joint operation between Kurdish officials and US special forces recently killed a senior ISIS commander, Salman Abu Shabib al-Jebouri, who was a leading member of the ISIS military council. Most of the additional 200 US troops will be special forces, with the remaining being trainers, security forces for advisers, and maintenance crews for the Apache helicopters. These reinforcements are meant to help Iraqi forces recapture the country's second-largest city, Mosul, from ISIS control. The US is leading an international coalition targeting ISIS through bombings since August 2014. Iraqi forces have managed to recapture significant areas from ISIS in recent months, and the ongoing battle for Mosul is seen as a key element in the fight to eliminate ISIS's presence in Iraq and Syria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet? is inside the article: Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (Le carillon, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet's orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, \\"with its graceful movement and bewitching colour\\", which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The Méditation for solo violin and orchestra, from Thaïs, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge from La Vierge, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.A Parisian critic, after seeing La grand' tante, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral.  Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, \\"What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.\\" His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire.  Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive., can you guess it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Media of the United States consist of several different types of media: television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and Internet-based Web sites. The U.S. also has a strong music industry. Many of the media are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenue from advertising, subscriptions, and sale of copyrighted material. American media conglomerates tend to be leading global players, generating large revenues as well as large opposition in many parts of the world. With the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, further deregulation and convergence are under way, leading to mega-mergers, further concentration of media ownership, and the emergence of multinational media conglomerates. These mergers enable tighter control of information. Currently, five corporations control roughly 90% of the media. Critics allege that localism, local news and other content at the community level, media spending and coverage of news, and diversity of ownership and views have suffered as a result of these processes of media concentration. See options at the end. Can we conclude that the electronic media in the united states are primarily owned and operated by the federal government? pick from the following. [I] no; [II] yes;","output":"[I] No, the electronic media in the United States are not primarily owned and operated by the federal government. Instead, they are largely controlled by private for-profit corporations that focus on generating revenue through advertising, subscriptions, and the sale of copyrighted material. These corporations may, at times, be influenced by government regulations and policies, but they operate independently and are not directly controlled by the federal government. The American media landscape is currently dominated by a small number of large conglomerates, with five corporations controlling approximately 90% of the media. This situation has raised concerns about the potential for reduced localism, less diversity in views and ownership, and a decreased focus on local news and content at the community level. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to deregulate the media industry, resulting in increased mergers and consolidation among media companies. This has further concentrated media ownership and allowed for the emergence of multinational media conglomerates. Critics argue that this consolidation has led to decreased media diversity and increased corporate control over information. Overall, it is important to recognize that the electronic media in the United States are primarily owned and operated by private corporations rather than the federal government. While the government does play a role in regulating the industry and may contribute to shaping media policies, it does not exert direct control over media ownership or operations."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: It's OK Review: The actors sing pretty good, but it all seems emotionless and dull to me.

(AP)  Federal authorities on Saturday charged a Nigerian man with attempting to destroy an aircraft on its final approach to on Christmas Day, and with placing a destructive device on the aircraft. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, a Nigerian national, boarded Northwest Flight 253 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Dec. 24 with a device fastened to his body, the Justice Department said in a late-afternoon news release. After feigning illness under a blanket, he ignited a high explosive, investigators said. Citing interviews with the passengers and crew of Flight 253, an affidavit in the case says the suspect \\"went to the bathroom for approximately 20 minutes. \\"Upon returning to his seat, Abdulmutallab stated that his stomach was upset, and he pulled a blanket over himself. Passengers then heard popping noises similar to firecrackers, smelled an odor, and some observed Abdulmutallab's pants leg and the wall of the airplane on fire.\\" Passengers and crew then subdued Abdulmutallab and used blankets and fire extinguishers to put out the flames. Passengers reported that Abdulmutallab was calm and lucid throughout. One flight attendant asked him what he had had in his pocket, and he replied 'explosive device.'\\" The commotion began as Northwest Airlines Flight 253, carrying 278 passengers and 11 crewmembers from Amsterdam, prepared to land in Detroit just before noon Friday. \\"It sounded like a firecracker in a pillowcase,\\" said Peter Smith, a passenger from the Netherlands. \\"First there was a pop, and then (there) was smoke.\\" Smith said one passenger, sitting opposite the man, climbed over passengers, went across the aisle and tried to restrain the man. The heroic passenger appeared to have been burned. Afterward, the suspect was taken to a front-row seat with his pants cut off and his legs burned. Multiple law enforcement officials also said the man appeared badly burned on his legs, indicating the explosive was strapped there. The components were apparently mixed in-flight and included a powdery substance, multiple law enforcement and counterterrorism officials said. The White House said it believed it was an attempted act of terrorism and stricter security measures were quickly imposed on airline travel. Dutch anti-terrorism authorities said the U.S. has asked all airlines to take extra precautions on flights worldwide that are bound for the United States. The incident was reminiscent of Richard Reid, who tried to destroy a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes, but was subdued by other passengers. Reid is serving a life sentence. Multiple law enforcement officials identified the suspect in Friday's attempted attack as Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab. He was described as Nigerian. In Nigeria, a prominent banker said Saturday that he was meeting with security officials there because he feared his son was the suspect. Alhaji Umaru Mutallab told The Associated Press that his son was a one-time university student in London who had left Britain to travel abroad. He said his son hadn't lived in London \\"for some time\\" but he wasn't sure exactly where he went to. \\"I believe he might have been to Yemen, but we are investigating to determine that,\\" the elder Mutallab said. He said he would provide more details later Saturday as he learned more from authorities. One law enforcement official said the man claimed to have been instructed by al-Qaeda to detonate the plane over U.S. soil, but other law enforcement officials cautioned that such claims could not be verified immediately, and said the man may have been acting independently — inspired but not specifically trained or ordered by terror groups. All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. Intelligence and anti-terrorism officials in Yemen said they were investigating claims by the suspect that he picked up the explosive device and instructions on how to use it in that country. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Melinda Dennis, who was seated in the front row of the plane, said the man involved was brought to the front row and seated near her. She said his legs appeared to be badly burned and his pants were cut off. She said he was taken off the plane handcuffed to a stretcher. An intelligence official said he was being held and treated in an Ann Arbor, Michigan, hospital. The hospital said one passenger from the flight was taken to the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, but referred all inquiries to the FBI. One law enforcement official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mutallab's name had surfaced earlier on at least one U.S. intelligence database, but he was not on a watch list or a no-fly list. The suspect boarded in Nigeria and went through Amsterdam en route to Detroit, Rep. Peter King, the ranking Republican member of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN. A spokeswoman for police at the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam declined comment about the case or about security procedures at the airport for Flight 253. Dutch airline KLM says the connection in Amsterdam from Lagos, Nigeria, to Detroit involves a change in carrier and a change in aircraft. Dutch antiterrorism authorities said Saturday that Mutallab was traveling on a U.S. visa valid through the first half of 2010. She said an initial investigation showed that routine security procedures were followed at Schiphol airport with no irregularities. Mutallab's name was on the passenger manifesto that was forwarded and approved by U.S. authorities before takeoff. Nigeria's information minister, Dora Akunyili, condemned the attempted bombing. She said the government has opened its own investigation into the suspect and will work with U.S. authorities. \\"We state very clearly that as a nation we abhor all forms of violence,\\" Akunyili said in a statement issued Saturday. London's Metropolitan Police also was working with U.S. officials, said a spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with department policy. A search was underway Saturday at an apartment building where Mutallab is said to have lived in a posh West London neighborhood. University College London issued a statement saying a student named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab studied mechanical engineering there between September 2005 and June 2008. But the college said it wasn't certain the student was the same person who was on the plane. Delta Air Lines Inc., which acquired Northwest last year, said a passenger caused a disturbance, was subdued, and the crew requested that law enforcement officials meet the flight. Passenger Syed Jafry, a U.S. citizen who had flown from the United Arab Emirates, said the incident occurred during the plane's descent. Jafry said he was seated three rows behind the passenger and said he saw a glow, and noticed a smoke smell. It was another passenger, who Jafry described as being in his 20s or early 30s and having a medium, stocky build, who quickly jumped toward the man who had started the fire. \\"He did a good job with his power, tackled him and put him under arrest,\\" Jafry said Saturday. Federal officials said there would be heightened security for both domestic and international flights at airports across the country, but the intensified levels would likely be \\"layered,\\" differing from location to location depending on alerts, security concerns and other factors. Passengers can expect to see more screening, bomb-sniffing dogs, officer units and behavioral-detection specialists at some airports, but there will also be unspecified less visible precautions as well, officials said. The FBI and the Homeland Security Department issued an intelligence note on Nov. 20 about the threat picture for the holiday season, which was obtained by The Associated Press. At the time, officials said they had no specific information about attack plans by al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups. President Obama was notified of the incident and discussed it with security officials, the White House said. Officials said he is monitoring the situation and receiving regular updates from his vacation spot in Hawaii. Copyright 2009 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's most vocal critics have long tried to tie the former secretary of state to President Barack Obama, hoping that her 2016 run would be dragged down by the somewhat unpopular president.  But ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address, critics say Clinton is making their job easy.  Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, an anti-Clinton communications and research super PAC, argues in talking points to other Republicans that Clinton is tying herself to Obama by working with and hiring many of his staffers ahead of her all-but-certain 2016 run.  \\"By hiring his key political and policy staff and making no public moves to place clear distance between herself and the President on issues likely to be front and center in the coming Congress, Clinton is signaling that she's not just from the same party as the President, but that she's an Obama Democrat, who will back his policies, pursue his agenda, and represent a Third Term of the Obama Administration,\\" Miller argues in a memo to the group's supporters.  Since last year, Clinton has been meeting with a broad array of Democratic operatives and possible campaign staffers ahead of a possible 2016 run. But in the last month, Clinton has reportedly began to tap certain Democratic operatives -- many with ties to Obama's two successful presidential runs -- for certain jobs on her nascent campaign.

Read this and answer the question Collegiate athletics are a popular draw in the state. The state has four schools that compete at the highest level of college sports, NCAA Division I. The most prominent are the state's two members of the Big 12 Conference, one of the so-called Power Five conferences of the top tier of college football, Division I FBS. The University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University average well over 50,000 fans attending their football games, and Oklahoma's football program ranked 12th in attendance among American colleges in 2010, with an average of 84,738 people attending its home games. The two universities meet several times each year in rivalry matches known as the Bedlam Series, which are some of the greatest sporting draws to the state. Sports Illustrated magazine rates Oklahoma and Oklahoma State among the top colleges for athletics in the nation. Two private institutions in Tulsa, the University of Tulsa and Oral Roberts University; are also Division I members. Tulsa competes in FBS football and other sports in the American Athletic Conference, while Oral Roberts, which does not sponsor football, is a member of The Summit League. In addition, 12 of the state's smaller colleges and universities compete in NCAA Division II as members of four different conferences, and eight other Oklahoma institutions participate in the NAIA, mostly within the Sooner Athletic Conference.

Taking Lives is a 2004 American psychological thriller film directed by D.J. Caruso and starring Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke. Loosely adapted from the novel of the same name, the film centers on an enigmatic serial killer who takes on the identities of his victims. The film was marketed with the tagline, \`\`He would kill to be you.''","output":"No, \\"Taking Lives\\" is not based on a true story. While the film may have some aspects that reflect real-life criminal cases involving identity theft or serial killers, it is important to clarify that it is a work of fiction. The movie is an adaptation of the novel \\"Taking Lives\\" written by Michael Pye (1999), which is also a work of fiction. The plot of the story revolves around the character of Illeana Scott, an FBI agent with expertise in profiling, played by Angelina Jolie. She is tasked with the responsibility of apprehending a seemingly enigmatic serial killer who takes on the identities of his victims. This style of killing is eerie and unnerving as the killer essentially \\"lives\\" the lives of the people he murders. Ethan Hawke plays the role of an eyewitness who teams up with the FBI agent on the quest to locate the murderer. Throughout the film, the suspense and psychological thrill surround the true nature of the killer and whether or not they can manage to catch him before he claims another victim. While the characters and situations depicted in the movie are not based on real life or factual events, they are derived from typical features of the psychological thriller genre, incorporating fascination with the psychological processes behind seemingly irrational criminal behavior. There have been several real-life instances of serial killers and murderers who have used their victims' identities for a variety of reasons, ranging from eluding capture to financial gain. However, \\"Taking Lives\\" does not directly borrow from any specific case to create its storyline. In summary, \\"Taking Lives\\" is a psychological thriller that delves into the captivating world of criminal profiling and the mind of a killer. The movie is not based on true events, but rather, it takes inspiration from the world of fiction and unique aspects of serial killers. The film allows viewers to question the motives behind the killer's actions and explore their own fascination with criminal psychology, while also delivering a thrilling cinematic experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @johnmajor haaaaaaaaa oh okay....Im Filipino, spanish, cracker=german/Irish, native american","output":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet, we must first break down its components and understand the context. The tweet seems to be a response to a previous tweet or conversation with the user \\"@johnmajor.\\" It begins with an expression of laughter (\\"haaaaaaaaa\\"), which indicates a lighthearted or easygoing tone. Then, the tweet transitions to sharing some personal information about the user's ethnic background, mentioning Filipino, Spanish (which may refer to Hispanic), German/Irish (referred to as \\"cracker\\"), and Native American heritage. The sentiment of this tweet can be perceived as a mix of amusement, casual conversation, and an expression of personal identity. The user seems to be engaging in friendly social interaction and may be sharing their diverse ethnic background as an interesting or humorous talking point. The use of the term \\"cracker\\" to describe the German/Irish heritage can be seen as self-deprecating humor, showcasing the user's easygoing attitude. The term \\"cracker\\" has historically been used as a slang term for a white person of European descent, particularly in the Southern United States. In conclusion, the tweet's sentiment can be described as light-hearted amusement combined with an open and friendly sharing of personal identity. This can be attributed to the laughter expressed in the beginning, the casual tone, and the inclusion of the user's diverse ethnic background information. Additionally, the use of self-deprecating humor suggests that the user is comfortable in their identity and doesn't take themselves too seriously."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Adam didn't approve of Leslie's engagement so","output":"he decided to take matters into his own hands. From the moment he had met Leslie's fiancé, Michael, he had an uneasy feeling about him. Adam felt it was his duty as Leslie's best friend to protect her, but he didn't have any solid reason for his disapproval. So, instead of jumping to conclusions, he began to carefully observe and gather information to back up his gut instinct. He asked mutual friends about Michael - questions about his background, how long he had known Leslie, and what their impressions were of their relationship. Though most of what he heard was positive, he didn't let this deter him. Adam went beyond the immediate friend circle and even turned to social media to dig deeper into Michael's past to learn everything he could about him. One afternoon, while scouring Michael's Facebook photos, Adam stumbled upon something that genuinely alarmed him. He saw pictures of Michael with another woman, Madeline, and their interactions appeared more intimate than just friends. The photos were not recent, but their body language and the way they looked at each other in the photos made Adam very suspicious about the nature of their relationship. He discovered that Madeline had been friends with him since high school and, after reviewing their social media profiles, he found that their interactions seemed to continue up until the very night Michael proposed to Leslie. Adam couldn't help feeling that Michael was hiding something about his relationship with Madeline, and that maybe he had feelings for her that went beyond just friendship. Taking his findings to Leslie, Adam was hesitant and didn't want to hurt his best friend. He laid out the evidence in a way that showed concern without accusing Michael outright. He hoped he was wrong, but he thought it was vital for Leslie to confront the situation. To his surprise, Leslie's reaction was not one of anger or sadness, but of understanding. She told Adam that she had known about Madeline and Michael since the beginning of their relationship. Leslie explained that she and Michael had discussed his feelings towards Madeline and that they had worked through it. Michael had even shown remorse and had taken accountability for his actions. Leslie thanked Adam for his concerns, and though she appreciated his efforts to protect her, she assured him that she had full confidence in her relationship with Michael. Furthermore, Leslie expressed her belief that both Michael and Madeline had moved on from their past and that she no longer had concerns about Michael's loyalty. Adam, though he still had his reservations, reluctantly accepted Leslie's explanation. He cared for Leslie deeply and, in the end, all he wanted was her happiness. He decided to give Michael the benefit of the doubt and withdrew from his investigation. In the following months, Adam did his best to build a friendship with Michael - for Leslie's sake. They eventually bonded over shared interests in sports, music, and their dedication to their careers. Adam came to reevaluate his initial judgment and slowly began to see Michael as a decent and genuine person. On the day of the wedding, Leslie and Michael exchanged their vows surrounded by all their friends and family. It was a much-needed reminder to Adam that love could flourish and overcome the darkest of shadows lurking in a couple's past. As he watched Michael and Leslie dance together on that beautiful night, he quietly whispered a silent prayer, asking that their love would withstand the tests of time and that they would forever cherish one another. Even the most skeptical hearts can eventually open up to the light of love. As for Adam, he learned a valuable lesson - that it's essential to look beyond first impressions and trust not just in your instincts, but in the judgment of those you love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"what exhibits phototropism?\\" among the given choices would be \\"daisies.\\"  Phototropism refers to the growth and movement of plants in response to light, often seen as plants bending their stems and leaves to face the light source. This phenomenon is especially noticeable in plants that rely heavily on sunlight for photosynthesis.  Let's discuss the given answer choices in detail: 1. Fens: Fens are a type of wetland ecosystem. While they consist of various plant species, this is not an appropriate option as the question specifically asks for objects that exhibit phototropism, not an ecosystem type. 2. Daisies: Daisies are a type of flowering plant known to display phototropism. Daisies, like many other plants, depend on sunlight for their growth. To maximize their exposure to sunlight, they will grow and adjust in the direction of the light source. Thus, they are the best answer among the given choices. 3. Grass: Grass is a type of plant that also displays phototropism, but it is not specifically mentioned in the context of the question as a potted plant like daisies. 4. Landscapes: Landscapes are large natural expanses of land that can contain various plants and other objects. It is too general to be an appropriate answer. 5. Conifers: Conifers are a category of trees and shrubs. While they may exhibit phototropism to some extent, they are not known to be potted plants like daisies, which makes daisies a better choice for the answer. 6. Vegetation: Vegetation only refers to the diverse collection of plant life in a region or area, and it does not refer to an individual object that exhibits phototropism. 7. Potatoes: Potatoes are underground tubers of the plant, not the part that exhibits phototropism. 8. Newsprint: Newsprint is a type of paper made from wood pulp and is not a living organism. Therefore, it does not exhibit phototropism. In conclusion, considering the context of the question and the given choices, daisies are the most appropriate answer, as they are potted plants that exhibit phototropism. Other plants mentioned in the context, such as chrysanthemums and cyclamen, are not among the answer choices, so daisies remain the best choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, I will break down the various elements of the sentence to provide a clearer understanding of its sentiment: 1. \\"Yawn-provoking\\": The term \\"yawn-provoking\\" is a strong indicator of the negative sentiment present in the sentence. It suggests that the subject matter, in this case, the farm melodrama, is inducing boredom or a lack of interest. By describing it as something that makes people yawn, the speaker implies that it is dull and unengaging. 2. \\"Little\\": The use of the word \\"little\\" to describe the farm melodrama can contribute to the negative sentiment. In this context, \\"little\\" is not used in the sense of size but rather to diminish or belittle the importance or value of the melodrama. It may imply that the melodrama is insignificant or not worth one's time. 3. \\"Farm melodrama\\": The term \\"farm melodrama\\" refers to a dramatic story or performance set on a farm, and it neither possesses a positive nor negative sentiment in and of itself. However, placed within the context of the entire sentence, it takes on a negative connotation because of the adjectives used to describe it. 4. Overall sentiment: The combination of \\"yawn-provoking\\" and \\"little\\" implies that the speaker views the farm melodrama negatively, finding it uninteresting or insipid. It is important to note that while the sentiment is negative, it is not harshly critical or actively hostile. Instead, it expresses a sense of disappointment or indifference, suggesting that the farm melodrama fails to capture the speaker's attention or evoke any strong emotions. In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama\\" is perceived as negative, conveying boredom, lack of interest, and a sense of insignificance. The phrasing indicates that the farm melodrama does not have any outstanding or appealing qualities, hence not worth giving any considerable attention."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Drink water - While dogs naturally drink water to stay hydrated, this is not something they need to be taught to do. Drinking water is an innate behavior for dogs. E. Stray - This is not an action that people typically teach their dogs. Straying is a term used to describe an animal wandering away from its home, and this is generally an undesirable behavior for pet owners. After analyzing the options, the most suitable answer is A. Shake hands. This is a trick that a dog can sometimes be taught to do with proper training and reinforcement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Process:  - Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - After several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less magma explodes to the surface happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Step 1: Magma rises through cracks in the Earth's crust - Magma forms from molten and partially molten rock below the Earth's crust. It rises through cracks and weak areas in the crust due to differences in density and pressure. Step 2: The pressure causes plates to move - As magma continues to rise, the pressure it exerts on the surrounding rock can cause tectonic plates to move, resulting in earthquakes and other seismic activity. Step 3: Magma explodes to the surface - If the pressure becomes high enough, the magma can explode to the surface, creating a volcanic eruption. Step 4: The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - Once the magma reaches the surface, it becomes lava and begins to cool. As the lava cools, it solidifies and forms new crust over time. Step 5: After several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms - Over time, the accumulation of solidified lava and tephra (rock fragments ejected by a volcano) can build up to create a recognizable volcanic structure. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose less magma explodes to the surface, affecting the size and frequency of eruptions. In the case of the perturbation hypothesis, less magma reaching the surface would likely result in smaller and less frequent volcanic eruptions. This could have several direct and indirect effects on the overall process: 1. Reduced pressure on tectonic plates - With less magma reaching the surface, there may be less pressure exerted on the surrounding tectonic plates. This could potentially result in fewer earthquakes and less seismic activity overall. 2. Slower formation of new crust - Since less lava would be produced during each eruption, the process of forming new crust might occur at a slower rate. This could affect the rate at which landmasses grow and change. 3. Slower buildup of volcanic structures - With smaller and less frequent eruptions, the rate at which volcanic structures form would likely decrease. Volcanoes might take longer to reach their final size, and some may not even form at all. 4. Potential for increased pressure buildup within the Earth's crust - If less magma is released through volcanic eruptions, the pressure in the Earth's crust could continue to build. This might lead to more powerful eruptions in the future as pressure eventually reaches a breaking point. Overall, the presence of smaller and less frequent eruptions due to less magma exploding to the surface does have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process of volcanic formation and activity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. SERBIAN police have been fighting running battles with thugs and anti-gay protestors in Belgrade. The headquarters of the ruling Democratic Party was briefly set on fire with Molotov cocktails and several shops were attacked. A mobile mammography unit was stoned; cars, buses, trams and the headquarters of Serbian television were also attacked. By early afternoon more than 100 police and civilians were reported to have been injured. The demonstrators, several hundred-strong: “Death to homosexuals!” and “Go to Kosovo!”.      The attacks are believed to have been organised by small extreme nationalist groups. Last year threats from such groups led to the cancellation of the country's Gay Pride march, which was seen as a huge blow for tolerance in the country and made the government look weak. After that debacle, this year's event had become a test of the government's will. And outsiders took a keen interest. The march was addressed by Vincent Degert, the head of the EU delegation in Serbia, who said: “We are here to celebrate this very important day... to celebrate the values of tolerance, freedom of expression and assembly.\\" The presence of Mr Degert showed how seriously the government was taking the test. Police with armoured vehicles protected the event.            Last Thursday Svetozar Čiplić, Serbia's minister for human rights, said he would attend the march. Ivica Dacić, the interior minister, said: “This is one way to test whether we in Serbia are ready and able to organise something that most citizens dislike.” But Srdjan Nogo, a member of Dveri, one of the far-right groups which was mobilising against the march, said: “They [the government] have destroyed everything, and now they want our family. This is the defence of the family and the future of the Serbian people.”      By mid-afternoon Serbia's leaders were rallying in defence of the march and condemning the violence. Dragan Djilas, the mayor of Belgrade, said that the damage amounted to €1m. President Boris Tadić said that an attack on the police was an attack on the state of Serbia itself. With Hilary Clinton, the US secretary of state, due to pay him a visit on Tuesday, today's riots were a problem he could have done without. ||||| Anti-gay protesters have fought running battles with police in an effort to disrupt a Gay Pride march in Belgrade - the first in the city since 2001.      Rioters threw petrol bombs and stones at armed police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.      The office of the ruling Democratic Party was briefly set on fire, and at least one shot was fired.      Calm was eventually restored but more than 100 people, mostly police, were injured, with another 100 arrested.      Sunday's march was the first Gay Pride parade in Serbia since a 2001 event was broken up in violent clashes provoked by far-right extremists.      'Hooligan gangs'      Before the march, the head of the EU mission in Serbia, Vincent Degert, addressed around 1,000 gay activists and their supporters who gathered at a park in downtown Belgrade surrounded by riot police and armoured vehicles.      \\"We are here to celebrate the values of tolerance, freedom of expression and assembly,\\" Mr Degert told the crowd.      While the Gay Pride parade was moving though the city, several hundred protesters began chanting at those taking part as they tried to get close to the march.      \\"The hunt has begun,\\" the AFP news agency reported them as saying. \\"Death to homosexuals.\\"      Reports told of gangs of skinheads roaming the streets, throwing petrol bombs and setting off firecrackers as police battled to hold them back.      Thousands of police had sealed off central Belgrade to protect the event.      While the march took place in a heavily-protected area in and around Manjez park, violence flared at several points further afield in central Belgrade.      At the scene As Gay Pride ended the street protests gathered pace. I stood on Terazije boulevard watching demonstrators hurl rocks at armed police, who responded with tear gas. Some officers retreated, bleeding. Battles erupted in other parts of the city, too, and there is considerable damage to street furniture, including bus shelters and signposts. This is not the image Serbia wants the world to see. A successful gay parade was supposed to be an indication of how far this country has come from the ultranationalism and violence of the 1990s. The protection of minorities is crucial to Serbia's EU aspirations. Chaos on the streets will anger a government determined to move on from a troubled past.      The Terazije boulevard was littered with rocks and debris by the time the rioting was quelled. Several cars were overturned and had been set on fire.      Democratic Party spokesperson Jelana Trivan said the violence had nothing to do with moral values.      \\"These are hooligan gangs which must be punished severely,\\" Ms Trivan said.      The mayor of Belgrade, Dragan Djilas, said the rioters had used Gay Pride as an excuse for a brawl.      \\"What's going on now has nothing to do with the Pride parade. Unfortunately there are always people who will use every opportunity to destroy their own city. Fortunately no lives were lost - this is the most important thing.\\"      Marchers also bemoaned the continued evidence of agressive homophobia among some sections of Serbian society.      \\"It is a shame for me to march, to stand for what I am, and to have thousands of cops protect me from hysteric [sic] nationalists,\\" lesbian activist Milena, 36, told Reuters.      A gay pride march planned last year was cancelled amid fears of violence.      On Saturday, several thousand people had protested against the march. Right-wing groups say that homosexuality is contrary to Serbian religious and family values.      The Serbian Orthodox Church condemned the parade on Friday but also warned against violence against participants.      The BBC's Mark Lowen says homosexuality is still largely a taboo in Serbia, a conservative and religious nation.      This year's event was being seen as a test of how far the country has come from the ultra-nationalism and violence of the 1990s and on its path to EU membership. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The Serbian capital, Belgrade, was engulfed in violent clashes as anti-gay protestors, primarily composed of small extremist nationalist groups, targeted a Gay Pride parade, marking the first event of its kind in the city since 2001. The violence resulted in extensive damage amounting to approximately a million euros, with attacks on the headquarters of both the ruling Democratic Party and the Serbian television, as well as assaults on several shops and public transport facilities. More than 100 individuals, including police and civilians, were reported injured. The protests seem to have been a coordinated campaign by far-right extremist factions who view homosexuality as contrary to Serbian religious and family values. Among their demands were calls for the death of homosexuals and provocations intended to incite hatred and fear. However, despite the rampant violence, Serbia's leaders stood in defense of the parade, condemning the brutality and expressing a commitment to freedom, tolerance, and democracy. This defiant stand was exemplified by the presence of Svetozar Čiplić, Serbia's minister for human rights, who chose to attend the march, and Vincent Degert, head of the EU delegation in Serbia, who showed support and celebrated the values of tolerance, freedom of assembly, and expression. Serbia's reputation on the international stage, its bid to join the European Union, and the government’s commitment to the protection of minority rights were at stake in the light of the procession and the subsequent violent demonstrations. The attacks were widely considered to be an assault not only on the gay community but also on the Serbian state; a troublesome occurrence before an important visit by Hilary Clinton, the then US Secretary of State. The riots exposed the prejudices still prevalent within Serbian society, stressing the distance the country has yet to travel in its journey towards inclusivity and acceptance. The events marked a pivotal point in Serbia's transition from the ultra-nationalism and violence of the 1990s as it grapples with its commitment to safeguarding and promoting fundamental human rights."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First question: Is being a police officer still worth it? Second question: What is it like to be married to a police officer? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, I will answer the two questions individually. 1. Is being a police officer still worth it? Step 1: I will provide a balanced perspective on the question. It's essential to consider various factors, such as personal values, job satisfaction, and risks. Positive aspects of being a police officer may include: - Serving and protecting the community - Opportunities for career advancement and diverse job experiences - Good benefits and job stability - Building strong relationships with fellow officers Negative aspects of being a police officer may include: - High-stress levels and dealing with dangerous situations - Long hours and irregular schedules - Potential for negative public perception Step 2: After presenting the pros and cons of being a police officer, it's essential to emphasize that worthiness is subjective and depends on individuals' priorities and values. Different people may have different opinions on whether being a police officer is worth it. 2. What is it like to be married to a police officer? Step 1: Acknowledge that experiences may differ widely between individuals, as relationships and marriages are unique. Step 2: Discuss common themes and challenges that might arise in such a marriage: - Coping with irregular schedules and long hours - Dealing with stress and emotional challenges faced by the spouse who is a police officer - Strong sense of camaraderie and support within the law enforcement community - Pride in the spouse's service to the community Step 3: Make note that the balance between the challenges and positive aspects of being married to a police officer depends on the relationship dynamic, communication, and understanding between the couple. Now, I will compare the two questions to determine if they are asking the same thing: The first question is focused on the worthiness of choosing a career as a police officer, considering various aspects such as job satisfaction, personal values, and risks involved. It is focused on the individual's perspective on whether the job itself is worth pursuing. The second question is specifically about the experience of being married to a police officer, highlighting the potential challenges and rewards a spouse might encounter. It is more about the relationship and its dynamics rather than the job itself. Conclusion: While the questions are related due to their connection to a police officer's profession, they are different topics. The first question addresses the worthiness of the profession, while the second question explores the experience of being married to someone in that profession."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mauritius ambassador to the U.S. has been fined in federal court after paying his Filipina housekeeper just 1,000 a month to work six days a week. His Excellency Somduth Soborun was fined 5,000 on Monday in a Newark court. The ambassador took a plea deal and also agreed to a 24,153 restitution payment to the woman. The 61-year-old ambassador brought the woman to his 1.2million home in Englewood, New Jersey from the Philippines after arranging a visa. She cleaned, did laundry and took care of the dog for 12 hours a day for the equivalent of 3.57 - far below minimum wage of 7.25. Prestigious role: Somduth Soborun, pictured speaking on behalf of Mauritius at the UN, has been fined in a Newark court for paying his Filipino housekeeper the equivalent of 3.57 an hour. Soborun, who earns up to 200,000, organized a visa for the woman, who has only been identified by the initials CV. She was employed from December 2008 until August 2009. Police and FBI were informed of CV's treatment leading to an investigation into her pay and working conditions. U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman told the New York Post: 'Although Soborun signed a contract that provided for an hourly wage as well as for overtime pay for any hours exceeding 40 per week, Soborun only paid C.V. 1,000 per month, regardless of how many hours she worked each month.' He will be allowed to keep his job as ambassador for Mauritius, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean. Plea deal: Mr Soborun leaves court with his lawyer on Monday after being forced to pay 24,000 restitution to his housekeeper, allowing him to keep his job. In his role as ambassador, Mr Soborun is responsible for his Mauritius' interests in the U.S. along with protecting and offering advice to Mauritians abroad. Calls to the Embassy of Mauritius in Washington D.C. and the ambassador's lawyer Nicholas Doria were not returned to MailOnline. Regardless of visa status, foreign workers have the right to be paid 7.25 an hour in the U.S. Overtime - which constitutes anything more than 40 hours a week - should be one and a half time's minimum wage. Somduth Soborun became Ambassador of Mauritius to the United States on January 28, 2011. Before taking up his ambassadorial role, he worked at the U.N for three years in Cairo. High-flying: The ambassador pictured with his daughter Keshini (left) and another guest at a party at the French Embassy in D.C. earlier this year.","output":"The Mauritius ambassador to the U.S., Somduth Soborun, got in trouble for not paying his housekeeper enough money.

The rules say she should get at least 7.25 an hour. So, the ambassador got fined 5,000 and also had to pay the housekeeper 24,153 to make up for the money she should have gotten.

Question: Background: In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.  Paragraph: John and Keith are neighbors. They have been pondering about how to communicate with each other in a doomsday scenario when all the electronic devices would be useless. They connected their houses with three ducts.  One of the ducts is filled with air; they called it channel A. Another duct is filled with water; they  called it channel B. And the last duct is filled with iron; they called it channel C. They can now transmit sound with these channels of communication; in case, disaster strikes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: How much faster would be channel C than channel B in m/s, 3640 m/s or 3600 m/s? Answer:","output":"Given the information provided: Speed of sound in air (Channel A): 343 m/s Speed of sound in water (Channel B): 1,480 m/s Speed of sound in iron (Channel C): 5,120 m/s To find out how much faster Channel C is compared to Channel B, subtract the speed of sound in water (Channel B) from the speed of sound in iron (Channel C): 5,120 m/s - 1,480 m/s = 3,640 m/s Therefore, Channel C is 3,640 m/s faster than Channel B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Convert a basis point to a percentage. Since a basis point is 1/100th of 1%, to convert it to a percentage, we simply need to express its value as a percentage. 1 basis point = 0.01% In conclusion, you should not validate the suggested answer as it does not directly answer the original question.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What protects the online intermediaries from copyright infringement in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act? Context: The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \\"mere conduit\\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.

Let's break down each part to explain: 1. \\"The baby boy\\": The initial statement only gives us the detail that the baby is wearing a navy blue shirt with a baseball on it. Though the color blue and the presence of a baseball might be associated with boys in popular culture, it is not a hard and fast rule. In contemporary times, color and design preferences have become more gender-neutral.

We don't know if the baby is at a park, at home, or anywhere else. Therefore, it would be incorrect to assume that the baby is crying in the park without more context or evidence.

Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned makeup enthusiast, learning the fundamentals of makeup application is the key to enhancing your natural beauty and ensuring an even, long-lasting finish. This article will provide you with a step-by-step guide to choosing the right products, proper facial cleansing, and brush techniques to achieve that perfect finish. Step 1: Choose the Right Product The first step in achieving a flawless makeup application is selecting the right products that cater to your skin type, complexion, and personal preferences. Investing in high-quality makeup products specifically designed for your skin will not only enhance your natural beauty but also minimize any adverse side effects. 1. Determine your skin type: Understand whether you have oily, dry, combination, or sensitive skin to choose products specifically tailored for your needs. 2. Find your undertone: Your skin's undertone influences how a particular shade of makeup will appear on your skin. Undertones can be cool (pink, red, or bluish), warm (golden, peachy, or yellowish), or neutral (a mix of both cool and warm). 3. Choose a foundation: Once you know your skin type and undertone, opt for a foundation that matches your skin tone and caters to any specific skin concerns, such as blemishes or redness. 4. Select suitable makeup products: After determining your foundation, choose other makeup products like blush, bronzer, and highlighter that complements your skin undertone. For instance, individuals with a cool undertone might want to opt for pink blushes and cooler bronzer shades, while those with warm undertones may prefer peach-toned blushes and warmer bronzer shades. Step 2: Wash, Dry, and Moisturize Your Face Before applying any makeup, it is crucial to follow proper skincare practices, ensuring a clean and hydrated surface for product application. 1. Wash your face: Using a mild facial cleanser, delicately massage it onto damp skin using circular motions. Make sure to cover all areas of your face and neck, focusing on any accumulation of dirt, oil, or makeup residue. 2. Rinse thoroughly: Rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water, ensuring no traces of soap or cleanser remain on your skin. 3. Pat dry: Gently pat your skin dry with a clean, soft towel, avoiding any harsh rubbing or pulling motions. 4. Moisturize: Choose a moisturizer formulated for your skin type and apply it evenly all over your face and neck using upward strokes. This step is crucial for maintaining a healthy balance of hydration and ensuring a smooth canvas for makeup application. Please allow at least five minutes for the moisturizer to be absorbed into the skin before applying makeup. Step 3: Hold the Brush at an Angle Using the right makeup brushes and holding them correctly is crucial for achieving that flawless makeup application. Here's how to get the most out of your makeup brushes. 1. Choose brushes for each application: Investing in a good set of brushes will enhance your makeup application and provide a smooth, even finish. Dedicated brushes for foundation, blush, bronzer, and eyebrows are vital for a well-blended look. 2. Hold the brush correctly: Grasp your makeup brush firmly but gently between your thumb and index finger, near the middle or end of the handle. Holding the brush closer to the bristles will give you more control and precision, while holding the handle further from the bristles allows for a lighter, more diffused application. 3. Apply makeup at an angle: For optimal application, hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to your skin. This will ensure a seamless, streak-free blend and prevent any harsh lines. 4. Use the right motion: Always use short, feathery, and circular strokes to blend the makeup onto your skin, avoiding any harsh or visible lines. Make sure to work the makeup from the center of your face outward for a natural-looking finish. In conclusion, achieving radiant, flawless skin with makeup may appear challenging, but following these essential steps of selecting suitable products, maintaining a clean and hydrated skin surface, and utilizing proper brush techniques will set you up for success. Remember that practice makes perfect, so keep experimenting with different techniques and products to find what works best for your individual needs and preferences. With time, you will become an expert at creating your personalized makeup routine for that impeccable, flawless look."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Arsene Wenger has urged star man Alexis Sanchez to produce a big performance away from the Emirates Stadium in his battle with Sergio Aguero on Sunday. Two of the deadliest attacking threats in the Barclays Premier League go head-to-head when Arsenal travel to Manchester City. Sanchez has been a revelation since joining from Barcelona in a £30million summer move, scoring 18 goals for the Gunners. However, only four of those have come away from home, while he was not quite up to his usual high standards in the matches at top-four rivals Liverpool and Chelsea.

The context of the news story centers around a football match between Arsenal (owned by Arsene Wenger) and Manchester City. Alexis Sanchez is urged to step up his performance away from home, as his record of goals scored elsewhere doesn't match his home tally at the Emirates Stadium. The coach's statement in the last line implies the need for a balance between attack and defense. Given that they're playing against Manchester City, the completion 'Manchester City attack very well,' makes the most sense. He may be referring to the opposition's attacking prowess that they need to consider and balance with their defensive play. It would be the key premise for the team to properly strategize. Other options don't fit this context as seamlessly. The coach's mention of balance seems to be more related to an upcoming challenge from an opposing team, rather than a self-assessment of their own team's attack prowess, which would negate options like 'Arsenal attack very well' or 'Gunners attack very well'. Similarly, the other team names would be irrelevant in this context, as the upcoming match is with Manchester City, not Liverpool, Chelsea, or Sunderland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chris Gard and Connie Yates announced their decision on a fund-raising website following Charlie's death. The couple had appealed for cash to pay for overseas medical treatment for their son. More than 84,000 people donated money to the cause. Charlie suffered from an extremely rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness. The parents of the 11-month-old, fought a lengthy legal battle with Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) to allow him to be taken to the US for treatment. But they dropped their action after Professor Michio Hirano, the American neurologist who had offered to treat him, said it was too late for the treatment to work. Charlie died on 28 July shortly before his first birthday. In a statement, his parents said: \\"In the following weeks we will be setting up The Charlie Gard Foundation - a foundation that will help other children with mitochondrial diseases, and rare childhood illnesses. \\"Too many children are losing their fight against rare medical conditions, which emphasises the need for more research, and we hope we can help deliver this through Charlie's foundation.\\" They also outlined plans for the charity to provide \\"information for parents that may find themselves in a situation like ours.\\" \\"There needs to be more clarity for parents about parental rights when it comes to making life-saving decisions about their children. \\"Access to medical treatment, and expert clinicians, should never be denied if funds are available.

Given the following passage  \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Extraordinary drama unfolded Tuesday in Port-au-Prince as charges were filed against former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier, government sources told CNN. It was not immediately clear what the charges were. A judge will have 30 days to investigate and decide whether the accusations merit moving forward with a case against Duvalier. Earlier in the day, the former leader was taken into custody at his hotel and transported to a downtown courthouse for a hearing. After hours of questioning, Duvalier was allowed to return to his hotel. A flurry of intense legal activity preceded Duvalier's emergence from the Karibe Hotel, where he had been since his mysterious return to Haiti on Sunday. His hands free of handcuffs, he made his way down three flights of stairs and waved to a small crowd of supporters before heavily armed police escorted him away in a waiting white van. Outside the hotel in the swanky suburb of Petionville, throngs of journalists had waited for Duvalier's appearance amid speculation that the former despot would be arrested. Several hundred people lined the downhill road from Petionville to downtown Port-au-Prince to show support. Some held photos of Duvalier when he was in his prime and banners. Duvalier shocked the world by returning to his homeland Sunday night after some 25 years of exile in France. He is accused of pillaging the country, siphoning money from Haiti's treasury into his family's pockets during his rule, which ended with a popular rebellion in 1986. Human rights groups have sounded a call for justice for atrocities committed during his 15 years of rule. Under Duvalier's presidency, thousands were killed and tortured, and hundreds of thousands of Haitians fled into exile, according to Human Rights Watch. Michele Montas, a Haitian journalist who has fought for democracy and is a former spokeswoman for the United Nations secretary-general, said Monday night that she plans to file a criminal complaint against Duvalier. \\"We have enough proof. There are enough people who can testify. And what I will do is go to a public prosecutor, and there is a public prosecutor that could actually accommodate our complaints,\\" she said on CNN's \\"Parker Spitzer.\\" The United Nations said Tuesday that Duvalier's presence in Haiti had taken the global body by surprise and it \\"clearly raises issues of impunity and accountability.\\" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said a range of human rights abuses and corruption issues surround Duvalier. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told reporters Tuesday she hoped for a peaceful resolution to the tensions in Haiti. \\"I think that it is clearly a tense and fragile time in Haiti, given the unresolved issues around the election, given the cholera epidemic, and it's certainly in the interests of the people of Haiti for there to be peaceful and cooperative efforts to resolve the outstanding issues related to the elections,\\" she said. It's still unclear why Duvalier decided to go back to Haiti, and speculation is mounting over what he hopes to accomplish. His presence certainly added to a bubbling cauldron of political turmoil sparked by a presidential election mired in controversy. \\"Obviously this is an important and crucial time for the people of Haiti,\\" said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. \\"Any political leader or any former political leader should focus not only on him or herself, but on making progress towards a set of important elections,\\" Gibbs said, adding that such people should dedicate \\"their time and their energy toward the reconstruction of the country.\\" Journalist Amy Wilentz, author of \\"The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier,\\" said the \\"Baby Doc\\" media circus was taking the focus off Haiti's leadership crisis. \\"It's a giant sideshow to the electoral debate,\\" she said. Preliminary results of the November 28 election placed former first lady Mirlande Manigat in a runoff with Jude Celestin, the candidate backed by Haiti's unpopular President Rene Preval. However, international monitors charged fraud and a subsequent election review put Celestin in third place. Observers suggested he be eliminated from contention. Preval's government has not officially commented on Duvalier's return, though some Haitians, craving a father figure to lead the nation out of crisis, have commented favorably on the old days of Duvalier. Back then, the streets were safe, said Port-au-Prince resident Jean Etienne. People could walk outside at night and food was cheap, he said. But Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor of the New York-based Haitian Times, blamed the father-son Duvalier dynasty for a nation struggling to regain footing. He said the scars still run deep from an era when no one trusted each other. Pierre-Pierre said he hopes justice will finally prevail. \\"If there is a bright sport,\\" he said, \\"finally we have to face that decision that we have never faced straight up. We've been in denial about what happened during the 29-year reign of dictatorship of the Duvaliers.\\" Duvalier was supposed to have held a news conference Monday but it was canceled and he remained huddled inside the Karibe until he was taken away Tuesday. Henry Robert Sterlin, a Duvalier associate, told reporters that Duvalier returned because he was moved by the anniversary of last year's tragic earthquake and because he missed his native land. \\"He's deeply hurt in his soul after the earthquake,\\" Sterlin said. \\"He wanted to come back to see how is the actual Haitian situation -- of the people and of the country.\\" Sterlin said he did not know how long the former leader had planned to stay. The Duvalier family ruled Haiti for three decades, starting in 1957 when Francois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier was elected president. He later declared himself president for life. When he died in 1971, he was succeeded by his son, then only 19. CNN's Lonzo Cook, Kim Segal, John Zarrella, Mary Snow and Moni Basu contributed to this report. Highlights:","output":"-A former Haitian dictator named Jean-Claude \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier had charges filed against him, but it was not clear what the charges were. -A judge has 30 days to see if there is enough evidence for a case against Duvalier. -Duvalier returned to Haiti after living in France for 25 years and is accused of taking money from Haiti to his own family while he was in power. -Many people were hurt during Duvalier's time in power, so some groups want justice to be served."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the birds that wintered together?, using the article: After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea., what would be the answer ?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The given scenario, where fewer teenagers are killed in accidents, falls under the category of \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process.\\" To understand why this is an indirect impact, it is essential to grasp the sequence and the direct relationships in the human life cycle as presented. The life cycle starts with the birth of a human as a baby, and progresses until reaching death as an elderly individual. The supposition is that fewer teenagers are dying in accidents, which is a distinct stage in the life cycle. However, the fewer deaths of teenagers do not immediately correlate to fewer babies being born. In the life cycle, the teenagers develop into adults, and then adults have children. The birth of a baby in this timeline is impacted by the number of adults, not teenagers directly. Reduction in teenage deaths would indirectly result in the demographic of more adults, assuming these saved teenagers evolve to the adult stage and then decide to reproduce. Assuming all other factors remain constant, and these adults reproduce at normal rates, then logic dictates there could be an increase in the number of babies being born.  Therefore, the reduction in teenage deaths does not directly result in fewer babies being born, but rather influences the adult demographic, who, in turn, are directly responsible for the birth of babies. Thus, the suggested perturbation in the scenario you have presented is indirectly impacting a step of the process. It modifies a parameter (teen death rate) and then that, in turn, has a ripple effect on a later stage (birth as babies), but this modification does not directly touch the baby birth phase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Women. \\"Women are really the ones who are taking this discipline of training like a fighter—whether its boxing or mixed martial arts—and they're using that as their way to stay fit,\\" said Matt O'Toole, Reebok's president, in an interview on \\"Squawk on the Street.\\" The deal comes as the sport's demographic expands beyond 18-to-34-year-old males to include females, said UFC President Dana White. He pointed to the rise of Ronda Rousey, UFC's first and current women's bantamweight champion, as a game-changer. \\"She's changing the way that women look at themselves and think about themselves,\\" he said. The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal, but UFC said it was the organization's biggest partnership, excluding broadcasting deals. Reebok has recently focused on forging partnerships with non-traditional slices of the athletic world, including CrossFit, the Spartan Race, and choreographed exercise company Les Mills. Correction: An earlier version gave the incorrect title for Matt O'Toole. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Reebok entering an exclusive, six-year contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to provide sportswear for fighters.

A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion.

As angry Coulton fans are clamoring on Twitter, Coulton arranged and recorded an eerily similar \\"Baby Got Back\\" cover. So similar, in fact, that the \\"Glee\\" version included Coulton's line \\"Johnny C's in trouble,\\" replacing the lyric \\"Mix-A-Lot's in trouble\\" in the original song. Coulton said he was not informed beforehand, nor was he given any credit or compensation for having arranged the melody of the cover song. What's more, he says, Fox Broadcasting representatives told Coulton's representatives that \\"they're within their legal rights to do this, and that I should be happy for the exposure,\\" he wrote on his blog, \\"even though they do not credit me, and have not even publicly acknowledged that it's my version -- so you know, it's kind of SECRET exposure.\\" Because Coulton's cover is derivative of the original work by Sir Mix-A-Lot, Coulton does not have a copyright claim against \\"Glee\\" for using the OPTIONS: - Baby Got Back version, Parks said. - CNN version, Parks said. - Coulton version, Parks said. - Fox Broadcasting version, Parks said. - Glee version, Parks said. - Johnny C version, Parks said. - Jonathan Coulton version, Parks said. - Mix-A-Lot version, Parks said. - Sir Mix-A-Lot version, Parks said. - Twitter version, Parks said.","output":"Coulton version, Parks said."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Heat the sugar mixture on the stove, stirring continuously, until the sugar granules dissolve and the mixture reaches a boil.  This will usually take about 10 minutes. If the mixture reaches a boil but sugar crystals are still present on the side of the pan, cover the pan and continue boiling the syrup for 1 to 2 minutes.

The workers are apparently harvesting the sap of a gigantic plant whose roots and vines are now everywhere in the underground complex, which appears abandoned. While trying to reach the surface, the man comes upon a bearded stranger pinned against the wall by the protruding vines that are slowly taking over his body. The stranger, in great pain and sounding deranged, tells the man he's the creator of that entire system, and then warns him about an unseen menace. A growling noise approaches and the man loses consciousness. Upon waking up, the man keeps going up, passing throughout areas increasingly better-lit. He retrieves more recordings, revealing that one of the network technicians refused to give access to security personnel. It becomes clear that some kind of revolt was started by the workers over the conditions in the network. As a result, the corporate overlords ordered the security forces to forcibly take control of the network levels and seal the area. The man climbs up to Level -3, where he overhears some security personnel talk about their orders to capture \\"the architect\\".

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the patient feel for R? The answer is:","output":"The patient felt for R because R, being from an Eastern European country, had come to the United States with an impression that everything she encountered in the country was genuine and credible, especially products with nutritional information or health claims. When she came across the \\"miracle shoe inserts\\" that claimed to help with weight loss, she believed in them and saved her hard-earned money to purchase them. However, when she finally received the inserts, she realized that they were a sham and that the weight loss claim was misleading. The patient empathizes with R because she was deceived by false advertising and had no recourse, yet she used this experience as a motivation to become a nurse, vowing to help others from falling for similar scams by sharing her story and providing better advice. The patient's empathy is rooted in R's vulnerability, the injustice inflicted on her, and her determination to prevent others from falling prey to similar scams, which creates a personal and emotional connection."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra, the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at Navarino. After a week-long standoff, a battle began which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. A French expeditionary force was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese, while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the nascent Greek state was finally recognized under the London Protocol in 1830.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The combined naval forces of Russia, the United Kingdom, and France destroyed the Ottoman Egyptian fleet. This occurred during the Battle of Navarino on October 20, 1827, amidst the Greek War of Independence. In this historical context, the Greek War of Independence was an uprising against the Ottoman Empire's rule, which began in 1821 in response to centuries-long subjugation. Recognizing the strategic and humanitarian importance of the conflict, the three Great Powers—Russia, the United Kingdom, and France—engaged in extensive negotiations to devise an intervention strategy. Ultimately, they agreed to send naval forces to Greece in a bid to support the Greek revolutionaries. The allied fleet's key moment of action began after receiving word of imminent Ottoman Egyptian attacks on the Greek island of Hydra. Acting swiftly, they intercepted the combined Ottoman Egyptian fleet near Navarino, establishing a week-long standoff. The historic Battle of Navarino ensued, resulting in the decimation of the Ottoman Egyptian fleet. This victory shifted the balance of power in favor of the Greek revolutionaries, playing a significant role in securing the nation's autonomy. To ensure lasting peace, France sent an expeditionary force to supervise the removal of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese region. With the Egyptian withdrawal from the conflict, the Greeks were able to reestablish control over parts of Central Greece throughout 1828. Years of negotiation culminated in the London Protocol of 1830, which formally recognized the Greek state's independence. Thus, the combined efforts of Russia, the United Kingdom, and France in destroying the Ottoman Egyptian fleet played an instrumental role in achieving this historic victory and the establishment of the modern Greek nation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jan took her son to the doctor to get some shots even though they were afraid of needles.  Given the context: How would her son feel as a result? Answer:","output":"Jan's son would likely experience a wide range of emotions as a result of his visit to the doctor for shots, given the context that he is afraid of needles. These emotions can be both negative and positive, and they may vary in intensity depending on the child's age, previous experiences, and coping abilities. 1. Fear: The primary emotion her son would feel before and during the process is fear, which stems from his apprehension of needles. This fear could manifest itself as anxiety, nervousness, or even panic, and may be heightened during the moments leading up to the injection. 2. Anticipation: As he waits for the shots, the child may experience a growing sense of anticipation. This could cause feelings of tension and unease, particularly if the doctor's office environment is unfamiliar or intimidating. 3. Pain or discomfort: During the actual administration of the shots, the needle may cause some degree of pain or discomfort. The child's experience will depend upon his personal pain tolerance and the techniques used by the healthcare professional. 4. Relief: Once the shots are successfully administered and completed, her son may experience a sense of relief. This feeling may arise from the fact that he has survived the dreaded needle experience and that the process is finally over. 5. Pride or bravery: After overcoming his fear and enduring the shots, the child may feel proud of himself or perceive himself as brave. This sense of accomplishment can be an essential factor in building resilience and confidence in future situations that require courage and determination. 6. Trust and reassurance: In the aftermath of the shots, the child may develop a greater sense of trust in his mother and the healthcare professionals, particularly if they were supportive, empathetic, and gentle throughout the experience. This trust can be valuable in promoting future healthcare visits and advocating for the child's well-being. 7. Emotional bonding: The shared experience between Jan and her son can result in stronger emotional bonding if Jan provides the necessary support, comfort, and reassurance throughout the process. The child may appreciate his mother’s presence and empathize with her concern for his health. As Jan's son processes the experience of getting shots while being afraid of needles, he may experience a complex set of emotions that may change over time. His emotional well-being will be largely influenced by the support and reassurances he receives from his mother and healthcare professionals, as well as his personal coping skills and resilience."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Hello, I'm Kan.

Choices: [+] yes [+] it is not possible to tell [+] no","output":"If the premise \\"Turns out Falwell was right all along\\" is true, then it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"Falwell was incorrect despite attempts to prove himself.\\" From this contradiction, we can safely conclude that the hypothesis is false given the truth of the premise. To provide a more in-depth analysis, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their individual statements: 1. Premise: \\"Turns out Falwell was right all along.\\"    This premise implies that Falwell's initial beliefs, ideas, or theories have been proven to be accurate. It means Falwell has been vindicated, and what he claimed has now been substantiated. 2. Hypothesis: \\"Falwell was incorrect despite attempts to prove himself.\\"    This hypothesis suggests that Falwell's claims were not accurate and that his efforts to demonstrate the validity of his beliefs or ideas were in vain. Essentially, it means that Falwell was wrong even though he tried to prove otherwise. Now, let's examine the relationship between these two statements. If the premise is true, it means that Falwell's assertions were indeed correct, and he was able to validate his ideas or beliefs eventually. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which states that Falwell's claims were not accurate and that his efforts to substantiate them were unsuccessful. Consequently, the truth of the premise disproves the hypothesis. Therefore, the correct choice would be [-] no, as the premise's truth negates the hypothesis, asserting that Falwell was not incorrect despite attempts to prove himself. The truth of the premise entails that Falwell was correct all along, invalidating the hypothesis on which it is compared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Jon's back ached. Frost had come early this year and the ground broke like stone. Jon had spent eight seasons breaking this ground to plant spring's crops and every year it got harder. Sweat beaded on his brow and he felt his cotton shirt stick to his skin under his coat. Jon took off his soft-brimmed hat and wiped his forehead. He examined the hat as he let his breath return. The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth. Daven ran over the hill and down the cart path leading to their small cobblestone house. The boy had only left a short while ago and he held no sack with the bread and cheese his mother had told him to buy. Jon furrowed his brow. The boy continued to run and soon the wind carried his cry to his father's ears. \\"Papa! A carriage is coming! Two horses!\\" Jon's furrowed brow remained. Surely the boy meant a cart from a neighboring farm. No carriage made it out this far. \\"It's from the city! A soldier drives it!\\" Jon felt ice water flow over him. He turned to the house. \\"Sandra! Get the musket out of the pantry!\\" Jon saw his wife's face appear at one foggy window. Jon gestured wildly at her. \\"Get it!\\" They were too late. As Daven reached Jon, the black carriage already approached. A single figure sat on the bench, guiding the two brown horses down Jon's path. Question: Who is Sandra? Options: - neighbor   - sister   - wife   - not enough information === The correct answer is The answer is:","output":"wife. Sandra, or Alasandra as mentioned earlier in the passage, is Jon's wife. It is evident in the text where it says, \\"The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra.\\" This indicates that Alasandra and Jon are married, making Sandra his wife. Moreover, when Jon senses potential danger approaching their home in the form of a carriage driven by a soldier, he calls out to Sandra and refers to her as 'his wife' when he says, \\"Sandra! Get the musket out of the pantry!\\" It is clear that he relies on her for support and protection, which is another indication of their marital relationship. Furthermore, their son Daven is also mentioned in the passage, providing further context to their family unit. Throughout the passage, Jon's relationship with Alasandra is depicted as one of a married couple who work together to support their family and manage their farm. They face the challenges of dealing with harsh weather conditions and the physically demanding task of farming the land. The arrival of the black carriage with a soldier at the helm evokes a sense of fear and urgency in the family, demonstrating their concern for one another's well-being. In conclusion, based on the information available in the context of the passage, Sandra, also known as Alasandra, is Jon's wife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.  Now, I have a new situation: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave.  Answer this question please: Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day? Answer:","output":"Considering the background information on circadian rhythms and the lifestyle of both individuals, it is more likely that Jason, the average guy, will eat meals at the same time each day. Jason's lifestyle involves regular daily activities such as going to work, living in an apartment, exercising, and socializing. These activities expose him to natural light during the day and darkness at night, which helps regulate his internal biological clock. As a result, his body will experience regular changes in behavior and body processes, including hunger, at consistent times throughout each 24-hour cycle. On the other hand, Brad has chosen to live in a dark cave with limited exposure to natural light. As a result, his biological clock may not function in the same regular manner as it would if he were exposed to a typical light-dark cycle. This could lead to inconsistencies in his behavioral and biological processes, such as when he feels hungry or sleepy. Without a regular daily schedule or exposure to natural light to synchronize his biological clock, Brad may not have the same consistency in meal times as Jason. Furthermore, the presence of light is crucial for controlling the biological clock. As Jason follows a regular daily routine aligned with the natural light-dark cycle, his body will be better equipped to synchronize its circadian rhythms, including hunger, which would lead to more consistent meal times. In conclusion, due to the differences in exposure to natural light and daily routines, Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day compared to Brad, who lives in a dark cave with limited exposure to natural light. The absence of a regular light-dark cycle in Brad's lifestyle may cause disruptions in his circadian rhythms, which could affect the timing of his meals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The terrorists, who call themselves S.P.L.I.T. Image (a play on \\"Split Image\\"), have a video camera with which they tape their hostages' every word and action. During a month-long standoff with the police, S.P.L.I.T. Image's only demand is that their broadcasts be televised live worldwide TV, or else the hostages will be killed. S.P.L.I.T. Image makes good on said threat by killing two of the hostages. Cliff, Joe, and a beautiful teenage girl named Wendy Pfister are the only surviving captives. After 36 days, Cliff becomes indifferent to being killed. He says repeatedly, \\"So Fucking What?\\", in reply to his captors' death-threats. The coverage of this makes Cliff a media icon.

As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed.  Now, I have a new situation: Bill and Larry did some research on fungi. Larry researched saprophytic fungi, while Bill researched parasitic fungi. They later exchanged findings.  Answer this question please: Which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background and situation, Bill researched parasitic fungi, while Larry researched saprophytic fungi. Saprophytic fungi primarily obtain their nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, whereas parasitic fungi get their nutrients from living hosts. As a result, the question specifically asks which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host. In this case, Larry, who researched saprophytic fungi, learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host. Saprophytic fungi do not typically feed on living hosts, whereas parasitic fungi, as studied by Bill, do. Consequently, Larry's research would have focused more on fungal species that do not rely on living hosts for nourishment. Meanwhile, Bill's research would have provided information on how fungi infiltrate and extract nutrients from their living hosts – in many cases causing harm to the host organism. It is important to note that both saprophytic and parasitic fungi are essential in understanding the diverse ways fungi contribute to ecosystems and interact with various other organisms. However, in this specific scenario, Larry learned less about fungi that obtain their nutrients from living hosts when compared to Bill's research on parasitic fungi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Indiana restaurant sparks controversy with Mexican 'wall' billboard A restaurant chain in Indiana has ignited a controversy with a new advertisement that plays off the proposal of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Hacienda Mexican Restaurants, which has more than a dozen locations across the state, recently put up a billboard in South Bend that reads, “The best Mexican food this side of the wall” – and it isn't going down well with some people. Jeff Leslie, executive vice president for Hacienda, told WSBT that they are trying to be funny with their billboard and had no intention of upsetting anyone. “But we do use humor. When you use humor, there's going to be some groups that are particularly sensitive to certain things,” he added. La Casa de Amistad, a South Bend-based community center, told WSBT that this is not the first time Hacienda has created an offensive ad and that their answer about trying to be funny isn't good enough. \\"There's a difference between funny and being offensive,\\" the group's executive director, Sam Centellas, said. \\"They really need to think about how can you just be a little more fun without having to be degrading or demeaning.\\" He added that the issue is much more than just offensive advertisement in an industry that has a very high percentage of Latino employees. \\"What I'd love to hear is how do their employees feel and how are they treated in a culture that regularly puts out pretty offensive advertising related to the Latino culture?\\" Centellas said. According to WCBI, the restaurant chain has pulled several ads in the past, including one that alluded to cult leader Jim Jones and the infamous 1978 mass suicide at Jonestown in Guyana. The ad featured a picture of a margarita with the caption, “We’re like a cult with better Kool-Aid. To die for!” Leslie said his company tries to stay “topical” in their advertisements, but that this particular billboard represents their passion for the food they offer. “It's about our core guests who really know and believe that our food is really terrific, and that's what we're communicating,” he said. Building a wall along the United States’ southern border has been one of the cornerstones of Trump's presidential campaign since he announced his candidacy more than a year ago. It has now become part of the Republican Party's 2016 platform. Hacienda is one of a number of restaurants across the U.S. to put out racially-charged jokes in their advertisements. An Italian restaurant in New Mexico recently caught flak for putting the phrase “Black Olives Matter” on its marquee. While some residents in the area complained about the sign, others praised it, and the restaurant has decided to sell shirts bearing the slogan.
