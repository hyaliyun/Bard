Context: LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"?

But the order was dropped over questions of officials' authority to call for such an action—and the military's ability to even carry out said order, reports Reuters. The report says that during a meeting with select officials, Netanyahu told then-head of the Israeli Defense Forces Gabi Ashkenazi to \\"set the systems for P-plus,\\" a move to prepare for action, the New York Times reports. But Ashkenazi and then-intelligence boss Meir Duggan have called Netanyahu's order an attempt to \\"steal a decision to go to war,\\" reports the AP: They say the prime minister doesn't have the authority to make the command without the full Cabinet's backing. \\"This is not something you do unless you are certain you want to execute at the end. This accordion will make music if you keep playing it,\\" Ashkenazi says. In the TV report, which airs tonight, Barak disagrees, saying that putting systems on alert doesn't mean \\"the state of Israel is compelled to act.\\" And \\"eventually, at the moment of truth, the answer that was given was that, in fact, the ability did not exist,\\" Barak says. The incident in question appears to have occurred around a time when the US and Israel were deeply involved in a mission to delay Iran's nuclear progress and offer a nonmilitary resolution to Israeli-Iranian tensions, the Times notes. Expand this summary.","output":"In 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak reportedly requested that the military prepare itself to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. According to an Israeli TV report, Netanyahu instructed then-head of the Israeli Defense Forces, Gabi Ashkenazi, to \\"set the systems for P-plus,\\" which is a move toward taking action. However, the order was ultimately dropped due to questions surrounding the authority of officials to call for such a measure and the military's ability to carry out that order. Ashkenazi and then-intelligence chief Meir Duggan have accused Netanyahu of attempting to \\"steal a decision to go to war,\\" stating that the prime minister does not have the power to make this command without the approval of the entire Cabinet. Ashkenazi argued that taking such a step should only occur if there is certainty of execution at the end. In contrast, Barak maintained that putting systems on alert does not compel the state of Israel to act. Barak also acknowledged that, at the essential moment, it was determined that the capacity to act did not exist. This incident seems to have taken place during a period when the United States and Israel were deeply engaged in a mission to delay Iran's nuclear advancements and seek a nonmilitary resolution to the tensions between Israel and Iran. The New York Times notes that this highlights the complexities of the Israeli decision-making process and the ongoing debate about the appropriate approach to combat Iran's nuclear program. The situation also demonstrates the challenges faced by Israel's leadership at the time, as they attempted to navigate the delicate balance between Israel's national security interests and the potential consequences of engaging in military action against Iran. The dropping of the order to attack Iran's nuclear facilities may have been influenced by various factors, including pressure from the United States, concerns over the ability to execute a successful operation, and the realization that unilateral action by Israel could escalate into a broader conflict in the region. In addition, the episode serves as a reminder of the ongoing tensions and potential risks associated with Iran's nuclear program, amid efforts by the international community to curtail the country's nuclear ambitions. The canceled order in 2010 may have contributed to the eventual negotiation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), which sought to restrict Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Overall, this incident underscores the complex interplay of strategy, politics, and diplomacy in addressing the persistent challenges posed by Iran's nuclear program and the broader regional security environment. The decision-making process and the factors that influenced the ultimate outcome provide valuable insights into the potential risks and opportunities associated with similar situations in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It might make up more than 80 per cent of the known universe, but as of yet scientists have still not managed to directly observe one of the universe’s greatest mysteries - dark matter. In recent months there have been detections from the sun and in orbit around Earth, but now scientists think they have found it in neighbouring galaxies. They spotted photon emissions coming from space - and one of the best possible explanations is that they came from particles of dark matter. Scroll down for video explanation. Research led by Leiden University in the Netherlands has found particles in other galaxies that could be dark matter (illustrated). They analysed X-ray signals emitted by the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. The signal could not be attributed to any regular form of matter. Two groups have recently announced that they have detected a signal that could be a sign of dark matter, with the research to be published next week in Physical Review Letters. One of them, which included Netherlands-based Leiden University scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky, found it by analysing X-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up: the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces.There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light, but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the universe. After having collected thousands of signals from the Esa's XMM-Newton telescope and eliminated all those coming from known particles and atoms, they detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention. The signal appears in the X-ray spectrum as a weak, abnormal photon emission that could not be attributed to any known form of matter. Above all, ‘the signal's distribution within the galaxy corresponds exactly to what we were expecting with dark matter, that is, concentrated and intense in the centre of objects and weaker and diffuse on the edges,’ explained Dr Ruchayskiy. ‘With the goal of verifying our findings, we then looked at data from our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and made the same observations,’ added Dr Boyarsky. The discovery was made using Esa's XMM-Newton telescope (illustration shown). The researchers detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention - as it could be the best sign of dark matter yet. The signal comes from a very rare event in the universe: a photon emitted due to the destruction of a hypothetical particle, possibly a ‘sterile neutrino’. If the discovery is confirmed, it will open up new avenues of research in particle physics. ‘It could usher in a new era in astronomy,’ said Dr Ruchayskiy. And Dr Boyarsky said: ‘Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles. ‘We will know where to look in order to trace dark structures in space and will be able to reconstruct how the universe has formed.’ The research, to be published in Physical Review Letters, included EPFL scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky. They found the signal by analysing X-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy (shown) Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Scientists from Leiden University in the Netherlands may have found dark matter in neighboring galaxies by detecting photon emissions coming from space.

Please answer the following question: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine.  Rob is an auto mechanic. He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather.  Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","output":"In this situation, the truck would fare worse in hot weather and with a hot engine because Rob did not put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. Since antifreeze not only acts as a freezing point depressant but also raises the boiling point of the water in the car radiator, it plays a crucial role in preventing the engine from overheating in high-temperature conditions. Without antifreeze, the water in the truck radiator would only have a boiling point of 100 °C (boiling point of pure water). Considering the hot weather and a hot engine, the water in the truck radiator is more likely to reach and surpass this boiling point. Once the water turns into steam, it no longer effectively cools the engine, leading to overheating and potential significant engine damage. On the other hand, the car radiator has a 50 percent antifreeze solution, which increases the boiling point of the water to 129 °C. This allows the water in the car radiator to better withstand and cool the engine during hot weather conditions without boiling and turning into steam. As a result, the car with the antifreeze would likely perform better and have a lower risk of engine damage in hot weather compared to the truck without antifreeze. Therefore, the truck would fare worse in hot weather and with a hot engine due to the lack of antifreeze in its radiator, increasing the chances of engine overheating and consequential damages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brazilian authorities estimate around 35,000 are marching in the capital. Troops are being deployed to defend government buildings and there is a heavy police presence on the streets. Protesters are demanding the resignation of President Michel Temer, fresh elections, and for economic reform plans to be withdrawn. Mr Temer has faced new corruption allegations in the last week, and is facing growing pressure to step down. According to reports, several ministries are being evacuated because of the protests - but not before the agriculture ministry was damaged. \\"There was an invasion of the ministry's private entrance. They lit a fire in a room, broke photos in a gallery of ex-ministers and confronted police,\\" a spokesman told the AFP news agency. There have been clashes between police and demonstrators and local media report one person has been injured and several have been detained. Planned demonstrations began peacefully around midday before clashes with police erupted. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at some demonstrators, and video footage showed other members of the crowd smashing windows or setting makeshift barriers afire. Last week, testimony released by the country's supreme court alleged that Mr Temer had taken millions of dollars in bribes since 2010. The plea-bargain testimony came from bosses of a giant meat-packing firm. In response, Mr Temer vowed to prove his innocence and remain as president while so doing. On Saturday, he filed a petition to have the investigation suspended, but reversed that decision on Tuesday. Mr Temer took office a year ago after his predecessor, President Dilma Rousseff, was impeached.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Please answer the following question: Some years ago a woman on our staff came into my office to, basically, tell me off and complain to me about others and about myself. This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Q: x = 8, equation weights = [3, 6, 8, 2, 5] A:","output":"To compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituting a given value of x in the given polynomial equation with weights = [3, 6, 8, 2, 5], we first need to understand that the weights are associate with x in decreasing power. Therefore, the polynomial equation is: 3x^4 + 6x^3 + 8x^2 + 2x + 5 We then substitute x = 8 into the equation: = 3*(8)^4 + 6*(8)^3 + 8*(8)^2 + 2*8 + 5 = 3*4096 + 6*512 + 8*64 + 16 + 5 = 12288 + 3072 + 512 + 16 + 5 = 15893 Therefore, the result of the polynomial equation 3x^4 + 6x^3 + 8x^2 + 2x + 5 when x = 8 is 15893."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Like others, I have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the Clutter Killings, including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the participants to the crime -- including Capote himself. As to Capote, I cannot forgive him for willfully withholding Perry Smith's confessions, intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels. I believe truths and facts Capote \\"reserved\\" for his \\"book,\\" which required for Capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment, would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for Perry Smith even under the old McNaughton Rule. Capote himself could never write another major literary work after \\"In Cold Blood.\\" Shame and guilt. In my opinion, he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book/drama. To him, both men HAD to die for his book to succeed. The book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment. His actions and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion. Capote's book is not truth. It is not factual or journalistic. It is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination. What most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of Capote's mind, which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all. No wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer Blake's performance. That actor IS the nightmare from Capote's dishonest imaginings. So who is to say how the two killers should be played? Who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to \\"do it now\\" killing? I agree with the few who see in Eric Roberts' work a magnificent performance, Shakespearean in its range, yet played with heartbreaking sincerity. Anthony Edwards takes a much safer \\"attitude mode\\" to create a smarmy Hickok; but he is one-dimensional and boring, with only a few notes in his television range. Roberts is almost four-dimensional, adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body, a Frankenstein Creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what NOT to do. Like Leopold apropos Loeb, Robert's Perry Smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man. Without Hickok or a man of his particularities, Perry Smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors. He fears himself more than he fears anything else in life. Given the freedom from Capote's death grip on the consciousness of the Clutter killings, Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama. Same facts, some of the same lines from the case record, but deeper, more complex, with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed Roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is. What many of our reviewers dislike about this film, Roberts in particular, is that cold-blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand. That is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic \\"interpretation of life and death\\" than Capote could ever create -- a real Tragedy. The actual cold-blooded killer, Mr. Capote, and his hypocritically artistic \\"non-fiction novel\\" do not control these interpretations and performances. If \\"In Cold Blood\\" and Capote's effect on life, literature and truth matters as much as scholars say, then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth, or a version of the truth, that is not the rank, cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of Capote's own abyss. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thinks positively of the movie, as it praises the performances of the actors (particularly Eric Roberts) and appreciates the freedom from Capote's influence on the story. The reviewer highlights the depth, complexity, and realism showcased in this film and views it as a more accurate portrayal of the events than Capote's book.

Popular varieties of watercress include English Watercress and Broad Leaf Cress. You can also start growing from mature watercress purchased at a supermarket or farmer’s market. Cut the ends, then soak the base of the stalks in water for a few days to encourage root growth and proceed to plant them in soil as you would from seed. Choose a large container or planter with drainage holes that is at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep. Add a layer of landscaper’s cloth at the bottom of the container to keep the potting mix from escaping when you water. Add pieces of broken pots or small pebbles to the bottom layer of the container to allow for good drainage.  You can also use multiple small containers and place them in a larger drainage tray. Plastic containers are recommended over terra cotta ones, which can dry out too quickly for watercress. You need to water the plant often. It's soil should be wet at all times. You can put excess water in the tray or bucket to keep the plant wet. You can also place small pebbles in the drainage tray to allow water to flow freely into the growing container. Use a soilless mixture that drains well and contains peat moss and perlite or vermiculite. Leave approximately two inches (5 cm) of space to the top rim of the container and water the mix well. The ideal pH of the potting mix should be 6.5 and 7.5. Place the seeds 1/4 inch (.64 cm) deep in the potting mix, allowing three to four inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) between each seed. Soak the potting mix deeply enough so that water fills the drainage tray below roughly halfway full, but doesn’t rise higher than the growing container. Replace the water in the drainage tray with fresh water every two to three days.  Make sure the tray never dies out. Check it daily to see if you need to add more water. To keep the soil thoroughly cover the surface with a thin, clear plastic sheet that has small holes poked in it, which will retain water and allow airflow. The sheet can be removed when the sprouts begin to appear above the soil. Mist the soil surface well with water in a spray bottle every other day. Position the watercress where it will receive roughly six hours of natural light each day, but try to avoid harsh, direct rays that can burn the young plants. You can keep the containers indoors or when the weather is regularly between 55˚F and 75˚F (13˚ and 24˚C) where you live, you can place the container outside during warmer months. Add a small amount of water-soluble, all-purpose gardening fertilizer to the water in the drainage tray at the package-recommended rate. Once the plants have grown roughly five to six inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) in height use kitchen or gardening scissors to trim the top four inches (10.1 cm) of the plant as needed.  Avoid taking more than a third of any plant when cutting to allow the plants enough foliage to continue growing. Periodic harvesting helps encourage new growth. Rinse the watercress in cool water, dry it and use immediately or wrap it in bundles and store in the refrigerator for use with a few days. Summary:","output":"To grow watercress, plant seeds in a large, well-draining container with damp soil, provide lots of light, and keep the soil wet at all times, while sometimes trimming the plants and adding fertilizer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Merchant account banks like to see that you understand your business, the risks you face, and can prevent or reduce fraud (especially credit card fraud). A merchant service aggregator is a third-party service which provides the processing capabilities of a larger merchant account bank on a smaller scale.  PayPal and Square are two of the largest merchant service aggregators.  PayPal processes payments to and from bank accounts and credit cards for both individuals and businesses.  The service makes it easy to process payments online.  PayPal makes money by subtracting a percentage of each sale you make. Square, similarly, processes credit and debit card payments for shop owners digitally and in stores.  Unlike PayPal, they provide a credit-card reading device which can transmit data from a point-of-sale credit card for processing.  The device easily snaps into many smartphones or tablets.

Look at similar items of clothing from competitors and mark your clothing with prices within the same range.  Mark everything clearly online as well as in direct sales through physical stores.  Do not make up prices on the spot, or you will appear unprofessional and unprepared. .  There are a variety of online outlets through which you can easily sell the clothes you made.  Ebay and Etsy are probably the most famous sites for purchasing clothing online through small producers.  Ebay is an online auction house.  You can offer your clothes at a minimum price, and allow people to compete with each other to obtain them.  Whoever submits the highest bid for a given item at the end of a designated time period will get the clothes. Etsy is not an auction house, but rather functions as a distribution hub of custom-made goods of all kinds -- candles, magnets, art, scrapbooks, as well as clothing.  Through Etsy you can distribute your clothes and reach new consumers easily. Other similar sites include madeitmyself.com, depop.com, and storeenvy.com.  All allow you to sell (and buy) independent clothing and apparel. When you’re starting out, farmer’s markets and local festivals are a good way to go.  If you want to get an official stall at the farmer’s market, you may need to inquire with the organization which hosts the market and pay a small fee.   Other local places that might be willing to carry some of your stuff include local coffee shops and cafes, which often offer local products for sale.  If even farmers markets entail too much formality for you, you can easily set up on a busy public street in many municipalities.  Take your clothes and lay them out on a blanket or small foldable card table so passers-by can browse.  Bring a chair, a good book, and a lockbox (to collect money and make change) and wait for business to roll in.  You can even send out an email or social media blast in the form of “I’ll be selling skirts, shirts, and summer wear this Saturday at the corner of Third and Main.  Be there!” Find a good time to sell your clothes.  Weekends and evenings are usually your best bet. Carry promotional materials -- business cards, flyers, or catalogs -- everywhere you go. You never know who you’ll run into or when an opportunity to promote your clothing business will come up.  Many local businesses, libraries, restaurants, and the like have community bulletin boards in their entryways.  Ask to post a one-page flyer on these boards to increase local buzz about your clothes.  If you have a quality color printer and a decent graphic design suite like Photoshop, designing your own flyers and promotional materials should be easy.  If not, enlist help from a friend proficient in graphic design and run a bunch of copies off at your local print shop. Cultivate a social media presence.  Use sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest to show off your designs and newly-made outfits. Get a proper website.  There are lots of template sites like Tumblr and Squarespace which allow you to set up a professional website without knowing a thing about code.  Alternately, you could enlist help from someone who is more familiar with web design to build you a website from scratch. As you become more proficient at what you do, take on apprentices and new employees so you can ramp up production.  Enlist help from creative individuals with an eye for fashion to design new outfits and styles.  Finally, as your business grows, you might want to consider opening a boutique of your own. Do not make the decision to transition to a proper storefront lightly.  The associated costs -- rent, taxes, and utilities -- may make the effort more expensive than its worth.  If you’re set on opening your own shop, take your time looking at potential spaces.  Find one located in a high-traffic area that your target market can easily access.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on... According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about Sally Yates? Answer:","output":"Sally Yates is likely the Deputy Attorney General during President Barack Obama's administration. In the context provided, Yates is involved in and supportive of Obama's clemency initiative to reduce the sentences of non-violent drug offenders and give them a second chance. She also mentions that they expect many more men and women to be given this second chance and that they are not done with the initiative yet, which indicates she is actively participating in the administration's efforts on this matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.[1][2] A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.[3][4][5]  In ancient Greece King Juno asked two of his court philosophers, philosopher A and philosopher B, to come up with two interesting problems. Philosopher A devised a clever paradox and presented it before the court. He called the  paradox Problem A. But philosopher B didn't come up with a paradox. He too presented a clever problem which was not a paradox - he called it problem B.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.

A 24-year-old woman in a hospital bed fighting off flesh-eating bacteria has to be told repeatedly -- each time she wakes up -- what has happened, her parents told CNN on Monday. The medication Aimee Copeland is given leads her to forget each time she falls asleep. \\"It's scary to her,\\" said her mother, Donna Copeland. She asks where she is and \\"doesn't understand.\\" Yet Aimee Copeland -- who has lost a leg and part of her abdomen to the virulent bacteria and may lose more, including her fingers -- is keeping her spirits strong, her father said. Can I get this flesh-eating bacteria? \\"We really don't see the suffering side of it. We see the miraculous survival,\\" Andy Copeland said. \\"I think that's the story that's inspired us, that's the story that's inspired, I think, the nation at this point.\\" On Facebook, he wrote that doctors have used words like \\"astonishing,\\" \\"confounding\\" and \\"mind-boggling\\" to describe the young woman's recovery. The master's student in psychology at the University of West Georgia was out with friends on May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a homemade zip line. It snapped. The accident left her with a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, when the pain continued, a friend took her to an emergency room, where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and flown to Augusta for surgery. She had contracted the flesh-devouring Aeromonas hydrophila. The bacterium is \\"remarkably common in the water and in the environment,\\" according to Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. \\"When it gets into those deeper tissues, it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition,\\" he said. \\"When it does that, those tissues die, and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control.\\" In most cases, people contract the bacteria by swallowing them, resulting in diarrhea. Aimee Copeland's case was much more rare. Her wound became infected, \\"and the infection (ran) wild,\\" Creech said. A blog set up by the University of West Georgia psychology department said Aimee Copeland will suffer the loss of her fingers. \\"However, physicians have hope of bringing life back to the palms of her hands, which could allow her the muscle control to use helpful prosthetics. They are awaiting a safe time before embarking on surgery for this.\\" Speaking to CNN on Monday, her father said doctors were assessing \\"day by day, or even hour by hour.\\" Copeland has told his daughter that one day, the family will celebrate Aimee Day -- when she will be able to breathe on her own. \\"We're going to celebrate that day forever for the rest of your life,\\" he told her. \\"It's the day that my daughter was delivered from this horrible, horrible disease.\\" If there's anything to be learned, Andy Copeland said, it's not to use homemade zip lines. Aimee Copeland's parents say that when she wakes up, she expresses concern about finishing her thesis. In her studies, she has focused on eco-psychology -- the idea that harmonizing with nature can be a powerful tool in ensuring one's psychological health and vitality. CNN's Josh Levs, Greg Botelho and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this report. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Being open to conversation and other party guests will help you stay engaged and make the party seem a lot more bearable. Can we draw the following conclusion? Talk with other guests at the party to prevent boredom  Possible answers:  -- Yes  -- It's impossible to say  -- No","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that talking with other party guests can help prevent boredom. Engaging in conversations, finding common interests, or sharing stories can make the party more enjoyable and help pass the time. Here are some additional tips to survive a boring party: 1. Arrive with a positive attitude: Your mindset can greatly impact your enjoyment of the party. If you expect it to be boring, you might unintentionally make it so. Instead, try to be optimistic and look for opportunities to have fun. 2. Find like-minded people: Look for other guests who may also be feeling bored or out of place and strike up a conversation. You may discover common interests, making the party more enjoyable for both of you. 3. Take part in activities: If the party has games, entertainment, or other activities, make a point to participate. Getting involved could help take your mind off the boredom and give you something enjoyable to do. 4. Be a good listener: Even if the conversations aren't entirely to your taste, try to be a good listener. Stay engaged in the conversation, ask questions, and show genuine interest in what others have to say. This way, you will make a positive impression on others and might even learn something new. 5. Use humor: Light-hearted jokes or funny stories can be a great way to liven up a boring party. Just make sure your humor is appropriate for the atmosphere and won't offend any guests. 6. Connect with the host: Make an effort to have a conversation with the host, as they can often introduce you to other guests or suggest activities for you to enjoy. 7. Offer help: If you see an opportunity to lend a hand, take it. Helping out during the party not only occupies your time and mind but also gives you a sense of purpose and involvement. 8. Set a time limit: If you know that you can only handle a certain amount of time at the party, set a realistic limit for yourself. Having a departure time in mind can make you feel less trapped and more in control. 9. Take breaks: If you're feeling overwhelmed by the boredom, step outside or find a quiet spot to regroup and gather your thoughts. A quick break can help you reset your mindset and return to the party with renewed energy. 10. Remember that it's okay to leave: If you've exhausted all your options for making the party more enjoyable and still can't shake your boredom, remember that it's okay to politely excuse yourself and leave when the appropriate time arises. You can thank the host for the invitation and try to make the best of the situation while you're there, but ultimately, you need to prioritize your own mental well-being. By keeping these tips in mind along with engaging in conversations with other guests, you can actively combat boredom and potentially turn a dull party into a more enjoyable social experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Inspiring speakers charge thousands of dollars to give his kind of training to business managers and staff. It cost me only a12 taxi ride.  I had flown into Dallas just for the purpose of calling on a client. Time was important and my plan included a quick turn-around trip from and back to the airport. A clean taxi pulled up.  The driver rushed to open the passenger door for me and made sure I was comfortably seated before he closed the door. As he got in the driver's seat, he mentioned that the neatly folded Wall Street Journal next to me was for my use. He then showed me several tapes and asked me what type of music I would enjoy. Well!

I decided to find my right position in life, somewhere I could feel proud of being the best I could be. I knew I would never be a rocket scientist, but I love driving cars, being of service and feeling like I have done a full day's work and done it well. I evaluated my personal property and, I became a taxi driver! One thing I know for sure is that to be good in my business I can simply just meet the expectations of my passengers.

Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of this world, entire society of microscopic creatures was living on this tiny speck. They carried on with their daily lives, oblivious to the enormous creatures that surrounded them in the forest. Horton, a kind and curious elephant, noticed the dust speck as it passed by. His keen senses caught a glimpse of the microscopic society, and he was fascinated by their existence. Knowing that they could be in danger if any of the forest animals were to unknowingly harm their speck, Horton took it upon himself to ensure their safety. He gave chase to the speck and caught it before it could drift further away. Carefully, he placed the speck atop a nearby clover, where the tiny creatures could continue to live and thrive without interruption. The society prospered on the speck, and the forest elephants grew interested. Several of the creatures visit Horton's clover, and soon the word about the microscopic society began to spread. In this society, JoJo, a young, wise individual, was the eldest and the next in line for the mayoral position. JoJo didn't want to be the next mayor, though. He enjoyed his life and didn't care for the responsibilities and pressures that came with the mayoral position. Despite numerous attempts from his family members and peers to force him to take on the role, JoJo never discussed the mayoral position and continued to live his life as he pleased. Back in the forest, not everyone was pleased with the presence of the tiny society on the speck. A mischievous kangaroo was jealous of the attention Horton received for taking care of the speck and its inhabitants. She wished to reclaim her standing among the forest animals and wasn't above causing chaos to achieve her goal. In a cunning plan to get rid of the speck and the tiny civilization living on it, the kangaroo enlisted the help of a menacing vulture named Vlad Vladikoff. Vlad was known for his ruthless nature and willingness to harm others for personal gain. He agreed to aid the kangaroo in her plan, eager to watch the forest animals' reactions as their beloved speck disappeared. With a wicked grin, Vlad swooped down from the sky and, using his sharp talons, snatched the clover with the speck from Horton's watchful eye. Horton, sensing the danger to the tiny society, cried out in despair. He knew he had to do something to save them, but wasn't sure how to reclaim the speck from the terrifying vulture. As the forest animals gathered around him, JoJo's spirit and undying love for his people filled his heart. While he may not have wanted to be their mayor, JoJo knew that he needed to step up and fight for his people in their time of need. With a newfound sense of purpose and urgency, JoJo rallied the inhabitants of the speck. Together, they fought against the vulture and the kangaroo, proving that even the smallest of creatures could stand tall against insurmountable odds. Horton, proud and in awe of JoJo's bravery, remained by their side throughout the ordeal, offering his help whenever possible. Through teamwork and perseverance, the forest animals managed to outsmart Vlad and the kangaroo, saving the speck and its society from destruction. In the end, JoJo reluctantly accepted the mayoral position, realizing that he could use his wisdom and leadership skills for the greater good of his people. The entire forest learned a valuable lesson about the power of unity and resilience, and they were forever grateful for Horton's kind heart and dedication to protect even the tiniest of civilizations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to make a simple ornament for your desk? pick from the following. + Take an empty coke bottle, collect some beach sand and stain the sand in a few different shades, yellow, green, blue and so on, then layer it in the bottle; + Take a full coke bottle, collect some beach sand and stain the sand in a few different shades, yellow, green, blue and so on, then mix it in the bottle;","output":"I believe that the first option, \\"Take an empty coke bottle, collect some beach sand, and stain the sand in a few different shades – yellow, green, blue, and so on, then layer it in the bottle,\\" is the better solution for creating a simple ornament for your desk. There are several reasons for this choice, which I'll outline below: 1. Aesthetics: Layering the colored sand in distinct, visually appealing layers provides a more interesting and eye-catching ornament than simply mixing the sand together in a bottle. Layering allows you to create unique patterns and designs, which could be an excellent conversation starter or a focal point on your desk. Moreover, when visitors or colleagues see the neatly arranged layers, they are more likely to appreciate the effort and creativity behind the ornament. 2. Ease of creation: Working with an empty coke bottle makes it simpler to create the ornament in comparison to a full coke bottle. With an empty container, it's easier to control the pouring of the sand and avoid accidentally combining the colors unintentionally. The empty bottle also offers better access to its interior for inserting a funnel or spoon to help create the desired layered effect. 3. No interaction with liquid: Mixing the colored sand with the coke liquid in a full bottle could potentially ruin the effectiveness of the ornament. The liquid may cause colors to blend or dilute, diminishing the vibrancy of the colored sand. Furthermore, the sand particles might clump together in an unappealing manner due to the viscosity of the liquid, reducing the visual impact of the ornament. 4. Preservation: Layered sand in an empty coke bottle can be preserved much more effectively as a permanent keepsake. In contrast, mixing the sand with coke may lead to microbial growth, impart an unpleasant odor, or degrade the structural integrity of the bottle over time. This could diminish the overall appeal of the ornament and may even require disposal of the creation eventually. 5. Customizability: With an empty coke bottle and colored sand, you can easily update the ornament to match seasonal changes, office themes, or personal preferences. This flexible modification is significantly more challenging with a full coke bottle. Simple adjustments might include adding small shells, tiny toy figures, or glass beads that elevate the ornament's appearance. In conclusion, creating a simple ornament for your desk using an empty coke bottle and layered, colored sand provides an aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-make, and customizable decoration that can be preserved indefinitely. The advantages of this option outweigh the alternative of using a full coke bottle and mixing the sand with the liquid."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Hello! Those are great questions. Let me try to explain it in a simple way. 1. Dimensions of consciousness: Imagine you have a box of crayons and each crayon has a different color of consciousness. Each color represents a different level or \\"dimension\\" of consciousness. It's like when you're really awake, that's one color, and when you're sleepy, it's a different color. So, dimensions of consciousness are just different levels of how awake or aware your mind is. 2. What dimension is consciousness a part of? This question is a bit different from the first one. Everything around us, like toys and people, exists in space and time, which has three dimensions (like up-down, left-right, and forward-backward) and one time dimension (future or past). Consciousness is not a part of those dimensions. Rather, consciousness is how your brain or mind experiences and understands things around you. It's like tasting an ice cream or feeling happy; it's not about where you are in space, but how you experience it. So, these two questions are different.

Here are possible answers to this question: - front yard - washington state - countryside - concrete jungle - wisconsin  I believe the correct choice is \\"wisconsin\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice for the location that is not known for apple trees among the given possible answers is the \\"concrete jungle.\\" Here's why: 1. Front yard: A front yard can have apple trees if someone decides to plant them on their property. People often choose to plant fruit trees, including apple trees, in residential areas for gardening and fruit harvesting purposes. 2. Washington State: Washington State is well-known for its fruit production, including apples. In fact, Washington is the leading U.S. state in apple production, accounting for approximately 60-70% of the nation's entire apple production. 3. Countryside: Apple trees are often found in the countryside, where there is larger land for agricultural purposes. You'll commonly see apple orchards in rural areas, making the countryside a suitable environment for apple trees. 4. Concrete jungle: A \\"concrete jungle\\" refers to a highly urban area with a dense concentration of human-made buildings and infrastructure. These areas generally contain minimal green spaces and are not suitable for growing apple trees primarily due to the lack of open land and soil. Hence, the concrete jungle is not known for apple trees. 5. Wisconsin: While Wisconsin may not be as famous as Washington State for apple production, the state does have a sizable apple industry. Wisconsin's climate is suitable for growing apples, and the state has numerous apple orchards scattered throughout. In conclusion, the correct choice is the \\"concrete jungle\\" as it is an urban environment with little to no green spaces, making it unsuitable for apple tree growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\"  Question: \\"What natural disasters does Malaysia not have?\\" Answer: \\"It does not have hurricanes\\" Is this answer correct?

Barack Obama's historic peace-deal with Cuba after 50 years of cold war hostility was a breakthrough not to be sniffed at. But that didn't stop the US president having a try, when he got close and personal to a Cuban on Wednesday ... not a citizen, but a cigar. Significantly, it was the first time in 52 years that a US president has officially savoured the Cuban delicacy since John F. Kennedy stockpiled a secret stash of his favourite Havanas in the hours before he imposed a trade embargo on the Communist state in 1962. This, of course, doesn't include Bill Clinton's adventures with cigars and Monica Lewisnky in the Oval Office. Scroll down for video. Close to a Cuban: Obama was attending one of two White House receptions to welcome the start of Hanukkah when a guest handed him a large cheroot, which he took in his hand and ran under his nose. Obama was attending one of two White House receptions to welcome the start of Hanukkah when a guest handed him a large stogie. He took it in his hand and waved it in the air before running it under his nose for a whiff. The room fell near-silent as he paused to take in its aroma, before declaring it 'pretty good' to everyone's relief. 'I had the unique distinction of gifting the President of the United States with one of Cuba's finest cigars, a Montecristo Series at the White House…after a ceremony in which a Menorah was lit,' John Berzner, who offered the cigar to the president on Wednesday, told ABC News. He had packed just one cigar for the event, but felt compelled to present it to Barack Obama in celebration of the deal to begin normalising relations between the United States and Cuba, after 18 months of secret talks over prisoner releases brought a sudden end to decades of tension. 'Pretty good': The room fell near-silent as he paused to take in its aroma, before declaring it 'pretty good' to everyone's relief. When Berzner handed the cigar to Obama, he said: 'Mr. President, a Cuban cigar for you!' 'Oh, nice!' Obama replied as he lifted the cigar to his nose. 'The finest,' Berzner replied. The president approved, telling Berzner, 'Pretty good!' Nigel Savage, who was also a guest at the event and shot the video, added, 'The president definitely looked like he appreciated a good Cuban cigar.' It is unclear whether Obama kept the gift or handed it to the Secret Service. Legal again: President Barack Obama lifted some of America's sanctions against Cuba on Wednesday, making it legal for Americans who travel there to bring back a limited supply of cigars. The president's smoking habits have long been in the news. Obama last year told a United Nations official that he hadn't smoked a cigarette in years — mostly because of First Lady Michelle Obama. 'I haven't had a cigarette in probably six years,' Obama was overhead telling Maina Kiai at the U.N. General Assembly in New York back in September 2013. 'That's because I'm scared of my wife.' In 2009, the president said he was a 'former smoker' but he would 'constantly struggle' with kicking the habit. 'Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes,' he confessed at a press conference in 2009. 'Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No. 'I don't do it in front of my kids, I don't do it in front of my family,' he added. 'And, you know, I would say that I am 95 percent cured. But there are times where...There are times where I mess up.' Michelle Obama in February 2011 said her husband stopped smoking about a year earlier. President John F. Kennedy was partial to a puff and even asked his press secretary to buy him 1,000 of his favorite Cuban cigars in the hours before he imposed the Cuban trade embargo. Obama is not the first US president to enjoy a Cuban cigar on occasion. It emerged this week that President John F. Kennedy ordered his press secretary on February 2, 1962 to buy him as many of his favorite Cuban cigars as he could lay his hands on – and held off signing the Cuban trade embargo until his precious stogies were safely inside the White House. Kennedy asked Pierre Salinger to find at least 1,000 H.Upmann petit coronas, and gave him just a half-day to accomplish the task before they would become contraband. The next morning, Salinger recalled in rare video footage of his storytelling, he reported that he had bought up 1,200 of Cuba's finest exports – a feat the president pronounced 'Fantastic!' just before he signed a decree that banned all the communist country's products from the U.S. Washington already had some limited sanctions in place, but Kennedy's decision was the beginning of a comprehensive ban on U.S. trade with the island that remained intact until Wednesday. In 1996 the Helms-Burton law tightened the sanctions further. But President Barack Obama made a shocking move on Wednesday to reopen relations with Cuba and establish an embassy there. That means Americans who travel to Havana – and there will be thousands – 'will be able to return to the U.S. with some Cuban products, including Cohibas and other Cuban cigars,' according to Cigar Aficionado magazine.

It was a rare collaboration between the two that led to an entertaining and insightful conversation. However, the real highlight of the evening came when both golfers participated in the 'Ice Bucket Challenge' – a viral social media activity that raised awareness and funds for motor neurone disease research. The duo then passed on the challenge to soccer star Wayne Rooney, actress Meghan Markle, and former President George W. Bush.  The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon As always, when worlds collide, sparks fly. Such was the case when Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy joined Jimmy Fallon on the popular late-night talk show. The pair shared their passion for the sport, insights into their competitive characters, and how they motivate themselves on the course. Both golfers are admired for their exceptional talent and their dedication to the sport, making their presence on The Tonight Show a treat to golf enthusiasts and casual observers alike. The Ice Bucket Challenge Craze However, golf was not the only thing on the agenda. At the end of the show, Fallon challenged the two golfers to complete the 'Ice Bucket Challenge.' The viral activity involves participants pouring a bucket of ice-cold water over their heads while filming the process. The challenge initially became a sensation in 2014 when it encouraged people to nominate friends and family to do the same within 24 hours or donate to the ALS Association, which supports research and awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease. Raising Awareness for Motor Neurone Disease Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurological condition that attacks the nerve cells responsible for controlling muscle movement. This leads to the gradual weakening and wasting of muscles, causing difficulty in speaking, swallowing, and even breathing. The Ice Bucket Challenge aimed to create awareness and raise funds for MND research, support for those affected, and spotlight on the continued need for a breakthrough in treatment and a cure. A Chilling Experience As the audience anxiously anticipated, Woods and McIlroy showed their willingness to contribute to the cause by taking on the arduous task. After exchanging a few laughs, both golfers braced themselves and proceeded to pour buckets of ice-cold water over each other's heads. A combination of shock, laughter, and camaraderie filled the stage as Fallon and the audience cheered them on.  Nominating the Next Challengers In traditional Ice Bucket Challenge fashion, it was now time for Woods and McIlroy to nominate the next three people to complete the activity or donate to the ALS Association. With great enthusiasm, the two picked soccer superstar Wayne Rooney, former Suits actress Meghan Markle, and the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. Given their prominent status and significant influence, these nominations promised to keep the challenge trending and ultimately increase awareness and support for motor neurone disease. Conclusion The memorable appearance of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon once again exhibited the impact that celebrities and sports icons can have in raising awareness for crucial medical causes. By participating in the Ice Bucket Challenge and subsequently nominating other prominent figures, the two golfers successfully contributed to shining a light on the efforts to combat motor neurone disease, all while entertaining millions of viewers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick your answer from: A). keep their food and water separate from each other.; B). pour the water on top of the cat's food to save time.;...I think the answer is","output":"A). keep their food and water separate from each other. To help encourage your cat to stay hydrated, the most reasonable method from the given options is to keep their food and water separate from each other. This separation allows the cat to consume water more frequently without being discouraged by the presence of food. Cats are known to have a low thirst drive compared to other animals, so it is crucial to create an environment that promotes hydration. Mixing water with their food, as suggested in option B, is generally not recommended as it could make the food soggy and less appetizing for the cat. This approach might also discourage them from drinking water separately, further compromising their hydration. Moreover, cats are sensitive to the placement of their food and water sources. Having distinct locations for both can contribute to their overall comfort, fulfillment, and well-being. It is essential to place both the food and water sources in a quiet and easily accessible area, free from any possible disturbances. In addition to separating food and water sources, there are other measures you can implement to encourage your cat to drink more water: 1. Offer fresh, clean water daily: Cats are more likely to drink water if it is clean and fresh. Make a habit of changing the water in the bowl daily. 2. Provide multiple water sources: There could be times when your cat feels stressed or uncomfortable, having multiple water sources in different locations can help ensure that they have access to water at all times. 3. Choose a suitable water bowl: Some cats prefer a shallow and wide water dish, while others may prefer drinking from a water fountain. Experiment with different options to find the one that works best for your cat. 4. Encourage water intake through diet: Feeding your cat wet food will help provide additional moisture, aiding in keeping them hydrated. 5. Keep bowls clean: Regularly clean the water and food bowls to prevent bacterial build-up and maintain a hygienic area.

Q: Paragraph: \\"On 8 March 2016, the Facebook page for the web site Quartz shared a video called “Confessions of a Republican,” which was originally a political advertisement from 1964. The clip rapidly gained traction, and along with it skepticism that the viewpoints expressed too neatly echoed political schisms debated during the 2016 election: // <! [CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \\"\\"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\\"\\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]> This “Confessions of a Republican” ad from the 1964 presidential election is going viral, thanks to its uncanny relevance to the 2016 presidential election. Posted by Quartz on Tuesday, March 8, 2016 The speaker (actor Bill Bogert) discussed his lifelong identity as a loyal Republican voter before expressing reservations about the candidacy of then-Senator Barry Goldwater, who unsuccessfully challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Among the concerns he aired (the ad’s full text is at the bottom of the page) were what he described as a tendency of Goldwater to rapidly reverse position or deny statements on key issues, as well as a hawkish attitude during a point in American history when the specter of nuclear destruction loomed: The hardest thing for me about this whole campaign is to sort out one Goldwater statement from another. A reporter will go to Senator Goldwater and he’ll say, “Senator, on such and such a day, you said, and I quote, ‘blah blah blah’ whatever it is, end quote.” And then Goldwater says, “Well, I wouldn’t put it that way.” I can’t follow that. Was he serious when he did put it that way? Is he serious when he says I wouldn’t put it that way? I just don’t get it. A President ought to mean what he says. President Johnson, Johnson at least is talking about facts … but Goldwater, often, I can’t figure out just what Goldwater means by the things he says. I read now where he says, “A craven fear of death is sweeping across America. What is that supposed to mean? If he means that people don’t want to fight a nuclear war, he’s right. I don’t. When I read some of these things that Goldwater says about total victory, I get a little worried, you know? I wish I was as sure that Goldwater is as against war as I am that he’s against some of these other things. I wish I could believe that he has the imagination to be able to just shut his eyes and picture what this country would look like after a nuclear war. That portion alone drew comparisons to a fluctuating GOP identity in 2016, as well as objections raised about Donald Trump within the Republican party. Another excerpt paralleled former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke’s endorsement of Trump in February 2016: I wouldn’t have worried so much about party unity because if you unite behind a man you don’t believe in, it’s a lie. I tell you, those people who got control of that convention: Who are they? I mean, when the head of the Ku Klux Klan, when all these weird groups come out in favor of the candidate of my party — either they’re not Republicans or I’m not. Bogert concluded by saying that he planned to vote against Goldwater on Election Day, and that his party made a mistake in its choice of nominee. A voiceover then urged viewers to vote for Johnson. While it’s true many of the expressed sentiments echoed 2016 election rhetoric, the video was not a modern creation. The first appearance of it we found on the internet dated back to at least 2008 (clicking “transcript” revealed identical text to the video that circulated in 2016). The source for the earlier version was the Museum of the Moving Image, which exhaustively catalogued such media as part of an exhibit called The Living Room Candidate: Presidential Campaign Commercials 1952-2012: The Living Room Candidate: Presidential Campaign Commercials 1952-2012 is an online exhibition presenting more than 300 television commercials from every election year since 1952, when the first campaign TV ads aired. The website will be updated through the 2012 election between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. The site includes a searchable database and features commentary, historical background, election results, and navigation organized by year, type of ad, and issue. There is a playlist feature that allows visitors to select, annotate, and share their own groups of ads, and to view playlists by guest contributors. Each selected commercial is accompanied by a list of related ads. There is a transcript for each ad and a feature that allows visitors to search the entire database by title and by words in the transcripts. Remarks on the clip provided further context about the political climate in 1964: The margin of Johnson’s landslide victory in 1964 was partly a repudiation of Barry Goldwater’s extreme right-wing views. Goldwater, an Arizona senator and author of the best-selling book The Conscience of a Conservative, won the Republican nomination after a bitter primary campaign against moderate New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. In his acceptance speech, Goldwater made the infamous statement, “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.” The assertion, meant as a defense of conservatism, merged in the public consciousness with statements in which Goldwater advocated the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Vietnam and argued that Social Security be made voluntary. Film professor and author of the linked book (What’s Fair on the Air: Cold War Right-Wing Broadcasting and the Public Interest) Heather Hendershot said in a 2011 Curator’s Note: The right-wing media explosion of the 1960s has largely been lost to history, but we do have some snapshots of liberal responses to Cold War right-wingers in the form of campaign ads produced for the 1964 Johnson presidential campaign. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) used TV and radio to emphasize that Republican nominee Sen. Barry Goldwater was a nut with his finger on the proverbial button—as in LBJ’s infamous “Daisy Ad.” “Confessions of a Republican” is certainly less well-known, and is undoubtedly one of the strangest political campaign ads ever produced. In it, an actor (not identified as such) expresses his extreme anxieties about Goldwater. As he becomes increasingly nervous, he lights a cigarette to steady his nerves, and the camera moves in closer and closer. Who the hell is this sweaty, perturbed Man in a gray flannel suit? The spot is long on emotion and short on in-depth information, a tactic that should be familiar to TV viewers who have experienced virtually any mass mediated political campaign. Content-wise, what is of greatest interest is our putative Republican’s concerns about the “weird groups” supporting Goldwater, like the Ku Klux Klan. During the 1964 campaign a strange waltz materialized around the idea of “extremism,” with Goldwater insistent that he was not an extremist and the Johnson campaign insistent that he was. Our confessing Republican, a fantasy created by the DNC, distanced himself from the kooks, while revealing himself to be on the edge of instability himself. A 2010 blog post delved into the ad’s historical relevance (describing Goldwater’s campaign as “a naked appeal to Southern white racists to bolt the Democratic Party and support the Republican Party”). The article was written as race and racism once again became enormous issues in American politics following the 2008 election of the United States’ first black president. In November 2014, the actor from the 1964 commercial was interviewed about the “Confessions of a Republican” ad: Mr. Bogert himself was a 28 year-old Republican just as fearful of the man his Party put forth to lead the nation as was his semi-fictional character. “No, I certainly did not vote for Barry Goldwater. I voted for Lyndon Johnson. Ask me how long it’s been since I voted for a Republican.” I did. It’s been a long time. The interviewer noted that they had presumed that the actor in the Johnson campaign clip was a Democrat, but Bogert said that its producers required an actual Republican star in the spot: But just as the agency behind this commercial (Doyle Dane Bernbach) made sure that all of the staff who made this campaign were ardent Democrats, I’d always presumed that the actor in the “Confessions of a Republican” commercial was also a Democrat. Why would a Republican actor sign on to do a commercial at the expense of his own Party? “No, I’m a Republican. I just couldn’t stand Barry Goldwater. I was terrified of him … My father was disappointed that I did this commercial. He thought my performance was good, but he disagreed with the entire thesis.” I learned that when Bill Bogert interviewed to get the gig, the first question that the ad agency asked the young actor was whether or not he was a Republican. It was a pre-requisite for the gig. Not only was the “Confessions of a Republican” ad a legitimate archival clip from the 1964 campaign, but the actor depicted in it was himself a Republican, a casting prerequisite. The clip was likely scripted, but it was not a 2016 creation intended as a critique of the current political discourse. [TEXT: Confessions of a Republican] REPUBLICAN: I don’t know just why they wanted to call this a confession; I certainly don’t feel guilty about being a Republican. I’ve always been a Republican. My father is, his father was, the whole family is a Republican family. I voted for Dwight Eisenhower the first time I ever voted; I voted for Nixon the last time. But when we come to Senator Goldwater, now it seems to me we’re up against a very different kind of a man. This man scares me. Now maybe I’m wrong. A friend of mine just said to me, “Listen, just because a man sounds a little irresponsible during a campaign doesn’t mean he’s going to act irresponsibly.” You know that theory, that the White House makes the man. I don’t buy that. You know what I think makes a President – I mean, aside from his judgement, his experience – are the men behind him, his advisors, the cabinet. And so many men with strange ideas are working for Goldwater. You hear a lot about what these guys are against – they seem to be against just about everything – but what are they for? The hardest thing for me about this whole campaign is to sort out one Goldwater statement from another. A reporter will go to Senator Goldwater and he’ll say, “Senator, on such and such a day, you said, and I quote, ‘blah blah blah’ whatever it is, end quote.” And then Goldwater says, “Well, I wouldn’t put it that way.” I can’t follow that. Was he serious when he did put it that way? Is he serious when he says I wouldn’t put it that way? I just don’t get it. A President ought to mean what he says. President Johnson, Johnson at least is talking about facts. He says, “Look, we’ve got the tax cut bill and because of that you get to carry home X number of dollars more every payday. We’ve got the nuclear test ban and because of that there is X percent less radioactivity in the food.” But, but Goldwater, often, I can’t figure out just what Goldwater means by the things he says. I read now where he says, “A craven fear of death is sweeping across America. What is that supposed to mean? If he means that people don’t want to fight a nuclear war, he’s right. I don’t. When I read some of these things that Goldwater says about total victory, I get a little worried, you know? I wish I was as sure that Goldwater is as against war as I am that he’s against some of these other things. I wish I could believe that he has the imagination to be able to just shut his eyes and picture what this country would look like after a nuclear war. Sometimes, I wish I’d been at that convention at San Francisco. I mean, I wish I’d been a delegate, I really do. I would have fought, you know. I wouldn’t have worried so much about party unity because if you unite behind a man you don’t believe in, it’s a lie. I tell you, those people who got control of that convention: Who are they? I mean, when the head of the Ku Klux Klan, when all these weird groups come out in favor of the candidate of my party — either they’re not Republicans or I’m not. I’ve thought about just not voting at this election, just staying home — but you can’t do that, that’s saying you don’t care who wins, and I do care. I think my party made a bad mistake in San Francisco, and I’m going to have to vote against that mistake on the third of November.\\" Claim: A 1964 campaign ad for President Lyndon B.

Please answer the following question: This article: Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and... contains an answer for the question: What year was the school founded by the Bull brothers demolished?, what is it ?

Questions: What is the most common but not long lasting side effect of having a bath? Options: - use of water - drowning - rash - wet skin - dry skin A:","output":"The most common but not long-lasting side effect of having a bath is wet skin.  When you immerse yourself in water during a bath, the water makes contact with your skin, causing it to become wet. This wetness is only temporary, as your skin will soon begin to dry once you step out of the bath and remove the excess water, either by toweling off or simply air drying. Wet skin is a common side effect that most people experience after taking a bath but does not typically cause any discomfort or harm. The other options provided do not align with common sense as a general side effect of having a bath: - Use of water: While it is true that taking a bath requires the use of water, it is not a side effect. Rather, it is an essential element of the activity itself. - Drowning: Drowning is a severe and uncommon occurrence during a bath and is not considered a common side effect. It is critical to always practice safety measures while bathing and ensure that children and elderly individuals are closely monitored when in the water. - Rash: While some individuals may occasionally experience a rash after a bath, this is not a common side effect for most people and may be due to specific circumstances, such as allergies to bath products or water contaminants. - Dry skin: Although some individuals may experience dry skin after taking a bath, especially if the water is too hot or they use harsh soaps, this is not a typical side effect experienced immediately after bathing. Wet skin is the more common side effect in this scenario, while dry skin may become noticeable after the skin has fully dried.

Write the last sentence in this story. West Bromwich Albion fans were treated to almost half-an-hour of club coverage on Sky Sports News this afternoon, while fans of other clubs wondered what on earth was wrong with their television. It was probably the most coverage the club has had in years, but even the most hardened of Baggies’ fans will have grown tired of the Tony Pulis video feature as it was played on loop for what seemed an eternity. Many Twitter users wondered what was going on down at Sky Sports HQ and why they were being subjected to so much Pulis time, but it soon became apparent when the cameras started rolling live again, almost 30 minutes later.  OPTIONS: - Baggies reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Hartlepool reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Jeff Stelling reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Pulis reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Sky Sports HQ reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Sky Sports News reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Stelling reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Tony Pulis reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - Twitter reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air - West Bromwich Albion reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air","output":"Jeff Stelling reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air. This answer is the most appropriate, as Jeff Stelling is a well-known presenter and sports journalist associated with Sky Sports, and thus he would be the one to address the situation on air. The other options are either not affiliated with Sky Sports News or are not individuals who would appear on camera to discuss the incident, such as Tony Pulis (a football manager), Twitter, or West Bromwich Albion itself. The fireman's hat adds humor to the situation, as if acknowledging the unusual interruption and suggesting that the \\"emergency\\" has been resolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Speaking and listening is an important part of not only language arts classes, but also other content area classes. However, opening up discussions to be more than the typical call-and-response method (teacher asks a question, one student responds) is important to practice particularly in language arts class.  The best advice on guiding facilitation is to ask open-ended questions to which the asker doesn’t necessarily know the answer Students should be encouraged to talk to each other, to know that there is not one particular correct answer, and to use text-based evidence when making statements about literature. It should be made clear to students that the purpose of class discussions is not to find out that they have all the right answers, but to explore the themes and aspects of the literature together. As a guiding facilitator, your job is to present students not only with basic comprehension questions, but also with complex, higher-order thinking questions that get them involved in the text. This can be done even in the early grades after reading a book. Questions beginning with, “Why does the author believe that ___?” and “What have you encountered that makes you think about ___?” are some starter recommendations.  Keep discussions going. Ask students to build on what someone else said, or prompt them by saying “Tell me more about that.” Ask students to consider different perspectives on their statements, convince the class they are right, make predictions about what could happen next in the story, compare how their thoughts are the same or different from others, and summarize what they’ve learned from the discussion. Avoid trick questions, sarcasm, questions with obvious answers, yes-or-no questions, asking multiple questions before allowing time for response, and inadequate wait time (3-5 seconds) before changing the question or asking it again. Younger students will need some guidance on respectful discussion. Have the class make the rules together, using examples like “Stay respectful,” “Listen to others’ opinions,” “Look at who is speaking,” and “Piggyback off others’ ideas.” Post the rules in a visible place in the room and remind students of the rules before starting a discussion.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"(1). No While both questions are related to the concept of dyeing hair with Kool-Aid, they are not exact paraphrases of each other. The first question asks for a detailed explanation of the steps to dye brown hair with Kool Aid. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve that: 1. Choose the right Kool-Aid flavor: Select a Kool-Aid flavor or color that you want to dye your hair. Keep in mind that the color might not turn out exactly as you expect, especially if your hair is brown. Brighter colors may show up less vibrant on darker hair. 2. Prepare your hair: Make sure your hair is clean and dry before starting the process. The Kool-Aid will adhere better to hair that is free of oils and other products. 3. Mix the Kool-Aid dye: In a bowl, mix a few packets of Kool-Aid powder (unsweetened) with a little bit of water to create a thick paste. The amount of Kool-Aid you use may vary depending on the length and thickness of your hair. You can also add a teaspoon of conditioner to help the color spread more easily. 4. Apply the Kool-Aid dye: Put on gloves to protect your hands from the dye. Using a brush or your fingers, apply the Kool-Aid mixture to the sections of hair you want to dye. Be generous and make sure the hair is fully saturated with the mixture. 5. Wrap your hair: After applying the Kool-Aid to your hair, wrap those sections in aluminum foil or plastic wrap to prevent the dye from transferring to other parts of your hair or clothes. 6. Wait: Let the mixture sit on your hair for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. The longer you leave it on, the more intense the color will be. 7. Rinse: Once the time has passed, carefully remove the foil or plastic wrap and rinse your hair with cold water. Avoid using shampoo during this rinse, as it may reduce the intensity of the color. 8. Dry and style: Dry your hair and style as desired. Keep in mind that the color may continue to develop over the next few days, and it may fade after several washes. Now to answer the second question, yes, it is possible to dye your hair using Kool-Aid. As explained in the step-by-step process above, you can achieve temporary hair dye results using Kool-Aid. The outcome may not be as vibrant or long-lasting as traditional hair dye, but it offers a cost-effective and fun way to experiment with different hair colors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from: + Comforted by Skylar; + in Skylar's boobs; + Resentful for Skylar's actions; I heard that Skylar buried Jan's head in her bosoms because she was crying.  And I was wondering How will Jan feel after this? Answer:","output":"Jan might feel comforted after being embraced by Skylar in a compassionate and nurturing manner. The act of burying her head in Skylar's bosom might serve as an expression of support, safety and solace during an emotionally vulnerable moment. Many people, when faced with difficult situations or challenges in their lives, need a shoulder to lean on or someone they can trust and confide in. In times of emotional distress, physical contact may provide vital reassurance and help build a sense of security and relief from pain, anxiety, and other negative emotions. Such gestures are known to help release oxytocin, a hormone often referred to as the \\"love hormone\\" or \\"cuddle hormone,\\" which fosters a sense of social bonding and attachment. In this case, Skylar's comforting embrace with her bosoms might offer Jan a reprieve from her current struggles, allowing her to regain her composure, take comfort in the knowledge that someone cares for her, and find the strength to move forward. Depending on their relationship or personal understanding of each other's boundaries, Jan may interpret this action as Skylar's heartfelt attempt to provide the emotional support she needed. However, it is essential to consider that personal preferences, individual boundaries, and cultural expectations could play a significant role in how someone perceives such an act of comfort. Jan's feelings following Skylar's actions may vary depending on her background and her relationship with Skylar. If Jan feels like her boundaries were violated or if she considers Skylar's actions inappropriate, she might feel resentful and upset. In this case, it would be essential for Skylar to acknowledge Jan's feelings, apologize, and ensure to respect her boundaries in the future. In conclusion, Jan's emotional response to Skylar's consoling gesture may vary based on their relationship, her emotional state, preferences, and personal boundaries. If the embrace was received positively, Jan might feel comforted and emotionally supported, leading to a strengthened bond between them. On the other hand, if Jan deems the act inappropriate, she might feel resentment toward Skylar and express her discomfort. Communication and understanding each other's boundaries are crucial in ensuring that both parties navigate such emotionally charged situations effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Step 1: find the rows of medicine table. Step 2: find the number of rows in enzyme table whose enzyme's id not one of the results of step 1","output":"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enzyme WHERE enzyme.id NOT IN (SELECT medicine.enzyme_id FROM medicine);  I used the definition of the SQL subquery to get the enzymes' id from the medicine table first.

He is tied in place, and a man begins brushing him all over. he","output":"continues to brush the collie with diligence and care, despite the dog's mild protests in the form of impulsive wriggling and the occasional whimper. The bristles of the grooming brush run gently through the collie's thick and lustrous coat of tricolor fur — mostly sable and white, with a hint of black running down the spine.  With every stroke, loose fur and debris are expelled, leaving behind a slick and gleaming pelt that accentuates the dog's muscular physique. The man seems to have a very systematic approach to the task at hand. He begins from the dog's head and works his way down the body, ensuring every strand of the dog's long and silky fur is attended to. The dog's eyes occasionally meet the man's. Even though he isn’t enthusiastic about his current predicament, the collie's trusting, amber eyes reveal a deep bond between the two. It's clear from the dog's resigned acceptance that this isn't their first grooming session together. Once the brushing is done, the owner moves on to the collie's ears, gently folding them back to inspect and clean inside. He uses a soft, damp cloth to remove any dirt or wax buildup. This is followed by the trimming of the dog's nails, a process that requires some treats as bribery for the collie. While the collie might have been standing on top of the table reluctantly initially, there seems to be an understanding now. The grooming table has turned into an area for a bonding ritual between man and his faithful companion—an integral routine the collie ultimately seems to accept as another peculiar aspect of human love. After all, beauty routines can be both taxing and calming. And in a strange, convoluted way, coming to terms with a sense of cleanliness that animals aren't usually built to comprehend does form an unusual bonding experience. It is as if the man is trying to articulate care in a language that is initially alien to his little collie. But over time and with routine, they seem to have established an understanding. The process ends with a soft rub over a fluffy tail accompanied by a soft word of praise from the man. As if relieved, the collie bounds off the table once he is untied, shaking momentarily to re-align his coat before happily trotting off, tail wagging. The stunning coat of fur now looked glossier, healthier, and it undeniably added a certain charismatic flair to the collie's disposition.  From all this, it's evident that this kind of bonding through the medium of care and hygiene is a language that man and beast comprehend, attesting to the age-old saying of the beautiful bond between a man and his dog."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

The text discusses the challenges related to media pluralism and the concentration of ownership in several member states. Here's a detailed translation and explanation of the statement: The sentence \\"Il souligne très justement diverses difficultés affectant le pluralisme médiatique et la concentration de la propriété dans un certain nombre d'États membres\\" translates to \\"It quite rightly highlights various difficulties affecting media pluralism and the concentration of ownership in a certain number of member states.\\"  In this context, the statement underlines the importance of ensuring that media outlets remain diverse and free to express a range of views. Additionally, it emphasizes that media ownership should not be concentrated in a few hands or confined within a small group of member states. The diverse media landscape contributes to a healthy democracy, allowing for a variety of opinions and perspectives to be heard and considered. Media pluralism is essential to guaranteeing unbiased news and opinions in society. Concentration of ownership becomes problematic as it restricts the range of voices and opinions being shared, which can lead to a one-sided and homogeneous point of view in the media landscape. The statement encourages finding solutions to overcome these difficulties, ensuring a more democratic and fair media environment in member states.

Smooth the napkin out by hand so there aren’t any wrinkles. The napkin should now be a rectangle. Orient the open half where the two edges meet towards you. Starting on one end, take approximately two inches of fabric and fold it in towards the center. You will continue folding the napkin like an accordion, taking two inches of fabric and folding it towards the center of the napkin. Stop folding when you have approximately four inches of unfolded napkin left. Now, fold the napkin in half horizontally bringing the two bottom edges of the fan together. Your fan should now be folded in half with the extra four inches of unfolded napkin hanging on the inside fold of the fan. If the unfolded napkin is on the outside of the fan, unfold the fan and refold it the opposite way. Take the unfolded corners that are part of the four inches of unfolded napkin section. Tuck the top corners unfolded napkin section into where the two halves of the fan meet. This will make a triangular edge along the unfolded section. Make sure to tuck it securely to make a sturdy base. Let the napkin fan out into a semi-circle. The base that you’ve created from folding the unfolded corners of the napkin will act as a base to keep your napkin fan standing. Be aware that this fan is delicate. The fan may fall and unfold if you try to move the dinner plate that it is resting on. You can use the same basic technique of the standing fold to create a fan that can be placed inside of a glass. Rather than leaving four unfolded inches, fold the entire napkin like an accordion.  Now that the napkin is fully folded, take one end of the fan and fold approximately one inch over. Allow the fan to open up. Place the folded end of the fan into your glass and spread the rest of the fan out. This technique is called the goblet fan.","output":"Create an elegant fan-fold napkin for dinner plates or glasses using cloth or paper napkins by accordion-folding the fabric and tucking in corners to form a sturdy base or adapting the technique for a goblet fan."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  But I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  What is an answer for this question: Who is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","output":"Jeff is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight due to his diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol, compared to Ronaldo who has a more balanced and healthier diet focused on low fat and cholesterol. This higher intake of dietary lipids in Jeff's diet can lead to unhealthy weight gain and increased risk of health problems such as cardiovascular disease."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter Movie plot: In 1818, Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) lives in Indiana with his parents, Nancy (Robin McLeavy) and Thomas (Joseph Mawle), who works at a plantation owned by Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch.In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary.Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam. Because Sturgess' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since \\"Only the living can kill the dead\\").

I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations.

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where does Atticus's daughter live in Go Set a Watchman? Context: An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.

Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863. Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.The series' impact on Dalí is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande hazaña! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande hazaña! Con muertos!. In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads.

Question: What happened as the volcano exploded? Movie title: King Solomon's Mines Movie plot: Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) hires Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because...

Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.  I am facing a new situation today: Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year.

Here's why: 1. Soccer: Soccer is a sport, not a place or venue, so while outdoor soccer fields often have bleachers, the term itself doesn't indicate a specific location that houses indoor bleachers. 2. Sporting event: A sporting event is a broad term that refers to any athletic competition, which could be held indoors or outdoors. While many sporting events may have bleachers, this answer choice doesn't point directly to an indoor location. 3. Pharmacy: A pharmacy is a store where people buy medications, over-the-counter drugs and other health and wellness products. Bleachers are not found in pharmacies since seating isn't a typical feature in these spaces. 4. Gymnasium: A gymnasium, or indoor gym, is a facility designed for sports, physical education, and other athletic activities. Gymnasiums often have bleachers, which are tiered rows of seats that provide a place for spectators to sit and watch the events taking place in the gym. These indoor venues can host a variety of sports, including basketball, volleyball, and indoor track.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film is set in the 1750s and involves Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a GuaranÃ­ community to Christianity.[6] The GuaranÃ­ community is not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, shown by the opening scene where they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls, a large waterfall they live above. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. The GuaranÃ­ warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza (Chuck Low). After returning from another kidnapping trip Mendoza is told by his assumed fiancÃ©, Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi), that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn). Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his actions. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return to the GuaranÃ­ village, scaling a cliff while dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, there are a few tense moments when the natives recognise him, but after seeing him in his humbled state, they cut away his heavy bundle and forgive him. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the GuaranÃ­. Moved by the GuaranÃ­'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson). The Jesuit missions were safe because they were...

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms?  Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

Title: The Flowers of War Movie plot: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

Snails are not only consumed as a delicacy in various cuisines but are also valued for their nutritional content and are used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. To meet the escalating demand, it is essential to create an efficient snail farming system that ensures the optimal growth and health of the gastropods. One such system is the semi-intensive system that balances the benefits of both extensive and intensive methods. This article will explore how to determine whether you should create a semi-intensive system for your snail farm and provide insights on achieving optimal conditions for snail farming. Determining the Need for a Semi-Intensive System Before deciding on implementing a semi-intensive system, it is crucial to assess the specific needs of your snail farm. The semi-intensive system combines the natural habitat of snails with some form of artificial enclosure, providing a controlled environment that promotes growth and reproduction. Factors to consider include the number of snails you plan to raise, available resources, potential market demand, and your experience with snail farming. The semi-intensive system is most suitable for those planning to operate a small to medium-sized snail farm. It provides a balance between managing snail growth and managing costs, as this system does not require significant initial investment compared to the intensive method. Additionally, it ensures a more controlled environment when compared to the extensive system, resulting in higher yields due to better protection from predators and enhanced ease of management. Ensuring Sufficient Space for Snail Growth and Health One of the primary factors to consider in a semi-intensive system is the size of your snail house, also known as a snailery. An adequately sized snailery allows the snails to grow and thrive while minimizing stress and overcrowding. To calculate the appropriate size for your snailery, consider the species of snail you intend to farm and their anticipated growth rate, as well as the number of snails you plan to raise. Snails are sensitive to changes in their environment, and providing ample space for movement and growth is crucial to their overall well-being. It is recommended to allocate approximately 10 square meters of space for every 500 mature snails. This size estimation accounts for the snails' activities, such as foraging, laying eggs, and mating, as well as the necessity of having a designated area to isolate sick or injured snails. Replacing Compost for Optimal Nutrition When setting up a semi-intensive snail farming system, it is important to use high-quality compost or soil substrate that is rich in essential minerals and nutrients. Maintaining a favorable soil substrate condition is vital for the snails' nutrition, growth, and reproduction. Therefore, it is necessary to replace the compost periodically to ensure that your snails continue to thrive and receive the nourishment they require. Depending on the snail species and the environmental conditions of your snailery, the compost may need to be replaced every 6 to 12 months. Regular monitoring of the soil substrate will allow you to determine when it is time to replace the compost based on the nutrient content of the soil. Maintaining Clean Water Sources Snails require access to a clean and fresh water source for their survival. In a semi-intensive system, it is essential to provide a regularly replenished water supply in the enclosure. Snails consume water for hydration, maintaining their body temperature, and regulating their metabolism. Dehydration is detrimental to snails, as it may cause them to become inactive and negatively impact their growth and reproduction. To provide a consistent source of clean water, install a continuous-flow drinking system in the snailery. This provides the snails with fresh water on a constant basis and prevents the water from being contaminated by waste. Additionally, keep the humidity levels within the snailery in check by regularly misting the enclosure and properly draining excess surface water to prevent the onset of harmful pathogens. Conclusion In conclusion, establishing a semi-intensive snail farm system requires careful consideration of your specific needs and goals while ensuring that the snails have the appropriate environment to grow and thrive. By implementing proper management techniques, such as maintaining a sufficiently large snailery, replacing compost to promote nutrition, and providing access to clean water sources, you can optimize your snail farming venture and foster a thriving gastropod population."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In a fire station in Toronto, a fire pole likely serves the same purpose. Regarding the first firefighters, the existence of firemen can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with the first organized firefighting force being established in Ancient Rome around 6 AD under the rule of Emperor Augustus. Known as the \\"Vigiles,\\" these fire brigades were responsible for controlling and extinguishing fires and saving lives in the great city. Firefighting techniques and equipment evolved over time, and professional fire departments emerged in various cities, such as the London Fire Brigade in England, established in 1666, and the New York City Fire Department in the United States, officially established in 1865.

The move to limit Airbnb hosts from renting properties for more than 90 days was announced in December. London boroughs have warned that short-term lets are pushing up longer term rental prices in the capital. But nearly a third of all boroughs told the BBC the time limit would not slow the growth of short-term letting. Airbnb, an accommodation listing website, said the impact of short-term lets and home-sharing websites on rental prices in London was \\"negligible\\". Last year, it commissioned the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) to investigate the impact of short-term lets on London's rental market . Airbnb said the IPPR report found \\"entire homes\\" booked on the site at least once a year made up less than 1% of total private housing stock in London in 2015. But the study also showed 11% (2,444 properties) of Airbnb's entire home rentals were let for more than six months of the year. The IPPR found landlords were, in some cases, removing properties from the long-term rental market altogether and offering their properties for rent on a series of short-term lets instead. In turn, this piled pressure on long-term rental prices due to a lack of available properties, the report said. It also found some Airbnb hosts may have been offering properties for rent illegally. Events organiser Daniel Thomas has been looking for an affordable room to rent in the area for over a year. Mr Thomas, who commutes from Slough to Ladbroke Grove, said: \\"Lots of young people here are looking for properties for the first time, and they're all just going to tourists, so we have nowhere to live.\\" The law states owners cannot let property for more than 90 days in a given year on a short-term let. If an owner wants to let for longer, they must seek planning permission for a \\"change of use\\" from their local council. Seven London boroughs - Camden, Hammersmith, Haringey, Islington, Lewisham, Waltham Forest, Westminster - have now called for tougher legislation to prevent illegal lettings. A Camden Council spokesman said: \\"There is a clear justification for doing so given the detrimental impact short-term letting is having on housing availability in London.\\" Diarmard Ward, executive member for housing at Islington Council said: \\"Airbnb and other short-term letting sites push up rents and they also reduce the number of homes for people who want to rent long term.\\" Airbnb's northern Europe boss, James McClure, told BBC London the company was introducing the 90-day limit \\"to forestall any potential danger down the road\\". \\"That's why we're looking to implement automatic limiting to ensure the law is respected and it's up to councils to decide the best use and mix of properties in their area,\\" he added. The Department for Communities and Local Government said any landlord breaching the 90-day limit \\"faces a hefty fine\\", and added it is up to local councils to enforce the law. A government spokesman praised Airbnb's policy and encouraged other services to follow suit. But commercial landlords operating on Airbnb told BBC London the 90-day limit would have no effect. One, who has three homes listed on the site but did not want to be named, said: \\"I'll just carry on as before. When the 90 day rule comes up, I'll re-register the homes I have so it looks like they're different homes... a few metres away. \\"I know many other landlords planning to do the same thing.\\" Another, Bulent Boytorun, who rents four homes on Airbnb, said he may move his business to alternative home-sharing platforms. All 33 of London's boroughs, including the City of London, were asked whether they believed all home-sharing websites should block illegal lets. Twelve of the 28 the councils that responded to BBC London said they supported it. But when BBC London asked other competitors in the short-term letting market sites if they enforced the 90-day rule or planned to do so, none said they did. A spokesperson for TripAdvisorRentals, which lists about 8,000 London properties, said: \\"To list on our site, homeowners and managers must agree to our terms and conditions, which require a property to be operated in accordance with all local laws and regulations.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the impact of Airbnb and other short-term letting platforms on the London rental market.

Elections would be held on 26 October, he said in a TV address. Separately, Ukraine's military says it clashed with rebel armoured vehicles that entered the country from Russia. More than 2,000 people have died in months of fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The two regions declared independence from Kiev, following Russia's annexation of the southern Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March. In the address late on Monday, Mr Poroshenko said he acted fully in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution, which states that new elections must be held if a ruling coalition in parliament is not formed within 30 days. The previous coalition collapsed on 24 July. The president stressed that the \\"current composition of the parliament has been the mainstay of (President) Yanukovych\\", who was forced to flee Ukraine amid mass street protests in February. \\"Elections is the best way of cleaning things up,\\" he said. However, new elections do hold some risks for Mr Poroshenko, the BBC's David Stern in Kiev reports. If the president is unable to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine before the October vote, he risks a voter backlash. Anger is also rising among Ukrainians at the government's inability to introduce reforms and tackle corruption, our correspondent adds. Earlier on Monday, Ukraine's military said a column of 10 tanks and two armoured personnel carriers had crossed from Russia and been heading towards the south-eastern port of Mariupol. It said Ukrainian troops destroyed two tanks, blocking the area. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard the reports about the alleged incursion, but complained of regular \\"disinformation about our 'incursions'\\". Mr Lavrov also commented on the parading of captured Ukrainian government soldiers by rebels through the centre of Donetsk on Sunday. Crowds lined the streets chanting \\"fascists\\" as the dishevelled-looking prisoners walked by with their hands tied behind their backs. Some people threw eggs and other objects at the prisoners. The move was widely condemned around the world. However, Mr Lavrov said this was \\"nowhere near mistreatment\\" and that Ukrainian fighters' actions often amounted to \\"war crimes\\". \\"I saw images of that parade and I didn't see anything close to what could be considered as humiliating,\\" he said. On Monday, heavy fighting on Monday was also reported in and around Donetsk. Ukraine's security services said 10 Russian soldiers were captured in the region. Ukraine accuses Russia of arming the rebels in the east and sending its troops into the country - a charge the Kremlin denies.

It can be found in drugstores or online and comes in spray and powder form. To apply, spray your hair a few times or sprinkle a little on top of your scalp. Comb in the spray or powder, which will help comb out any dandruff flakes. Rinse your comb after each stroke. Talcum powder can be used instead, but it can make dark or black hair look grey, white, or dotted. Find the region of your scalp with the most dandruff, and comb your hair so it covers this area. Hairstyling products may help you achieve this task, but fluffing up your hair into a tousled look can work as a quick improvement. Covering up the dandruff is not actually treating anything, and you should keep in mind that this is only a quick visual fix.  The best way to get rid of dandruff is to actually use treatment methods that will affect the underlying causes. Select a shirt, dress, or other top with a white, grey, or metallic appearance. This will make white or yellow dandruff flakes much less noticeable. Textured or patterned clothing may help hide the dandruff as well. Any cap, hat, or scarf can be used to hide the dandruff on your scalp. As long as it's on, it will also minimize the number of dandruff flakes that fall onto your clothing. Plus, people will not be able to see any flakes that are stuck to your hair. Pocket a mini-lint roller before you head outside. Any time you see dandruff flakes on your clothing, make a trip to the bathroom and use the lint roller to pick them up off the fabric.  If you can't get your back, have a friend or loved one help you. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple way to explain something longer. So, for this article, the summary is: Dry shampoo can help clean your scalp and hide dandruff. You can also use talcum powder, but it can make dark hair look lighter. Wearing clothes with certain colors and patterns can make dandruff less noticeable. Hats and scarves can also help cover it. If you see dandruff on your clothes, use a small roller to clean it off.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of\\" a new world\\".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum  consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed  feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum. Question: What's the reason that the eagle was disciplined? - He was a problem child. - He beat all to become the best. - He didn't do as teachers taught. - He decided to climb to the top of the tree. The answer is:","output":"He didn't do as teachers taught."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

If There is no indication in section 717 or its legislative history that Congress intended to take such a narrow view of GAOas authority., can we conclude that \\"Section 717 showed that Congress had intended to take a narrow view of GAO's authority.\\"?","output":"Based on the provided information, it is not reasonable to conclude that \\"Section 717 showed that Congress had intended to take a narrow view of GAO's authority.\\" Since there is no indication in Section 717 or its legislative history pointing towards a narrow interpretation of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) authority, the opposite conclusion should be drawn. To assess the intent behind a particular statutory provision like Section 717, it is important to examine the following elements: 1. Statutory language: The actual text of Section 717 should be analyzed to determine whether any narrow or broad interpretation of GAO's authority is apparent from the phrasing. The presence or absence of limiting language may provide valuable insights into Congress's intention. 2. Legislative history: Reviewing the records of congressional proceedings, committee reports, and other documents related to the drafting and enactment of Section 717 can help identify discussions or comments relating to the scope of GAO's authority. These resources might offer evidence of whether Congress intended a narrow or broad interpretation. 3. Purpose of the statute: Understanding the purpose of the statute or the problem that Congress intended to address with Section 717 can help in determining the scope of GAO's authority. If the purpose of the provision aligns with a broader interpretation of GAO's powers, it would not be correct to conclude that Congress intended a narrow view. 4. Judicial interpretation: Courts may have already interpreted Section 717 in cases where its scope was challenged or questioned. Examining these judicial interpretations could provide valuable insights into the intended scope of GAO's authority. 5. Consistency within the broader statutory scheme: Placing Section 717 in the context of the overall statutory structure may provide clues about the intended scope of GAO's authority. If Congress has generally assigned broader powers to the GAO in other related provisions, it would be inconsistent to assume that it intended a narrower view in Section 717. In conclusion, without any indication in Section 717 or its legislative history that Congress intended a narrow view of GAO's authority, it would be incorrect to assume such a restrictive interpretation. It is essential to consider the variety of factors mentioned above when determining the scope of GAO's authority and understanding Congressional intent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is Python primarily used for?","output":"While these two questions may seem similar, they actually have slightly different implications. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each question to help illustrate the subtle difference between them. 1. What is Python used for currently? This question generally seeks to understand the various applications and areas where Python, as a programming language, is being employed in the present context. It aims to explore the current landscape of Python usage in various industries and fields. In this case, the emphasis is on the present scenario, without any regard for which applications might be more significant or dominating compared to others.  Some current uses for Python include: - Web Development: Python is widely used in web development, with popular frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid, making it easy to develop and maintain professional websites and web applications. - Data Science: Python has established itself as a dominant language in the field of data sciences, thanks to its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, which are essential for data analysis and manipulation. - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Python also plays a significant role in machine learning and AI, with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras offering users powerful platforms for training and deploying models. - Automation: Python is a popular choice for automation tasks, as it is easy to learn, write, and understand, especially for repetitive tasks or simple scripting purposes. - Networking and Security: Within the realms of networking and security, Python’s flexibility and its extensive standard library make it an ideal language for network programming, penetration testing, and cybersecurity research. - Game Development: While not as common as some other languages, Python still has usage in game development, with libraries like Pygame providing developers with tools for building simple 2D games. 2. What is Python primarily used for? This question, on the other hand, aims to understand the main or most significant area of application for Python as a programming language. It assumes that Python's usage tends to be more prominent in specific fields compared to others, and focuses on identifying those dominant areas. To answer this question, we can consider the following primary use cases of Python: - Web Development: As previously mentioned, Python is very popular in web development, making it one of the primary uses for the language. - Data Science: Python's rich ecosystem of tools and libraries also make it the go-to programming language for data scientists, which can be considered another primary use case. - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Python's role in machine learning and AI is substantial, and as these fields continue to grow in importance, so does Python's position as the dominant language in these areas. It is important to note that Python's versatility means it still has relevant applications in many other fields; however, web development, data science, and machine learning/AI can be identified as the primary areas where Python usage is most significant and well-established. In conclusion, while both questions address Python's usage, the first question focuses on providing a broader and more comprehensive view of the areas in which Python is used currently, whereas the second question seeks to identify the primary or most significant use cases where Python excels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Because hie forgot something, he put the car in what? Possible A: straightforth, reverse, backwards, back and, race  Why is \\"reverse\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Reverse\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in response to the question 'Gill went forth for some time. Because he forgot something, he put the car in what?' because it demonstrates an understanding of both human behavior and the workings of a car. Let's break this down further by considering each possible answer and why \\"reverse\\" is the most reasonable based on human common sense. 1. Straightforth: This term suggests moving forward or continuing in the same direction. However, in the context of the question, Gill needs to return to where he came from because he forgot something. Moving forward will take him farther away from his starting point, so this option is counterintuitive and doesn't align with human common sense. 2. Reverse: This answer is aligned with human common sense because it accurately represents the action Gill would need to perform to return to his starting point. In a car, \\"reverse\\" is the gear that allows the car to move backward. If Gill realized he forgot something and needed to go back, he would most logically put the car in reverse to achieve this. This action aligns with how humans understand cars and their functions. 3. Backwards: This term, while generally correct, is less specific compared to \\"reverse.\\" It does indicate that Gill needs to return or move in the opposite direction, but it does not explicitly mention the gear he would need to use to do so. Therefore, while this answer may convey the general idea, \\"reverse\\" is a more precise term and thus a more accurate representation of human common sense. 4. Back and: This option is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear understanding of the action Gill needs to take. It suggests going back, but it does not specify how Gill would do so. As a result, it does not align well with human common sense, which seeks clear and specific information to make a decision. 5. Race: This term implies moving quickly or speeding and has no clear connection to the context of the question. In the given scenario, Gill needs to go back because he forgot something, so racing or speeding would not be relevant or aligned with human common sense. In conclusion, the answer \\"reverse\\" aligns best with human common sense because it correctly interprets the context of the question and describes the necessary action Gill would need to take in response to realizing he forgot something. It demonstrates an understanding of human behavior in such a situation and provides an accurate representation of the workings of a car, making it the most reasonable and logical response."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Okay, let's break this down like we're talking to a five-year-old.  Premise: \\"Even better than Roger Rabbit insofar as animation\\" This means that something is better than the movie \\"Roger Rabbit\\" when it comes to animation. In other words, some other cartoon or animation is more fun or has better pictures than the Roger Rabbit movie. Hypothesis: \\"Animation and Roger Rabbit have nothing in common.\\" This means that animation (cartoons and moving pictures) and the movie \\"Roger Rabbit\\" don't share any similarities. They are completely different things. Now, let's see if the hypothesis comes from the premise. Since the premise says that something is better than Roger Rabbit in terms of animation, it means that Roger Rabbit is connected to animation.

First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and reversed what he saw as his father's laxness by cracking down on unorthodox sects and by decapitating an anti-Manchu writer his father had pardoned. In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \\"money to nourish honesty\\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence.

Title: Easy check (and fix) for leaks Product review: I love Avent products, and so does my baby. I was given an infant feeding set by a friend before my daughter was born, and when I choose to bottle feed when she was about a month old, the Avent system made the change so easy. I love how the system will grow with my baby.However, I did have some problems with leaks so I did a bit of testing to determine which part of the assembled bottle was faulty.I discovered that some of the teats still had little bits of silicon left at the base from the manufacturing process (I'm sure there's a name for that!) which was preventing them from sealing properly.Easily fixed - just run your finger around the inside and outside of the base of the teat, and if there are any bits of silicon sticking out, pull 'em off! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light.  The step-by-step reasoning is as follows: 1. The user starts off the review with a positive statement, saying they love Avent products, and that their baby also seems to enjoy them. This creates an overall positive tone to the review.  2. The user mentions that they were given an infant feeding set by a friend and that it made the transition to bottle feeding smooth when their daughter was around a month old. This again casts the product in a good light due to its ease of use during a critical phase in a baby's life. 3. The user appreciates that the product can adapt or grow with the baby, indicating that it provides long-term value, which again is positive. 4. However, the user does mention a negative aspect, which is the leakage they experienced with the bottle. This could cast the product in an unflattering light.  5. Despite the leak issue, the user takes time to investigate the problem and finds out that it is caused by residual silicon left from the manufacturing process at the base of the teats.  6. The user gives a simple solution to this problem, which is to run a finger around the base of the teat and remove any silicon bits. Fixing this issue is straightforward and does not require any external materials, making the problem seem less serious.  So, overall, despite mentioning a problem (which could be seen as a quality control issue), the user provides a simple solution and finishes the review without significantly reducing their positive sentiment towards the product. Therefore, the review can be seen as mostly flattering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Step 4: Fewer fish and their eggs die, leading to a more stable fish population. Step 5: Fewer frogs and plants die, allowing for higher populations of these species. Step 6: Fewer insects and other wildlife die, maintaining a more balanced ecosystem. Step 7: With a more balanced ecosystem, the overall impact of acid rain is reduced, and the environment is more resilient against future damage.

Baltimore Children’s Bookstore wins grant from James Patterson The Children’s Bookstore in Baltimore is one of the first recipients of James Patterson’s grants. James Patterson — one of the most popular authors in the world — is taking a page from the book of Dolly Levi, who famously said, “Money, pardon the expression, is like manure. It’s not worth a thing unless it’s spread around, encouraging young things to grow.” Last year, the bestselling thriller writer announced plans to distribute grants to help independent bookstores, and this week the first checks went out to almost 60 stores around the country: more than 250,000 in amounts ranging from 2,000 to 15,000. Patterson has said he will give away 1 million before he’s done. One of those lucky stores is The Children’s Bookstore in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore. JoAnn Fruchtman, a former artist and teacher, has owned the small store for 35 years. She was stunned by the boldness and generosity of Patterson’s plan. “I’ve met a lot of authors,” she said, “and a lot of authors have supported indie bookstores, for sure, but this is really amazing.” She never formally applied for a grant. She just wrote Patterson a letter back in November “commending him for doing what he’s doing.” In her letter, Fruchtman also described the history of her store and its efforts to help Baltimore City public schools. For the past 15 years, she’s been raising money from the community so that teachers can apply for grants to pay for books to use in their classroom. “So, for example, if a high school class is doing a unit on World War II,” she explains, “they can get copies of ‘Night,’ by Elie Wiesel. And then the kids get to keep the books.” Through this program, The Children’s Bookstore has given away tens of thousands of books. Obviously, Patterson was impressed, though Fruchtman says she does not yet know the size of the grant her store has received. Fruchtman gives the credit to the people she works with. “My staff is fabulous,” she says. “They all read. They all love literature. They all love to recommend books. The success of the store has to do with the fact that we’re just totally devoted to our kids — and getting them excited about books. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Children's Bookstore in Baltimore has been named as one of the first recipients of a grant from renowned author James Patterson.

The Children's Bookstore, owned by JoAnn Fruchtman, has been in operation for 35 years and has been actively involved in helping Baltimore City public schools by providing books to classrooms through community-raised funds. The grant awarded to The Children's Bookstore is expected to support its efforts in promoting reading and literature among children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: You are presented with the question \\"Cancer cells perform what more often than regular cells?\\" and the following answer choices:  - death  - PDAs  - grow  - recovery  - disease  - kill them  - mitosis  - radiation  Now knowing that cancer cells divide more often than normal cells, and grow out of control and basically, mitosis is the process by which a cell divides, choose the best answer. Answer:","output":"The best answer would be \\"mitosis.\\" Mitosis refers to the process of cell division, where one cell splits into two identical cells; each carrying the same genetic material. This process is a fundamental aspect of cellular biology, allowing for growth, development and repair within organisms.  In normal circumstances, mitosis is a well-regulated process within the body, ensuring that the number of new cells produced matches the number of cells that have died. This balance helps maintain the proper functioning and health of tissues and organs. However, in the case of cancer, this process of mitosis becomes distorted. Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled and rapid cell division. Instead of following the normal cycle of growth and cell death, cancer cells continue to undergo mitosis and produce new cells regardless of the need or space within the organism. This excessive cell division leads to the formation of tumor masses, which can disrupt the normal functioning of the body. So, given the context of the question and knowing that cancer cells divide more often than normal cells, it can be inferred that cancer cells perform \\"mitosis\\" more often than regular cells. This accounts for their hasty growth and proliferation, which in turn, causes the medical condition known as cancer. This unmodulated mitosis is what separates cancer cells from normal cells, they do not respond to the body's signals to stop dividing, leading to an overgrowth of cells, and potentially, to malignancy. The other options do not fit as well. \\"Death\\", \\"PDAs\\" (public displays of affection), \\"recovery\\", \\"disease\\", \\"kill them\\", and \\"radiation\\" are not processes or actions performed more often by cancer cells. \\"Grow\\" could be a possible answer, but it is less precise than \\"mitosis\\". Despite their rapid growth, what differentiates cancer cells specifically is the mechanism by which they grow: through excessive and uncontrolled mitosis.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was knighted in 1911? is inside the article: In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his appointments as Companion of Honour in 1944, to the Order of the Crown (Belgium; 1920), and Officer of the Legion of Honour (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \\"Sir Henry Wood\\", often referred to by its first line, \\"Where does the uttered music go?\\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him. His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially \\"the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", but universally referred to by the informal short version.His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood: His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him \\"Timber\\" – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too.

The app, which provides a customizable and interactive notification and lock screen, has proven to be more engaging than the default options on my smartphone. It definitely deserves a 4-star rating, here's why: Pros: 1. Visually appealing - The minimalistic design suits the modern aesthetic that most users prefer. The customizable interface lets me choose various themes and even tweak the layout, as per my taste. 2. Great functionality - I appreciate the fact that the app gives me quick access to my notifications and essential settings right from the lock screen. This has saved me so much time in comparison to navigating through the default Android lock screen. 3. Enhanced security - With com.achep.acdisplay, I can set my own security features, such as the lock screen PIN, pattern, or fingerprint access. This adds an additional layer of security, on top of the default phone settings. However, there are some areas that could be improved to make the app worthy of a perfect 5-star rating: Cons: 1. Battery drainage - I have noticed a slight increase in the battery usage, which I assume is because of the screen timeout customization. This can be a bit concerning for users with older smartphones or those who don’t always have access to a charger. 2. Occasional glitches - Once in a while, the app freezes or lags, especially while interacting with the notifications or changing settings. Although this issue sorts itself out or can be solved by restarting the app, it can hamper the user experience. In conclusion, com.achep.acdisplay is an excellent app for customizing your smartphone's lock screen and improving the ease of accessing notifications and settings. A few improvements in terms of performance and battery efficiency could elevate the app to a full 5-star rating.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  Now, I have a new situation: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate.  Answer this question please: Whose cup of water is more dense? A:","output":"Chris's cup of water is more dense.  Here's the reasoning behind this: Density of water is related to the distance between the molecules. The closer the molecules are, the more dense the water is. According to the information provided, when water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. This increase in density continues until the water temperature is around 4°C, at which the water reaches its highest density. So, when Chris orders water with molecules closer together, he is implicitly ordering colder water, which is denser. In contrast, Steve’s water, with molecules far apart, would be warmer and less dense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two neighboring planets in another solar system. The people of Mandron use many fossil fuels to power things that require electricity. The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: The habitats of which planet's animals are in more danger? A:","output":"Based on the information from the background article about the impact of fossil fuel usage on global warming and its consequences on habitats and species, the habitats of the animals on the planet Mandron are in more danger. This is due to the fact that the people of Mandron heavily rely on fossil fuels for their energy needs. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change. As a result, habitats undergo significant and potentially destructive changes, putting the animals living in those habitats at a higher risk of extinction. On the other hand, the people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power, significantly reducing their dependence on fossil fuels and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, their approach to energy production is more sustainable and poses less threat to the habitats of animals on their planet. Consequently, the habitats of Liptar's animals are comparatively safer than those on Mandron."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Merlin loved them, but they're hard and sharp like glass. He's cough and hack after eating them. He liked them so much tho' that I decided I'd try to soften them by letting them soak in water overnight. That didn't work -- I threw the rest of them out fearing for the health of my dog. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it is unlikely that the user would recommend this product to others. Although their dog Merlin seemed to enjoy the product at first, the user expressed concerns about the hard and sharp texture, which caused Merlin to cough and hack after consumption. This indicates that the product might not be safe or suitable for the dog's health. The user also mentioned trying to soften the product by soaking it in water overnight, but this attempt was unsuccessful. The fact that they ultimately decided to discard the remaining product due to their fear for their dog's health further supports the idea that they would not recommend it to others. In summary, despite their dog’s initial enthusiasm for the product, the user's experience with the hard and sharp texture, as well as their unsuccessful attempt to improve it, suggest that they would not endorse this product to other dog owners. Their primary concern appears to be the safety and well-being of their pet, which is likely to be a priority for others seeking recommendations as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The situation is worsening each day as water levels are rising because of poor drainage, the head of Pakistan's disaster management body said. The UN has begun relief work but more rain has been forecast for the area. Meanwhile, in India's eastern Orissa state more than one million have been displaced and 16 killed in floods. About 2,600 villages have been submerged across 19 districts. The army and navy have been called in to help as many villagers are still stranded and dependent on food drops from helicopters. Heavy monsoon rains have been battering South Asia for days but southern Pakistan has borne the brunt of the bad weather in recent weeks. Almost one million houses there have been destroyed or damaged and floods have affected nearly 4.2m acres of land, the UN says. The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Karachi says that the rain is heaping misery on the hundreds of thousands living out in the open.  Many people remain stranded on high ground and rooftops surrounded by flood waters, our correspondent says. The United Nations Children's Fund, Unicef,  said up to 2.5 million children had been affected. One official said children and families, many of them still recovering from last year's devastating floods, are in urgent need of help before the situation worsens. More rain has been forecast for the coming days. \\"The situation in Sindh is already serious and there will be more flooding and more problems because of these rains,\\" Arif Mehmood, a meteorology official, is quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. In other developments: Officials in Orissa, India, said at least 61,000 people had been evacuated to safety and relief and rescue operations had begun. Several rivers, including the Mahanadi, are overflowing and flood waters have severed a number of key road links. Some areas had been cut off due to breaches in river banks and embankments and helicopters were the only way to bring food and water to people stranded there, Mr Mohapatra said. Orissa's Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said that the authorities were taking all measures to bring aid to those affected, adding that the state might seek help from central government. Officials said the situation was expected to get better soon as rains had stopped and the water level in the Mahanadi and other rivers had begun to recede. Summary:","output":"There is a lot of water rising in Pakistan and India because of heavy rain and poor drainage systems. This is causing many people to lose their homes, and even some people have died. The United Nations is trying to help, but more rain is expected. Many people are stuck and need food and water to be brought to them by helicopters. The leaders of these countries are trying to help, and they hope the situation will get better soon as the water levels start to go down."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: For how long has Sudan probably not accept Christian worshipers? Options:  A. They just started in 2011  B. not enough information  C. Only ten years before 2011  D.

Reactions of female partners were monitored by London neuroscientists. They were more turned on when their partner was making a cup of coffee. This was compared to their significant others ironing, drilling or sawing. Seven out of 10 women likened receiving a home-made coffee to receiving a gift. Article:","output":"Title: The Secret to a Happier Relationship: Making Coffee for Your Partner Introduction It's no secret that maintaining a healthy and happy relationship requires constant nurturing and effort from both parties involved. But could something as simple as making a cup of coffee for your significant other be the key to a more harmonious connection? According to a recent study conducted on 20 real-life Australian couples, it turns out that coffee might just be the magic ingredient that keeps partners feeling loved and appreciated. The Study The intriguing research was carried out by a team of London neuroscientists who carefully monitored the reactions of female partners when their male significant others performed various household tasks. The selected tasks included ironing, drilling, sawing, and, of course, making a cup of coffee. By observing the responses of the women in these scenarios, the researchers were able to deduce which tasks triggered the most positive reactions. The Findings What the researchers found was truly fascinating. Among the four tasks carried out by the men, making a cup of coffee seemed to elicit the most appreciative reactions from their female partners. Ironing, drilling, and sawing, on the other hand, did not seem to have the same effect on the emotions of the women. Seven out of 10 women in the study reported that receiving a home-made cup of coffee from their partners felt akin to receiving a gift. This finding suggests that the simple act of brewing coffee for your partner can have a profound impact on their overall happiness and sense of appreciation in a relationship. The Possible Explanations But what is it about coffee that makes it the magic potion for a happier partnership? One possible explanation could be attributed to the soothing and pleasurable aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The smell of coffee has long been known to have a calming effect on the human brain and has even been found to reduce stress. Furthermore, the act of making coffee for your partner could serve as a tangible representation of your love and care for their well-being. In this busy world, taking the time to prepare a warm, comforting beverage for someone can provide a sense of comfort and security that strengthens the emotional bond between partners. Lastly, coffee has always been synonymous with socialization and connection. Offering a freshly brewed cup of coffee to your partner can create an opportunity for conversation and bonding, reinforcing the emotional foundation of your relationship. Conclusion The study conducted on Australian couples is a reminder of the power that lies in simple, everyday gestures. Making a cup of coffee for your significant other may seem insignificant, but it could serve as a meaningful act of love and appreciation that strengthens the fabric of your relationship. So, the next time you want to make your partner smile and feel loved, grab a coffee mug and your favorite coffee beans. After all, the key to a happier relationship might just be hidden in that warm, fragrant cup of Joe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on Some Time? is inside the article: Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Her song \\"Death of Samantha\\" was inspired by the incident., can you guess it ?

Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday. The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points including Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems. Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign. The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization. In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of \`\`semi-starvation.'' Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office. The last visitor was then-U.S. Rep.

Question: what the multiple endings of john say about its possible authorship; Suggestion: Synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms are not found in John.","output":"False. The given suggestion does not directly address the question regarding the multiple endings of the Gospel of John and its possible authorship. Instead, the suggestion refers to synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms, which are not related to the endings of John or its authorship. Therefore, the proposed suggestion cannot be considered a correct answer to the question. In order to provide a more suitable answer to the question, it is essential to delve into the context and content of the Gospel of John, specifically its multiple endings and the implications these endings have on the possible authorship of the book. The Gospel of John is distinct from the three synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in that it presents theological and narrative material that is unique to the account. Some scholars argue that the gospel has what appear to be multiple endings, particularly when looking at chapters 20 and 21. The conclusion of chapter 20 suggests a fitting end to the book, yet chapter 21 continues with another ending. Chapter 20 concludes with Jesus’ appearances to Mary Magdalene and his disciples, followed by Thomas' confession of faith. The last two verses of chapter 20 (John 20:30-31) seem to be a fitting closing statement, which reads, \\"Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.\\" However, John 21 follows with an additional post-resurrection appearance and the reinstatement of Peter, concluding with another statement that seems to hint at the purpose and authorship of the gospel (John 21:24-25): \\"This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\\"  These multiple endings have led scholars to propose various theories about the authorship of the Gospel of John. Some argue that the book could have gone through multiple stages of composition or redaction, with additional material being added by different authors or editors over time. Others suggest that the author of the Gospel of John purposefully included multiple endings to emphasize different aspects of Jesus' life and ministry. Considering the previously mentioned elements, a more accurate answer to the question regarding the multiple endings of the Gospel of John and its implications on the possible authorship would involve discussing the various theories proposed by scholars, and analyzing the content and context of the gospel's endings."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: poor quality Product review: The pan is heavy, but that is not the reason why I consider it bad. After my first use of the pan, it got rusty. So I have to return it. A:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product, and there are several reasons for this conclusion. The main factors that contribute to this assessment are the indications of poor quality in both the title and the content of the review, as well as the specific issue of rust after just one use. First, the review title - \\"poor quality\\" - immediately sets a negative tone and suggests that the product may not be up to satisfactory standards. As a potential buyer, it is important to look for well-crafted and reliable products, and a \\"poor quality\\" label would naturally detract from the overall appeal. Secondly, the review addresses the heaviness of the pan. Although the reviewer acknowledges that the pan's weight is not necessarily a negative feature, it is still mentioned in the context of their overall dissatisfaction. As a potential buyer, I would be looking for a balance of quality and ease of use, and the mention of the pan's weight might lead me to consider other options with a lighter design. The most significant factor influencing my decision, however, would be the mention of rust after just one use. Rust development is indicative of poor construction and low-quality materials used in the manufacturing process. Having a rust-prone cooking utensil is both a health concern and a sign that the item would likely not have a long lifespan. For someone in search of a reliable, long-lasting product, this would be a major red flag. Additionally, the reviewer's decision to return the pan serves as further evidence of their dissatisfaction with the product. Consumers generally only return items that have failed to meet their expectations or have proven to be seriously defective. Consequently, the mention of returning the pan would further decrease my interest in purchasing the product. In conclusion, the details provided in the review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product in question. The negative aspects highlighted – poor quality, heaviness, and rust development after just one use – are all factors that raise concerns about the product's durability, reliability, and overall performance. As a potential buyer, these insights would make me more inclined to seek alternative options that have better reviews and fewer reported issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","output":"The sentence \\"Hän piirsi hiekkaan rajan.\\" is in Finnish, which is a Uralic language primarily spoken in Finland and by Finnish people. Finland's neighboring countries, such as Sweden, Estonia, and Norway, are also home to Finnish-speaking populations, as well as in various other countries with Finnish expatriates. Finnish is a member of the Finno-Ugric subfamily of the Uralic languages, which also includes Estonian, Hungarian, and several minority languages spoken in Russia, like Karelian. It's an agglutinative language, meaning that it uses a system of adding various morphemes to words in order to express grammatical relationships between words.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Over the credits, we see numerous magazines and newspaper articles from the 80's, all of which feature Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a major professional wrestling star. We then flash forward twenty years, where Randy \\"The Ram\\" is getting ready for a match in a small, local auditorium on the underground circuit. He interacts with the other wrestlers backstage, most of whom are much younger than he is (Randy is acknowledged to be in his 50's). Ironically, though they are foes inside the ring, outside the wrestlers are all friendly, discussing with each other how they want to perform the \\"act\\" that night, and after the show go drinking together. Randy preps for the match and it's obvious his age has caught up with him; his joints are cracking as he stretches and becomes short-winded easily. After he stretches he puts a small piece of a razor blade in his wrist bandages, in which later he uses to cut himself on the forehead to draw blood, making the match more dramatic for the fans. Afterward, Randy is given a meager payday, as the promoter claims the audience was smaller than expected. Randy's manager then poses a 20th anniversary rematch with his most notable opponent, the Ayatollah, which sold out Madison Square garden in the 80's. Randy agrees, hoping this kind of high-profile match could help him get back to the top.Randy goes home to find he has been locked out of his trailer for not paying his rent. He takes pain medication with a beer and falls asleep in the back of his van. The next day he goes to work to load boxes at a supermarket where he asks his boss if he could have more hours. His boss is very rude to him and makes a snide comment about the cost of tights going up being the reason he needs more hours. Randy laughs it off and continues to ask his boss for more hours but \\"not on the weekends\\". Again his boss makes a snide comment about his other 'profession' being the reason he can't work weekends.That night after work goes to a strip club to visit a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa...

On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them.

And the answer is?","output":"Titania and Oberon are moons of the planet Uranus. Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant that is most notably known for its unusual axis tilt, with its rotational axis inclined about 98 degrees relative to its orbital plane. This unique tilt causes the planet to experience extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing approximately 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness as Uranus orbits the Sun. Titania and Oberon are the largest and most well-known of the 27 known moons orbiting Uranus. These two moons were discovered by the British astronomer Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787. Herschel, who also discovered the planet itself in 1781, named these moons in honor of characters from William Shakespeare's play \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\" Titania represents the queen of the fairies, while Oberon stands for the king of the fairies who are central characters in the play. Titania, the larger of the two moons, has a diameter of approximately 1,578 kilometers (981 miles) and is the eighth largest moon in our solar system. Its surface is composed mainly of water ice, with a mix of rock and an abundance of impact craters, as well as some immense fault lines or fractures that are believed to have formed due to the expansion of its outer ice shell as the underlying warmer layer of ice deformed over time. Oberon, in contrast, is slightly smaller than Titania, with a diameter of about 1,523 kilometers (946 miles). Much like Titania, its surface is mainly composed of water ice, mixed with some rock, and is also marked by a considerable number of impact craters. Oberon exhibits signs of some past geological activity, as it has fewer craters than Titania, suggesting that parts of its surface have been resurfaced at some point in time. Since their discovery, Titania and Oberon have been the subject of several observational studies and exploration missions to better understand their composition, geological history, and relationship to Uranus as well as the broader solar system. The most famous of these missions was the Voyager 2 spacecraft flyby in 1986, which provided close-up images and valuable data on these intriguing moons and their parent planet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique.

Dracula refuses to help, and transforms Mamuwalde into a vampire, whom he names Blacula and imprisons in a sealed coffin. Mamuwalde's wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee), is also imprisoned and dies in captivity. In 1972, the coffin has been purchased as part of an estate by two interior decorators, Bobby McCoy (Ted Harris) and Billy Schaffer (Rick Metzler) and shipped to Los Angeles. Bobby and Billy open the coffin and become Prince Mamuwalde's first victims. At the funeral home where Bobby McCoy's body is laid, Mamuwalde spies on mourning friends Tina Williams (Vonetta McGee), her sister Michelle (Denise Nicholas), and Michelle's boyfriend, Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala), a pathologist for the Los Angeles Police Department.

When she finally recovered, she found herself talking with what seemed to be a French accent: \\"I phoned a friend the other day, and she spent the first ten minutes laughing,\\" Hasnip said at the time. \\"While I have nothing against the French.\\" Hasnip suffered from foreign accent syndrome , a rare condition in which people find themselves speaking their own language Like someone from a foreign country. The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain. The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that. Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent. Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent. Their strangely changed speech only resembles the foreign: accent with which it has a few sounds in common. When an English woman named Annie recently developed foreign accent syndrome after a stroke, she spoke with what seemed to be a Scottish accent.

This rare condition causes individuals to speak their own language as if they have a foreign accent. The syndrome occurs due to damage in several parts of the brain, which leads to the lengthening of certain syllables, mispronunciation of sounds, and changes in the normal pitch of their voice. These changes in speech collectively create the impression of a foreign accent. However, it is important to note that the affected individuals do not acquire a true foreign accent; their altered speech only resembles a foreign accent with which it shares a few sounds in common."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: After witnessing an uncontrollable blaze burn her family's pizzeria to the ground when she was just 11 years old.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Solubility may increase or decrease with temperature; the magnitude of this temperature dependence varies widely among compounds. Notice in particular the curves for NH4NO3 and CaCl2. The dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic (ΔHsoln = +25.7 kJ/mol), whereas the dissolution of calcium chloride is exothermic (ΔHsoln = −68.2 kJ/mol), yet Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\" shows that the solubility of both compounds increases sharply with increasing temperature. In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature. The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books. Chemists are often able to use this information to separate the components of a mixture byfractional crystallization, the separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent. For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH3CO2Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80°C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0°C. According to the temperature curves in Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\", both compounds dissolve in water at 80°C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0°C. Only about 36 g of CH3CO2Na are soluble in 100 g of water at 0°C, however, so approximately 114 g (150 g − 36 g) of Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.

She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.

The mood has changed in a matter of weeks from one of handwringing impotence over Ukraine to one of foreboding. The anxiety is encapsulated in the sudden rush to Moscow by Angela Merkel and François Hollande. To senior figures closely involved in the diplomacy and policymaking over Ukraine, the Franco-German peace bid is less a hopeful sign of a breakthrough than an act of despair. “There’s nothing new in their plan, just an attempt to stop a massacre,” said one senior official. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish foreign minister, said a war between Russia and the west was now quite conceivable. A senior diplomat in Brussels, echoing the broad EU view, said arming the Ukrainians would mean war with Russia, a war that Putin would win. Announcing the surprise mission to Kiev and Moscow, Hollande sounded grave and solemn. The Ukraine crisis, he said, started with differences, which became a conflict, which became a war, and which now risked becoming “total war”. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Danish prime minister and until recently the head of Nato, publicly voiced fears that Putin could expand what is seen as Soviet revisionism to countries now in Nato and the EU. In the Baltics, Putin might risk a little exercise in “hybrid warfare”, he said, just to test how the western alliance would react. That Merkel has gone to Moscow is telling in itself and speaks to the sudden gravity of the situation. The Russian-speaking German chancellor has talked to the German-speaking Putin more than 40 times in the past year as the main western mediator on Ukraine. But until Friday she had never gone to Moscow. Only a few weeks ago she vetoed a summit in Kazakhstan with Putin because she believed there was no point negotiating with someone she no longer trusted. Putin is demanding that a large tract of eastern Ukraine, taken by force by his separatist proxies in recent weeks, be granted internationally licensed autonomy and that a new frontline be recognised as a basis for a putative ceasefire. The parallel might be 1991 in Croatia when the Serbs took a quarter of the country and then consolidated their grip behind lines patrolled by UN peacekeepers. It crippled and destabilised Croatia. European policymakers say this is Putin’s aim in Ukraine. In Croatia the land-grab lasted four years until Zagreb, gradually armed by the Americans and Europeans, quickly routed the Serbs militarily. The big difference then was that the Serbs were stretched by a bigger war next door in Bosnia where eventually Nato bombed them to the negotiating table. That will not happen with the Russians. Arming the Ukrainians, meanwhile, will open up big divisions between the Americans and most Europeans. Putin is playing on those divisions as he plays on splits between the Europeans. He does not need to try very hard. The divisions are ever-present over sanctions. On Monday the EU will impose more sanctions, extending a blacklist of pro-Russia separatists and Russians by 19 names. These penalties are minor. The broader economic sanctions in force against Russian banks and companies are more serious. They lapse in July unless extended by all EU governments. Last year the biggest opponent was Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, whose then foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, now coordinates EU foreign policy. The new leftwing pro-Russia Greek government may be this summer’s problem. The sanctions policy has so far held up, but is showing acute strains. Senior diplomats from EU governments regularly say the sanctions are hurting but are not working because they have not changed Putin’s behaviour. The EU is split in two, with Britain leading the pro-sanctions side and a sizeable group complaining that the punishment has cost the EU an estimated 15% of exports to Russia. Germany is the pivot, the swing power. Putin is increasingly seen as a reckless gambler who calls bluffs and takes risks, and is inscrutable, paranoid and unpredictable. Trying to work out what he wants is guesswork. The Europeans sound scared. Ukraine is a huge problem for Europe, not least the dawning realisation that fixing it will cost tens of billions and will take a very long time. But for Europe it is becoming clear that the real nightmare is not Ukraine, but Putin’s Russia.

A prologue explains the role of the bounty hunter. A wanted criminal named Burch tries to ambush bounty hunter Jim Kipp, but Kipp gets the better of him. Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much. Kipp is immediately attracted to the doctor's daughter, Julie. A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter.  Edwards mistakenly believes Kipp is seeking him for another crime. The townspeople become anxious as the truth about Kipp becomes known. Led by the postmaster, Danvers, they offer Kipp a bribe to leave town.

Seger, but he later succeeded Seger and represented New Jersey in the United States House of Representatives for twenty years, lasting from 1941 until 1961. Canfield is most remembered as the \\"Father of the United States Coast Guard Reserve\\", as he spearheaded the effort to pass the legislation that started the reserve in 1941., A barrister (also known as barrister-at-law or bar-at-law) is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions who works at higher levels of court. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as \\"legal scholars\\"., The United States House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the United States Congress which, along with the Senate, composes the legislature of the United States., A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services., Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east., The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II., New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014., A counsel or a counsellor at law is a person who gives advice and deals with various issues, particularly in legal matters. It is a title often used interchangeably with the title of \\"lawyer\\"., The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: The Browns are an abomination but they're far from the worst team in NFL history The Cleveland Browns are bad. They are very bad. They hover pitifully at the bottom of the uninspiring AFC North with an 0-11 record, and it doesn’t take much imagination to see them going 0-16 this season. Were it not for the Cavaliers’ NBA title and the Indians’ near world championship, the Browns’ misfortune would be chronicled in headlines that prominently include the words “Cleveland” and “woebegone,” “hapless” or “misfortune.” On Sunday, as if to show how bad they really are, in a 24-9 loss to Pittsburgh, the Browns gave up eight sacks, lost one quarterback (more on that later) and couldn’t manage a touchdown even when they had a first down just inches from the goalline. And yet this year’s Browns, as bad as they are, won’t be the worst team in NFL history. Not even close. For Cleveland can still run a functional offense at times. They can score points on occasion and they’ve even come close to winning two games this fall – although one of those was against the Jets. The 2016 Browns will never be as bad as the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They will always have that. The ‘76 Bucs were dreadful. They didn’t score a point until the season’s third game and then after a 17-point uprising in week four, they were shut out again the following week. In fact, they went scoreless in five of their games that year. Unsurprisingly, they were 0-14 and would have easily been 0-16 had the NFL played 16-game seasons back then. Things were so bad, their coach, John McKay, joked: “We can’t win at home and we can’t win on the road; what we need is a neutral site.” Unfortunately for the Bucs there were no international games in 1976 and they were left to be as awful as they could be. But at least the Bucs had the excuse of being an expansion team. Three years later they were in the NFC Championship Game. The Browns might not even be as bad as the 2008 Detroit Lions, who are the NFL’s only 0-16 team. They gave up 517 points that year, which was the second-worst total in league history. Cleveland’s defense is not very good but they’ve managed to hold opponents to just under 30 points a game, meaning they won’t be as awful as the 2008 Lions or even the 1981 Baltimore Colts who allowed 533 points. Those Colts won their first and last games but lost the 14 in between which, come to think of it, is better than the Browns are doing right now. Still, the chances are that history won’t frown on these Browns as much as it does on the 1990 New England Patriots who had the NFL’s worst offense and second worst defense. That team managed to pull out a two-point victory (which was swiftly followed by a sexual harassment scandal) and finished 1-15. It was a miserable enough season that a move to St Louis seemed to be imminent until a local businessman named Robert Kraft stepped in to save the franchise. The Browns aren’t leaving Cleveland. They’ve already done that to their loyal and eternally-patient fans. But ever since the expansion Browns arrived in 1999, they’ve done everything they can to break hearts. Going 0-16 would set a new low ... even if it isn’t the lowest the NFL has ever seen. “It’s bullcrap. We can’t keep doing this and we can’t keep letting our guys get hit.” Yes, it was a bad day for the Browns. One made worse when their rookie quarterback, Cody Kessler, who was supposed to be a reason for Cleveland fans to hope, appeared to have suffered his second concussion this season when he was knocked to the ground by Pittsburgh’s Lawrence Timmons. That outraged the Browns other hope this year: receiver Terrelle Pryor. After the game, Pryor went off to reporters about the team’s offensive line, which has turned the team’s quarterback position into a turnstile. There’s a decent chance Kessler will miss the season, meaning he will avoid the disaster the Browns campaign has become. Pryor, who has 51 catches for 627 yards this year and four touchdowns, has the right to criticize his team-mates. He has performed. He also has revived his career and is a free agent at season’s end – meaning he will probably escape the mess soon enough. Vikings Linval Joseph absolutely destroys Fox sound guy during pregame intros https://t.co/4C3Afhj3tU The worst part about this is collision is you can see it happening. Everyone in the stadium can see it happening. Everyone but this poor network sound technician and the Minnesota Vikings who trampled him. 12. The number of missed extra points on Sunday, breaking the previous record of 10. After much debate about the usefulness of the extra point, the NFL moved the spot from which it would be kicked from the two to the 15. The idea was that by moving the kick back, extra points would be more exciting and the league would be more exciting too. Now, in Week 11 of the most unpopular NFL season in recent memory, we get overwhelmed by kicking imperfection. Certainly, it was windy in some NFL stadiums on Sunday. Especially New Jersey’s Met Life Stadium where New York’s Robbie Gould missed two extra points and Chicago’s Connor Barth failed on one attempt. Cincinnati’s Mike Nugent could blame the cold for his two misses. New England’s Stephen Gostkowski and San Francisco’s Phil Dawson could say it was the rain in Santa Clara that prompted their misses. But Jacksonville’s Jason Myers and Minnesota’s Kai Forbath missed indoors. At least Seattle’s Steven Hauschka and Detroit’s Matt Prater can say their attempts were blocked … As if that justifies everything. There was a time, earlier this year, when Dak Prescott was seen as a fragile placeholder for Tony Romo in the Cowboys offense. Though Dallas’s coaches seemed happy with the rookie’s training camp, he wasn’t supposed to actually lead the Cowboys to the playoffs. His first few games as the team’s starter reflected that as he played carefully and conservatively, trying not to make many mistakes. Now that the team is officially his, he has been given more and more freedom. Sunday he completed 27-of-36 passes for 301 and three touchdowns against no interceptions. It was his second straight 300-yard passing game. More importantly, he has 14 touchdowns and only two interceptions for the 9-1 Cowboys. Oh, and he picks up his litter. Shame on you for not choosing him when you had the chance on draft night. – The Vikings ended their four-game losing streak with two length-of-the-field returns to beat Arizona 30-24. Xavier Rhodes picked off a Carson Palmer pass at the goal line and ran 100 yards for a second quarter touchdown. Then in the fourth quarter, Cordarrelle Patterson took a kickoff 104 yards for a score. – Kansas City lost a costly game they probably did not expect to drop when they went down 19-17 at home to Tampa Bay. Bucs quarterback Jameis Winson has been responsible for a touchdown in every one of his 26 NFL games. On Sunday, he threw for 331 yards and a touchdown. – The New York Giants won a game they needed to keep up with Dallas when the out-fought the Bears 22-16 at the Meadowlands. After a flat start, the Giants defense overwhelmed Chicago and quarterback Jay Cutler in the second half. Cutler’s last-chance desperation pass was intercepted ending another disappointing game for him. Eli Manning threw for two touchdowns. – Indianapolis beat Tennessee for the 11th straight time as Andrew Luck threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns. It was a game the Colts desperately needed to win to move to 5-5, tying them with the Titans for second in the AFC South and putting them closer to the 6-3 Houston Texans who play in Mexico City on Monday night. – Detroit continue to surprise, winning for the fifth time in six games and moving to 6-4 with a 26-19 victory over Jacksonville. Matthew Stafford continued his strong run with 278 yards passing. The Lions also returned a punt and interception for touchdowns. – Russell Wilson became the first quarterback in Seahawks history to catch a touchdown pass when receiver Doug Baldwin hit him with a 15-yard scoring throw in Seattle’s 26-15 win over the Eagles. - Miami scored two touchdowns in the final two minutes to ruin Jared Goff’s first NFL start as the Dolphins beat the Rams 14-10. Goff, the top pick in last spring’s draft, was 17-of-31 for 134 yards and no touchdowns or interceptions on a rainy afternoon in Los Angeles. - Patriots quarterback Tom Brady played near his San Francisco Bay area home for the first time in his pro career and threw four touchdowns in the rain as New England beat the 49ers 30-17. Summary:","output":"The Cleveland Browns are not doing very well in the NFL and have not won any games this season. They lost another game on Sunday to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Even though they are playing badly, they are not the worst team in NFL history. That title goes to the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who also lost all their games that year.

Life would be easier. However, education cannot promise all wishes, dreams, and desires.Society must reject the foolish idea that a college education's main purpose is to satisfy our desires and secure success.Like most challenging things, education is a gamble   in which results depend entirely on people's ability to look past their wants to see the realism and reason behind their wants. For instance, my first year of college, I took a sociology class.In class, we were taught that Third World countries were poor.We learned that our quality of life would be almost impossible for an average person in those countries.I began to examine my own desire to be rich.To always go after money felt selfish when knowing others had none at all.Learning about other society's financial situations forced me to look beyond what I wanted. Through the process of education, everything once desired is tested.Wanting something no longer is enough; it's more important to examine why we want it and whether we really want it.When my desire for money changed, everything changed.I stopped longing for money-driven careers and stopped valuing the people who had them.I began to examine the things I purchased and my reason for wanting them.

Question: suppose More mass is burned by the red giant happens, how will it affect a SMALLER white dwarf star.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the steps involved in the process: 1. A red giant burns more mass: It means the red giant will have a higher rate of nuclear fusion in its core, producing more energy. 2. This mass creates high core temperatures: The higher mass burning will result in higher core temperatures. 3. The mass decreases: As more mass is burnt, the overall mass of the red giant will decrease. 4. The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center: As the mass decreases, there will be a point where the red giant cannot sustain fusion of carbon and oxygen in its core. 5. The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers: At this stage, the star's gravity will be weaker due to the decrease in mass, and the outer layers will not be held as tightly. 6. The layers break away: Eventually, the outer layers will be expelled, leaving behind only the inner core. 7. Only the inner core remains: Once the outer layers have dispersed, what remains is the inner core, which is known as a white dwarf. Now, let's consider the effect on a smaller white dwarf star if a red giant burns more mass: A smaller white dwarf star is already the final stage of stellar evolution for a low or medium mass star. Assuming the two stars are not interacting or in a binary system, the red giant burning more mass will not directly affect the smaller white dwarf star. However, the white dwarf might be indirectly affected by the increased radiation emitted by the red giant as it burns more mass, causing changes to the white dwarf's outer layers or affecting the surrounding material. This interaction, however, depends on the distance and position between the two stars. Given this analysis, the answer to the question is: C: no effect The red giant burning more mass will not have a direct and significant effect on a smaller, non-interacting white dwarf star. Indirect effects, if any, will depend on the distance and relative positions of the two stars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Like many others around him, Dong Wenxian sported a bandage around his head and appeared motionless in bed. \\"He's sleeping -- though his condition isn't stable yet,\\" his daughter Dong Huixian told CNN. \\"There's still metal in his skull -- but he's already the lucky one.\\" The elder Dong is one of more than 140 people injured in a deadly attack Saturday night when ten knife-wielding assailants stormed the Kunming Railway Station in southwestern China, seemingly hacking at anyone in sight and killing at least 29 people. The U.S. State Department has condemned the attack, calling it a \\"horrific, senseless act of violence\\" in a statement. Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to \\"severely punish the terrorists in accordance with the law.\\" Authorities said police shot four perpetrators dead on the scene and captured a wounded female suspect. They have also linked the rampage to separatists from the country's far western Xinjiang region, where tensions between Han Chinese and the largely Muslim Uyghurs have sometimes turned violent.

Dong, a 50-year-old street vendor from the countryside, was trying to buy a train ticket home to visit his sick mother when he was hacked. \\"His whole face was covered in blood,\\" his wife described the sight greeting the family at the hospital, which has received most of the people injured in the attack. \\"We're now waiting for him to go through surgery,\\" said Huixian, the 17-year-old daughter. \\"But those with even more severe injuries need to be operated on first.\\" \\"Those Xinjiang people are just horrible and I hate their guts,\\" she added. A spate of violent incidents has rocked restive Xinjiang in recent months. Only two weeks ago, police announced the death of 11 terrorists in a foiled attack in Aksu Prefecture. Last October, a jeep carrying a Uyghur family plowed into crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing, killing two tourists and injuring 40. Authorities have responded by intensifying their crackdown on suspected Islamic separatists, including the arrest last month of prominent Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti. The killings in Kunming -- a city of more than six million residents, known for its mild weather and leisurely pace -- shocked the nation and occurred at a particularly sensitive time as Chinese lawmakers are set to start their annual session Wednesday to hear the first government work report under President Xi's leadership. Far away from Beijing but a short drive from Dong's hospital is a small, nameless street in front of the massive Kunming Railway Station. Lined with supermarkets, restaurants and a post office, it was again bustling with passengers hauling luggage Sunday afternoon, the blood stains in the area already washed away. Uniformed police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops patrolling the station's sprawling ground regularly passed the street on foot and in cars. Food sellers on the sidewalk exchanged details they had seen or heard about the carnage. READ MORE: China's train station killings described as a terrorist attack.

In social media, some users' attempts to reflect on the root causes -- including waves of Han migration into Xinjiang and the treatment of Uyghurs in their native land -- to the latest terror were quickly drowned out by the overwhelming sound of fury. Chang, the shop owner, admitted he'd never given much thought to Xinjiang separatists.

Details of her life are relatively unknown and she is believed to have perished from overwork under the Khmer Rouge regime shortly after giving birth to her son.  - Tith Vichara Dany was a widely popular actress in Cambodia who most likely made her debut in 1967. She starred in a majority of films which include \\"Thavory Meas Bong\\", \\"Tep Sodachan\\", and \\"Sovann Pancha\\" during the nation's golden age of cinema. She is often paired on screen with fellow actor Kong Sam-Oeurn. Other notable actors she started with are Chea Yuthorn and \\"Vann Vannak\\". In only a span of at least seven years she is credited to have starred in over one hundred films. Details of her life are relatively unknown and is believed to have perished shortly after the Khmer Rouge regime.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Vann Vannak was a popular actor in Cambodia during the late 1960s until 1975. Despite his talents, producers usually favored casting his rivals Kong Som Oeurn or Chea Yuthorn in their movies. Due to their lack of support, Vann Vannak starred in considerably fewer films when compared to his rivals. Nevertheless, he was pivotal in movies such as \\"Sovann Pancha\\", \\"Neang Kakey\\", and \\"Champa Meas\\" all of which had Vichara Dany as the female lead. To increase his presence in the industry he created his own production company known as Pisnoka in 1970 which made eight films casting himself as the male lead in all of them.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person Lennon become involved with in a protest? , can you please find it?   In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response...

While Ainsley is urinating, Sampson falls silent; Ainsley finds Sampson killed. He grabs his harpoon, only to be murdered by a monstrous being. During a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, a group of friends including Ben and his best friend Marcus decide to go on a haunted swamp tour. They find the tour closed because the guide, Rev. Zombie, was sued for negligence. Rev. Zombie suggests they try a place farther down the street, owned by the over-the-top, inexperienced tour guide Shawn. Marcus decides to leave but changes his mind upon seeing two topless girls: Misty, a ditzy porn star, and Jenna, a bossy, boastful, up-and-coming actress. Their sleazy director, Doug Shapiro, is also present. Ben pays for himself and Marcus and Shawn leads them to his tour bus, where the other tourists, Jim and Shannon Permatteo, a Minnesota married couple, and the quiet, hot-tempered Marybeth are waiting. Shawn does not know what he is doing, which the others realize as they arrive at the swamp. Shapiro has Misty and Jenna strip down and film a scene for Bayou Beavers as everyone boards the boat, while a homeless swamp-dweller named Jack Cracker warns them away from the swamp. Shawn leads them through swamplands and past abandoned houses, including one where Victor Crowley, a deformed creature, lived. The boat hits a rock and begins sinking, leaving them stranded. As the crew walks through the woods, they encounter the shabby Crowley house, and Marybeth shares the legend of Victor Crowley. Victor was a deformed child with a rare disease, bullied by other kids and was kept hidden by his father, Thomas Crowley. One night a group of mean teenagers stumbled across the house and threw fireworks at it to scare Victor. The house began burning, and Thomas returned, causing the teens to flee. Victor was killed when Thomas accidentally hit him in the face with a hatchet while trying to break down the door.

The group is disturbed by the story but tries to focus on finding a way to escape the swamp. As they make their way deeper into the swamp, they start to realize that the legend of Victor Crowley might be true. They hear strange noises and catch glimpses of a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows. The group becomes increasingly uneasy, but they have no choice but to push forward in hopes of finding a way out. As they continue on their journey, they come across the gruesome remains of Sampson and Ainsley, confirming their worst fears. It becomes obvious that the monstrous being that killed the father and son is none other than Victor Crowley himself. The group, now terrified, decides to split up to cover more ground and hopefully find a way out of the swamp faster. Ben and Marcus stick together, while Jim and Shannon, Misty and Jenna, and Marybeth go in separate directions. As they explore, they find themselves hunted by Victor Crowley, who is relentless in his pursuit to kill anyone who enters his domain. One by one, the members of the group become victims of Victor Crowley. Misty and Jenna are brutally murdered while filming their scene for Bayou Beavers. Jim and Shannon are ambushed, and despite their best efforts to escape, they fall to the hands of the vengeful spirit. Doug Shapiro, in his quest for profit, is also killed by Victor Crowley after he stumbles upon his location while filming the girls. Ben, Marcus, and Marybeth, who are the remaining members of the group, decide to band together to find a way out and try to fight against Victor Crowley. They realize that they need to learn more about the legend to see if there is a way to defeat him or understand why he continues to haunt the swamp. The trio manages to find more information about Victor Crowley and his father, Thomas Crowley. It turns out that after Thomas accidentally killed his son, he was overcome with grief and desperation. He sought the help of a local voodoo practitioner to bring Victor back to life. Instead, the ritual cursed Victor, creating an immortal being filled with rage, forever trapped in the swamp. Armed with this new knowledge, Ben, Marcus, and Marybeth devise a plan to confront Victor Crowley and put an end to the nightmare once and for all. They lure him into a trap, managing to incapacitate him temporarily. However, as Victor is seemingly defeated, he rises once again, proving his immortality. At this point, the group understands that the only way to stop the rampage is to leave Victor's swamp and never return. Their numbers significantly reduced, and having lost friends and loved ones to the hands of Victor Crowley, Ben, Marcus, and Marybeth finally escape the haunted swamp. They are left to ponder the tragic story of Victor Crowley and the terrible fate that befell them all, realizing the importance of understanding local legends and respecting the histories and territories which they visit. In the end, the movie \\"Hatchet\\" serves as a cautionary tale, reminding viewers of the consequences of treading into unknown territories, especially when they are haunted by vengeful spirits with a thirst for blood. It also explores themes of vengeance, the power of local legends, and the resilience of the human spirit when confronted with seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.

Obama: U.S. 'a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws;' blasts Arizona law Saying the United States \\"must remain a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws,\\" President Obama called today for changes to a \\"broken\\" immigration system and condemned a new Arizona law requiring migrants to carry documentation. \\"Our failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others,\\" Obama said during a naturalization ceremony for two dozen new U.S. citizens, all of them members of the military. The Arizona law -- described here by our sister paper, The Arizona Republic -- requires migrants to produce papers when asked by law enforcement officials. Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill today, reports our colleague John Fritze in the OnPolitics blog. The law threatens to \\"undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe,\\" said Obama, who has asked his Justice Department to investigate possible civil rights implications. In Washington, Senate Democrats and Republicans are working on a compromise immigration bill, and Obama said he would try and assist those efforts. He called for a \\"comprehensive\\" law, which includes tighter security at the border as well as a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are already here. \\"Passions are great and disagreements run deep,\\" Obama said. \\"Yet surely we can all agree that when 11 million people in our country are living here illegally, outside the system, that's unacceptable. The American people demand and deserve a solution.\\" Obama spoke after the swearing-in of the nation's newest citizens, including immigrants from China, Ethiopia, Mexico and Papua New Guinea. Obama congratulated his guests for renewing \\"the spirit of possibility\\" and \\"the very essence of the country that we all love.\\" Obama also presented Sgt.

Biography of Sergeant Ledum Ndaanee, U.S. Marine Corps (E-5), recipient of the Outstanding American by Choice recognition: Sergeant (Sgt.) Ledum D. Ndaanee was born in Nigeria on May 2, 1982. At the age of 16, he moved to the United States with his family, settling in Richmond, Va. After attending a local community college, Sgt. Ndaanee had his heart set on serving his new country by joining the U.S. Marine Corps. He enlisted in September 2004. Sgt. Ndaanee deployed to Iraq on two separate occasions with the 1st Battalion, 2d Marines in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On August 4, 2007, while assigned as a turret gunner conducting combat operations, he suffered a concussion and traumatic brain injury as the result of an improvised explosive device. While recovering from his injuries at Wounded Warrior Battalion-East in Camp Lejeune, NC, Sgt. Ndaanee played a vital role in the recovery process of his fellow Marines and Sailors. He was instrumental in encouraging others to overcome their injuries by serving as a mentor. After recovering from his wounds, Sgt. Ndaanee achieved an important milestone in his life by becoming a U.S. citizen in November 2007. Sgt. Ndaanee is currently serving as the non-commissioned Officer-in-Charge of the Warrior Athlete Reconditioning (WAR) Program's Strength and Conditioning Team and is also a member of the aquatics team within Wounded Warrior Battalion-East. Over the course of his military career, Sgt. Ndaanee has been recognized with several honors including the Good Conduct Medal, Purple Heart Combat Action Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.

Lancashire mill-girls Jenny Hawthorne and Mary Hollins go on holiday to Blackpool during the annual wakes week in their hometown of Hindle.  They run into Alan Jeffcote, the son of the owner of the mill in which they work, who has also traveled to Blackpool with a group of friends while his fiancée is detained on business in London.  Jenny and Alan hit it off immediately, and he persuades her to leave Blackpool to spend the week with him at Llandudno in North Wales.  To cover her tracks, Jenny leaves a postcard with Mary, asking her to send it to her parents (Edmund Gwenn and Sybil Thorndike) later in the week.  She and Alan leave their friends and set off for Wales. Shortly afterwards, Mary is involved in a serious road accident and is killed.  Her possessions are returned to Hindle and the unmailed postcard is found in her luggage.  Jenny's parents are already suspicious and concerned by the fact that Jenny has not returned to Hindle as they would have expected in view of such a tragic turn to her holiday, and the discovery of the postcard increases their fears.  Jenny returns at the end of the week.  Her parents ask about her holiday, and allow her to dig a hole for herself as her fictitious account shows she is unaware of Mary's death and has clearly not spent the week in Blackpool.

Answer based on context: The Steelers traveled to Chicago to take on the Bears. In the first quarter, the Bears scored first when Jordan Howard ran for a 3-yard touchdown to take a 7-0 lead for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Steelers managed to tie it up at 7-7 when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 7-yard pass. The Bears moved ahead by double digits later on when Mike Glennon found Adam Shaheen on a 2-yard pass to make it 14-7. This would be followed up by Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal to make it 17-7 at halftime. After the break, the Steelers got back to work and came within 3 as Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 17-14. They would tie the game up in the fourth quarter when Chris Boswell nailed a 32-yard field goal. The Steelers then tried their hand at coming back for the win later on in the quarter, but Roethlisberger was sacked in Bears territory, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Bears got the ball. They would win it by way of Howard's 19-yard run for a touchdown and the final score 23-17. With the loss and 9-game regular season winning streak snapped, the Steelers dropped to 2-1 and with the Ravens' loss to the Jaguars moved into a tie on top of the AFC North.

As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Goal: Protect neck from sun. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"Your question does not list specific methods, so I will provide insights on different methods to protect your neck from the sun and analyze which are more reasonable. 1. Wear a wide-brimmed hat: This method is quite effective as the wide brim provides good shade for your neck and face. It also keeps your head cool, which is a bonus during hot temperatures. Moreover, they are available in various styles and materials, allowing you to choose one that matches your preferences and fashion sense. This is a very reasonable and practical method to protect your neck from sun exposure. 2. Applying sunscreen: Sunscreens with a high SPF (Sun Protection Factor) provide sufficient protection against UVA and UVB rays. It would help if you applied sunscreen on your neck and other exposed body parts. Although sunscreen is effective, you may need to reapply it periodically, especially after sweating or swimming. This method may be less favorable than wearing a hat, as it might require more maintenance and leaves room for error if it is not applied evenly or adequately. 3. Sports or outdoor neck gaiters with UV protection: A UV-protective neck gaiter offers excellent sun protection. It's versatile and can be worn in various ways, ensuring that your neck remains covered from sun rays. Additionally, it can be used to protect your face during outdoor activities like biking, hiking, or jogging. Therefore, outdoor neck gaiters are a reasonable and effective method. 4. Using sun protective clothing: There are specially designed clothes, including shirts and jackets, with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) that shields your skin from harmful rays. These garments usually offer protection for several body parts, including your neck. Investing in sun-protective clothing might be a reasonable choice depending on your specific needs and the outdoor activities you engage in. 5. Finding shade when possible: Staying in the shade when you're outdoors is an excellent way to minimize sun damage. However, this method might not be feasible in all cases, especially during long outdoor excursions or when shade isn't readily available. 6. Using an umbrella: Carrying a portable umbrella can help protect your neck from the sun. However, this method may not be practical during some activities, and it can be cumbersome to carry around an umbrella during outdoor activities. Considering the various methods discussed above, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and using a UV-protective neck gaiter appear to be the most reasonable and effective options for protecting your neck from the sun. These methods provide good coverage without significant inconveniences and are suitable for most outdoor activities. In addition, by combining these methods with sunscreen for extra protection, you can further shield yourself from the sun's harmful rays."},{"instruction":"Question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence.

The three countries in the South Caucasus were once part of the Soviet Union, but after its break-up in 1991, they gained independence. Although people there now enjoy greater social freedoms than ever before, there is a divide between how men and women are treated. Many women, despite being old enough to vote, feel society will look down on them if they go out late in the evenings. As a woman from Azerbaijan, I grew up seeing the women around me choosing to stay in during the evenings. But people who range from their 20s all the way to their 60s have a new approach to this now. I know many women who defy the stereotypes and will go out at night, not only to dance at night clubs, but also to for a walk, or enjoy the beauty of the lights of night-time Baku. Of course, Western influences through education or increased tourism have begun to permeate these countries with music venues, bars and nightclubs becoming more prolific.  And as the number of women working in the region increases, so does their spending power - and their desire for somewhere to spend it. The proportion of women employed in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia increased slightly between 2006 and 2011, according to the World Bank. Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia But for others, embracing this new lifestyle means getting a reputation as a \\"good-time girl and being ostracised by neighbours and families. They will share their pictures on social media, but take steps to ensure they remain anonymous. Others, however, want the whole world to know just what a a good time they are having. \\"I do go out at night. When everyone else in the city falls asleep, a new crowd takes over Yerevan and the nightlife begins. So far I haven't faced any criticism; in fact I feel like part of a community. \\"Every year I notice an increase in the number of women going out. I think one reason is because young women are becoming financially independent and more and more women are making their own choices regardless of public opinion. Also, there is a new generation of young women who don't concede to the archaic concept of reputation; to be a so-called \\"good-time girl\\". \\"Women who fear the opinions of others or their neighbours keep their personal lives a secret.\\" \\"I may go to a club or go for a walk with the people I know and trust, but I worry this might be misunderstood. There are some people who say 'if it is late, then this is bad', without checking where and who you are out with. Every Armenian girl who wants to live in an unassuming way should consider public opinion of course. But now these kind of stereotypes are disappearing - you can stay out until 23:00 local time. \\"I try to be at home at 22:30. If I come home late, my parents don't like it, and I know the neighbours will grumble. This could then affect my future life and reputation. I know I am not doing anything wrong, but I need to adapt to the circumstances. \\"Sometimes I go to karaoke clubs with my friends. There are many discos in Armenia, though these have not been easily accepted by society. People say a 'normal' girl would not go to these clubs. The situation is worse outside Yerevan. For example, in the second biggest city, Gyumri, there are no entertainment centres open at night because no-one goes. \\"But karaoke is seen to be something a bit more acceptable; you can dance, sing and have fun, and people won't call you names. \\"The situation may change, but it won't be easy - it might take 50 years at least.\\" \\"I have a master's degree in education and I work for a hospital in the capital city Baku. \\"I don't think men or women should have a night life. It's not a healthy form of entertainment, and sleeping at night is very important. Also they drink alcohol in night clubs. I think people who drink alcohol are not thinking straight. \\"For me, women's freedom is not about going on a night out. A woman should only think about getting educated, to be independent financially and to be confident enough to speak her own mind. I don't go on nights out and I have never been. Nobody in my close family goes clubbing. \\"I have never been subject to any restrictions imposed by my family; I have had no interest in going to clubs. If I wanted to, I could go. I do sport after work, or I meet my friends, or I visit my relatives.  When  I go out with my friends, first we go to a cafe to have lunch, then we go for a walk in the city. \\"I spend my holidays in foreign countries like Russia, Turkey and Iran. I also don't go clubbing in countries I visit. I'm interested in the culture and history of foreign countries, so I visit museums and libraries there.\\" \\"I go on nights out as well as evening concerts and night clubs. \\"I think a woman should have time to go out and have fun in order to help her to get rid of the stress of her workload, the negative feelings and the aggression of the week, and also to get know new people. Otherwise this anger affects other people. \\"Everyone should go to popular concerts at least five times a year. \\"Let's consider that a woman stays at home, but a man goes to tea houses, clubs and so on. Does it mean that only men have the right to have fun? If so, let them change the name of Azerbaijan to 'the Male Republic of Azerbaijan'. \\"The people who think that a woman should stay at home have been conditioned by their families. But some of the women cannot go out, because of lack of money, or safety or they want to be  a 'good girl' so they can get married. \\"My family used to think like this, but I have changed them. If you have a love of life, you try to resist these restrictions. \\"I'm not 18 anymore.\\" \\"I meet family members and friends on Fridays after work and on Saturdays as well. We go out to restaurants first, then go clubbing. We don't go out every week, but it is mostly how we spend our weekends. \\"I'm the mother of a young daughter, so she stays with her grandmother when I go out to get a bit of time for myself. \\"I don't hear any kind of criticism from the older generation or religious people. But it hasn't always been like this. In the 1990s there were no night clubs: we had war and poverty. But at the end of the 1990s jazz clubs were established where we had discos and house parties. Generally, Georgian people like to eat, dance and have fun.\\" \\"I spend my spare time with my friends, I don't like to stay at home. We go to the cinema, or if we know there is any kind of an event on, we go there. The only restriction I have from my parents is to be at home by midnight. Also they want to know who I'm going out with, and where. I think this comes from outside opinion as I'm divorced and have a baby. \\"I don't want to have any conflict with my family as I have to live with them. But I think everyone should go out and have fun. My mother is very modern, for example, I have a tattoo and she likes it very much. But her character is different, she doesn't like to have fun, she prefers to stay at home. \\"I often go on nights out. I have many friends, and I go out for a birthday parties often. We go to clubs if there is any interesting event on. If it is birthday party we do everything in moderation, like drinking, dancing and having fun. Sometimes very interesting events start very late.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research.

Half awake, the 55 people inside watched the morning sun climb over the white sands of the Sonora Desert. They arrived in Phoenix at noon â which is never a good time to arrive in Phoenix. Stepping out of the bus into 90-degree heat, they marched in circles in front of the copper-domed Arizona State Capitol. Latino men and women struck Korean janggu drums, and Korean American adults and kids carried tall placards with messages in Spanish: LegalizaciÃ³n Ahora! L.A. had arrived in the Valley of the Sun. The bus riders crossed the desert Sunday to protest the Arizona right's latest assault on democracy, a new law that gives Arizona law enforcement a mandate to demand immigration papers from anyone they \\"reasonably\\" suspect could be an illegal immigrant. \\"This affects all of us, everywhere,\\" said Hyun Joo Lee of the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium, one of several organizations represented on the L.A.-to-Phoenix ride. \\"It's about uplifting the values that make this country great.\\" Court challenges are inevitable. But if Arizona's SB 1070 is allowed to go into effect it will suddenly be dangerous to look or sound like an indocumentado in Arizona. Popsicle vendors, beware. Mestizos in blue jeans, look out. Grandmothers with thick accents â silencio! Conceived by the Arizona far right, SB 1070 has already accomplished something truly remarkable. It has united cosmopolitan, left-leaning Angelenos with libertarian, right-leaning Arizonans, throwing them together under a big tent of pro-civil rights, populist anger. \\"I left the Marines in December, and I come home to this,\\" said retired Sgt. Alejandro Salazar, a 26-year-old Mexican American from Phoenix, who arrived at the Sunday rally with wife â a Mexican born, legal U.S. resident â and a bright-red Marine Corps flag draped over his shoulder. Sgt. Salazar served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and in 2008 he voted for Sen. John McCain for president. He finds SB 1070 deeply insulting. Marines can be tough-looking guys, but out of uniform, Salazar told me, he's just another tough-looking Latino. \\"I look like I'm illegal,\\" he said. \\"If you drive a car with a [sound] system, or with rims, you're going to get stopped.\\" Don Sanders, a 65-year-old retiree from Ahwatukee, which he calls \\"the Pacific Palisades of Phoenix,\\" was angry enough to come to his first ever immigrant-rights rally.

Article: Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Hundreds of infants and toddlers have died after accidentally being left in the car. This simple trick could help you never forget that your child is in the back seat. VPC      Cobb County police investigate an SUV where a toddler died June 18, 2014, near Marietta, Ga., when the father forgot to drop his child off at day care and went to work. Justin Ross Harris, 33, was being held without bond on a felony murder charge. (Photo: Ben Gray, AP)      An average of 38 children have died in hot cars each year in the USA since 1998.            And many of these incidents could have been prevented. One simple way to make that happen: leave something you need in the back seat.      If you are driving a child, after you put them in a back seat — in a car seat, booster or buckled in with a seat belt — put your left shoe back there, too.      This year, according to the Department of Geosciences at San Francisco State University, 13 children have died after being left in cars, and the summer has just started. Last year 44 children died after being left in hot cars.The heat and holidays give more reason to find a way to prevent more deaths from occurring.      The results of a recent survey, published on the SafeKids.org website stated that:      • 14% of parents have intentionally left their children in a parked car.      • 11% of parents admit to forgetting their child in a car.      • Nearly 1 in 4 parents of a child younger than 3 has forgotten the child in a car.      • Dads are nearly three times more likely than moms to leave a child in a parked car.      Not all deaths were caused because people forgot. Some parents believe cracking the window will make the car cool enough. About 6% of the people in the Public Opinion Strategies survey cited above thought it was OK to let a child stay in a parked, locked vehicle for longer than 15 minutes.      Some deaths are caused because kids get into cars, are trapped and die before anyone discovers them.      Still, a little more than half of all child heat stroke deaths in cars were caused because a parent forgot their child was in the car. The parent is distracted, preoccupied or running on autopilot, like many busy parents of babies and toddlers. The child falls asleep. The parent gets out of the car and leaves the baby behind.      MONDAY: Ga. boy's mom also researched hot-car deaths, police say      SATURDAY: Father researched child deaths in hot cars, warrants show      Often the death comes when a parent breaks a routine, safety experts say.      For Reginald McKinnon of Cape Coral, Fla., it was picking up his daughter Payton from day care and taking her to the doctor. After the appointment he put her in the rear-facing car seat in the back seat and headed back to work.      He spent the day there not realizing his 17-month-old was still in the back seat. When he opened the door to his SUV to go home, Payton was dead, still strapped into her seat.      McKinnon was sentenced to five years of probation and community service for Payton's March 2010 death. He is dedicated to honoring Payton's memory by educating parents and friends about the risk of hyperthermia when children are left in cars.      In Phoenix, Daniel Bryant Gray, 33, was sentenced June 20 to four years in prison followed with seven years probation after he left his 3-month-old son, Jamison, last year in a car parked outside a bar where Gray worked.      JUNE 25: Police press murder case in Ga. toddler's hot-car death      JUNE 20: Fla. father arrested after daughter dies in hot car      The day before in Murfreesboro, Tenn., Samantha Harper pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted aggravated child neglect in the hot-car deaths of her two 2-year-old, Savannah Marise, and 3-year-old, Daniel Marise. She was sentenced to 16 years in jail and will have to serve eight years before being eligible for probation.      The same day in Marietta, Ga., Justin Ross Harris, 33, was booked on murder charges after he told investigators that he forgot to drop his son at day care and went to work instead. On his drive home, he discovered that his 22-month-old son, Cooper, had died in the back seat.      And Steven Lillie, 31, was arrested June 20, four days after his 9-month-old daughter, Anna Marie Lillie, died after being left in a hot pickup truck in Rockledge, Fla.      What will work is some kind of system that won't fail to remind a person a child is in the back seat.      In 2012 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published a report, \\"Reducing the Potential for Heat Stroke to Children in Parked Motor Vehicles: Evaluation of Reminder Technology.\\" It found reminder and detection devices to be unreliable and required too much effort from caregivers for them to operate.      Putting something on the back seat as a reminder isn't a new idea. Safety groups have been pushing it for years telling people to put something you will need when you reach your destination.      You may not always have your laptop, your purse, or your cellphone. But you do always have a shoe.      So when you put your kid in the back, put your left shoe back there, too.

(AP) — A Louisiana police officer rescued a 5-week-old baby locked for more than a half hour inside a sweltering car on a summer day after someone noticed the child unconscious in the back seat and called 911, authorities said.      The woman told police she had just dropped off her other child and forgot the baby was in the back seat in the strip mall parking lot. Temperatures outside reached above 90 degrees on Tuesday. The temperature inside the car was about 130 degrees. The baby has made a full recovery.      The mother of the infant, Gloria Elzy, 44, of Slidell, Louisiana, was in custody Wednesday on a charge of second-degree cruelty to juveniles and a warrant for failure to appear for an unrelated case.      The age of Elzy's older child is not known but both children are now with Child Protective Services, which has opened an investigation into the incident.      \\"With all the media attention on this type of issue, it's mindboggling to me that someone can leave, better yet, forget, about a child inside of a vehicle,\\" Slidell Police Chief Randy Smith said.      Police said someone reported seeing an unresponsive child in a car around 5 p.m. on Tuesday and called 911. When Officer Joshua Funck arrived, he used a device to unlock the vehicle and removed the infant, who was sweating profusely. The child was rushed to an area hospital, revived and has since made a full recovery, Seuzeneau said.      \\"If the citizen wouldn't have immediately called Slidell Police, and Officer Funck didn't act quickly, the baby would not have survived,\\" Smith said. \\"They are both heroes in my book.\\"      Slidell Police Detective Daniel M. Seuzeneau said in a news release Wednesday that bond had not been set for Elzy and he did not know if she was represented by an attorney. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"An average of 38 children have died in hot cars each year in the USA since 1998, and many of these incidents could have been prevented.

Translate \\"Impacto ambiental en Lleida\\" from Spanish to English.","output":"\\"Impacto ambiental en Lleida\\" can be translated to English as \\"Environmental impact in Lleida.\\" Lleida is a city in the Catalonia region of Spain. The phrase refers to the effects that human activities, industry, and development have on the natural environment and ecosystems in and around Lleida. Different factors may contribute to the environmental impact in Lleida. These factors include but are not limited to: 1. Industrial pollution: Industries located in Lleida may release pollutants into the air, water, and soil. Examples include manufacturing plants, chemical industries, and food processing plants. Emissions from these industries may lead to respiratory issues, water contamination, and damage to the region's biodiversity. 2. Urbanization: As Lleida continues to develop and grow, there may be an increase in urban sprawl and the expansion of built-up areas. This leads to habitat fragmentation, deforestation, and loss of green spaces. Urban heat island effects may also become more pronounced, causing an increase in ambient temperatures in the city. 3. Agriculture and livestock production: Lleida is an important agricultural region in Catalonia, with a heavy focus on fruit, vegetable, and cereal production, as well as livestock farming. Intensive agricultural practices, including the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides, can lead to soil degradation, contamination of water sources, and loss of biodiversity. Livestock production can also contribute significantly to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as methane. 4. Transportation: Increased vehicular traffic and the use of fossil fuels can lead to higher levels of air pollution in Lleida. Emissions from cars, buses, and trucks contribute to air quality degradation and climate change. 5. Waste management: The management and disposal of waste, whether it be domestic, industrial, or agricultural, is a key challenge for Lleida. Improper waste disposal can lead to soil pollution, contamination of water sources, and the release of harmful gases. Inadequate recycling and waste reduction efforts can also exacerbate the problem. 6. Climate change: As a global phenomenon, climate change affects Lleida as well. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can impact local ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. This, in turn, may result in increased pressure on the environment. To reduce the environmental impact in Lleida, both the local government and citizens can implement various measures. These could include promoting sustainable development, adopting cleaner technologies, investing in renewable energy sources, and supporting conservation efforts. Commuting via public transportation, cycling, or walking, recycling waste, and conserving water resources are also critical steps that individuals can take to contribute to a healthier and more sustainable Lleida."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In that respect, the SEC should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions, its use of criminal statutes, and working effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate. Does it follow that \\"The SEC should think about its civil sanctions.\\"?","output":"Yes, it follows that \\"The SEC should think about its civil sanctions.\\" This statement is an accurate summary of the original statement, emphasizing the need for the SEC to reevaluate its current approach concerning civil sanctions, the application of criminal statutes, and coordination with the Department of Justice. A longer, more detailed response would discuss the SEC's role, the existing regulatory framework, and the potential benefits and considerations for a reexamination of its enforcement strategies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a prominent US federal regulatory agency that aims to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient financial markets, and facilitate capital formation. Established in 1934, the SEC enforces federal securities laws that regulate the securities industry, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Civil sanctions are monetary penalties imposed upon individuals or entities that have violated securities laws. The SEC has the authority to impose civil sanctions, which may include fines, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of restrictions on future business activities. These sanctions serve to deter future misconduct, promote investor confidence in the market, and provide compensation to harmed parties. The statement suggests that the SEC should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions. This could imply that the current level of sanctions may not be effective in deterring securities law violations or might not be appropriately targeting the most egregious violators. A reevaluation may involve analyzing the specific circumstances under which sanctions are imposed, the size of penalties concerning the severity of violations, and the deterrence value of these sanctions. Additionally, the statement encourages the SEC to review its use of criminal statutes. The SEC, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, can bring criminal charges against individuals or entities for willful violations of securities laws, like insider trading or accounting fraud, if their actions meet the elements of the crime. By examining its use of criminal statutes, the SEC can determine whether it is appropriately leveraging its authority to bring the most severe cases to justice, which could provide a stronger deterrent effect. Working effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate is another aspect for reconsideration. Enhanced cooperation between the two agencies can help ensure that the enforcement regime is fair, consistent, and efficient, allowing violators to face the appropriate penalties in a timely manner. This collaboration can also lead to better resource allocation, achieving a more significant deterrent effect, and restoring investor confidence in the market. In conclusion, it does follow that \\"The SEC should think about its civil sanctions.\\" A comprehensive reexamination can lead to more effective strategies for deterring securities law violations. This reevaluation should consider the civil sanctions' amount and appropriateness, the proper use of criminal statutes, and enhanced coordination with the Department of Justice to better serve the SEC's mission of maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient financial markets."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I know that the answer to the question \\"jewishness means to\\" is in \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"Jewishness, specifically in the context of Ashkenazi Jews, is referred to as \\"Yiddishkeit.\\" This term originates from the Yiddish language and encompasses not only religious aspects such as the study of Torah and Talmud for men and observing Jewish Law for both men and women, but also various traditions, ideologies, practices, and movements within the broader Jewish culture. Yiddishkeit has evolved over time as a result of modernization and the emancipation of Jews in Europe. Previously, Ashkenazi Jews in regions such as the Rhineland, Riga, and Romania would primarily speak Yiddish in their secular lives and pray in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew. The concept of Yiddishkeit has since expanded to include not only Orthodoxy and Hasidism but also a wide array of Jewish cultural expressions. While the number of people who still speak Yiddish has decreased, Yiddishkeit can be identified through various manners of speech, styles of humor, and patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a person embracing their Jewishness or Yiddishkeit would be someone who engages with Jewish culture through supporting Jewish institutions, reading Jewish literature, attending Jewish movies and theater, traveling to Israel, visiting historical synagogues, and participating in other Jewish-related activities. In summary, Yiddishkeit represents the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews and encompasses a wide range of cultural, religious, and social practices, which have evolved and expanded throughout history as a result of modernization and the emancipation of the Jewish people in Europe. An individual embracing Yiddishkeit associates and participates in various aspects of Jewish culture, traditions, and activities."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

A:","output":"B). No; Justification: The task involves interpreting and answering a query about a biological/evolutionary concept, specifically evolution above the species level over geologic time.  1. The first thing to do is understand the query. The question is asking about what displays evolution over geologic time periods above the level of species. In simpler terms, it's about macroevolution – major evolutionary changes over time that lead to the diversification of species into different forms (like the evolution of mammals from reptiles). 2. The answer options provided are \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\", indicating it's a yes/no question. The statement in question, to essentially be evaluated as true or false, is: \\"Leptospirosis shows evolution over geologic time above the level of the species.\\" 3. Leptospirosis, however, is a bacterial infection caused by Leptospira bacteria, not a species or group of species. Hence, it cannot be an entity that exhibits evolution over geologic time periods. 4. The statement added that speciation events show evolution above the species level over geologic time, which is accurate. However, this doesn’t correlate with leptospirosis because, as stated, it's a disease, not a process of evolutionary diversification. Given these reasons, the appropriate response would be \\"B). No\\", because 'leptospirosis', being a disease, cannot demonstrate evolution over geologic time above the level of species."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs.  answer the following question:  What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? Answer:","output":"During the English Reformation, the Bishop of Lincoln claimed the right to present the rector for St Botolph's Church in Quarrington. This right had previously been held by Ramsey Abbey in the 13th century before passing on to the Bishop of Lincoln in the early 16th century."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This one is okay except that it keeps coming back to the same song and I find it difficult to call up the other cd's I downloaded. My original coby has a built in usb port which is very convenient because there is no extra wire to use or lose. I like having an FM radio to listen to as an option and really wanted the upgraded version of my original coby which is advertised, but for some reason not available. For the price it works well enough if all you want is extra memory and a device that is inexpensive that you don't want to worry about if you are traveling or jogging. All in all I am still getting used to it and haven't tried any of the other features such as voice recording and book downloads. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"To answer the question, I will go step-by-step through the review to analyze the positive and negative aspects mentioned. 1. The reviewer gives the item 2 1/2 stars, which indicates an average or below-average rating. 2. They liked their original COBY but wanted more memory, which the new COBY seems to provide. 3. The reviewer mentions a problem where the device keeps coming back to the same song and difficulty in accessing the other downloaded CDs. 4. They appreciated the built-in USB port and FM radio in their original COBY, implying that these might be lacking or not as good in the new one. 5. They mention the price being reasonable for extra memory and an inexpensive device for travel or jogging. 6. They also mention they are still getting used to the device and haven't tried all the features yet, like voice recording and book downloads. After analyzing the review, I would say that it depicts the product in an unflattering light because despite some positive aspects (extra memory and reasonable price), the negative points (song selection issue, possible lack of a built-in USB port, and difficulty accessing other content) outweigh the positive aspects. Additionally, the reviewer's rating (2 1/2 stars) also suggests a less-than-optimal experience with the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen. Question: What kept the speaker from melting? Answer: A:","output":"The air conditioning system inside the Hemingway House and the fans outside prevented the speaker from melting in the extremely hot weather while visiting Key West, Florida in July.

Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader.

Now, let's solve the problem: Japanese: 彼は最初のClubをペンシルバニア州で販売し、その後ウィナー・インターナショナルを創業して1000万台以上を売り上げた。 Khamer: នៅពេលខ្ញុំមកដល់ទីនេះដំបូងរឿងទើបតែកើតឡើងទេ។ Step 1: Translate the Japanese sentence to English: \\"He sold the first Club in Pennsylvania, and later founded Winner International, selling over 10 million units.\\" Step 2: Translate the Khamer sentence to English: \\"When I first arrived here, the story just began.\\" Step 3: Compare the translations: The translations are not the same.

So, the Khamer sentence is not a correct translation of the Japanese sentence. Solution: No"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial?  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Premise: \\"Everyone thinks so.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so.\\" true? OPT: [1]. yes [2]. it is not possible to tell [3]. no","output":"[3]. no The premise \\"Everyone thinks so\\" and the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" represent two opposing statements. In this specific scenario, if we assume that the premise is true, it entails that every individual in the context being referred to holds a particular viewpoint or opinion. This means that there is a unanimous agreement among all individuals concerning the subject matter at hand. On the contrary, the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" suggests that no individual in the context being referred to holds the specified viewpoint or opinion. In essence, this statement implies that there is a complete absence of agreement or support for the subject matter. Given that the premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive, it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time. If we accept the premise as true, \\"Everyone thinks so,\\" then by default, the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" must be false. Consequently, the answer is [3]. no, as the two statements cannot coexist as true under the same conditions and context. To further understand the logical implications between these two statements, we can use a more concrete example. Let's assume that the subject matter is a highly acclaimed movie. The premise \\"Everyone thinks so\\" would mean that every individual believes the movie is excellent. If that were the case, it would be logically inconsistent and impossible for the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" (i.e., no one believes the movie is excellent) to also be true simultaneously. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"Everyone thinks so\\" being true, the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" cannot be true, and the answer is [3]. no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, the premise includes the beautiful fishing villages of Peschici and Vieste that climb up a rocky promontory. Although the statement suggests that Pugnochiuso and its neighboring resorts have splendid views and historical value, it does not provide enough information about popularity or the level of preference among tourists or locals. To determine if Pugnochiuso is indeed the most popular resort due to its views, we would need more information or data supporting this claim, such as the number of visitors, customer reviews, or tourism surveys comparing Pugnochiuso and the other beach resorts mentioned. Furthermore, one must consider that the preference for a resort location or its popularity might not depend solely on its views. Factors like accommodations, activities, accessibility, and overall experience could also play a significant role in determining a resort’s popularity.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: – When Abigail Kingston became engaged to Jason Curtis, she did not have to wonder about what she'd wear on her wedding day. The dress she had in mind has been passed down through five generations in her family, starting with her great-great grandmother Mary Lowry Warren, who wore it when she wed on Dec. 11, 1895, in Buffalo, New York. In the 120 years since, it has been worn by nine other brides in her family, making so many trips that Abigail and her mother Leslie, who wore the dress as bride number 6 in 1977, were afraid that it was simply beyond repair, reports the Lehigh Valley Express-Times. When the keeper of the dress (the mother of the last bride to wear it—that last wedding being in 1991) sent it to Kingston, it arrived filled with holes, with disintegrating sleeves and browned satin. Not only had the dress been dry cleaned just once, lace patched the wear from 10 brides of different sizes trying to make it fit. Abigail, who is tall and thin, turned to a bridal designer, who spent 200 hours restoring it to its \\"spectacular\\" original design, reports Jezebel, transforming the brown into a blush shade and painstakingly recreating the disappearing sleeves and their 80 hand-sewn pleats. Still, \\"it is very, very fragile,\\" says Abigail, so she'll slip it on after the ceremony to wear throughout the cocktail hour during her Oct. 17 wedding in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. Abigail will also wear her great grandmother's ring and a locket given to her grandmother by her grandfather. \\"It's not just the dress that's been handed down,\\" Leslie says. \\"It's the love.\\" A 12th bride is already asking about it. (This bride wore her baby.)","output":"Title: Timeless Love: The Wedding Dress That Ties Generations Together When Abigail Kingston became engaged to Jason Curtis, she did not have to spend hours trying on countless gowns to find her perfect wedding dress. Instead, Abigail knew that she would be wearing a piece of family history; an exquisite dress that holds a story of love and tradition spanning five generations. The heirloom, first worn by Abigail's great-great-grandmother Mary Lowry Warren on December 11, 1895, in Buffalo, New York, has since been adorned by nine other brides in her family, each one adding their unique chapter to its tale. The well-traveled dress, which was never dry cleaned but only had its lace patched, found its way to bride number 6 in 1977, when Abigail's mother, Leslie, wore it on her wedding day. However, with time comes wear, and Leslie was afraid that the delicate gown was beyond repair, as it had developed numerous holes and acquired a brown hue. It appeared the gown's journey would end, but then, much like a fairy tale, a bridal designer was able to breathe new life into the dress. After receiving the fragile gown filled with holes, disintegrating sleeves, and browned satin, the designer spent over 200 hours meticulously restoring it to its former glory. The once-brown satin was transformed into a beautiful blush shade, and the disappearing sleeves were recreated, including the 80 hand-sewn pleated details. However, despite the incredible restoration, the dress remains delicate, and Abigail plans to slip it on after the ceremony to wear throughout the cocktail hour during her October 17 wedding in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. Honoring family tradition does not end with the dress for Abigail, though. She will also wear her great-grandmother's ring and a locket given to her grandmother by her grandfather. It is clear that the dress, much like the cherished memories and stories that each generation of brides shares, goes beyond its physical representation. Leslie aptly puts it, \\"It's not just the dress that's been handed down. It's the love.\\" As the time for Abigail to wear the storied gown approaches, the story of love and family connection the dress carries continues to grow. Interest in the gown remains strong, with a 12th bride already expressing her desire to carry on the tradition. One can only imagine the countless emotional, joy-filled moments the dress has borne witness to and the many more it will continue to inspire. It is a beautiful reminder that love, like this timeless wedding dress, knows no boundaries and endures across generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Track ovulation: Knowing your ovulation cycle may help you determine the best time to conceive a boy, as male sperm are believed to swim faster but do not survive as long as female sperm. Trying to conceive just before or during ovulation may increase the chances of male sperm reaching the egg first. 2. Adjust your diet: Some studies suggest that a diet high in potassium and sodium may increase the likelihood of conceiving a boy. Include potassium-rich foods such as bananas, potatoes, and spinach, and sodium-rich foods like cured meats and olives. 3. Sexual position: Some people believe that certain sexual positions, like those that allow for deeper penetration, can increase the chances of conceiving a boy. This is because male sperm may have an advantage under these conditions. 4. Maintain a healthy weight: Being at a healthy weight can generally improve fertility, so maintaining a balanced diet and exercise routine will help create optimal conditions for conception. 5. Manage stress: High stress levels may impact fertility, so finding ways to manage stress through exercise, meditation, or other relaxation techniques may help improve your chances of conceiving a baby boy.

It was this title that Lancelot Brenton ( his elder brother , John Jervis Brenton , died in 1817 ) inherited . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Step 1: Read both sentences carefully. Sentence 1: \\"It was this title that Lancelot Brenton inherited (his older brother John Jervis Brenton having died in 1817).\\" Sentence 2: \\"It was this title that Lancelot Brenton (his elder brother, John Jervis Brenton, died in 1817) inherited.\\" Step 2: Identify the common elements and structure of the sentences. Both sentences mention \\"Lancelot Brenton,\\" \\"this title,\\" \\"inherited,\\" \\"older/elder brother,\\" \\"John Jervis Brenton,\\" and \\"died in 1817.\\" The structure of the sentences varies slightly, with Sentence 1 using parentheses and Sentence 2 using commas around the additional information. Step 3: Determine the meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1: Lancelot Brenton inherited a title due to the death of his older brother, John Jervis Brenton, who died in 1817. Sentence 2: Lancelot Brenton, whose elder brother John Jervis Brenton died in 1817, inherited a title. Step 4: Compare the meanings. Both sentences convey the same central idea: Lancelot Brenton inherited a title after his older/elder brother John Jervis Brenton died in 1817. The difference lies in the placement and punctuation of the additional information, which doesn't change the core meaning.

After putting him under, Lisa plants a post-hypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to \\"be more open-minded\\". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior. While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: total waste Product review: avoid at all costs. there's not one redeeming quality about a movie such as this one.not even the occasionally \\"so bad it's funny\\"...it is simply BAD.now you may still want to be a sucker (i'd rather use the term looser) and rent it anyway. your problem.judging from the other reviews, i'd say you've been amply warned... Answer:","output":"The review presented would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product. There are several reasons behind this conclusion, which can be broken down into smaller pieces for better understanding. 1. Strong negative language: The use of strong negative language such as \\"total waste,\\" \\"avoid at all costs,\\" and \\"not one redeeming quality\\" sends a clear message that the reviewer was highly dissatisfied with the product. Such language instantly creates a negative perception about the product, discouraging any potential buyers. 2. No positive aspects mentioned: Generally, a balanced review may highlight the good sides of a product alongside the bad ones. However, in this case, the reviewer explicitly states that there is 'not one redeeming quality' about the movie. This suggests that the product did not offer even minor enjoyment and failed on all fronts. 3. Disparaging other customers: The reviewer takes a strong stance against those who may still want to try the product despite the negative review by calling them 'suckers' or 'losers.' This further reiterates the gravity of the situation and the idea that trying the product would not be worth the time or money. 4. Agreement among other reviews: The reviewer mentions that other reviews echo their sentiment, which implies that the majority of people who have tried the product have found it to be undeserving of their time and money. Such a consensus makes it even less likely that the product would be worth purchasing or trying out. 5. No specific details: While the review lacks detailed information regarding the specific issues the reviewer experienced with the movie, the overall tone and strong negative language paint a clear picture of dissatisfaction. The lack of details might leave some room for doubt or make potential buyers curious to make up their mind independently. However, it is essential to weigh this factor against the already discussed negative elements conveyed in the review. In conclusion, the strongly negative review would considerably decrease the chances of me buying the product. The use of harsh language, absence of any positive aspects, disparaging remarks towards potential buyers, and the agreement among other reviewers collectively contribute to discouraging potential buyers from considering the product as a worthwhile investment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rheinmetall in Germany developed an automatic 20 mm in the 1920s and Oerlikon in Switzerland had acquired the patent to an automatic 20 mm gun designed in Germany during World War I. Germany introduced the rapid-fire 2 cm FlaK 30 and later in the decade it was redesigned by Mauser-Werke and became the 2 cm FlaK 38. Nevertheless, while 20 mm was better than a machine gun and mounted on a very small trailer made it easy to move, its effectiveness was limited. Germany therefore added a 3.7 cm. The first, the 3.7 cm FlaK 18 developed by Rheinmetall in the early 1930s, was basically an enlarged 2 cm FlaK 30. It was introduced in 1935 and production stopped the following year. A redesigned gun 3.7 cm FlaK 36 entered service in 1938, it too had a two-wheel carriage. However, by the mid-1930s the Luftwaffe realised that there was still a coverage gap between 3.7 cm and 8.8 cm guns. They started development of a 5 cm gun on a four-wheel carriage.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What will happen immediately after eating? Possible A: defecating, pooping, reduced, becoming full, gaining weight  Why is \\"becoming full\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question asks about the immediate consequence of eating, and we are given a list of possible answers. Step 2: Analyze the given possible answers We have five possible answers: a. defecating b. pooping c. reduced d. becoming full e. gaining weight Step 3: Evaluate each possible answer against common sense a. Defecating: Defecating doesn't usually happen immediately after eating. It is a consequence, but it happens after the digestive process has taken place, which takes some time. b. Pooping: Pooping is a synonym for defecating, so the same reasoning as above applies. c. Reduced: It's unclear what \\"reduced\\" refers to in this context, but it is not an immediate consequence associated with eating in common sense. d. Becoming full: Becoming full is an immediate consequence of eating, as when we eat, our stomachs fill up with food. As more food is consumed, the sensation of fullness signals that we have eaten enough. This feeling of fullness is an indicator aligned with common sense that we have finished eating. e. Gaining weight: Gaining weight is also a consequence of eating, but it does not occur immediately. The body takes time to absorb the calories from food and convert them into stored energy (fat). So, this is not an immediate consequence of eating. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the evaluation of each possible answer, the one that aligns with human common sense the most is \\"becoming full.\\" Justification: Becoming full is an immediate and common consequence of eating, as it indicates that our bodies have received enough food to feel satisfied.

He says that \\"chlorophyll is used for absorbing light energy by plants\\" and \\"sun emits light energy\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question?","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What allows plants to absorb energy from the sun?\\" is chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells, as well as in algae and some bacteria. It plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis, allowing plants to absorb and convert light energy from the sun into a usable form of energy. The sunlight that reaches Earth's surface consists of a wide spectrum of wavelengths, including visible light, which appears as different colors to the human eye. Within this visible light spectrum, chlorophyll primarily absorbs red and blue light, while reflecting green light. This is why most plants appear green to our eyes. When a plant absorbs light energy through chlorophyll, this energy isn't immediately usable by the plant. Instead, it needs to be converted into chemical energy through a series of reactions collectively known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll within the chloroplasts absorbs solar energy and uses it to power the production of energy-rich compounds like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). These compounds serve as energy currency in the cell and are used in various processes, including the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to produce the plant's main carbohydrate, glucose, through the conversion of carbon dioxide and water. Glucose can be used as an immediate energy source by the plant, stored for later use, or converted into other organic compounds like cellulose and starch. Ultimately, chlorophyll's role in absorbing light energy from the sun is essential to the process of photosynthesis. This process is of utmost importance not only to the life cycle of plants but also to the entire ecosystem, as it serves as the base process for energy flow in food chains and plays a critical role in the Earth's carbon cycle by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into organic matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - having sex - disorientation - sickness - throwing up - snapchatting  Explain why a human would choose \\"disorientation\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"disorientation\\" as the answer to the question because it directly relates to the impairing effects of alcohol on cognitive and motor functions. Drinking alcohol can lead to impaired judgment, slower reaction times, and reduced coordination, all of which are essential for safe driving. When a person is disoriented, they may have difficulty understanding their surroundings, processing information, and making appropriate decisions. This disorientation greatly increases the risk of a car crash as the individual may not be able to respond effectively to traffic signals, other vehicles, and changes in road conditions. The other options are not as directly related to the consequences of alcohol consumption and its effect on driving skills. While having sex, sickness, throwing up, and snapchatting can all potentially distract a driver or cause difficulty in operating a vehicle, they are not inherently caused by drinking alcohol. Disorientation, on the other hand, is a known effect of alcohol consumption and it has a direct and clear link to the increased risk of car crashes when a driver is under the influence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  A butterfly lays an egg - A larvae matures inside of the egg - The caterpillar hatches from the egg - The caterpillar eats and grows - The caterpillar spins a coccoon around itself and forms into a pupa - The butterfly forms inside of the coccoon - The mature butterfly emerges from the coccoon - The butterfly mates A:","output":"The final step in the process after a butterfly mates is for the adult female butterfly to lay an egg, thus completing the life cycle of a butterfly and continuing on to the next generation. This process is called oviposition. During oviposition, the female butterfly selects an appropriate host plant, typically one that is a suitable food source for her offspring, and proceeds to lay her eggs on or near the plant. The selection of the appropriate plant is crucial, as the caterpillars that emerge from the eggs are highly specialized eaters that are only able to consume specific types of plants. Failure to lay the eggs on a compatible host plant can lead to the death of newborn caterpillars, as they starve due to a lack of food. The female butterfly uses a specialized organ, the ovipositor, to deposit her eggs on the selected host plant. Depending on the species, butterflies may lay their eggs individually or in clusters. The eggs exhibit a wide range of shapes, textures, and colors, which also vary across species and sometimes aid in camouflage against potential predators. Once the eggs are laid, the life cycle of a butterfly has come full circle. The new generation of eggs will develop within their protective shells, with larvae maturing inside, and the entire process will be repeated. This cycle is an essential aspect of the survival and perpetuation of butterfly species in the wild. With each successive generation, butterflies have the opportunity to pass on their genes and potentially adapt to their environment or develop new characteristics through genetic mutations. These evolutionary changes, driven by natural selection, work to ensure that butterfly populations remain healthy and vibrant in a constantly changing world. In this way, the final step of egg-laying provides not only a conclusion to the life cycle of an individual butterfly but also serves as a critical link to future generations, ensuring the continuation of these beautiful and ecologically important creatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both of these individuals have been part of historic space missions during their respective careers, and they share a common professional interest in human spaceflight and exploration. Bertalan Farkas, born August 2, 1949, in Szeged, Hungary, is a retired Hungarian Air Force officer, pilot, and the first Hungarian national to venture into space. He flew to space as part of the Soyuz 36 mission organized by the Soviet Union's Intercosmos program. During this mission, Farkas was a research cosmonaut, performing various scientific experiments and tests. Launched on May 26, 1980, the Soyuz 36 crew spent 7 days and 20 hours in outer space, several of those days docked to the Salyut 6 space station. Farkas' spaceflight was an important moment in space history, as it represented Hungary's entrance into the global space community. Georgi Ivanov, born July 2, 1940, in Lovech, Bulgaria, is a retired Bulgarian Air Force officer, pilot, and the first Bulgarian national to travel into space. Ivanov was selected to be part of the Soyuz 33 mission, another joint spaceflight organized by the Soviet Union's Intercosmos program. Launched on April 10, 1979, Ivanov and his team spent 1 day and 23 hours in space. Though the mission experienced technical issues that prevented the spacecraft from docking with the Salyut 6 space station, Ivanov's voyage marked a significant milestone for Bulgaria, as it demonstrated the country's participation and importance within the international space community.

Article: Both wrapping techniques have pros and cons, and the one you choose should be informed by your reason for wrapping the ankle. Take these factors into consideration when making your choice:  Ace bandages are used to make compression wraps. They are made from stretchy fabric that many find to be comfortable against the skin. They are secured with metal fasteners, or you can buy adhesive wraps that use velcro or glue to keep the wrap in place.  Ace bandages are conveniently reusable, so they're a good choice for people who need to wrap frequently. Athletes may find ace bandages to be cumbersome when worn during physical activity. They create a bulky padding around the ankle that can make it more difficult to run and jump.   A wrap constructed from tape includes a bottom layer of underwrap, which protects the skin from getting pulled too much by the tape, and a layer of tape that is adhered to the underwrap in a pattern that supports the ankle.  Tape is not reusable, so it can get expensive for people who need to wrap every time they perform a physical activity. The underwrap protects the skin somewhat, but a little pulling usually takes place. Tape feels lighter on the body, so many athletes prefer it to using an ace bandage when the wrap is intended to support the ankle during physical activity. Make sure the ankle and foot are clean and dry. Extend the leg and rest the ankle on a chair or bench to make the wrapping procedure easier. If tape will be used, it's advised to shave the hair from the bottom section of the leg and ankle.

A state news agency said the new deposits exist in \\"southern coastal areas\\" and triple Iran's estimated amount of raw uranium. The announcement comes after Western experts concluded that Iran, which has few uranium mines, had likely drained its native supply. But a former Israeli official says Iran is just trying to gain leverage before nuclear talks with US, Russia, France, Germany, and China starting Tuesday. \\"It seems that Iran is trying to raise the bidding price and to enter negotiations from a position of strength,\\" Danny Ayalon tells the Jerusalem Post. He called it \\"a negotiating pattern which is common in the Persian bazaar.\\" Iran said its upcoming power stations were for electricity only and conformed to international standards. Iran has also announced the installation of new centrifuges that enrich uranium faster at its site in Natanz—a move Washington called provocative. Expand this summary.","output":"Iran found more raw-uranium deposits and plans to build 16 new nuclear power stations. These deposits are in the southern coastal areas and they make Iran have three times more raw uranium than before. This is important because some people thought Iran was running out of uranium. Uranium is a special rock that can be used to make electricity in nuclear power stations, but it can also be used to make very dangerous weapons called nuclear bombs. Iran says that it will only use the uranium to make electricity, but some countries are worried that they might be trying to make the dangerous weapons. Before they found these new deposits, Iran was going to talk with other countries like the US, Russia, France, Germany, and China about how they use nuclear power. Some people think that Iran is talking about the new uranium deposits and nuclear power stations to make the other countries think they have more power than they do. This way, they can get better deals in the talks. Iran has also put in new machines, called centrifuges, that can turn uranium into a special kind that is used in nuclear power stations and can also be used to make nuclear bombs. The US thinks this is not a friendly thing to do because it makes them worried that Iran might be trying to make dangerous weapons."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What artist's painting got funding for its restoration after it was feared it would soon be beyond repair?  Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three.

Movie title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her... Answer:","output":"The movie \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" does not provide specific details about where Vin and Carol had their honeymoon. This classic 1942 film, directed by William Wyler, is primarily focused on the experiences of the Miniver family as they live through the prelude and early years of World War II in England. While the romance between Vin and Carol is an important subplot, the movie places greater emphasis on the war's impact on the family and their community. Vin, the older son of Kay and Clem Miniver, meets Carol Beldon while he is back from Oxford University. The pair initially clashes over their divergent views on class differences and social responsibilities. However, they eventually fall in love and get engaged. Vin later joins the Royal Air Force as a fighter pilot, contributing to the war effort. The film's plot doesn't delve into the couple's honeymoon; rather, it highlights the various challenges and events that the Miniver family endures during the tumultuous period of the war. The story spans from the early days of the war, such as Clem's involvement in the Dunkirk evacuation, to the hardships experienced by the family and their community on the home front. In conclusion, \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" does not provide a specific location for Vin and Carol's honeymoon. The movie's main focus lies in the family's experiences and struggles during World War II, with the couple's romance serving as an important subplot that showcases the theme of love and unity during trying times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.  Question: \\"How do the attorneys working with the program feel about it?\\" Answer: \\"They feel that they can use their language skills to help others\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Answer: Yes, this answer is correct. The paragraph mentions attorney Irene Mak, who is one of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program. She shares that despite earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases at NLS compared to her previous private law firm, the job is more satisfying due to her ability to use her language skills and give back to the Asian community. This indicates that attorneys working with the program feel a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in using their language skills to assist others, particularly those in need within their community."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process.  Environmental pollution can have various harmful effects on birds, making it harder for them to mate, reproduce, and survive. These effects can include changes in habitat, reduced food sources, and increased exposure to toxic substances like pesticides and heavy metals, which can weaken their immune systems and reproductive capacities. Although pollution may not directly alter the mating process (i.e., the physical act of mating), it can have indirect consequences on several steps in the life cycle of birds. For example, pollution can lead to a decrease in available nesting sites or suitable habitats, which may make it difficult for birds to find a mate or raise their offspring successfully. Pollutants may also accumulate in the tissues of birds and their prey, harming the health of both adult and young birds. This can negatively affect their ability to reproduce, grow, and survive. Furthermore, pollution can disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems, leading to a decline in the populations of insects and other small prey that birds rely on for food. As a result, birds may face increased competition for food resources, which can further stress their reproductive efforts. In conclusion, while environmental pollution may not directly impact a specific step in the mating process of birds, it can have significant indirect effects on multiple aspects of their life cycle, making it more difficult for them to mate, reproduce, and thrive in their natural habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Waterbury police arrested Adam Plaeger, 38, on charges of strangling his girlfriend Melanie Heuberger, 40, after an argument, as reported by WTNH News.  The disturbing image of Plaeger's tattoo bearing Heuberger's name raises questions about the dynamics involved in their relationship.

Question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

O'Niel (Sean Connery), is assigned to a one-year tour of duty at Con Am 27, a titanium ore mining outpost on Jupiter's third moon Io (pronounced \\"eye-oh\\"), a volcanic moon about 2,275 miles in diameter and located 275,000 miles from Jupiter's gas surface. Conditions on Io are difficult - gravity is 1/6th that of Earth with no breathable atmosphere, atmospheric work-suits are cumbersome, and miners carry around their own air supply whilst working. Shifts are long but significant bonuses are paid as incentives to boost production. Explaining in an opening disclaimer, Con Am 27 is franchised to Con-Amalgamate by the League of Industrial Nations located on Earth. The colony's population is 2,144 men and women (1,250 labor, 714 support personnel, and 180 administration and maintenance crew). It is policed by a forced called Administrative Level 4 and above.Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), the head of the mining colony, boasts that since he took over the running of Io productivity has broken all previous records.The film begins with a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffering an attack of the DT's who rips open his work-suit which then decompresses resulting in his death. Shortly thereafter another miner Cane (Eugene Lipinski) enters a lift to the mine without wearing his work-suit, and likewise dies from decompression.With the assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel starts an investigation into these deaths. However, before he can complete his investigation there is a further incident, this time involving a worker Sagan (Steven Berkoff) threatening to kill a prostitute with a knife. At the scene of this incident O'Niel attempts to calm the man and enter the room by the main door, whilst Montone, O'Niel's sergeant (James B. Sikking), enters the room via the air duct. Montone shoots Sagan dead before O'Niel can talk with him.O'Niel takes a sample of blood from the dead Sagan in the morgue and has Lazarus examine it in her lab. It is here where...

Doncaster dominated most of the first half with Andy Williams forcing a fine save from on-loan Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths in the 16th minute. Cheltenham relied heavily on counter-attacks, with Harry Pell setting up James Dayton for a chance which he curled just wide and Billy Waters forcing Marko Marosi into an one-handed stop before the break. Cheltenham improved in the second half, bidding to protect an unbeaten home record stretching back to last September when they were beaten 1-0 by Tranmere in the National League. Koby Arthur saw a shot blocked on the edge of the box and the on-loan Birmingham forward also sliced a shot wide of the near post - but Cheltenham are still waiting for their first win since returning to the EFL.

Article: Though it may be tempting to pop a zit or pick at your acne, doing so can cause the skin to become even more inflamed and lead more acne as well as acne scars. Instead, make sure you wash the area well and apply skin care products that will work to treat and heal your acne. Never use any sharp tools on your skin, even if it is advertised as an acne removal tool. This can lead to permanent damage to your skin that can be difficult to treat or that will require more intense skin care treatments to heal. If you have a habit of resting your chin, cheek, or forehead in your hands, try to avoid doing this. If possible, try not to touch your face at all throughout the day. Your hands are carriers of bacteria and germs that may only make your acne worse if they end up on your face.  As well, if you tend to have oily hair or if you have longer hair, keep it clean and away from your face. Oil from your hair can make your face and neck extra oily, leading to possible breakouts and acne in these areas. Avoid wearing baseball caps or hats throughout the day, as these can cause acne to develop on your hairline or your forehead. Wash your caps and hats often if you wear them on a daily basis so they do not carry any bacteria that can get onto your skin.  Make sure your cell phone is clean, as you can get breakouts where your phone rests on your face. To make sure you are removing dead skin cells from your skin that can cause acne, you should wash your face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Use a cleansing product that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or glycolic acid to treat your acne effectively. Avoid scrubbing your face hard with a washcloth when you clean your face. Instead, use your fingers to gently massage the product into your skin.  If your skin is very sensitive, then wash with a gentle facial skin cleanser such as Cetaphil or Eucerin. You should also always wash your face after exercising or playing sports as oil buildup due to sweating can make your acne worse. If you are starting to grow facial hair, you may be tempted to start shaving. However, shaving can irritate acne-prone skin and lead to more breakouts. As well, you may end up nicking a pimple while shaving, which could cause inflammation. If you do need to shave, try to shave as lightly as possible on the surface of your skin to avoid irritating your acne. If you are using a safety razor when shaving, soften your facial hair with warm water and soap before you shave so you do not have to press too hard on your skin. Though your skin may appear better after a day out in the sun, in the long term, sunlight can actually make your acne worse and lead to sun damage on your face. As well, many acne products can make your skin more vulnerable to burning. Protect your skin by applying oil-free sunscreen before you go outside, even if it is not sunny outside.  Many commercial acne products can dry out your skin, especially if your skin is still trying to get used to the ingredients in the product. To prevent dryness or chapped skin, use a moisturizer that is oil-free and noncomedogenic. This will ensure the moisturizer does not clog your pores or irritate your skin.  Avoid using moisturizers that are heavy in oils, such as Vaseline and mineral oils. These products will only increase the buildup of oil and debris on your skin and make your acne worse. Ask your dermatologist to recommend an oil-free moisturizer, based on your skin type and the severity of your acne. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, picking at or popping acne can worsen the inflammation and lead to scarring. To prevent acne, maintain good hygiene, avoid touching your face, and keep hair and personal items clean. Wash your face twice a day using appropriate acne-fighting ingredients and treat sensitive skin gently. When shaving, take precautions to avoid irritation.

Given the background: Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.  and the situation: David is experimenting with electromagnetic waves. He has four different waves to study, wave A, wave B, wave C, and wave D. In wave A, distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves is greater than that of wave B. In wave C, the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given time is greater than that of wave D.  Answer the following question: Which wave has higher frequency, wave A or wave B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Wave B has a higher frequency than wave A. To understand why, let's analyze the given information and some principles of electromagnetic waves. According to the background provided, electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. In other words, there is an inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency - as the wavelength decreases, frequency increases, and vice versa. Now, let's examine the details provided about the four waves David is studying: 1. Wave A - The distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves (i.e., wavelength) is greater than that of wave B. 2. Wave B - By comparison to wave A, wave B must have a shorter wavelength since the distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves is lesser. 3. Wave C and Wave D - These waves are relevant, as they provide information on the number of waves passing a fixed point in a given time, which is the definition of frequency. The question asks which wave has a higher frequency, wave A or wave B. Based on the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, and since we know that wave A has a longer wavelength than wave B, we can conclude that wave B must have a higher frequency than wave A. This is because the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency, and wave B has a shorter wavelength compared to wave A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

London Theater Journal: A Hellish Vacation LONDON – What a pristine room, all sparkling white from floor to ceiling, with not a speck of dust in sight. If you’re a regular theatergoer, you know that any stage set this clean and this white isn’t going to stay that way for long. This being the summer of carnage in London theater – with hit productions of the vampire romance “Let the Right One In” and the torture-happy “1984” — you also know that before you can say “Drop that weapon,” these immaculate walls will be smeared with blood. Such were my first impressions on entering the Shed of the National Theater, the home to Polly Stenham’s “Hotel,” and for once my first impressions were correct. This anxiety-fueled allegory, which takes place in a luxury resort on a desert island, is an exercise in desecration, as a pale-skinned British family that stinks of privilege and entitlement is brought to its knees. That’s literally brought to its knees, all the better to be roughed up and mutilated. Ms. Stenham achieved fame at 19 with her first produced play, “That Face” (2007), a portrait of a mad monster mother and her damaged teenage progeny. Her second work, “Tusk Tusk” (2009), was a variation on the same theme. With “Hotel,” Ms. Stenham retains her signature dysfunctional clan of warped teenagers and warping parents, but expands the view around them, to reveal an entire dysfunctional world. That’s a lot of weight to place on one unhappy family, and “Hotel” buckles under the burden of topical baggage. Mummy (Hermione Gulliford) is a British cabinet minister for foreign affairs, who is angry with Daddy (Tom Beard) for derailing her career by sending pictures of his penis to a lusty online correspondent. They’re on this vacation with the kids, Ralph (Tom Rhys Harries) and Frankie (a defiantly sly Shannon Tarbet), to try to salvage their marriage. But the sins of the father ain’t nothing compared to the sins of the mother in her capacity as running-dog international treaty signer. And so the family is visited by an assortment of unwelcome guests who include one seriously angry hotel maid (the fiercely poised Susan Wokoma) and – wait for it – an army of Somali pirates. The word has been that “Hotel,” directed by Maria Aberg, is so intense and so graphic that some theatergoers have been fainting or bolting in terror. My audience, perhaps forewarned by publicity, seemed to take the torture and slaughter of this slickly mounted production in stride. I suspect, though, that there might have been some wincing at the ennobling references to Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” woven into the script. There’s blood on the floors at the Gate Theater, too, though in this case the blood is black and unmistakably ersatz. That’s because in “Idomeneus,” the German dramatist Roland Schimmelpfennig’s inventive deconstruction of a Greek myth, ink is spilled whenever its characters bite the Aegean dust. This they do in ways that include thorough evisceration. Whether such unseemly deaths ever befell Idomeneus, a Greek general who returns home to his native Crete from the Trojan War, or his unlucky kin is moot. We have only the word of a bunch of uncertain storytellers to go on. Embodied in this production by an ensemble of five, this group will be familiar to anyone with a passing acquaintance of Greek tragedy. They’re the men and women of the Chorus, those anonymous folks who can be found reliably kibitzing on the sidelines as big honchos like Oedipus and Electra pursue their majestic dooms. Mr. Schimmelpfennig (probably best known for his play “The Golden Dragon”) has placed them center stage, and by extension, he puts us up there with them. That affinity is given physical life in Ellen McDougall’s engaging, surprisingly easygoing production of “Idomeneus,” which has been translated from the German by David Tushingham. The members of the audience are invited to enter the theater by crawling through a hole in the wall, which is how the members of the chorus will subsequently make their entrance. Choruses, they’re just like us! The five performers (Alex Austin, Jon Foster, Mark Monero, Susie Trayling and Ony Uhiara) are as motley a lot as you might find in a city subway car. Of course they do have a bit of that well-enunciated, professionally charming persona that comes from years of acting classes and auditions. But otherwise they’re as goofy, self-conscious, nervous, sloppy and obsessive as we civilians are. They are also like us in that they really don’t know what truly happened in the epochal events that shaped their civilization. As they take turns recounting the legend of Idomeneus, and portraying the principal players in his story, they offer assorted alternate versions of what might have happened. This involves their getting wet and dirty, as they slide around Ana Ines Jabares Pita’s glassy, wine-dark sea of a set. The one thing our Chorus does know – as it considers the plight of the play’s title character, who was told by the gods to sacrifice his son in exchange for his own deliverance – is that the spoils of war include crippling guilt and the taint of inhuman behavior. This is not perhaps a surprising moral, but it is delivered with assured tentativeness by the ensemble here.

Greg's grandma is a culinary expert. She is also  very eager to teach others how to make great foods. One day she taught Greg how to make candied fruit. Greg was so excited about it that he bought two baskets of fruits, basket A and basket B, to make some candied fruits. He used the basket A fruits to make some candied fruits, but was too lazy to use the basket B fruits. He just kept the basket B fruits on his kitchen top.  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","output":"Basket A fruits will be preserved because they were used to make candied fruits, which undergo a process of preservation by being saturated with sugar in heated sugar syrup, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one crown. It is generally accepted by most scholars (John Elliott being an English-speaking example) that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Some newer historical opinions propose that under their rule, what later became Spain was still a union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as to a large degree Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms, with most of their own separate institutions, for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords.  - The New World is one of the names used for the Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands such as those of the Caribbean and Bermuda).  - Genoese (\\"Zeneize\\") is a dialect of the Ligurian language spoken in Genoa (the principal city of the Liguria region in Northern Italy).  - Bartholomew Columbus (Genoese dialect: Bertomê Corombo; ) (c. 1461  1515) was an Italian explorer from Genoa and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus.  - Christopher Columbus ( 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, colonizer, and citizen of the Republic of Genoa. Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. Those voyages and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola initiated the European colonization of the New World.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles.

Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions.  - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.  - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars.  - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  - The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.  - John the Apostle ( Aramaic :    Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew :     Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek :  ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament .  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.

Family relationship is the inborn connection, which you can't avoid or choose at will. Love, for a student, is not always within our reach and as for friendship, personally, it's most important. Nowadays, it is common to see friendship in colleges or middle schools. What is difficult is how to deal with personal contacts between different sexes. The key is to know how to tell love from friendship. The term, friend, covers a much wider range of meanings. It can be a nodding acquaintance, a comrade, a confident  , a partner, a playmate, a brother, etc. Everyone needs friendship. No one can sail the ocean of life single handed. We need help from, and also give help to, others. In the modern age, people attach more importance to relations and connections. Without stars, the night sky won't be so beautiful; without friendship, our life won't be meaningful. With friendship, life is happy and harmonious. So, friendship may be a quiet walk in the park with the one you trust if possible, while love is the company you are always feeling like keeping. And friendship is when someone gazes into your eyes, you feel only care and calm while love is when someone gazes into your eyes, you will not keep calm. Love is not a word spoken out easily. In a way, love is selfish, while friendship is selfless and extensive. Love is not necessarily to be returned. But friendship needs something in exchange. You can't wish \\"let there be love in our hearts\\", for love needs enough time to sow, to water and to take good care of and also needs a rosy, calm, relaxed, emotional and private atmosphere.

Let D = the actual distance traveled by the person at 8 km/h Let T = the time it took for him to travel that distance Step 2: Write an equation based on the given information. We know that distance = speed × time, so D = 8T (actual distance traveled) If the person walked at 12 km/h instead of 8 km/h, he would have traveled (D+20) km since he would have walked 20 km more. Hence, (D+20) = 12T. Step 3: Solve for the variable. To solve for the actual distance (D), we'll need to find the time (T) first. We can do this by equating the two expressions in terms of T: 8T = 12T - 20 We'll now solve for T: 4T = 20 T = 5 Now, we'll plug the value of T back into the equation D = 8T to find the actual distance: D = 8(5) D = 40 km Step 4: Pick the correct answer from the given options.

A:","output":"The Ford Louisville Assembly Plant, which is the second Ford plant in Louisville, was established on a 180-acre site in the year 1955. This manufacturing facility was built to expand Ford's production capacity and to serve the rapidly growing automotive market in the United States. Louisville is home to the Kentucky Truck Assembly and the Louisville Assembly Plant, both of which contribute to Ford's production of a wide range of vehicles. The Kentucky Truck Assembly, which primarily manufactures Ford's F-Series Super Duty trucks, Ford Expeditions, and Lincoln Navigators, was opened in 1969. Meanwhile, the Louisville Assembly Plant is known for the production of the Ford Escape and the Lincoln Corsair. In the decades since its opening, the Louisville Assembly Plant has undergone numerous transformations and expansions. This facility was initially used to manufacture the Ford Courier, a compact pickup truck that was first introduced in 1971. Over the years, various other vehicles have been produced at the plant, including the Ford Ranger, Ford Bronco II, and the Ford Explorer. The plant was also retooled in 2011 for the production of the Ford Escape, making it one of the most flexible automobile manufacturing facilities in the world. Since the Louisville Assembly Plant's initial opening in 1955, it has been an important contributor to the regional and national economy. In recent years, Ford has invested heavily in both of its Louisville plants, providing employment to thousands of people and contributing to the growth and development of the city. To summarize, the Louisville Assembly Plant, situated on a 180-acre site, was established in 1955 as the second Ford facility in Louisville, with the Kentucky Truck Assembly opening in 1969.

Team A learned about reptiles, while Team B studied more about amphibians.  But I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

A:","output":"Team A learned more about turtles, as they were studying reptiles and turtles are a class of reptiles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

California lags far behind comparable states in funding legal services for the poor, a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal needs of the state's poor and lowerincome residents are being addressed. That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \\"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children. Half the nation's increase in poverty in the 1990s, when the number of poor jumped 30 percent, occurred in California, and nearly 25 percent of the nation's poverty increase occurred in Los Angeles County alone. Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages. The commission's report, \\"The Path to Equal Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" examined how the legal needs of the state's poor have changed in the last five years as well as both the shortcomings of the justice system and the improvements during that period. Despite increases in state funding to meet the legal needs of the poor, low interest rates (which have reduced the IOLTA fund), high unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Increases in state funding were made in an effort to meet the legal needs of the poor in which state?\\" is \\"New York State\\"?  + no. + yes.","output":"- no.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This movie is a rather odd mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film-noir to it. It's basically one messy heap of different genres, of which none really works out like it was supposed to. This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more serious as an actor. He's a former child-star who always used to star in in happy comical- and musical productions at the start of his career. In this movie he picks a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the movie). But his role is actually quite laughable within the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He's an extremely small boyish looking man. He actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old. Hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right. He simply isn't convincing in his role. Because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story also really feels as a messy one. Somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot-line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all. It just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime, despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957. He must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with. His movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality. Let's also not forget that this is a '50's movie but yet it more feels like a '40's one or perhaps even as one from the '30's. This is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black & white. Generally speaking black & white movies from the '50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception. It's a rather strange sight seeing Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence. It wasn't the only movie Armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies, often simply as himself. I guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music, since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What month and year were the surviving crew members of the brigantine formerly used as a whaler rescued?  The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas,  and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the  ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible  to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions   were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the... The answer to this question is:","output":"September 1914"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Kennedy was born in Inverness, the son of Mary and Ian. He was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and was educated at Lochaber High School in Fort William. He went on to study for a Master of Arts degree in Politics and Philosophy at the University of Glasgow. At university he became politically active, joining the SDP, as well as the Dialectic Society. Context: On 6 January 2006 Kennedy was informed that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement that over the past eighteen months he had been coming to terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were partly as a result of the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all. It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned ITV News correspondent, Daisy McAndrew.  The admission of a drinking problem seriously damaged his standing and 25 MPs signed a statement urging him to resign immediately. It was later claimed in a biography of Kennedy by the journalist Greg Hurst that senior Liberal Democrats had known about Kennedy's drinking problem when he was elected as leader in 1999 and had subsequently kept it hidden from the public.  On 7 January 2006, Kennedy called another press conference, at which he announced that while he was buoyed by the supportive messages he had received from grass root members, he felt that he could not continue as leader because of the lack of confidence from the Parliamentary party. He said he would not be a candidate in the leadership election and was standing down as leader \\"with immediate effect\\", with Menzies Campbell to act as interim leader until a new leader was elected.  He also confirmed in his resignation statement that he did not expect to remain on the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team. He pledged his loyalty to a new leader as a backbencher, and said he wished to remain active in the party and in politics. Campbell went on to win the resulting leadership election, and Kennedy subsequently gave his successor full public support. His leadership had lasted slightly less than six years and five months. Question: What did he say at the press conference? Answer:","output":"At the press conference, Kennedy announced that he had been dealing with a drinking problem for the past eighteen months and had sought professional help.

TEXT:Before I start, let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing, which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some. So, it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference. I have also not read the corresponding book; I'm only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context. Potential minor spoilers ahead. I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories (the likes of Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not enjoy this movie at all. While it started out mildly intriguing, it became tedious by the time it was only half-way finished. There are all sorts of problems; let's start with what is probably the most severe: the dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they aren't shouting each other's names for the n-th time, they are usually grunting monosyllables (\\"Kanedaaa!\\", \\"Tetsuoooo!\\", \\"Huh?\\", \\"Grrr\\", etc.). This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It doesn't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals. The grunting is augmented by some random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems haphazard, thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci-fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever. What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction. Not that there's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction, of course; but in this case you'll find yourself asking \\"what's the point of it all, and how long until it's over\\".

I'm giving it a 2-star rating, and I'd like to share my experiences with prospective users. First of all, I notice that the app tends to drain my phone's battery pretty quickly. I understand that some background processes and location services may be necessary, but the excessive power consumption is unacceptable when it starts affecting the overall performance of my device. Additionally, the app often crashes or fails to run properly when I need it the most. I've experienced constant lags and unresponsiveness, making it quite frustrating just to rely on this app for even the most basic tasks. I have a fairly new smartphone, so I don't think this should be a problem. I also find it difficult to navigate through the user interface. The design and layout seem cluttered and not very user-friendly. It takes me quite some time to find the features I'm looking for in the app, and this only adds to my overall disappointment. To sum it all up, the com.google.android.gms app needs significant improvement in terms of performance, battery efficiency, and user-friendliness.

The 18th-century department store known for its rather posh preserves is selling a brand which has added onions, apple - and even bacon to the humble baked bean. While the concoction certainly sounds palatable, the price might make you think twice. At £3.95 for a pot of Proper Beans it's a big ask to dig deep for what you're used to spending no more than £1 on.

Write an article using the following points: As Egypt's finance minister, Youssef Boutros Ghali has pushed for reform. Egypt's economy grew 7.1 percent in 2007, inflation still a concern. World Bank: 17 percent of Egyptian population living in poverty. Ghali: \\"We know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform\\"","output":"Title: Youssef Boutros Ghali and His Influence on Egypt's Sustainable Economic Development Youssef Boutros Ghali, as Egypt's finance minister, is globally acknowledged for his insightful political prowess and determined push for economic reform within Egypt, a pivotal nation in Middle-Eastern Africa. A cornerstone of his tenure as finance minister was his consistent advocacy for comprehensive financial adjustment, economic moderation, and state inclusivity. The year 2007 was a landmark for Egypt's economy under Ghali's leadership as it saw a significant growth of 7.1 percent. This growth rate was in part due to Ghali's robust fiscal policies that focused on privatization, a push for foreign investment, and the promotion of sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and construction. These sectors, in particular, have been pivotal drivers of Egypt's economy, providing significant contributions to national GDP and creating more jobs. However, an enduring concern during Ghali's term and beyond was the nation's pervasive inflation challenges. Despite the robust growth, inflation continued to remain high, driving up the cost of commodities and thereby aggravating the economic difficulties faced by the majority of ordinary Egyptians. Ghali, acutely aware of this issue, promoted policies designed to increase economic stability, but he was hard-pressed to find an immediate solution to Egypt's deeply entwined inflation problem. On a broader level, data from the World Bank elucidated a somewhat grim picture, showing that 17 percent of the Egyptian population was living below the poverty line. This added a new dimension to the economic dialog in Egypt, inferring persistent economic disparities and announcing a call to action to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Ghali was also committed to addressing the issue of poverty in Egypt. His quote, \\"We know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform,\\" sheds light on his approach to reform – one that aimed to be inclusive and beneficial to all Egyptians, especially those afflicted by poverty. His policies often encapsulated this sentiment as he sought to create more comfortable living standards for the less fortunate while fostering a more resilient and sustainable socio-economic environment. In a bid to address the economic dilemma, Ghali worked hard to balance fiscal responsibility and growth with social spending. He sought to engineer economic reforms that could help bridge the gap between the affluent and those less fortunate, aiming to uplift those in the lower strata of society. Though the robust growth and inflation mitigation were significant parts of Ghali's agenda, so too was the quest for equitable wealth distribution. His commitment was towards not merely gross economic advancement, but fair and inclusive progress that witnessed all Egyptians reaping the benefits of economic reform. Youssef Boutros Ghali's tenure as a finance minister was one marked by assertive economic growth juxtaposed with harsh socio-economic realities like inflation and poverty. However, his commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth was a torchbearer for progressive socio-economic policies and reforms in Egypt. His efforts have been an exemplification of targeted financial leadership amid complex dynamics, socio-economic challenges, and shifts in global relations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = −log10 Ka. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.  I am facing a new situation today: Jacob and Thomas were conducting an experiment in a chemistry class. The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, stronger acids have a higher Ka value, indicating a higher ratio of hydrogen ions to acid, as they have a greater tendency to lose their proton. Also, stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids.  In the new situation, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. So, considering the knowledge acquired from the background article, Jacob's strong acid would have a higher Ka value, which means a higher ratio of hydrogen ions to acid, and a smaller pKa compared to Thomas's weak acid.

Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.

Among the topics we address in our course is the retention  of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim  position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

Read this: Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (AGG) was developed from the Finnish \\"naisvoimistelu\\". It differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger' Athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions compared to Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball, ribbon, hoop and clubs are used on the floor area. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts. The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What does AGG stand for?","output":"AGG stands for Aesthetic Group Gymnastics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: This type of x-ray is called a hysterosalpingography, and most doctors recommend you have one before you are artificially inseminated. The purpose of the test is to make sure you have at least one functioning fallopian tube.  Before the test, a technician will use a speculum in your vagina and then will clean out your cervix. He or she will next inject a dye into your cervix with a catheter. An x-ray is then taken with the dye in your uterus and fallopian tubes. If your tubes are open, then dye can be seen spilling out of them on the x-ray. Basically, the procedure will feel much like a pap smear. If you have abnormal results, you may need to get treatment before proceeding with insemination. It's possible you may not be able to go through with insemination at all, but your doctor will discuss your options with you.  Some possible complications this test might show include obstructed fallopian tubes, scarring, polyps or tumors, intrauterine adhesion, or a development disorder in your uterus or fallopian tubes. On a positive note, the results might be normal, as well. While not all locations require this step, you may need to have tests done for sexually transmitted diseases before being inseminated. In addition, if your partner is providing sperm, he will need to be tested too.  Tests can take up to a week to come back, so you'll need to do this well in advance of your insemination appointment. As you will need to be tested for a wide range of diseases, you will likely need to provide a urine sample, as well as have a swab test done of your genital area. In addition, you'll likely need a blood test. Some people choose to try insemination the first time without the addition of fertility drugs, especially if they're having normal periods. Others choose to go ahead and try fertility drugs. One of the main fertility drugs, clomiphene citrate (Clomid), works to help you release eggs when you ovulate.  This drug is mainly for women who are having trouble releasing eggs at all. For example, women with PCOS often have this problem. This drug is usually taken starting at day 3 or 5 of your period, for 5 days in a row. Day 1 of your period is when first bleed. If you don't have regular periods, you may be given a drug to start your period. One consideration is that fertility drugs increase your chances of having more than one baby at once, which makes your pregnancy more dangerous. The risk of multiples with Clomid is 7%, while it is only 1% when trying to conceive without medication. Talk to your doctor about whether this drug is an appropriate choice for you. Summary:","output":"A hysterosalpingography is a special x-ray test that doctors suggest before doing a process called artificial insemination. This test helps to see if your fallopian tubes work well. A doctor puts a dye into your cervix and then takes an x-ray to see how the dye moves. It helps find any blockages or other issues. Sometimes, you and your partner need to get tested for illnesses too. The tests can take some time, so it's important to plan ahead. Some people may need special medicines called fertility drugs to help release eggs and improve chances of having a baby. But, these drugs may increase the chances of having more than one baby at once, which can be risky. You should talk to your doctor about what is best for you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. On 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of American Idol at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed \\"Somebody to Love\\" with the 'Queen Extravaganza' band. Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled. Queen's final concert with Freddie Mercury was in Knebworth in 1986. Brian May commented, \\"It's a worthy challenge for us, and I'm sure Adam would meet with Freddie's approval.\\" Queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue. Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale. A third London date was scheduled for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium, and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.  On 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The performance at London's Olympic Stadium opened with a special remastered video clip of Mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium. Following this, May performed part of the \\"Brighton Rock\\" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of \\"We Will Rock You\\".  On 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in Summer 2014 and Australia and New Zealand in August/September 2014. In an interview with Rolling Stone, May and Taylor said that although the tour with Lambert is a limited thing, they are open to him becoming an official member, and cutting new material with him.  In November 2014 Queen released a new album Queen Forever. The album is largely a compilation of previously-released material but features three new Queen tracks featuring vocals from Mercury with backing added by the surviving members of Queen. One new track, \\"There Must Be More To Life Than This\\", is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson.  In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people. As part of the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2017-2018, the band toured North America in the summer of 2017, toured Europe in late 2017, before playing dates in Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2018.

President James Dale along with his aides addresses the United States concerning the historic event. The President's science aides set up a first contact meeting with the Martians in Pahrump, Nevada as President Dale watches the development on TV with his wife Marsha and his daughter Taffy. Using a translator, the Ambassador of Mars announces that they \\"come in peace\\". When a hippie releases a dove as a symbol of peace, the Ambassador shoots it, then he and the other Martians slaughter a large number of people at the event including General Casey, news reporter Jason Stone, and Billy-Glenn Norris before capturing chat show host Nathalie Lake and her pet Chihuahua Poppy whose heads they later transpose back on one of their flying saucers. Thinking that the Martians assumed that the dove was a symbol of war, President Dale tells Professor Donald Kessler to renegotiate with the Martians, whose ambassador is invited to address the United States Congress. At this meeting, the Martians massacre most of Congress. Donald begs the Martian Ambassador to stop, but is rendered unconscious and taken aboard their ship where he is later shown with his body parts dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated.

Q:Information:  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Warehouse 13 is an American science fiction television series that premiered on July 7, 2009, on the Syfy network.  - NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group, formerly NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment & Cable Studios, is the division of NBCUniversal that oversees all of the conglomerate's cable television channels.  - The WB Television Network (commonly shortened to The WB and short for Warner Bros.) was an American television network that was first launched on broadcast television on January 11, 1995 as a joint venture between the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner and the Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary of the Tribune Company, with the former acting as controlling partner.

Question: \\"What does dukkha explain: Anxiety or Conceptual?\\"  Context: \\"The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought. These four truths explain the nature of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness), its causes, and how it can be overcome. The four truths are:[note 4]\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Dukkha, as one of the central concepts in the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, explains a variety of experiences that can be characterized as suffering, anxiety, or unsatisfactoriness. To fully understand and appreciate the scope of dukkha, it is essential to delve into both its anxiety-related aspects and the conceptual aspects that form the foundation of Buddhist thought. In the context of anxiety, dukkha primarily refers to the psychological and emotional manifestations of suffering or unease. People experience anxiety or stress in various life situations, such as when dealing with uncertainty, managing interpersonal conflicts, or facing challenging events. According to Buddhism, this anxiety arises from our inherent desire for pleasure and attachment to material or immaterial things. These desires and attachments can lead to a cycle of craving and suffering, which perpetuates the experience of anxiety. At a deeper level, dukkha is not limited to anxiety alone, but is understood as a more comprehensive and profound aspect of life. Buddhism teaches that all phenomena, whether mental or physical, are subject to the three marks of existence: impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anatta). Thus, dukkha is not only applicable to the explicit suffering people may feel but also permeates all existence, reflecting the impermanent, insubstantial, and ultimately unsatisfactory nature of reality. The conceptual aspects of dukkha relate to understanding the causes and conditions that give rise to suffering. The second of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the cause of dukkha (samudaya), identifies craving (tanha) and ignorance (avijja) as the root causes of suffering. Craving refers to our attachment to pleasant experiences, our aversion to unpleasant experiences, and the constant desire for a permanent sense of identity. Ignorance, on the other hand, involves a lack of understanding and recognition of the three marks of existence – impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and non-self. Buddhism offers a path to alleviate dukkha, which is the third of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the end of dukkha (nirodha). This path involves the cessation of craving and the increase of wisdom. By letting go of attachments, expectations, and rigid views of the self, one can gradually move towards a state of equanimity, peace, and liberation from suffering. The fourth of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the path leading to the end of dukkha (magga), presents the practical steps to achieve this liberation. Known as the Noble Eightfold Path, it consists of eight interrelated components: right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. By practicing these components, one can cultivate the qualities of wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline, which align with the ultimate goal of Buddhism – cessation of dukkha and attaining enlightenment. In conclusion, dukkha encompasses both the experience of anxiety and the broader conceptual framework that underlies Buddhist thought. Suffering, anxiety, and unsatisfactoriness are integral aspects of human life. By understanding the causes of dukkha and following the Eightfold Path, one can work towards overcoming these afflictions and attaining liberation from suffering. Thus, dukkha is vital to Buddhism, as it explains the problem that the teachings aim to address and the fundamental nature of the human experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It struck a chord, but I couldn’t place which issue it was. Does anyone know? It feels fitting, yet I wish I knew the exact story. **User29:** It’s “Spiderman No More!” — Amazing Spider-Man #50. A classic and poignant choice for Vinny’s. In the comic, Peter Parker decides to give up being Spiderman because of all the burdens that come with it. But eventually, he realizes the importance of his role and returns. Kind of feels metaphorical for the staff moving on to Riki but carrying their legacy with them. **User30:** That’s right, @User29. Seeing that cover at Vinny’s made the whole situation hit even harder. “Spiderman No More!” symbolizes a crucial turning point, mirroring the bittersweet end of Vinny’s era and the beginning of a new chapter with Riki. It’s a powerful message about identity, duty, and continuation - very fitting. **User1:** Wow, thanks for pinpointing the issue, @User29. The symbolism behind choosing “Spiderman No More!” is touching. It feels like a nod not only to their own end but to the resilience and ongoing journey of their staff and the memories within the community. A thoughtful choice for a farewell. **User8:** Couldn’t be a more apt selection. Spiderman’s struggle and eventual reaffirmation of his purpose parallel the emotional journey many of us are feeling with Vinny’s closing and the staff embarking on a new adventure at Riki. It’s a homage that encapsulates hope amid farewell. **User19:** Really puts into perspective the narrative arcs we live through, doesn’t it? Vinny’s may be saying “no more” for now, but the spirit and stories it housed continue, much like our friendly neighborhood Spiderman. It’s comforting, somehow, seeing life imitate art this way. **Moderator:** The choice of “Spiderman No More!” to mark the end (and new beginning) for Vinny’s Toys n Stuff and its staff moving to Riki shows the deep connection and thoughtfulness the store had with its community. It’s a poignant reminder of how stories, whether from comics or real life, weave into the fabric of our experiences, shaping our responses to change. Let’s keep sharing and supporting one another through these transitions."},{"instruction":"What does lethally non-lethal mean?","output":"\\"Lethally non-lethal\\" seems to be an oxymoron at first glance because it combines contradictory terms—lethal (causing death) and non-lethal (not causing death). There is no standard, widely recognized definition for this phrase in military or law enforcement contexts, where terms like \\"lethal\\" and \\"non-lethal\\" are commonly used to describe weapons or tactics. Non-lethal or less-lethal weapons are designed to incapacitate a person with minimal risk of causing death, used for riot control, crowd management, or situations where the use of deadly force is undesirable or unjustified. If the phrase \\"lethally non-lethal\\" is used, it might imply a situation or outcome where a supposedly non-lethal approach or weapon turns out to be lethal, either due to misuse, accidental circumstances, or because the method carries inherent risks that could lead to death. An example might be the use of a \\"non-lethal\\" weapon such as a Taser, which in rare cases can result in fatal outcomes, especially if misused or if the subject has underlying health conditions. Without more context, it's hard to specify exactly what is meant by \\"lethally non-lethal.\\" It could be used in a critical discussion about the potential dangers of non-lethal weapons, to highlight the fine line between control and harm, or in fictional or speculative discussions to explore weapons or tactics that ideally incapacitate without permanent damage but have a risk of lethality."},{"instruction":"What does lethally non-lethal mean if a vigilante in DC Comics does that?","output":"In the context of a DC Comics vigilante using the term \\"lethally non-lethal,\\" it likely refers to a method or approach that stays within the vigilante's code of not taking lives (thus being non-lethal) but is nonetheless extremely dangerous and could potentially lead to death if not carefully controlled. Many vigilantes in comic books, including those in the DC Universe, adhere to a moral code that prohibits killing. However, they often employ tactics, weapons, or methods of intimidation that push the limits of this code, being as aggressive and forceful as possible without directly causing fatal outcomes. For instance, Batman is famously known for his rule against killing. His gadgets, combat techniques, and psychological tactics are designed to incapacitate and deter rather than to kill. However, some of these methods could be deemed \\"lethally non-lethal\\" in the sense that they carry a significant risk of causing severe harm or potentially lethal consequences, especially if there's an error in judgment or execution. Using \\"lethally non-lethal\\" approaches allows such characters to navigate their own moral and ethical boundaries, maintaining their code against killing while still being effective against those who have fewer scruples. It might also highlight the vigilante's skill and precision in controlling the force used to the extent that it stops just short of being lethal, emphasizing their commitment to their principles even in the face of extreme danger or provocation. In a broader thematic sense, employing \\"lethally non-lethal\\" tactics could serve to explore the complexities and paradoxes of vigilante justice within the narratives of DC Comics. It can raise questions about the morality of inflicting pain or potentially endangering lives, even when done in the service of a perceived greater good, and the fine line vigilantes walk between being heroes and becoming similar to those they fight against."},{"instruction":"Нужный точный ответ, Какие есть малоизвестные песни для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF, на площадке Bandcamp","output":"На площадке Bandcamp можно найти множество малоизвестных песен, которые подойдут для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF.

Dir Fabrice Thuriot , Jean-Claude Nemery, Michel Rautenberg, Paris, L’Harmattan, pp 101-114 Introduction L’identité territoriale est souvent caractérisée par sa temporalité longue. Passant par des ancrages mémoriels requérant une présence sur la longue durée ou des transmissions culturelles s’effectuant sur le long terme, mobilisant des marqueurs historiques ou spatiaux aux changements lents (Candau, 1998 ; Piveteau, 1995 ; Marié, 1982), elle présente une relative inertie. Une inertie qui n’est pas d’ailleurs sans contribuer à des interprétations en termes de traditionalisme et de conservatisme conduisant à associer l’identité à la résistance au changement, à la non-modernité, au mieux à la stabilité. Cette représentation a été infléchie dans la période récente notamment par les approches constructivistes (Dubar, 2000) qui en ont montré la dynamique sociale et psychologique aussi bien que politique (Castells, 1999 ; Touraine, 1992). Les mutations rapides des territoires et des territorialités interpellent aujourd’hui ces différentes lectures : l’identité s’y oppose-t-elle, devient–elle obsolète dans ce contexte, ou bien s’ajuste-t-elle aux nouvelles configurations et comment ? Considérant les approches en termes de dynamique et de construction identitaires, nous faisons l’hypothèse d’un système de transformation qui effectue un double réagencement, des identités, et des organisations territoriales. Sur une durée courte, cet agencement passe par la médiation de l’action, action politique et d’aménagement en particulier. Celle-ci n’en est pas le seul vecteur, mais a le mérite de le rendre observable, au travers des intentions et des explicitations qui la portent. L’hypothèse conduit à examiner la dynamique du système identité/action/territoire et en particulier les processus de production et de modification des référents identitaires dans des situations de mutation et de recomposition des territoires. Ces dernières constituent des indicateurs heuristiques par leur caractère novateur et volontariste ainsi que par la redéfinition du rapport entre territoires qu’elles engagent. L’identité pour quoi faire ? Fonctions et contradictions de la rhétorique identitaire dans l’aménagement L’analyse empirique comme les analyses critiques de l’évolution des territorialités montrent une contradiction entre discours et politiques d’aménagement d’une part, territorialités et identités d’autre part. Les premiers indiquent une vivacité du territoire comme forme d’organisation de la puissance publique (Pagès, 2000) ou comme figure utopique de relations sociales et de relations avec un milieu (Roux, 2000) ; les seconds rendent compte de structurations sociales qui ne sont plus fonction de la proximité spatiale, d’entités spatiales hétéroclites, ou encore de la dissolution des grandes références identitaires que sont la nation, la religion, le travail ou l’idéologie. On peut avancer de ce fait que « crise » des territoires et « crises » identitaires s’avèrent concomitants. Parallèlement, les opérations de recomposition institutionnelle des territoires procèdent pour certaines par un changement d’échelle, sans remettre en cause les principes d’homogénéité et de continuité d’une organisation de type territorial. Ces nouvelles entités : pays, communautés de communes et d’agglomérations, parcs naturels, demandent la réalisation de projet ou d’autre procédure nécessitant de définir ou visant à créer une « consistance » territoriale : une unité, une structuration interne, des limites. Elles interrogent sur l’émergence d’une « identité » qui leur permette d’être reconnue et d’entraîner adhésion voire appartenance citoyenne. D’autres organisations ne ressortissent pas de cette catégorie car elles créent des espaces complexes, sans continuité ou sans homogénéité. Il s’agit là des réseaux, des espaces intermédiaires u d’interface, des ensembles transfrontaliers. Ces alliances interrogent quant à elles sur leur statut territorial : dans quelle mesure peuvent elles être identifiées et faire sens, comment peuvent-elles se positionner au sein des entités insitutionnelles de projet alors qu’elles ne répondent à la figure spatiale du territoire ? La question porte plutôt là sur leur capacité à se poser et être identifiées à l’analogue de territoires. Ce « remue-ménage » des territoires conduit à s’intéresser au rapport entre l’intervention publique volontariste qui le porte et l’identité territoriale. Fait-elle avec, contre ou malgré les références identitaires ? Quelles sont les figures référentielles qu’elle produit et qui pourraient constituer des prises pour l’identification pour les ensembles qu’elle fabrique ? Ce contexte d’action publique spécifie notablement la construction identitaire, il demande des supports particuliers, mais il se caractérise surtout par sa temporalité. En effet, on est là sur des changements spatiaux rapides. Et si de nombreux travaux sur la nation ou sur les entités régionales ont montré que l’identité s’ajuste de manière spontanée et progressive sur le temps long (Anderson, 1996), on connaît moins les processus d’infléchissement sur le temps court (Cardy, 1997). Or ceux-ci sont d’autant plus susceptibles de se produire que l’on se trouve face à des identités territoriales labiles (Di Méo, 1996) plus sensibles aux effets de discours. Par ailleurs, le rapport action aménagiste et identité est spécifié par une volonté explicite de réagencer et de produire des « territoires ». La loi d’aménagement du territoire de 1992 a été fondatrice de ce mouvement, que les procédures de projet ont entériné. Ce statut de « territoire » conféré aux objets spatiaux visés par l’intervention s’accompagne nécessairement d’une rhétorique sur l’identité. Celle-ci a été foisonnante dans les années quatre-vingts dix au niveau national (Guigou, 1993 ; DATAR, 1993, Chérèque, 1990), elle est aujourd’hui envahissante aux échelons locaux, à travers pays ou communautés d’agglomérations. L’intentionnalité conduit également à accélérer les manifestations identitaires, discursives ou symboliques. A la différence de processus spontanées et longs intervenant dans la formation du sentiment national ou régional, elle a l’identité pour visée et la procédure opérationnelle pour échéance. La volonté de construction « territoriale » accompagne ainsi une intention ou une manifestation de « construction identitaire ». Face à ce constat, une première question triviale est celle du pourquoi ? Quel est l’enjeu pragmatique de cette invocation identitaire ? Quels en sont l’intérêt et l’usage dans les opérations de recomposition ? Un premier facteur à considérer est celui de la nécessité d’une légitimation politique, légitimation qui par ailleurs change de forme. En effet, si les la mobilité, la labilité et le réseau caractérisent les territorialités sociales contemporaines (), la circonscription territoriale reste la référence organisationnelle des pouvoirs publics et de la fonction politique. Or si l’on peut dire que « le territoire est un support d’unité et d’identité, par l’exercice de la fonction politique » (Retaillé, 1998), l’unité du territoire justifie en retour l’unité de sa représentation politique. Sans l’unité fonctionnelle et sociale qui lui donnait corps, la circonscription spatiale qui fonde la représentation politique perd dès lors sa pertinence. Il en résulte une dissociation entre espaces de l’action et espaces de la reconnaissance de la légitimité : les premiers restent circonscrits et affirmés dans les opérations et procédures, les seconds perdent leur visibilité et leur assise. L’aménagement dès lors doit les réassocier : pour justifier de sa pertinence et de la légitimité de ses acteurs, il lui faut attester de l’existence du territoire qui la fonde, affirmer et construire l’objet de son intervention. Il procède en superposant aire d’intervention et aire politique, en créant l’unité spatiale et fonctionnelle de l’espace politique, par des artefacts à vocation symbolique (périgois). Mais dire et faire le territoire demandent aussi de légitimer une hsitoire et une unité sociale, et de montrer et authentifier l’existence d’une collectif (Micoud, 2000 ; Di Méo, 2002). Ils passent par l’édification d’un récit sur le territoire, dont documents et visualisations sont des outils essentiels par leur fort effet performatif (Debarbieux, 2003 ; Lussault, 1992). Dressant de manière discursive une figure unitaire, donnant une cohérence et une continuité, le récit permet de suppléer le manque de visibilité et l’absence de signes de légitimité des circonscriptions locales. En conséquent le récit identitaire change de nature et de fonction : il ne se situe pas dans une logique d’affirmation ou de reproduction mais bien plus dans une logique performative de validation d’une existence et d’une action publique. Un second facteur de développement de la rhétorique identitaire concerne la mobilisation collective et les référentiels producteurs de mobilisation. L’émergence de techniques de management appliquées à la gestion des territoires conduit en effet à mobiliser l’identité du territoire, dans ses dimensions discursive et symbolique. Les procédures de projet, en sont particulièrement significatives : qu’il s’agisse du projet d’agglomération, du projet de territoire, ou du projet urbain, ce type d’opération fonctionne à l’instar d’un pacte d’alliance autour d’une conception d’un territoire (Rondeau, 1992). Il permet une mobilisation des énergies, et de ce fait une fédération entre acteurs privés et publics. Le projet d’autre part intègre l’hétérogénéité dans un discours sur l’unité future. Il est de ce fait fortement performatif : la figure énoncée pour l’avenir doit susciter une adhésion collective qui permettra de le produire et de le rendre effectif. Le territoire redevient ainsi une référence fondatrice d’une dynamique collective, non plus toutefois à travers des spécificités manifestes, mais dans une dimension virtuelle du discours et de la praxis. La rhétorique identitaire est également liée à des modes de désignation et de différenciation « post-modernes » qui renvoient au sens, et confèrent une dimension existentielle et non plus seulement fonctionnelle aux entités considérées. Les structures d’organisation des pouvoirs, qu’elles soient locales ou nationales, se redéfinissent ainsi en appelant à des « valeurs », des histoires, des « êtres collectifs ». Ces référentiels ont une capacité à produire du sens politique que n’ont plus les référents classiques du modèle républicain, qu’ils soient ébranlés par l’instabilité des cadres institutionnels ou la dérégulation introduite par la mondialisation. Un troisième type de facteur est d’ordre utilitaire et économique. Dans un contexte d’une économie d’échanges d’échelle mondiale, la distinction et le positionnement du territoire acquièrent en effet des enjeux nouveaux. Elles conduisent pour une part à développer et faire état de spécificités définies et circonscrites spatialement. L’imaginaire attaché à un territoire apportant une plus-value symbolique aux productions et conférant de la valeur à l’implantation, la distinction est construite pour une grande part sur un registre existentiel. L’affirmation de l’existence d’un territoire et l’attestation de son « authenticité » prennent ainsi une valeur commerciale. Quelles sont les conséquences de ces nouvelles dimensions fonctionnelles du discours identitaire ? L’appartenance territoriale dans ce processus a vocation à faire du sens politique. Il ne s’agit pas d’une dynamique communautariste ou d’ordre culturel, mais d’une opération de mise en mouvement social. Le territoire acquiert un statut d’objet collectif qui, en l’absence d’autre liant social ou idéologique, peut fonder un intérêt commun. Ces phénomènes montrent le passage d’une identité instituée à une identité instituante dans la mesure où elle définit le territoire auquel elle se réfère et en fait un objet « reconnu, apprécié, jugé, valorisé, inséré dans un système de principes et de normes » (Ghorra- Gobin, 1994). Ce sont des idéologies –au sens de figures, de croyance, d’imaginaires ou de représentations - du territoire qui conduisent à une définition partagée de ce que le territoire peut et doit être. C’est de ce cadre de référence commun que l’on attend un sentiment d’appartenance susceptible de produire du lien social. C’est bien l’identité en tant qu’expression, discours et récit sur l’objet, idées partagées sur l’objet qui pourra instaurer des distinctions et donc inventer des territoires. L’identité actée par les acteurs publics dans l’aménagement lui permet d’être instituante. Ils n’en sont pas les acteurs exclusifs, mais ils ont par nature une mission d’édification. Le mouvement pose question toutefois sur la nature et la signification des identités territoriales. Est-on dans un usage qui ne dépasse pas la dimension de la rhétorique et qui réduirait l’affirmation identitaire à du marketing ? Les caractères identitaires invoqués sont-ils réduites à la sphère symbolique, alimentées et instrumentalisées sur des référents culturels et idéologiques, mais que n’étayent plus des matérialités spatiales ? Dans une critique politique, Pagès et Pélissier (2000) dénoncent la valeur symbolique comme relevant de l’imagerie. Le territoire « devient un mot étendard » dont on utiliserait les connotations de convivialité et de consensus pour « euphémiser » les conflits. On peut y voir également l’expression de la nostalgie (Roux, 2000), une figure de l’harmonie sociale proche du mythe des origines bien plus qu’une utopie. Le signe remplaçant le sens, le territoire réifié peut devenir objet de consommation que chacun instrumentalise1. L’enjeu du discours idéologique sur le territoire peut conduire également à une inversion du lien entre la réalité et les signes : on aménage le monde ou le local selon les représentations qu'on s'en donne identitaire au risque de produire des territoires-simulacres (Baudrillard, 1977, 2003). L’aménagement viserait alors à se conformer à une norme idéologique du territoire, à se doter d’une identité en empruntant aux éléments référentiels emblématiques d’une catégorie par lesquels se fonde l’authenticité. 1 La valorisation marchande des ressources sémantiques du territoire constitue le thème intéressant d’un roman de Julien Barnes (1988) « England, England ». Il imagine un parc territorial à thème : un « england- land », qui reprend les attributs identitaires les plus caricaturaux du pays. Mais ce pays réduit à ses emblèmes, finit par être préféré à l’original. Pour l’auteur la critique porte davantage sur les rapports politiques conduisant à la définition identitaire que sur le rapport à la réalité : le parc constitue un miroir à partir duquel l’Angleterre peut se penser elle-même, car la position dominante et universaliste qu’elle s’est donnée entraîne l’absence d’alter ego. La perte d’identité est là poussée à son extrême puisqu’elle atteint les conditions mêmes de la construction identitaire. Augustin Berque (2002) contre ce type d’interprétation en mettant en exergue la recherche de sens sous-jacente. Les formes de simulacre que sont l’écologisme, le paysagement et le néorégionalisme ne seraient alors que des indicateurs d’un désir de territorialisation c’est- à-dire de construction de son existence en regard d’un milieu. Mais quelles que soient les interprétations politiques ou philosophiques de cette dynamique, il nous semble que, pour le moins, on peut y voir i) une transformation des supports de l’identité, qui deviennent virtuels et symboliques, ii) une transformation de la dynamique du système liant aménagement et identité et territoire, avec un aménagement fondateur de territoire et opérateur d’identités, iii) des enjeux nouveaux à la production de spécificités et de valeurs existentielles qui réactualisent la valeur identitaire du territoire. De quoi parle-t-on ? Identité territoriale, identité de territoire et identification Notre propos jusqu’ici a considéré la rhétorique identitaire, les références à l’identité affirmées par le discours aménagiste ou par le discours politique dans le cadre d’opérations d’aménagement. Cette limitation, tout comme les critiques portant sur des affirmations identitaires uniquement discursives demande à préciser la nature de l’identité en tant qu’objet saisi par l’aménagement. Nous considérons l’identité comme « le processus de construction de sens à partir d’un attribut culturel, ou d’un ensemble cohérent d’attributs culturels, qui reçoit priorité sur toutes les autres sources » (Castells, 1997). Dans l’identité territoriale, c’est le territoire en tant qu’objet spatial porteur de signes culturels et doté de sens qui alimente la construction du sens, du sujet ou de la collectivité. La référence à un espace fonde la conscience d’une singularité collective ; la singularité sociale et culturelle s’alimentant de la singularité de l’espace qu’elle conduit à produire. S’il y a indissociabilité des deux termes du système, pour des raisons méthodologiques de compréhension du processus, cette relation peut être abordée à partir du sujet social, soit à partir de l’objet spatial. Ces deux entrées peuvent être définies comme l’identité territoriale pour la première, l’identité de territoire pour la seconde (Lévy, 2003). L’identité territoriale a pour objet l’individu ou le groupe dans la manière dont ils construisent leur propre identité sociale ou personnelle à partir du territoire. Elle considère les procédures de l’attachement, de la définition d’un « soi » ou d’un « nous » à travers la dimension territoriale. Ces procédures sont celles de la symbolisation, de l’inscription dans l’espace des structures fondatrices de la vie collective : mythes et histoire, autant que centre et limites (Segaud, 1983 ; Bonnemaison, 2000). L’identité de territoires constitue une forme d’objectivation. Elle rend compte d’une caractérisation par laquelle le territoire est défini dans une singularité qui lui confère un statut d’objet propre et d’objet spatial. En tant que telle, elle relève d’abord d’un acte de catégorisation sociale (Dubar, 1998), permettant de distinguer et de différencier et qui aboutit à une désignation qui est reconnaissance et octroi d’identité. Mais elle marque également une séparation entre le sujet qui désigne et l’objet qui se voit affecté de caractères propres. Si la spécificité territoriale devient le signifiant et le signifié de l’existence du collectif, le territoire acquiert donc là un statut d’objet indépendant de ce collectif. Cette approche a l’intérêt d’ouvrir sur le problème des normes et des référents de l’identification : comment désigne-t-on ? Tous les modes de désignation du territoire ont- ils la même valeur dans la construction d’une identité ? En reprenant une définition de Mucchieli (1986), deux types de caractérisation nous semblent pouvoir être distingués, l’un positiviste, l’autre existentialiste. La caractérisation « positiviste » ressortit de la spécificité. Elle fait valoir des données qui distinguent une région parmi d’autres sur des critères mesurables ou vérifiables. Elle a pu donner lieu à des sortes d’état-civil du territoire, plus proches de la carte d’identité que d’une approche sensible. Sur la base d’une critérologie convenue, elle réalise une nomenclature qui fonde le descriptif « géographique ». L’aménagement et l’analyse spatiale sont très friands de cette procédure, soit qu’ils s’attachent à décrire des mailles existantes, soit qu’ils visent à établir des homogénéités spatiales, et des discontinuités à partir desquelles définir un découpage. La caractérisation dans un registre existentialiste, renvoie à la personnification, dont Lipiansky (1992) a montré qu’elle constitue une forme essentielle de l’expression d’une identité collective. Dans cette opération, le territoire est affecté des propriétés de l’individualité humaine : unité, cohésion, continuité dans le temps, etc. On lui attribue également des traits de caractères propres : sympathie, amabilité, dynamisme, froideur, etc. Cette modalité marque également la saisie d’un espace dans sa dimension sensible, dans les émotions qu’il peut procurer, dans la subjectivité d’un ressenti. Elle constitue de ce point de vue la reconnaissance d’un rapport sensible à un espace, de sentiments et de vécus personnels. Cette subjectivation a pu prêter le flanc à la naturalisation dès lors qu’elle est considérée non plus comme une relation mais comme un attribut de la ville : « il est courant de dire que les lieux ont du génie et parfois même une mémoire ; disons plutôt que nous les leur prêtons (Retaillé, 1997). La personnification par ailleurs saisit dans une approche holistique une totalité, elle représente une synthèse intégrative (Mucchieli, 1986) de traits particuliers sous la forme d’une figure leur donnant une cohérence. Cette procédure, en considérant le collectif dans des formes analogues à celle de l’individu, le rend appréhendable. Elle permet de le dissocier et de l‘autonomiser en lui conférant un statut d’ « être » pourvu d’une existence propre. Cette subjectivation participe donc à la mise à distance d’un objet territorial, elle porte un discours sur le collectif qui suppose un regard externe, et qui s’alimente à un savoir commun. Affecté d’un comportement et de caractères propres, le territoire est posé comme une donnée en soi, dont on peut s’ériger le porte-parole, voire instrumentaliser (Candau, 1998). Cette distinction entre identité territoriale et identité de territoire a d’abord une valeur heuristique. Elle permet de ne pas faire l’amalgame entre un discours aménagiste qui vise à caractériser un territoire et une intention politique d’intervention sur la culture par instrumentalisation de l’identité. Le premier peut être levier du second mais l’analyse de l’un ne permet pas de rendre nécessairement compte du second. Ce qui est en jeu dans le discours aménagiste est un discours sur l’identité de territoire, qui autonomise ce dernier en le substantialisant. L’analyse de ses effets dans la construction identitaire personnelle demanderait pour le moins une analyse sur le long terme. A court terme, il fait état d’une production de référents d’identification. Une production publique, parfois élaborée de manière collective, dont on attend une reconnaissance et une diffusion. Ces référents à la fois fédèrent autour d’une figure et indexent cette fédération à un territoire L’analyse des référents d’identification proposés par l’aménagement permet de ne pas réduire le discours à une production d’images qui ressortirait de la communication publicitaire. Elle permettre d’atteindre le fonctionnement d’un processus de construction identitaire et de le montrer sous son aspect dynamique. L’identification représente cette activité « toujours incomplète, inachevée et interminable dans laquelle nous sommes engagés par nécessité » (Bauman, 2002). Elle ne s’effectue pas par acquisition, et incorporation de traits déjà définis, comme dans les entreprises de diffusion du sentiment national, mais aussi par sélection et redéfinition de critères et indicateurs discriminants. Or les recompositions territoriales nous semblent tout particulièrement remettre en jeu les identifications. Dans la mesure où elles modifient les relations entre territoires, elles demandent de revoir la présentation de soi, et d’affirmer une distinction, mais une distinction qui soit attractive et fédératrice dans une politique d’alliance. Ce jeu de distinction et d’ouverture que rendent nécessaire les donnes économiques et politiques nous semblent tout particulièrement susceptibles de montrer une transformation profonde des logiques d’identification, car il est peu compatible avec la fermeture et le repli. Dans les recompositions se joue ainsi la production de références identitaires modernes, ajustées à un contexte global. Les modes d’identification des espaces recomposés Dans les recompositions, comment dire alors l’unité de l’entité fabriquée ? Quels sont les référents mobilisés pour dire une identité de territoires, et qui compte tenu de ce que nous avons dit, sont susceptibles de faire sens, de montrer une personnalité sinon un être collectif, tout en confortant l’objectif qui les mobilise ? 2. Dans les matériaux accompagnant les opérations de recomposition que nous avons pu analysés, deux modes de présentation de l’identité peuvent être distingués, en fonction des figures géographiques convoquées. Un premier type de figures est constitué d’objets naturels englobants : Il y est fait un abondant recours, par exemple dans les dénominations des pays. On trouve là des références à d’anciennes régions naturelles : Voironnais, Bray, Saintonge, etc, avec souvent des déclinaisons organiques : « Cœur Entre-deux-Mers », ou marketing : « Ardèche verte », « Provence verte », « Landes nature ». Une autre catégorie utilise des termes géographiques, dont souvent des unités morphologiques plus ou moins localisées : « Drôme des Collines », « Hautes falaises » et « Risle estuaire » dans l’Eure, « Sept vallées » en Pas de Calais, « Crêtes préardennaises », « Saverne Plaine et Plateau », « Vallées d’Azur-Mercantour », etc. Le procédé marque une invention spatiale, dans la mesure où il ne se borne pas à utiliser d’anciens intitulés pour leur affecter un nouveau périmètre, mais crée une entité nouvelle qu’il personnalise par un nom. Il témoigne également de la valeur référentielle de cette terminologie géographique générique, crêtes, vallées, estuaire, monts et vaux. Quelle en est la valeur dans l’action ? Il s’agit là d’un mode de désignation dont il faut se demander la signification dans la définition d’une identité de territoire, ainsi que la valeur opérationnelle dans un contexte d’aménagement. Elles sont révélatrices des représentations publiques de l’unité d’une entité composite et non pas d’une réalité des identités territoriales. Du point de vue de leur usage stratégique, ces figures ont une fonction d’attestation de l’unité car elles renvoient à des formes concrètes, quasi de bon sens et qui donc facilitent l’adhésion et la confiance. Elles rationalisent également le lien : la géographie et les experts géographes offre des attestations reconnues comme scientifiques et donc « vraies ». Elles ont aussi pour conséquence paradoxale de fonder par la nature l’identité d’un territoire qui est de fait inventé. Le milieu naturel est implicitement posé comme un déterminant que l’on aurait redécouvert et que l’on viendrait faire ressurgir. On voit bien la portée politique et l’importance légitimante du procédé. L’invention du territoire est dé- 2 Cette partie résulte de travaux empiriques menés sur les réseaux, les coopérations transfrontalières ou l’intercommunalité. Les discours produits à l’occasion des ces opérations, ont été analysés pour rendre compte des façons de représenter et dire l’existence des entités fabriquées (cf Fourny, 2005). socialisée, dé-shistoricisée et le complexe travail d’unification politique est diminué, laissant accroire qu’il consiste à retrouver et à se mouler dans une unité naturelle préexistante. Un autre type de figures est d’ordre articulatoire. Il apparaît dans des structures où l’intégration est moindre que dans les pays ou les communautés de communes : réseau, ou alliances où la discontinuité n’est pas destinée à disparaître à courte échéance. Les figures communes sont là celles des flux, de la mobilité et de l’échange, dans leur étendue ou dans leur histoire : bassin d’emploi, réseaux migratoires historiques. Elles renvoient aussi à des lieux ou objets partagés qui ne mettent pas en jeu la globalité du territoire, mais instaurent une sorte de mitoyenneté : la frontière, un espace ou une limite naturelle tel qu’une rivière ou une zone verte, un monument. Ces procédures sont intéressantes par ce qu’elles territorialisent le flux, l‘inscrivent au moins symboliquement dans un espace. Ces figures transforment les significations des objets géographiques, font par exemple de la discontinuité politique (la frontière) un lien. Elles mettent en exergue, patrimonialisent la limite, les marques spatiales qui ont produit, créés ou symbolisés l’écart et la différence. Ces figures référentielles ont une valeur symbolique et instrumentale. .

En pleine mutation des territoires, Fourny interroge la manière dont l'identité s'ajuste, résiste ou devient obsolète face à ces changements rapides. Elle met en lumière l'approche constructiviste, soulignant la dynamique psychosociale et politique de l'identité territoriale. Selon elle, une certaine inertie de l'identité territoriale, souvent perçue comme traditionaliste ou conservatiste, joue un rôle significatif face à la modernisation et à la stabilité. Cependant, les territoires en mutation présentent un défi intéressant à cette représentation, suggérant une adaptabilité et une transformation des identités territoriales. Fourny propose alors de considérer l'identité territoriale comme un système en transformation, où la médiation de l'action, notamment politique et d'aménagement, joue un rôle clé. Elle évoque comment, à travers des projets d'aménagement et des politiques publiques, les identités et les organisations territoriales sont réagencées pour s'adapter aux nouvelles configurations spatiales. La recherche s'attarde sur les fonctions et les contradictions de la rhétorique identitaire dans l'aménagement du territoire. Fourny examine l'évolution des discours et politiques d'aménagement qui, malgré la fluidité et la complexité des territorialités contemporaines, continuent de chercher une assise dans l'identité territoriale. Elle identifie un paradoxe où, malgré une apparente crise identitaire et territoriale, l'aménagement cherche à produire ou à réaffirmer des identités territoriales pour légitimer son action et mobiliser des collectifs autour de projets de territoire. L'article critique cette instrumentalisation de l'identité territoriale, souvent réduite à une rhétorique de marketing territorial, sans pour autant nier la nécessité d'un sentiment d'appartenance et d'une identification collective. Fourny explore les dynamiques à l’œuvre dans les recompositions territoriales, soulignant comment ces processus cherchent à créer des spécificités et des valeurs existentielles ajustées au contexte globalisé. En résumé, Marie-Christine Fourny interroge de manière critique le rôle et la manipulation de l'identité territoriale dans les politiques publiques et les stratégies d'aménagement. Elle met en évidence les tensions entre une quête de légitimité, un besoin de mobilisation collective et l'utilisation instrumentalisée de l'identité, tout en reconnaissant l'ajustement nécessaire des identités territoriales dans un monde en constante transformation."},{"instruction":"Нужный точный ответ, Какие есть малоизвестные песни для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF, (нужен сэмпл со словами ) на площадке Bandcamp","output":"Извините, я не могу предоставить точных ответов на запросы об использовании малоизвестных песен для создания сэмплов или ремиксов.

Given the resizing to \`64x64\` pixels and then applying max pooling with a kernel of \`2x2\` and stride \`2\`, which halves both dimensions, the dimension reductions are not accounted for fully in the \`// 4\` operation in your linear layer size computation. Considering that the operation will be applied twice if you apply two max pooling operations (which is common if you have more than one convolutional and max pooling layer combination), and assuming you're doing it once as per your current code, the size calculation does not need the \`// 4\` since you've only applied one pooling operation reducing each dimension by half. Therefore, the correct input size to \`fc1\` should consider the size after the pooling operation, which should be \`(64/2) * (64/2) * num_channels_out_of_last_conv_layer\`. You mentioned you're running on a CPU with Google Colab and don't plan to use GPU, but there's no specific constraint in your code that would not allow it to run on a GPU, either. It's well-prepared to run on any device specified by the \`device\` variable. Here’s the corrected section for the \`Net\`: \`\`\`python class Net(nn.Module): def __init__(self, num_classes): super(Net, self).__init__() self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 8, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1) self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0) self.fc1 = nn.Linear(8 * 32 * 32, 64) # Corrected for after pooling self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, num_classes) \`\`\` The primary correction here is to the \`self.fc1\` argument where it now correctly calculates the input size as \`8 * 32 * 32\`, this matches the output height and width after the pooling layer (64/2 = 32) and multiplied by the number of output channels from your first convolutional layer (8). Make sure that whenever you update your network architecture (like adding more convolutional layers or changing layer specifications), you adjust this calculation accordingly. Everything else in your implementation follows good practices for setting up a dataset, transforming images, defining a model, and training/testing loops in PyTorch. However, always double-check that the paths for your dataset are correct and accessible in Google Colab to ensure that your dataset is loaded correctly."},{"instruction":"Нужный точный ответ, Какие есть малоизвестные песни для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF, (нужен сэмпл со словами ) на площадке Bandcamp","output":"К сожалению, не могу предложить конкретные малоизвестные песни на площадке Bandcamp, подходящие для создания сэмпла в стиле GREAF.

Passersby this Halloween were met with a chilling sight: the store’s windows splattered with fake blood, proclaiming “GHA is DEAD!!!” A solitary tombstone placed strategically at the entrance serves as a eerie testament to the store’s demise. For over two decades, Glasgow Halloween Central has been the heart and soul of Halloween celebrations in the city, offering an unparalleled selection of costumes, decorations, and party essentials. Year after year, as October approached, the store would transform into a hub of activity, with excited children and adults alike perusing its aisles, planning their perfect Halloween look. The news of the store’s closure came as a shock to many, especially given its emblematic presence and contribution to the local Halloween culture. The owners, in a statement released early this morning, cited a concoction of rising rental costs, competition from online retailers, and the changing landscape of retail as the grim reapers of their business. “It is with heavy hearts that we announce the closure of Glasgow Halloween Central,” the statement read. “We’ve seen generations of families come through our doors, and it’s been an absolute pleasure to add a bit of magic and fright to your Halloweens. We tried to fight the good fight, but it seems this is one battle we couldn’t win. Thank you, Glasgow, for all the love and support over the years. It’s been a thrilling ride.” The statement did little to assuage the sense of loss felt by the community. John McAllister, a regular customer, shared his disappointment: “It’s truly the end of an era. My kids grew up visiting this store every Halloween. It was more than just a shop; it was a tradition, a part of our community’s fabric. Seeing it go out like this, it’s heartbreaking.” As the night falls on Sauchiehall Street, the fake blood-splattered windows and the ominous tombstone seem to symbolize not just the end of Glasgow Halloween Central but perhaps the end of an era for traditional retail in the heart of Glasgow. The cityscape is ever-evolving, but for many, this Halloween will be remembered not for the ghosts and ghouls that roam the night but for the ghost of a beloved store that once was.

User1: Hey everyone! Been a while since I’ve wandered down Sauchiehall Street, but I found myself there this past weekend. Couldn’t help but notice the old Glasgow Halloween Central spot still sitting empty. Has anyone seen it recently? Is that eerie send-off still on display? User2: Passed by just a few days ago. It’s quite a sight! The fake blood and the “GHA is DEAD!!!” sign are long gone, but the place still has an abandoned feel to it. No new tenants yet, it seems. Quite sad to see such a vibrant part of our Halloween history standing empty like that. User3: Yeah, I saw it too. The tombstone that was part of the original décor has also disappeared. The whole facade just looks neglected now, with peeling paint and some graffiti tagging. It’s a real shame. That place used to be buzzing with energy, especially around October. User4: I’ve heard some folks saying it’s cursed, that no new business wants to move in because of the “GHA is DEAD” stunt. Sounds like urban legends starting to swirl around it. Glasgow loves its ghost stories, doesn’t it? User5: @User4, that’s Glasgow for you! But honestly, it’s probably more to do with high rents and less foot traffic in that part of Sauchiehall Street. Still, it adds an intriguing layer to the story of the place. User6: Does anyone know if there are any plans for the space? It would be great to see something new breathe life into that spot. Maybe a new Halloween or party shop in homage to the old GHA? User7: @User6 Last I heard, there was talk of a developer interested in the property, but nothing concrete. Seems like the fate of that space is still up in the air. I agree, though – would love to see a new business that nods to its past. Moderator: It’s fascinating to see the interest in the old Glasgow Halloween Central spot. Let’s keep this thread as a space for updates and memories. Who knows, maybe we’ll see a revival yet.

Have you seen the old Glasgow Halloween Central on Sauchiehall Street lately? Just passed by this morning, and there’s some exciting news – it’s becoming a BHF (British Heart Foundation) charity shop! User1: Really? That’s amazing news! After all the years of it sitting empty, it’s great to see some life in that spot again. And for a good cause too! User9: Yes, saw the signs up yesterday. They’re currently refurbishing the interior. It’s quite the transformation from its macabre send-off. So glad to see it being put to good use. And honestly, a charity shop in that location could do really well. User3: That’s a fantastic update! The BHF does some incredible work. It’s definitely a welcomed change. Hopefully, it’ll bring more foot traffic to that part of Sauchiehall Street again. Can’t wait to check it out when it opens. User5: It’s kind of poetic, isn’t it? A place that once celebrated the end and spookiness of things now champions the heart and the fight against heart disease. A genuinely positive twist for that old building’s story. User10: As someone who has a personal connection to the work BHF does, this is heartwarming to hear. It’s going to be interesting to see if they keep any of the old Halloween store charm in the new setup or if it’ll be a complete overhaul. User6: @User10, from what I could peek, it looks like a complete overhaul. Clean, bright, and inviting. No traces of its spooky past. But who knows? Maybe they’ll have a Halloween-themed event or display in homage when October rolls around! User11: Great to see a valuable community asset filling that space finally. And given BHF’s reputation, I’m sure they’ll do a fantastic job. Does anyone know when the grand opening is? User2: I walked by earlier, and a sign says the grand opening is scheduled for next month.

Write a follow up in 2016 where BHF has moved out, but a new KikoRiki themed kids store named Riki is opening, and there is a transitional period facade up, with a similar vein to the 2006 send off for GHC, with fake blood, but being cleaned up by a cute familiar face saying “Watch this space, which will soon be very much alive” Thread Title: Farewell BHF, Hello Riki! Sauchiehall’s Latest Transformation User12: Sad to see the BHF store close down on Sauchiehall Street, but it seems there’s already something new brewing. Passed by today and saw an eye-catching setup. Looks like a kids’ store named Riki is moving in, themed around KikoRiki. There’s this intriguing transitional facade up – echoes of the GHC send-off with fake blood but in a less macabre, more playful twist. User1: Riki, as in the KikoRiki series? My kids are going to lose their minds! But wait, fake blood? That’s an…interesting choice for a kids’ store. 😅 User12: @User1, it’s actually quite clever! The fake blood looks like it’s being cleaned up by one of the KikoRiki characters, with a bubble saying, “Watch this space, which will soon be very much alive”. Definitely caught my attention – and made me chuckle. User13: I saw that too! It’s a brilliant nod to the GHC saga and such a smart way to generate buzz. Really shows a deep understanding of the local history and spirit. Plus, a cute way to involve the kids. User4: Finally, some good news for that spot! It’s been through so much transition, but this feels like a promising fit. KikoRiki has a big fan base, and a dedicated store could become a new landmark on Sauchiehall. User14: Does anyone know when Riki is slated to open? And will they be keeping this playful theme going inside the store? I’m all for businesses that embrace and add to the local culture. User15: Talked to one of the workers there – they’re targeting an opening in a couple of months. As for the theme, he mentioned interactive play zones and themed sections that’ll make you feel like you’re stepping into the KikoRiki world! User3: This is the kind of innovative approach that keeps Sauchiehall Street vibrant. A store that not only appeals to kids but also engages with the community’s history and humor is refreshing.

Write that Krash the blue Rabbit is cleaning it up, the blood splatters is meant to be a nod to how GHC bowed out Thread Title: Krash the Blue Rabbit Takes on Sauchiehall Street! User8: Guys, did anyone else catch that it’s Krash from KikoRiki cleaning up the transitional facade at the upcoming Riki store? The homage to how GHC said goodbye with the fake blood being “cleaned up” is both clever and heartwarming. User16: Absolutely saw that! It’s a playful yet respectful nod to the history of the location. Having Krash there, broom in hand, dealing with the “mess,” is a genius way to bridge the old with the new. Shows Riki isn’t just about taking over a space but becoming a part of its story. User1: Krash is such a fitting character for this too, given his energetic and somewhat chaotic nature in KikoRiki. It’s a fun, creative way to make light of the transition and engage the community. Really makes the statement that something new and lively is coming. User17: Honestly, it’s marketing gold. Recognizing the GHC send-off and turning it into something this playful and family-friendly speaks volumes. Plus, it’s generated this buzz amongst us, hasn’t it? Well played, Riki, well played. User9: I was initially skeptical when I heard GHC’s facade was going to be reimagined for Riki’s arrival. But seeing it executed with such charm and wit has completely won me over. It’s a touching tribute wrapped in fun. I’m all in for supporting Riki now! User18: Took the kids to see the setup yesterday, and they absolutely loved it. Explained to them the connection to the old Halloween shop, and even they appreciated the creativity behind it. Krash with a broom was a hit! Can’t wait for the store opening. User19: Did anyone snap a picture? I’m currently out of town and dying to see this. It sounds like such a unique approach, blending homage with anticipation for what Riki will bring to our beloved Sauchiehall. User4: @User19, I did! I’ll post a couple of pictures on the thread. It’s really something seeing it in person. It stirs up a good bit of nostalgia while also making you excited about what’s next.

User20: Can’t believe Riki is opening in just 4 weeks! Been following the updates on this thread, and I’m super curious—do you think they kept the “GHA is DEAD” tribute as part of their store setup? Or was it just for the facade during the transition? User1: Good question! Last time I walked by, the construction covers were still up, but there was a sense of playfulness peeking through. If they’ve been this thoughtful during the transition, I wouldn’t put it past them to incorporate some aspects of their clever homage into the store itself. User8: I’m keeping my fingers crossed they did. That mix of respect and humor really set a positive tone for the transition. It’d be a shame if they didn’t carry some element of that energy into the store. Maybe in the form of a dedicated section or interactive display? User21: It would be a smart move on Riki’s part. The GHC tribute created quite the buzz and showed a great way to respect local history while moving forward. I’m eager to see how they tie in the old with the new, especially given the significant legacy of GHC. User14: Has anyone else noticed the renovation seems to promise a lot of interactive and engaging experiences? Considering that, it wouldn’t surprise me if they’ve found a way to weave the GHC tribute into an interactive part of the store—maybe even something educational about the history of Sauchiehall Street. User5: I hope they maintain that playful and respectful homage. It not only connects Riki with the community but also educates the younger generation about local traditions and the evolution of businesses in Glasgow. Keeping my eyes peeled for the grand opening! User22: Walked past the site today, and there’s definitely an air of excitement building up! Though everything’s still under wraps, you can tell they’re going all out. If they managed to infuse the store with as much character as the facade had, we’re in for a treat. User11: Whether they include the GHC tribute or not, I’m just thrilled that this spot will no longer be vacant. Sauchiehall Street has seen its fair share of ups and downs, and having Riki open up with such positive vibes is refreshing. Can’t wait for the grand opening!

Known for its iconic blue walls and red corners, Vinny’s was a cornerstone for many of our childhoods, offering an ever-evolving selection of toys and games, from Spiderman to Pokemon and even KikoRiki in its later years. Despite their efforts, they’ve succumbed to competition. Noticed a Spiderman cover on their door today, symbolizing their final bow. User8: Such sad news. Vinny’s was a staple of my early toy-hunting days. Their selection of Doctor Who memorabilia was unmatched. It’s tough seeing such cherished places close. On the brighter note, I heard that the staff are transferring to Riki. At least they’re landing on their feet. User23: This really hits hard. Vinny’s Toys n Stuff was more than just a toy store; it was a community hub where fans and collectors came together. I’m glad to hear that the staff will continue their journey at Riki, which has been a beacon of success in these changing times. User1: Riki’s thriving nature amidst other closures is a testament to its innovation and ability to adapt. I’ve seen how they’ve continuously evolved since opening, always bringing something new to the table while honoring Glasgow’s rich retail history. It’s bittersweet to see one legend close as another grows. User14: On my last visit to Riki, it was evident how it’s become a cultural and community epicenter, much like Vinny’s used to be. It’s comforting to know that Riki is absorbing not just the staff but, hopefully, the spirit and legacy of Vinny’s. User26: Does anyone know if there will be any kind of farewell event or sale at Vinny’s? It would be nice to have one last memory in the store, maybe snag a piece of memorabilia for old times’ sake. User7: The end of Vinny’s feels like watching a piece of my childhood close its doors. But, the silver lining in its staff moving to Riki gives hope that what made Vinny’s special will live on in a new form. Riki’s been fantastic at community engagement and celebration of local history; they’re the perfect place to continue Vinny’s legacy. User19: I’m curious to see if Riki might incorporate some of Vinny’s iconic elements into their store. A dedicated corner or an homage of sorts. It would be a wonderful way to remember and honor Vinny’s lasting impact on Glasgow’s toy scene. User27: It’s a changing of the guard, in a way. Vinny’s Toys n Stuff will be dearly missed. Here’s to hoping that its spirit will indeed find a new home within Riki’s vibrant walls. And maybe this transition can serve as a beacon of community continuity – out with the old, but not forgotten, in with the new, but ever respectful. Moderator: The closing of Vinny’s Toys n Stuff marks the end of an era for Glasgow’s toy enthusiasts. Yet, the transition of its staff to Riki offers a glimmer of hope and continuity for our community. Let’s honor Vinny’s legacy by supporting each other through these changes and continue sharing our experiences and memories. Whether it’s farewells or new beginnings, our community’s spirit remains strong. — This fictional follow-up captures the collective nostalgia and resilient spirit of a community faced with the closing of a beloved local toy store, Vinny’s Toys n Stuff, and the thriving success of another, Riki. Amidst changing retail landscapes, the story reflects on the importance of adaptation, the strength of community bonds, and the enduring legacy of local institutions. Write a follow up asking which Spiderman comic’s can be seen on the door, and a user says it’s Spiderman No More Thread Title: Which Spiderman Comic Graces Vinny’s Farewell Door? User28: Walking past the now-closed Vinny’s Toys n Stuff, I couldn’t help but pause at the Spiderman comic cover they chose for their door. It struck a chord, but I couldn’t place which issue it was. Does anyone know? It feels fitting, yet I wish I knew the exact story. User29: It’s “Spiderman No More!” — Amazing Spider-Man #50. A classic and poignant choice for Vinny’s. In the comic, Peter Parker decides to give up being Spiderman because of all the burdens that come with it. But eventually, he realizes the importance of his role and returns. Kind of feels metaphorical for the staff moving on to Riki but carrying their legacy with them. User30: That’s right, @User29. Seeing that cover at Vinny’s made the whole situation hit even harder. “Spiderman No More!” symbolizes a crucial turning point, mirroring the bittersweet end of Vinny’s era and the beginning of a new chapter with Riki. It’s a powerful message about identity, duty, and continuation - very fitting. User1: Wow, thanks for pinpointing the issue, @User29. The symbolism behind choosing “Spiderman No More!” is touching. It feels like a nod not only to their own end but to the resilience and ongoing journey of their staff and the memories within the community. A thoughtful choice for a farewell. User8: Couldn’t be a more apt selection. Spiderman’s struggle and eventual reaffirmation of his purpose parallel the emotional journey many of us are feeling with Vinny’s closing and the staff embarking on a new adventure at Riki. It’s a homage that encapsulates hope amid farewell. User19: Really puts into perspective the narrative arcs we live through, doesn’t it? Vinny’s may be saying “no more” for now, but the spirit and stories it housed continue, much like our friendly neighborhood Spiderman. It’s comforting, somehow, seeing life imitate art this way. Moderator: The choice of “Spiderman No More!” to mark the end (and new beginning) for Vinny’s Toys n Stuff and its staff moving to Riki shows the deep connection and thoughtfulness the store had with its community. It’s a poignant reminder of how stories, whether from comics or real life, weave into the fabric of our experiences, shaping our responses to change.

Write a convo wondering how long GHC's farewell was up for before being taken down","output":"Thread Title: GHC's Farewell Display Duration? User31: Been reminiscing about the old Glasgow Halloween Central store lately and got into quite the discussion with a friend about its iconic farewell display – the one with fake blood and the “GHA is DEAD!!!” sign. Does anyone remember how long that display was up before it got taken down? It was such a memorable send-off. User1: Oh, that was quite the sight, wasn’t it? If my memory serves me right, the display wasn’t up for very long. Given the nature of it, I believe it was only a few days, maybe a week at most, before they cleared everything out. It was striking but brief. User32: Yeah, it was definitely a short-lived moment. I remember passing by, thinking I’d snap a picture the next time, but by my next visit, the signs and the faux blood were gone. Must have been less than a week, as you mentioned, @User1. User33: It was such a dramatic statement; really caught the essence of Halloween Central’s flair for the dramatic. Shame it was so temporary; it was a memorable piece of street art in its own right. But I guess the quick removal was out of respect for whatever was coming next. User29: I think @User33’s right about the respect aspect. Plus, the nature of the display might not have sat well with everyone in the public – it was pretty intense for a storefront. Though short-lived, it made its mark on all of us who saw it in person. Truly the end of an era. User34: In a way, keeping it brief made it all the more impactful. It became one of those “you had to see it to believe it” moments in Glasgow’s retail history. Does anyone have photos? Would be great to see them again for those of us who missed it. User8: Sadly, I don’t have photos, but I do remember the buzz it created among locals and even online. It sparked discussions far beyond those who saw it in person, extending GHC’s legacy a bit further than its physical presence did. Moderator: The farewell display of Glasgow Halloween Central remains a poignant moment in the city’s memory. Though brief, its impact and the discussions it sparked highlight the strong community connection to local businesses and landmarks. If anyone does have photos or further details about the display's exact duration, sharing them here would be wonderful for preserving and cherishing those memories."},{"instruction":"Write a convo saying the parodied version in 2016 ia more well documented","output":"Thread Title: The 2016 Parodied Farewell of GHC – A Well-Documented Event User35: Has anyone else noticed that the 2016 parodied version of Glasgow Halloween Central's (GHC) original farewell is way more well-documented than the 2006 send-off? It’s fascinating to see how much more attention and detail was captured the second time around. User1: Absolutely, @User35. I think it really highlights how much social media and our attitudes towards documenting everything have evolved in that decade. There were lots more photos, videos, and even some blog posts about the 2016 parody event compared to the original. User36: The power of smartphones and social platforms cannot be overstated. By 2016, everyone had a camera in their pocket, ready to capture any moment. Plus, the community really rallied around the idea of giving GHC another memorable send-off, even if it was in jest. User29: I saw a couple of those blog posts. They detailed not just the event but also threw in some history about GHC and its impact on local Halloween culture. It was a nice blend of tribute and humor, showing a sensitivity to preserving our city's retail heritage in a digital format. User37: Also, locals seemed more prepared to participate—in a way, it was not just about remembering GHC but also about making a statement on how the community responds to change. There was an almost collective effort to ensure this piece of local history was well-documented. User38: I think there was a bigger sense of irony and playfulness in 2016, with people sort of embracing the absurdity and nostalgia. Those participating and documenting knew they were part of a unique 'reenactment'. It turned a farewell into a communal, almost celebratory event reflecting on both the past and how we engage with the present through media. User34: Does anyone have links to some of those blog posts or videos? It would be great to compile a little digital archive here on our forum. For both historical interest and as a way to showcase our community's spirit. Moderator: An excellent idea, @User34. If any members have photographs, videos, blog posts, or any digital memorabilia from the 2016 parodied GHC farewell, please share. It’s important to preserve these moments, not just as memories but as reflections of our community’s evolution in how we document, share, and remember significant local events.

The closure of Glasgow Halloween Central (GHC), a beloved local store that had served the community with costumes, decorations, and Halloween spirit for over two decades, was marked not by somber memorials but by a humorous, affectionate parody of its own dramatic 2006 send-off. This event not only celebrated the legacy of GHC but also set the stage for the next chapter in Glasgow’s retail landscape, leading to the success of a new store, Riki. **The Purpose Behind the Parody** The parodic farewell was a testament to the impact GHC had on the local community. Rather than focusing on the loss, the event aimed to highlight the joy, creativity, and communal spirit GHC had inspired over the years. In a dazzling display of fake blood and playful “GHA is DEAD!!!” signs reminiscent of GHC’s original closing, the community came together to honor the past while looking hopefully towards the future. This unique approach to marking the end of an era served several purposes. Firstly, it fostered a sense of unity and shared history among Glasgow’s residents, reminding them of the many Halloweens they had celebrated together. Secondly, it showcased the community’s ability to face change with resilience and good humor. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it ensured that the spirit of GHC would not be forgotten, even as a new tenant prepared to take over its iconic Sauchiehall Street location. **Riki: A Success Born from Legacy** Enter Riki, a vibrant, innovative store that promised to fill the void left by GHC’s departure. Specializing in children’s toys and themed around the popular cartoon series KikoRiki, Riki opened its doors with the community’s full support, buoyed by the positive energy of the parodic farewell. The store understood the importance of legacy and the value of community engagement, integrating itself into the fabric of Glasgow’s retail scene with respect for its predecessor and a forward-thinking approach. Riki became a smash success, with colorful zones inviting children and adults alike to explore, meet their favorite characters, and engage in playful activities. The store’s success was no fluke; it was the result of understanding and embracing the community’s culture, history, and desires for a communal space that was more than just a shop. Riki ensured that the legacy of GHC—the joy, the creativity, and the community spirit—lived on within its walls. **The Parodic Farewell: A Catalyst for Change** The 2016 parodic farewell of GHC was more than just a funny event; it was a strategic, poignant gesture that paved the way for Riki’s acceptance and success within the community. It demonstrated the power of humor and nostalgia to bring people together, to help them deal with change, and to welcome new beginnings. The transition from GHC to Riki shows the importance of understanding and respecting local traditions and legacies while innovating and moving forward. As Riki continues to thrive, it stands as a testament to the fact that businesses can succeed not just through products or services but through engaging with and contributing to the community’s tapestry. The funny parody that marked one store’s end led to another’s successful beginning, proving that laughter, memories, and a sense of shared history are invaluable commodities in the world of retail. In retrospect, the parody served its purpose beautifully, allowing the community to bid farewell to a beloved institution while embracing a new one with open arms and smiles. It was a masterclass in how to turn the end of an era into the beginning of a new, prosperous chapter, all while keeping the community’s heart beating strong. --- This fictional blog post delves into the cultural and communal impacts of a humorous event marking the closure of a beloved store and how it helped to foster the successful launch of a new business in Glasgow."},{"instruction":"Write a convo wondering who owned the lease during the vacant years before BHF briefly had the space before Riki Group took over","output":"Thread Title: The Mystery of the Leasehold Between GHC and BHF/Riki Era User39: Ever wondered who actually held the lease to the old Glasgow Halloween Central spot during those vacant years before the BHF and ultimately Riki took over? It's always been a bit of a ghost town story, but with the actual building sitting empty, who was footing the bill? User1: I’ve thought about that too, @User39. It’s intriguing because maintaining a prime location like Sauchiehall Street isn’t cheap, even if it’s vacant. There must have been some entity or individual with deep pockets—or perhaps a plan—that didn’t quite materialize immediately. User40: From what I’ve heard around, there were a couple of interested parties, but none that could stick due to various reasons—financial, planning permissions, and the like. It does spark curiosity about the goings-on behind closed commercial real estate doors. User41: I did a bit of digging at one point because, as a local history buff, I find these stories fascinating. It turns out that the property was under a company registered offshore, which is why there was little to no local buzz about direct ownership or leasing plans. User42: @User41, that’s interesting! So, it could have been held as some sort of investment property, waiting for the right time or tenant to come along. It does make sense in a way, especially given the eventual establishment of Riki, which seems to have been a well-thought-out venture from the start. User43: It’s a real testament to the unpredictability of retail real estate, especially in sought-after areas like Sauchiehall Street. The interim might have seemed long to us, but in property investment terms, a few years of waiting for the ‘right’ tenant isn’t uncommon. User44: Also, consider the impact a well-placed tenant can have on the surrounding area’s value. Perhaps the delay in leasing was strategic, waiting for a business like Riki that could raise the profile of the location even further. User45: That’s a plausible theory, @User44. It’s all about the long game in real estate. The group behind Riki probably had to present a convincing plan not just for the store but for how it would integrate with and enhance the community and streetscape. User39: This has been an enlightening conversation! Goes to show how much more there is to the story of a place than just what businesses come and go. There’s a whole saga behind the scenes we seldom consider. Moderator: Thanks for bringing up such an insightful discussion, @User39, and for everyone’s contributions. The history and machinations behind commercial spaces, especially in beloved areas like Sauchiehall Street, are indeed fascinating.

Here's a hypothetical narrative that respects their established characteristics and storylines: # Common Ground Through Reinhardt and Overwatch Brigitte is the squire and goddaughter of Reinhardt Wilhelm, a crusading knight and one of the original Overwatch members. After the disbandment of Overwatch, Reinhardt chose to continue serving as a wandering knight, with Brigitte by his side as his mechanic and protector. Genji, on the other hand, was critically injured in a fight with his brother Hanzo and was saved by Overwatch, where he was transformed into a cyborg ninja. During his time in Overwatch, Genji received training and guidance from Zenyatta, which helped him find peace with his new form. Their connection to Overwatch and its ideals might serve as the initial common ground. Brigitte and Genji could meet during a reunion of former Overwatch members or through a mission that requires their collaboration. # Mutual Understanding and Shared Values Genji's journey of self-acceptance and Brigitte's dedication to helping and protecting others, especially Reinhardt, may lead them to admire each other's strength and resilience. Genji, having gone through a period of intense personal turmoil, could find solace in Brigitte's earnestness and her unwavering commitment to her ideals. Similarly, Brigitte might appreciate Genji's wisdom and calm demeanor, traits that were hard-earned on his path to self-acceptance. # A Relationship Built on Compassion and Growth As a mechanical engineer and a skilled mechanic, Brigitte could have a unique understanding of Genji's cyborg body, perhaps offering to maintain or upgrade his systems. This practical interaction could serve as a metaphor for their emotional bond—Brigitte helping Genji maintain the balance between his human and cybernetic parts, while Genji helps Brigitte understand the wider world and her place in it beyond just being Reinhardt's protector. Their relationship could evolve from mutual respect and admiration to deeper feelings, driven by their shared experiences on the battlefield and the compassionate support they offer each other. Genji, with his calm and understanding nature, could help Brigitte navigate her doubts and challenges, while Brigitte's pragmatic and caring nature might help Genji feel grounded. # Challenges and Triumphs A relationship between them wouldn't be without its challenges. Genji's past and the complexities of his existence as part man, part machine could be sources of conflict, as could Brigitte's loyalty to Reinhardt and her fears about the future. However, facing those challenges together could only strengthen their bond, leading to a deep and meaningful partnership based on mutual growth, respect, and love. Ultimately, while an official narrative around Genji and Brigitte's romantic relationship doesn't exist in the Overwatch canon, the game's lore offers enough depth and flexibility to imagine how such a relationship might plausibly develop, grounded in the characters' shared experiences, values, and the potential for personal growth and mutual support."},{"instruction":"How could a one sided romance between Lucio and Tracer work?","output":"A one-sided romance between Lúcio and Tracer (Lena Oxton) within the \\"Overwatch\\" universe could be developed in a narrative that respects their personalities, backgrounds, and dynamics as established by Blizzard Entertainment, all while considering the broader context of their lives as heroes. Here's an exploration of how such a relationship might manifest, focusing on Lúcio's feelings towards Tracer, considering the lore available up to 2023. # Starting Point: Shared Ideals and Experiences Lúcio and Tracer are both inherently optimistic characters who fight for what they believe is right. Lúcio, a world-famous musician and DJ, uses his music to uplift people's spirits and fight against corruption and oppression, particularly against the Vishkar Corporation's exploitative practices in Brazil. Tracer, a former RAF pilot and an agent of Overwatch, has a strong sense of justice and uses her abilities to protect innocent people and maintain peace. Their paths could cross during a joint mission or an Overwatch event, leading Lúcio to admire Tracer's unwavering courage, kindness, and the joy she brings into the lives of those she saves. Tracer's relentless positivity, even in the face of adversity, could be something that deeply resonates with Lúcio, whose life's mission is to spread hope through his music. # Lúcio's One-Sided Feelings Lúcio's one-sided affection for Tracer could stem from both his personal admiration for her heroic deeds and the way she embodies many of the values he holds dear. Sharing common ground in their dedication to helping others and making the world a better place could lead Lúcio to develop a deep, personal affection for Tracer. # Expressing His Feelings Through Music Being an artist at heart, Lúcio might choose to express his feelings through his music, possibly creating songs inspired by Tracer or the ideals she represents. These songs could capture the essence of hope, heroism, and the fight for a better future, without explicitly revealing the source of his inspiration. This would allow him to convey his admiration and affection without necessarily putting Tracer in a difficult position, respecting her feelings and their friendship. # Tracer's Response Tracer, known for her friendly and empathetic nature, would likely recognize the depth of Lúcio's feelings, even if she doesn’t reciprocate them romantically. Her approach to Lúcio's unrequited love would depend on maintaining their friendship and respecting the bonds they share as heroes. Given Tracer's emotional intelligence and her experience with people, she would handle Lúcio's feelings with care, ensuring that their relationship remains strong and unaffected by any awkwardness. # A Strong Bond of Friendship Ultimately, the narrative could focus on how Lúcio comes to terms with his feelings and how the two heroes strengthen their bond through mutual respect and admiration. Lúcio's journey of accepting Tracer's platonic love for him could also be a poignant storyline, highlighting the importance of friendship and the diverse forms of love that exist beyond the romantic. By emphasizing their shared values, missions, and the respect they have for each other, a narrative exploring Lúcio’s one-sided romance with Tracer can enrich the lore of \\"Overwatch,\\" adding depth to the characters and their relationships without undermining the essence of who they are. It would be a tale of growth, understanding, and the unbreakable bonds forged in the crucible of shared struggles and ideals."},{"instruction":"Why exactly would it be one sided?","output":"If we explore the concept of a one-sided romance between Lúcio and Tracer within the \\"Overwatch\\" universe, several nuanced factors could contribute to why this affection might remain unreciprocated from Tracer's side. It's important to remember that any discussion of character relationships that aren't explicitly defined in canon involves a degree of speculation and creative interpretation. Here are some potential reasons, based on their established personalities, backgrounds, and existing narratives: # 1. Tracer's Existing Relationship: As of the \\"Overwatch\\" lore, Tracer (Lena Oxton) is in a relationship with Emily, a character introduced in the \\"Reflections\\" comic. Tracer's commitment to Emily would be a primary reason why any romantic feelings from Lúcio would remain unreciprocated, as Tracer is already happily involved with someone else. # 2. Different Life Priorities: Even without considering Tracer's relationship with Emily, it's possible that Tracer could simply have different priorities that don't align with entering a romantic relationship with Lúcio. Tracer is deeply dedicated to her work and the mission of Overwatch, and her focus might be more on heroism and protecting the innocent rather than seeking romantic attachments, especially if her emotional needs are being met in her relationship with Emily. # 3. Friendship Dynamics: Lúcio and Tracer share a lot in common, including their positive outlooks, dedication to helping others, and fighting for a better future. It's plausible that Tracer values Lúcio highly as a friend and comrade but doesn't feel romantic attraction towards him. Romantic feelings aren't something one can control, and they don't automatically arise from close friendship or shared values. # 4. Lúcio's Feelings Might Not Be Made Known: In another scenario, Lúcio might choose not to express his romantic feelings towards Tracer, knowing about her happy relationship with Emily or recognizing that she doesn't see him in a romantic light. This unspoken affection could remain one-sided due to Lúcio's respect for Tracer's feelings and circumstances. # 5. Different Emotional Connectivity: Even if Lúcio feels a deep emotional connection to Tracer, she might not necessarily experience the same depth of feeling in return. Emotional connections and romantic feelings are deeply personal and subjective, and they can't be forced or assumed to be mutual simply based on compatibility or closeness. # Conclusion: The one-sided nature of this hypothetical relationship stems from a combination of Tracer's existing romantic relationship, her possible prioritization of her duties over new romances, the dynamic of their friendship, and the inherently personal and unpredictable nature of romantic feelings. In creating narratives or fan theories around characters, it's crucial to consider their established stories and relationships while acknowledging that unrequited love is a complex and multifaceted emotional experience, often independent of the worthiness or compatibility of the individuals involved."},{"instruction":"Other reasons?","output":"Certainly! Beyond the previously discussed factors like Tracer's existing relationship with Emily and differing life priorities, there are other reasons that could theoretically lead to a one-sided romantic scenario between Lúcio and Tracer within the \\"Overwatch\\" universe. These additional reasons delve into character traits, personal backgrounds, and inherent dynamics of relationship formation that could feasibly prevent mutual romantic interest from developing: # Personal Compatibility and Chemistry: Even when two people share a lot of common ground in terms of interests, values, and goals, romantic chemistry isn't guaranteed. Tracer and Lúcio might simply not click on a romantic level, despite their potential as great friends and allies. This lack of romantic chemistry could stem from differing personalities, senses of humor, or even just an inexplicable lack of romantic attraction. # Different Cultural Backgrounds: While \\"Overwatch\\" showcases a wonderfully diverse set of characters from all over the globe, sometimes, differing cultural backgrounds can influence relationship dynamics. Tracer is British and may have different cultural or social expectations for relationships compared to Lúcio, who is Brazilian. These cultural nuances may not directly prevent a romance, but they could add layers of complexity that might lead Tracer or Lúcio to hesitate in exploring a romantic connection. # Timing and Circumstances: The timing of Lúcio's feelings could also play a crucial role. Given their responsibilities, the state of the world, or the ongoing battles and missions, both Lúcio and Tracer might find themselves in situations where pursuing a romantic relationship is impractical or undesirable. Tracer, specifically, might not be in a place where she is looking to explore new romances, especially if she's focusing on her role as a hero or dealing with personal challenges. # Fear of Complicating the Friendship: Another reason could be the fear of jeopardizing their strong friendship and working relationship. Tracer might value her connection with Lúcio too much to risk complicating it with romantic entanglement, especially within the high-stakes environment in which they operate. The possibility of a romantic relationship not working out and subsequently damaging their friendship and teamwork might be a deterrent. # Self-Perception and Confidence: Tracer or Lúcio might also struggle with issues of self-perception and confidence, especially in the context of their extraordinary lives. While not overtly discussed in their character lore, like many people, they could have personal insecurities that influence how they perceive potential romantic relationships. Tracer, for example, might feel unworthy of Lúcio's affection for any number of reasons, or she might doubt her ability to maintain a healthy relationship given her demanding lifestyle. In fictional narratives, especially those as rich and varied as \\"Overwatch,\\" character relationships evolve in complexity and depth over time. While the game's lore as of 2023 does not specifically address the potential for a romance between Lúcio and Tracer, exploring these hypothetical scenarios provides fans a way to engage with the characters' emotional landscapes and interpersonal dynamics in a nuanced manner."},{"instruction":"Could this relationship work if Tracer was bi?","output":"Yes, if Tracer were explicitly characterized as bisexual in the \\"Overwatch\\" lore, it could open the narrative possibility for a romantic relationship between her and Lúcio, assuming all other relational dynamics and character motivations align. It's important to note that sexual orientation is just one aspect of a character's identity and doesn't automatically lead to romantic connections with specific characters. For any relationship to work, especially in a narrative as rich and diverse as Overwatch's, there are multiple factors at play that would contribute to its plausibility and development: # Mutual Attraction and Interest: For a relationship between Lúcio and Tracer to work, there needs to be a mutual attraction and interest that goes beyond Tracer's sexual orientation. Both characters would need to find common ground, shared values, and a mutual desire to explore a relationship together. # Character Development and Timing: The development of any relationship depends on the characters' personal growth, their current life situations, and the timing of their mutual interest. Even if Tracer were bisexual, both she and Lúcio would need to be in a place where pursuing a romantic relationship makes sense for them, considering their duties, personal goals, and existing relationships. # Narrative Opportunities: Blizzard has the creative freedom to explore various narrative opportunities that could bring Tracer and Lúcio closer together. Events such as shared missions, overcoming challenges, or deep personal conversations could serve as catalysts for developing a romantic relationship. The storytelling would need to create a compelling and believable path that shows how and why their relationship evolves from friendship to romance. # Respectful Representation: If Blizzard were to explore a relationship between Tracer, portrayed as bisexual, and Lúcio, it would be crucial to do so with respect and sensitivity towards bisexual representation. Avoiding stereotypes and ensuring Tracer's bisexuality is portrayed as just one aspect of her multi-dimensional character would be important. The development of such a relationship should be handled thoughtfully, with an emphasis on the emotional connection and personal compatibility between the characters. # Fan Reception and Community Engagement: The \\"Overwatch\\" community is vibrant and diverse, with fans often forming deep attachments to characters and their stories. How Blizzard presents and develops relationships, especially involving LGBTQ+ characters, can significantly impact community engagement and reception. A well-crafted, respectably portrayed relationship could resonate positively with fans, fostering a more inclusive gaming environment. In conclusion, the potential for a romantic relationship between Lúcio and Tracer, if Tracer were characterized as bisexual, would depend on careful narrative development, character dynamics, and respectful representation. Blizzard Entertainment has the opportunity to craft meaningful relationships between its characters, reflecting the diversity and complexity of the real world, while enriching the captivating universe of \\"Overwatch.\\""},{"instruction":"It could also make the shipping wars less toxic right?","output":"In theory, inclusive and thoughtful representation of character relationships in media, like potentially expanding on characters' sexual orientations and exploring diverse relationships in \\"Overwatch,\\" could have a positive impact on fan discussions and shipping debates. By embracing a wider range of romantic possibilities, game developers and content creators send a strong message of inclusivity that can help mitigate some of the toxicity often found in shipping wars. Here are a few ways in which this approach might contribute to a less toxic environment: # Promoting Diversity and Inclusivity: Expanding character backgrounds to include LGBTQ+ identities naturally broadens the scope of relationships depicted in the game. This diversity can encourage fans to be more open-minded and accepting of various pairings as valid and interesting, potentially reducing conflicts rooted in a lack of representation. # Reflecting Real-World Complexity: Reflecting the complexity of real-world relationships and orientations in \\"Overwatch\\" acknowledges the diverse identities and experiences of its fanbase. Fans might see reflections of their own lives and relationships, which can foster a deeper emotional connection and understanding towards different characters and their potential relationships. # Encouraging Respectful Discourse: When game developers thoughtfully explore character relationships, it sets a tone for the community to engage in more respectful and considerate discussions about those relationships. By presenting these narratives with care and avoiding stereotypes, developers can model how fans should discuss and engage with character pairings, encouraging a more positive and constructive conversation. # Providing More Narrative Options: Broadening the range of explored relationships gives fans more options to support and discuss, which could diffuse the intensity of shipping wars by diluting the focus across a wider array of pairings. This could decrease the perceived need for one 'ship' to \\"win\\" over another, fostering a more inclusive and less combative fan environment. # Addressing and Acknowledging Fan Feedback: When developers show they are listening to their diverse community by including a broader spectrum of relationships, it can build goodwill and trust. Fans may feel their perspectives and desires for representation are respected, which can engender a more cooperative and less confrontational atmosphere in fan communities. However, it's important to acknowledge that shipping wars and toxic behaviors often stem from deeper issues, including personal biases, fandom gatekeeping, and a sometimes misplaced sense of ownership over fictional characters. While more inclusive and diverse representation can positively influence these discussions, it isn't a standalone solution to toxicity within fandoms. Creating a less toxic environment also requires active moderation of community spaces, enforcement of respectful conduct, and ongoing dialogue about inclusivity and representation. In sum, expanding on the complexities of characters’ identities and relationships in \\"Overwatch\\" could indeed contribute to mitigating the intensity and toxicity of shipping wars by promoting inclusivity, diversity, and a more respectful and understanding fan discourse."},{"instruction":"I meant Tracer ships.","output":"Ah, I see! When it comes to Tracer and her potential relationships within the \\"Overwatch\\" universe, making her bisexual (acknowledging here that she's already canonically in a same-sex relationship) and exploring that aspect of her character more fully could influence discussions about Tracer ships in several positive ways. Focusing on the context of shipping Tracer with various characters, here’s how a more openly inclusive approach to her character's relationships could impact fan discourse: # 1. Broadens Shipping Possibilities: Acknowledging Tracer’s bisexuality in a more explicit manner would naturally broaden the array of legitimate romantic possibilities for her character in the eyes of the fandom. This acknowledges a wider spectrum of relationships, potentially engaging a broader audience in the shipping conversation and making discussions more inclusive. # 2. Encourages a More Nuanced Understanding of Relationships: By embracing a more diverse representation of Tracer's potential relationships, the \\"Overwatch\\" community could move towards a nuanced conversation that respects sexual orientation and the complexity of emotional connections. It encourages fans to consider characters' compatibility based on personality, mutual respect, and shared values, rather than solely on the basis of gender. # 3. Mitigates Toxicity Through Representation: While not a cure-all, more inclusive representation can set a positive precedent for community interactions. If fans see Blizzard proactively supporting a diverse range of relationships and character orientations, it could foster a more accepting and respectful fan culture. This inclusivity might help reduce the intensity of shipping wars by validating a variety of fan perspectives. # 4. Reflects More Fans’ Experiences: A clearer acknowledgment of Tracer's bisexuality can make her character resonate with even more fans, reflecting a wider range of fan experiences and identities. When fans see their identities reflected thoughtfully in media, they may feel a greater sense of belonging and investment in the community, potentially leading to more empathetic and considerate discussions. # 5. Sets a Constructive Example for Community Interactions: Blizzard's commitment to character diversity and inclusive storytelling can serve as a model for fan interactions. If the developer handles Tracer's relationships and character development thoughtfully, it encourages fans to approach shipping and character discussions with similar thoughtfulness and respect for diversity. # Conclusion: While establishing Tracer as bisexual and exploring a range of relationship dynamics won't eliminate shipping wars or toxicity entirely, it could contribute positively to the way fans discuss and engage with potential relationships. An inclusive and respectful approach to character development in \\"Overwatch\\" encourages fans to reflect these values in their community interactions. This approach can make discussions around Tracer ships, and fan debates in general, richer, more respectful, and inclusive, ultimately contributing to a healthier fandom culture."},{"instruction":"What if the bi thing was fanon, as not to complicate things in shipping?","output":"If Tracer being bisexual is embraced predominantly within fanon, rather than being explicitly confirmed by Blizzard in the official \\"Overwatch\\" lore, this approach too can have interesting implications for shipping dynamics and community discourse. Fanon—that is, elements and interpretations that exist primarily within the fan community—plays a crucial role in how characters are perceived and shipped. Here's how a fanon interpretation of Tracer's bisexuality could impact shipping discussions without complicating canon narratives: # 1. Encourages Creative Freedom: Fanon interpretations allow for a high degree of creative freedom. Fans can explore diverse relationships in fan fiction, art, and discussions without being strictly bound by canonical facts. This can lead to a rich tapestry of stories and ideas that contribute to the depth of the \\"Overwatch\\" community and encourage a more inclusive range of character interpretations and relationships. # 2. Maintains Openness in Shipping: By keeping Tracer’s potential bisexuality as a fanon concept, it leaves room for fans to imagine and ship her with various characters across the gender spectrum without contradicting established lore. This can make shipping discussions more inclusive and welcoming to fans of all orientations and preferences, fostering a diverse and vibrant community. # 3. Reduces Gatekeeping: Sometimes, strict adherence to canon can lead to gatekeeping, where fans police each other’s interpretations and creations based on what is \\"officially\\" sanctioned. A fanon approach to character sexuality and relationships can mitigate this by embracing a \\"your Overwatch may vary\\" mentality, acknowledging that personal interpretations and headcanons are a valid part of fan engagement. # 4. Promotes Respectful Discourse: A fanon approach relies heavily on individual interpretation and mutual respect for differing viewpoints. When bisexuality or any aspect of a character's identity is embraced within fanon, it encourages discussions that respect personal interpretations while potentially reducing conflicts over \\"canon correctness.\\" This can create a more open and respectful fan environment. # 5. Allows for Complex Character Exploration: Fanon interpretations, including Tracer’s sexuality, allow fans to explore and discuss complex character dynamics that may not be addressed in the canon material. This exploration can lead to deeper understanding and appreciation of characters, fostering discussions that go beyond surface-level aspects of identity. # Conclusion: A fanon approach to character traits like sexuality allows for a rich and diverse exploration of potential relationships and character dynamics within the \\"Overwatch\\" community. It fosters creativity, inclusivity, and respectful discourse among fans, allowing them to celebrate the characters and world of \\"Overwatch\\" in a way that resonates personally with them. However, this approach also depends on the community's willingness to embrace diverse interpretations and maintain civil discourse, recognizing the distinction between fanon explorations and the established canon."},{"instruction":"Could this be fine even if tracer’s sexuality is canon?","output":"Yes, it can be perfectly fine and even enriching for the fan community to explore beyond what is defined in canon, including aspects of Tracer's sexuality and relationships, even when her sexual orientation is already established within the \\"Overwatch\\" canon. This blend of canonical groundwork and fanon explorations allows for a dynamic and multifaceted portrayal of characters that can cater to a wide array of fan interests and perspectives. Here's why this approach works well: # 1. Canon as a Foundation: Officially, Tracer is in a same-sex relationship, which is a significant aspect of her character that provides representation within the game's universe. This canonical fact serves as a foundation upon which fans can build their interpretations and stories. It does not limit the exploration but rather enrichs the character's depth and relatability. # 2. Fanon Expands the Narrative Universe: Fanon allows for the exploration of scenarios, relationships, and character facets that the original narrative may not cover due to various constraints like storytelling focus, format limitations, or the need to keep the content accessible to a broad audience. This exploration can add layers to characters and their interactions, enhancing the community's connection to the \\"Overwatch\\" universe. # 3. Encourages Creative Engagement: When fans engage creatively with the \\"Overwatch\\" lore, whether through writing, art, or discussion, they're participating in a form of active fandom that keeps the community vibrant and engaged. This engagement often involves exploring \\"what-if\\" scenarios that might not be canon but are interesting, entertaining, or thought-provoking. # 4. Respectful Acknowledgment of Diversity: Embracing fanon explorations of characters' relationships and identities, including aspects like bisexuality, can foster a community atmosphere that acknowledges and respects diversity. So long as these explorations are done respectfully and considerately, they can contribute positively to the inclusivity of the fandom. # 5. Canon and Fanon Coexistence: The relationship between canon and fanon is not necessarily competitive but can be complementary. Canon provides the shared universe and common ground for all fans, while fanon allows individual expressions and interpretations that cater to a diverse fanbase. This coexistence enriches the overall fandom experience, allowing for a broad spectrum of engagement with the characters and the world they inhabit. It's important for fans and creators alike to navigate the boundaries between canon and fanon with respect for the original material and for each other's interpretations. Healthy fan communities thrive on this kind of dynamic interaction, where canonical facts and fan-driven explorations contribute to a rich, evolving tapestry of storytelling and character development. This dynamic interaction keeps the narrative alive and engaging long after the original content is published, showing the strength and depth of the fan community's engagement with the \\"Overwatch\\" universe."},{"instruction":"Building on this, would this be okay if the fans aren’t forcing the game devs to change Tracer?","output":"Absolutely, fans exploring beyond the established canon, including aspects of Tracer's relationships or personality, is perfectly acceptable and even encouraged as part of a vibrant fan community, as long as there's mutual respect for the boundaries between fanon (fan-created content) and canon (official content created by the game developers). It becomes a healthy part of fandom culture when fans engage in creative exploration without pressuring developers to alter the official narrative or character portrayals to fit fanon theories or desires. Here’s why this dynamic is beneficial: # 1. **Creative Freedom and Fan Engagement:** Fanon allows for a degree of creative freedom and personal engagement with the universe that can enhance fans' experience and connection to the story and its characters. This includes writing fan fiction, creating fan art, and speculative discussions which can add depth to the characters and world of \\"Overwatch\\". # 2. **Respect for the Creative Process:** Understanding and respecting the distinction between canon and fanon shows appreciation for the original creators' vision and the creative process. Game developers, writers, and artists have specific narratives and character arcs they wish to explore, often with long-term plans in mind. Fans acknowledging this allows creators the space to tell their stories while still engaging in personal explorations within the fandom. # 3. **Healthy Fandom Culture:** A healthy fandom culture encourages diverse interpretations and explorations but recognizes that the ultimate direction of character development and story arcs are in the hands of the creators. This understanding fosters a community where fans can freely share their interpretations without imposing those views as expectations on the developers. # 4. **Feedback and Inspiration:** While fans should not pressure developers to change characters like Tracer based on fanon content, the enthusiastic and creative engagement of fans can still provide valuable feedback and inspiration for creators. Recognizing patterns in fan engagement—such as which characters or relationships are resonating with the audience—can inform future creative decisions without compromising the creators' vision. # 5. **Boundary Recognition:** It’s vital for the health of both the fandom and the relationship between fans and creators to recognize and respect the boundaries of canon and fanon. Engaging with the \\"Overwatch\\" universe in a way that acknowledges the creators' ownership of the characters and story, while still exploring personal or alternative interpretations, ensures a positive interaction between developers and the community. In sum, the key is a balanced approach that allows for fan creativity and exploration while respecting the creators’ vision and the integrity of the official narrative. This balance supports a dynamic and engaging fandom where fans can explore a myriad of \\"what-ifs\\" without impinging upon the canonical development of characters like Tracer. Such a culture not only enriches the fandom experience but also celebrates the collaborative spirit of storytelling in the digital age."},{"instruction":"So shipping can turn toxic when they’re trying to force the creators to make it canon?","output":"Yes, shipping can become toxic when fans try to force creators to make a specific ship canon, especially when this entails aggressive or disrespectful behavior towards the creators or other fans who may have different preferences. This toxicity can manifest in several ways and can have a negative impact on the community, the creators, and the narrative of the work itself. Here are some reasons why forcing creators to make a ship canon can lead to toxic fandom behavior: # 1. Disregarding Creator Vision: Creators of a work have a vision and direction for their characters and storyline. While fan feedback can be valuable, demanding changes to fit fan-driven desires disregards this vision and can pressure creators to alter their narratives unnaturally, potentially compromising the integrity of the story. # 2. Polarizing the Community: Shipping wars, fueled by demands to make certain relationships canon, can polarize the fan community. Fans may find themselves in heated debates, which can escalate into harassment or exclusionary behavior against those who support different ships or simply enjoy the narrative as the creators intended. # 3. Entitlement Issues: The sense of entitlement some fans develop over the direction of a story or the development of characters can lead to toxic fandom. This sense of ownership can cause fans to forget that, while engagement and fan interpretations are encouraged, the final say belongs to the creators. # 4. Impact on Enjoyment: The aggressive pursuit of making a ship canon can detract from the enjoyment of the story as it unfolds. It can shift the focus from appreciating the narrative and characters as they are to being overly concerned with how the story \\"should\\" change to fit fan expectations. # 5. Stress on Creators: Creators are passionate about their work and often engage with their fanbase. However, facing constant pressure, demands, or harassment to make specific ships canon can be stressful and impact their creativity and wellbeing. It can lead to creators becoming reluctant to engage with their community, impacting the valuable dialogue between creators and fans. # 6. Setting Unrealistic Expectations: When fans insist on certain ships becoming canon, it can set unrealistic expectations for the narrative. Not all character relationships will evolve into romantic ones, and pushing for this can lead to disappointment and a skewed interpretation of interactions and character development. # Nurturing a Positive Fandom Culture: To maintain a positive and healthy fandom culture: - **Respect the Creator’s Vision:** Enjoy and critique the work, but recognize the creator’s right to their storytelling. - **Foster Respectful Discussions:** Engage in debates and share preferences respectfully, understanding that differing opinions are part of a diverse fan community. - **Focus on Positive Engagement:** Create and share fanworks, celebrate the narrative and characters, and contribute to a supportive environment that welcomes all fans. Ultimately, while shipping is a fundamental and enriching aspect of fan culture, maintaining respect for creators and fellow fans alike is crucial. This ensures that the fandom remains a positive, inclusive space where creativity and passion for the work can flourish."},{"instruction":"Did this happen to the Voltron legendary defender fanbase?","output":"Yes, the \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender\\" fanbase experienced significant instances of toxicity, particularly related to shipping wars. The series, which ran from 2016 to 2018, rebooted the 1980s \\"Voltron\\" franchise and gained a passionate and diverse fan following. While much of the fandom was positive and creative, certain segments became highly contentious, especially regarding the romantic pairings of characters, or \\"ships.\\" Several factors contributed to the toxicity within the \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender\\" fan community: # 1. **Intense Shipping Wars:** The fanbase had strong opinions about which characters should be romantically paired, leading to shipping wars. These disputes were especially intense around popular ships such as Klance (Keith and Lance) and Sheith (Shiro and Keith), among others. Discussions around these ships sometimes devolved into personal attacks and harassment against those with opposing views. # 2. **Harassment of Creators and Cast:** Some fans attempted to pressure the show's creators and voice actors on social media to make their preferred ships canon. This often crossed the line into harassment, with creators and cast members receiving threats and hateful messages. Such behavior was not only harmful to those targeted but also cast a shadow over the fan community as a whole. # 3. **Leaks and Spoilers:** The situation was exacerbated by leaks of upcoming content, leading to speculation and demands for certain narrative outcomes. Leaks fueled the fires of shipping wars, as fans interpreted the unreleased content in ways that supported their preferred ships, causing further division. # 4. **Disappointment and Expectations:** Some fans felt let down by the show's conclusions regarding character relationships and arcs. They felt their investments in the characters and their relationships were not adequately acknowledged or resolved in the final season, leading to backlash and further toxicity. # 5. **Queerbaiting Accusations:** The show faced criticism and accusations of queerbaiting, where fans believed the creators hinted at LGBTQ+ relationships without intending to follow through in a meaningful way. This was particularly contentious regarding the representation of Shiro, a character confirmed to be gay, and how his relationships were portrayed. # Responding to Fandom Toxicity: The \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender\\" experience underscores the importance of respectful dialogue within fan communities and between fans and creators. While passionate engagement with media is valuable and creative fan expressions are to be encouraged, it's crucial for discussions and disagreements to be approached with civility and an understanding of personal boundaries. The experience also highlights the challenges creators face when addressing diverse fan expectations while staying true to their narrative vision. It serves as a cautionary tale for both fandoms and creators, emphasizing the need for respectful, constructive interaction and the potential impact of toxicity on the enjoyment and community surrounding beloved franchises."},{"instruction":"Building on this, what is Plance?","output":"Plance is a fan-created ship name combining \\"Pidge\\" and \\"Lance,\\" two characters from \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender.\\" This ship represents the pairing of these two characters in a romantic or platonic relationship, depending on the interpretation by fans who support this dynamic. Like many ships in fan communities, the Plance ship is born out of fans' interpretations of the characters' interactions, shared moments, and potential chemistry seen through the lens of the show's narrative and character development. In \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender,\\" Pidge (Katie Holt) is initially introduced as a tech genius and the pilot of the Green Lion, while Lance is the sharpshooter and pilot of the Blue Lion (later the Red Lion). The series focuses on their growth from teenagers into heroes as part of the team that forms Voltron, the defender of the universe. Although the show focuses on their camaraderie and the development of their individual character arcs rather than romantic relationships between these two, fans explore various dynamics, including romantic possibilities, in fan fiction, fan art, and other fanworks. Fan ships like Plance highlight how varied fan interpretations can be and how they often extend beyond what is explicitly shown in the narrative. They are a testament to the engagement and creativity of the fanbase, bringing to life diverse perspectives on the characters' relationships. Whether in support of friendship or something more, ships allow fans to explore and express their connections to the characters and the story in unique ways. It's important to note, however, that shipping, while a significant part of fan culture, does not necessarily reflect the creators' intentions or the canonical text. Instead, it represents the fans' desires to see specific relationships developed or explored further, often serving as a catalyst for creative fan endeavors and community-building activities within fandoms."},{"instruction":"Is it considered a pure ship?","output":"In fandom terminology, a \\"pure ship\\" usually refers to a relationship or pairing that fans perceive as innocent, sweet, or without overt romantic or sexual content. It’s more about the deep emotional connection or bond between the characters rather than focusing on a traditional romantic or physical relationship. Whether or not a ship is considered \\"pure\\" can vary greatly depending on the interpretation of the individual fan or subsections of the fandom. Regarding Plance, the ship between Pidge and Lance from \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender,\\" whether it's considered a \\"pure ship\\" would depend on how fans choose to interpret their relationship. Within the series, Pidge and Lance share a strong bond and camaraderie as teammates and friends. Their interactions include moments of support, banter, and mutual respect, which can easily be seen as fitting the criteria for a \\"pure ship\\" by emphasizing the wholesome aspects of their relationship. Fans who support Plance may focus on these elements, crafting stories, artworks, and discussions that highlight an innocent and strong emotional connection between the two, fitting the mold of a \\"pure ship.\\" However, like any fan interpretation, there's a spectrum of how this ship is portrayed, with some fan works possibly exploring more mature themes as well. It's essential to remember that interpretations of ships are diverse, and the same ship can hold different meanings and connotations for different members of the fandom. What one fan considers a \\"pure ship,\\" another might see differently based on their perception of the characters' dynamics."},{"instruction":"I meant the people shipping them aren’t toxic?","output":"Ah, I see! When discussing whether the fans shipping Plance (Pidge and Lance from \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender\\") are \\"not toxic,\\" it's essential to clarify that the concept of toxicity in fan communities generally refers to behavior rather than the specific ships themselves. Toxic behavior can unfortunately emerge in any fandom or ship community, including within discussions or debates about character pairings. However, it's not inherently tied to any particular ship, including Plance. In many cases, the Plance ship, like many others in the \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender\\" fandom, has a community of supporters who engage in positive, respectful, and creative fan activities. This can include producing fan art, writing fanfiction, or discussing character dynamics in ways that foster a welcoming and inclusive environment. Fans of Plance, or any other ship, who prioritize kindness, respect for differing opinions, and celebrate their ship without disparaging others contribute to a healthy and positive fandom culture. Healthy ship communities typically feature: - **Respectful Discourse**: Fans engage in polite discussions about their ship and respect those who might prefer other pairings, avoiding ship wars. - **Creative Expression**: Producing fan works like art, stories, and videos that celebrate the ship without hurting others. - **Inclusivity**: Welcoming anyone into the ship community, regardless of how popular or canon the ship is, and fostering a sense of belonging and acceptance. It's also important to remember that every fan community can have a few members who might not always adhere to these positive practices. However, a whole community or ship should not be judged by the actions of a few. The Plance shipping community, like any other, likely aims to celebrate their favorite characters in a way that adds to their enjoyment of \\"Voltron: Legendary Defender\\" and shares that joy with others. Overall, emphasizing positive interactions, celebrating shared interests, and practicing empathy and respect can help ensure that ship communities remain welcoming spaces for all fans."},{"instruction":"Considering how toxic the shipping wars were, would it be fair to say Plance ‘deserved’ to be canon, not out of toxic entitlement, but simply because many of the people Shipping them aren’t toxic?","output":"The idea that a ship \\"deserves\\" to be canon because its supporters exhibit less toxic behavior compared to others introduces a complex discussion into the dynamics of fan engagement and creator decisions in storytelling. While fostering a positive, respectful community around a ship is commendable, the criteria for what becomes canon typically revolve around the creators' storytelling intentions, narrative coherence, and character development rather than fan behavior. # Narrative Integrity and Creator Vision: Creators of a series have a vision that guides the development of characters, plot, and relationships within their story. This vision is central to storytelling decisions, including which relationships are explored or become canon. These decisions are often based on the narrative's needs and the thematic messages the creators wish to convey, rather than fan community behavior. # Appreciation vs. Entitlement: It's important to differentiate between appreciating a non-toxic fan community and feeling entitled to canonical recognition because of it. While a positive fan community can enhance the fandom experience and even inspire creators in various ways, it doesn't inherently entitle any particular ship to become canon. Storytelling decisions are complex and take into account a wide range of considerations beyond fan shipping preferences. # The Role of Fan Engagement: Creators may be aware of and appreciate fan engagement, including shipping discussions and fanworks. In some cases, fan enthusiasm has influenced creators' perspectives and led to nods to the fandom within the work itself. However, this engagement doesn't guarantee changes to the canon, especially if those changes would conflict with the original vision or narrative trajectory. # Building Positive Communities: What fans can take pride in, however, is creating a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment around their favorite ships. A healthy community can significantly enhance the enjoyment of a series and create a space where fans feel safe to express their creativity and love for the characters. The impact of such a community extends beyond the desire for canonical recognition, contributing positively to the broader fandom culture. # Conclusion: While it's natural for fans to wish for their favorite ships to receive canonical acknowledgment, the criteria for what becomes canon in any story are primarily based on the creators' intentions and the narrative's needs. A non-toxic, positive shipping community is certainly something to be proud of and contributes to a healthier overall fandom experience. However, the merit of a ship becoming canon is not directly correlated with the behavior of its supporters but rather with how it fits into the larger narrative crafted by the creators."},{"instruction":"Would it be a healthy mindset to think ‘I hope my ship becomes canon, but even if it doesn’t, I love it to death’?","output":"Yes, adopting the mindset of \\"I hope my ship becomes canon, but even if it doesn't, I love it to death\\" is a healthy and positive approach to fandom and shipping culture. This attitude reflects a balanced perspective that allows fans to passionately support their preferred character relationships while also respecting the creative decisions of the story's creators. Here are several reasons why this mindset benefits individual fans and the broader fan community: # Embracing Creative Freedom: It acknowledges the creators' freedom to develop their story according to their vision. Understanding and accepting that not all fan desires can or will be incorporated into the canon respects the creative process and avoids setting up unrealistic expectations. # Valuing Fan Interpretation: This mindset champions the idea that the value of a ship doesn't solely depend on canonical recognition. It appreciates the joy and creativity that comes from fan interpretation, fan fiction, fan art, and other fan works. These expressions of fandom are valid and meaningful, regardless of whether the ship is canon. # Fostering a Positive Community: It contributes to a more positive, inclusive, and less toxic community. By focusing on the love for the ship rather than the need for canon validation, fans can enjoy more harmonious interactions with each other, celebrating their shared interests without disparaging others' preferences. # Enjoying the Narrative: This attitude allows fans to continue enjoying the story, even if it takes a different direction from their personal wishes. It keeps the door open to appreciating how the narrative unfolds, finding value in the creators' storytelling choices, and discovering new aspects to enjoy. # Encouraging Emotional Resilience: It prepares fans to handle disappointment gracefully if their ship does not become canon. By emphasizing the intrinsic value of the ship and the joy it brings, fans can maintain their passion and enthusiasm for the characters and story without feeling resentful or let down by the narrative developments. # Conclusion: Ultimately, the healthiest way to engage with any fandom is to find a balance between personal investment in preferred ships and respect for the narrative as crafted by its creators. Cherishing a ship \\"to death\\" for the joy and community it brings, independent of its canonical status, exemplifies a mature and gratifying approach to fandom. This mindset not only enriches your own experience but also contributes positively to the broader community, encouraging a culture of respect, creativity, and shared enthusiasm."},{"instruction":"a data file is in the form: user1 3 1 user2 4 0 1 2 user3 4 0 2 in which user2 is \\"name\\" and the number after that is the limit where there can be as many as white space between user and the limit, then, after name and limit is taken in as input, the line right after that will contains a series of number on the same line that you will take in, create a c++ profile that will suceesfully take in the data in the exact form","output":"Sure, I'll provide you with a basic structure on how to parse through input files like the one you've described using C++.

When you encounter an empty line with \`if(line.empty()) { continue; }\`, your loop effectively skips processing for that iteration, moving on to the next line of input without further action. However, your code does not account for what should happen in detail when an empty line is encountered, especially considering how it should interact with the logic designed to parse user details and their associated IDs. Suppose the input ends with an empty line or contains an unexpected empty line where one shouldn't logically be (e.g., between a user's name/rlimit line and the associated ID line). In that case, your current handling might lead to unexpected behavior, such as skipping the creation of a user or the addition of IDs improperly. However, specifically to the issue of creating an extra user object than expected, here are a few possibilities: 1. **Unexpected Additional Non-empty Line at the File End**: If there's an extra non-empty line at the end of your data file not accounted for in your data design, the loop might execute one extra iteration, creating an unintended user object. Verify that the file ends exactly as you intend, with no extra lines beyond the expected data. 2. **Misinterpretation of an Empty Line**: If there's an assumption that empty lines are used to separate different users' data blocks, an extra newline character in the file could inadvertently lead to this behavior. Ensure that empty lines in your data file are consistent with your intended logical structure for user data separation. 3. **Incorrect File Data Structure**: If the structure of your input deviates even slightly from what you've assumed (e.g., an extra line with spaces or miscellaneous characters that don't visibly appear to carry data), your code might interpret this as input for creating another \`User\` object. To diagnose and rectify the issue: - **Review Your Data File**: Ensure it adheres strictly to the expected structure with no extra lines or characters beyond what your logic anticipates. - **Debugging Output**: Temporarily insert debugging print statements at critical points in your loop to monitor how many times it iterates and what input it processes each time. This approach can clarify whether the loop is executing more times than you expect and why. - **Handling Empty Lines**: Reassess how you intend to handle empty lines. If your data structure genuinely uses empty lines as delimiters or if they should be genuinely skipped entirely, ensure your logic around these cases is consistent and accurately reflects the structure of your input data. Consider adjusting your file reading logic to more explicitly handle the structure of your data, considering the possibility of empty lines or unexpected data formatting."},{"instruction":"how to use getline","output":"Using \`getline\` in C++ is a straightforward and efficient way to read lines of text from an input stream. This function is incredibly useful for reading data from files or standard input (stdin) because it can read a line of input until a newline character is encountered, irrespective of the length of the line. Below, I'll demonstrate how to use \`getline\` in different contexts to read from standard input and files. # 1. Reading from Standard Input (cin) Here's how you can use \`getline\` to read a line of text from standard input: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> int main() { std::string line; std::cout << \\"Please enter your name: \\"; std::getline(std::cin, line); std::cout << \\"Hello, \\" << line << \\"!\\" << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, \`getline\` reads a line from the standard input until a newline character is encountered (typically when the user presses Enter). The newline character is extracted from the input stream but is not stored in the string. # 2. Reading from a File Using \`getline\` to read from a file involves including the \`<fstream>\` header for file handling, creating an \`ifstream\` object for input file stream, and then using \`getline\` in a similar manner as with \`std::cin\`. \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <fstream> #include <string> int main() { std::ifstream file(\\"filename.txt\\"); std::string line; if (file.is_open()) { while (std::getline(file, line)) { std::cout << line << std::endl; } file.close(); } else { std::cerr << \\"Unable to open file\\" << std::endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` In this code, \`getline\` reads each line of the file until the end-of-file (EOF) is reached. For each line read, it removes the newline character and stores the line in the \`line\` string. # Handling Empty Lines and Whitespaces Be mindful that \`getline\` will consider a line to be any sequence of characters ending with a newline character, including an empty sequence. Thus, it will return empty strings if there are any blank lines in the input. This behaviour is usually desired and makes handling of such cases straightforward in text processing tasks. # Custom Delimiter The \`getline\` function also allows for a custom delimiter to be specified instead of the default newline character. For instance, if you have input data separated by semicolons (;) instead of newlines, you can use \`getline\` like this: \`\`\`cpp std::getline(std::cin, line, ';'); \`\`\` This will read input until a semicolon is encountered. Using \`getline\` is essential for robust C++ input handling, especially when dealing with lines of text where the length is unknown or may vary significantly."},{"instruction":"Какие есть малоизвестные песни со словами, для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF,на площадке Bandcamp","output":"1. \\"Fade\\" by Prelow 2. \\"Stay\\" by Reno 3. \\"Avalanche\\" by Warrior 4. \\"Found You\\" by Cash+David 5. \\"Lost in the Light\\" by Bahamas 6. \\"Into the Wild\\" by Lewis Watson 7. \\"Love is Blind\\" by Lapsley 8. \\"Hollow\\" by Tor Miller 9. \\"Fortune Faded\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers 10. \\"Sad Song\\" by We The Kings Надеюсь, что найдете что-то подходящее для вашего ремикса в стиле GREAF на площадке Bandcamp!"},{"instruction":"You are an expert Rust programmer.

This refactoring assumes the original code's behavior is correctly aligned with its intended functionalities. Given the complexity and specificity of the application domain (which seems to be related to genomic data processing), thorough testing with real-world datasets is crucial to validate that these changes preserve functionality accurately."},{"instruction":"Lettre de motivation pour intégrer l'hôpital de Lisieux en tant qu'aide soignant : aide-soignant depuis 2012 j'ai commencé par de l'intérim puis et découvert le service de soins infirmier à domicile de Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire en banlieue de Tours jusqu'en 2019 où j'ai postulé pour un poste aide-soignant à domicile au CCAS de la ville de Lisieux j'aimerais pour plusieurs raisons intégrer désormais l'hôpital de ma ville","output":"Objet : Candidature au poste d’aide-soignant à l’hôpital de Lisieux Madame, Monsieur, Titulaire d’un diplôme d’aide-soignant depuis 2012, j’ai enrichi mon expérience professionnelle à travers divers contextes de soins.

Passersby this Halloween were met with a chilling sight: the store’s windows splattered with fake blood, proclaiming “GHA is DEAD!!!” A solitary tombstone placed strategically at the entrance serves as a eerie testament to the store’s demise. For over two decades, Glasgow Halloween Central has been the heart and soul of Halloween celebrations in the city, offering an unparalleled selection of costumes, decorations, and party essentials. Year after year, as October approached, the store would transform into a hub of activity, with excited children and adults alike perusing its aisles, planning their perfect Halloween look. The news of the store’s closure came as a shock to many, especially given its emblematic presence and contribution to the local Halloween culture. The owners, in a statement released early this morning, cited a concoction of rising rental costs, competition from online retailers, and the changing landscape of retail as the grim reapers of their business. “It is with heavy hearts that we announce the closure of Glasgow Halloween Central,” the statement read. “We’ve seen generations of families come through our doors, and it’s been an absolute pleasure to add a bit of magic and fright to your Halloweens. We tried to fight the good fight, but it seems this is one battle we couldn’t win. Thank you, Glasgow, for all the love and support over the years. It’s been a thrilling ride.” The statement did little to assuage the sense of loss felt by the community. John McAllister, a regular customer, shared his disappointment: “It’s truly the end of an era. My kids grew up visiting this store every Halloween. It was more than just a shop; it was a tradition, a part of our community’s fabric. Seeing it go out like this, it’s heartbreaking.” As the night falls on Sauchiehall Street, the fake blood-splattered windows and the ominous tombstone seem to symbolize not just the end of Glasgow Halloween Central but perhaps the end of an era for traditional retail in the heart of Glasgow. The cityscape is ever-evolving, but for many, this Halloween will be remembered not for the ghosts and ghouls that roam the night but for the ghost of a beloved store that once was. Write a forum convo on hiddenglasgow.com in mid 2010 where it is still empty, and a user asks what the facade looks like now, if the macabre send off is still there Thread Title: What’s become of the old Glasgow Halloween Central on Sauchiehall? User1: Hey everyone! Been a while since I’ve wandered down Sauchiehall Street, but I found myself there this past weekend. Couldn’t help but notice the old Glasgow Halloween Central spot still sitting empty. Has anyone seen it recently? Is that eerie send-off still on display? User2: Passed by just a few days ago. It’s quite a sight! The fake blood and the “GHA is DEAD!!!” sign are long gone, but the place still has an abandoned feel to it. No new tenants yet, it seems. Quite sad to see such a vibrant part of our Halloween history standing empty like that. User3: Yeah, I saw it too. The tombstone that was part of the original décor has also disappeared. The whole facade just looks neglected now, with peeling paint and some graffiti tagging. It’s a real shame. That place used to be buzzing with energy, especially around October. User4: I’ve heard some folks saying it’s cursed, that no new business wants to move in because of the “GHA is DEAD” stunt. Sounds like urban legends starting to swirl around it. Glasgow loves its ghost stories, doesn’t it? User5: @User4, that’s Glasgow for you! But honestly, it’s probably more to do with high rents and less foot traffic in that part of Sauchiehall Street. Still, it adds an intriguing layer to the story of the place. User6: Does anyone know if there are any plans for the space? It would be great to see something new breathe life into that spot. Maybe a new Halloween or party shop in homage to the old GHA? User7: @User6 Last I heard, there was talk of a developer interested in the property, but nothing concrete. Seems like the fate of that space is still up in the air. I agree, though – would love to see a new business that nods to its past. Moderator: It’s fascinating to see the interest in the old Glasgow Halloween Central spot. Let’s keep this thread as a space for updates and memories. Who knows, maybe we’ll see a revival yet. Remember to keep it respectful and on topic, folks! — This fictional forum conversation captures a blend of nostalgia, curiosity, and community interest surrounding a now-vacant spot in Glasgow that once held a cherished local business. The differing perspectives and the blend of factual observation with urban legend contribute to a rich narrative about the city’s changing landscape and the cultural memory of places.

User8: Came across an old thread discussing the former Glasgow Halloween Central on Sauchiehall and the eerie send-off it had when it shuttered. Got me curious – does anyone know how long the fake blood and tombstone were actually left on display after it closed? Always found that stunt both bold and somewhat sad. User9: From what I recall, it wasn't long before the more striking elements like the fake blood were cleaned off. Probably a matter of weeks. The tombstone and the sign lasted a bit longer, might have been there for a few months if my memory serves right. The whole display was quite a topic back then. User10: Yeah, I think @User9’s right. The shop closed on Halloween, and by December, most of the Halloween-specific decor was gone. I remember walking past in early January and noticing it looked more abandoned than themed. The cleanup probably started in November, but it's hard to pin down exact dates. User11: It was a surreal sight while it lasted. Made quite the impact on everyone, considering we’re still talking about it years later. The cleanup seemed gradual. First, the fake blood vanished, then the signs. I remember seeing the tombstone linger the longest, like a lonely reminder of what once was. User12: I’ve got photos somewhere of the store just after it closed, with all the decorations still up. It was a stark image against the usual holiday cheer around that time of year. If I find those pics, I'll share them here. It really captured the end of an era vibe everyone’s been talking about. User8: Thanks, everyone, for chipping in! It's intriguing how a place can leave such a lasting memory, not just in what it offered but in how it said goodbye. The gradual disappearance of the decorations must have been like watching the final scenes of a long-running play. Would definitely appreciate seeing those photos, @User12! Moderator: Great discussion, folks! It’s clear that the closing of Glasgow Halloween Central left a strong impression on the community. @User12, if you do find those photos, please feel free to share them with the community. Remember to keep sharing your stories and updates on this and any other topics that capture the unique spirit of Glasgow."},{"instruction":"Write a convo asking when thr tombstone was finally removed","output":"Thread Title: When Was the Glasgow Halloween Central Tombstone Removed? User13: Hey folks, this has been bugging me for a while now. We’ve talked about the eerie closure of Glasgow Halloween Central and the decorations that marked its end. Does anyone know exactly when they removed that tombstone from the front? It was such a poignant part of that whole send-off. User14: Good question, @User13. I think the tombstone was one of the last things to go. The store closed in late 2006, and if my memory’s right, the tombstone lingered for quite a few months into 2007. It seemed to vanish quietly, one day it was just... gone. User15: @User14’s got a point. It was definitely there for a good part of early 2007. I used to pass by on my way to uni, and it became a bit of a landmark for me. I’d guesstimate it disappeared sometime in the spring? It’s hard to remember precisely. User16: I was actively photographing Sauchiehall Street’s changing landscape around that time, and I have pictures up until March 2007 with the tombstone still in place. By my next visit in early May, it was gone. So, it must have been removed sometime between those months. User17: It vanished without much fanfare, didn't it? Considering how iconic it had become, you’d think its removal would have caught more attention. Then again, with the dilapidated state of the store, maybe people were just glad to see any signs of change. User18: Does anyone know why it was removed? Was it the city, the property owners, or someone else who decided to finally clear it out? That tombstone was practically a piece of urban art by the end. User19: From what I gathered, it was the property owners who eventually cleared it. With the ongoing talks of new tenants and refurbishments, all remnants of the old store had to go, including our infamous tombstone. In a way, it was the last chapter in the Halloween Central saga. User13: Such an interesting piece of local history, just gone without much notice. Thanks for sharing what you remember, everyone. It’s like putting together pieces of a forgotten puzzle. Moderator: It's clear that Glasgow Halloween Central and its tombstone left lasting memories for many in our community. While it might be gone, it’s discussions like these that keep the story alive.

Bungie, la desarrolladora detrás de \\"Halo\\", comenzó el desarrollo del juego original, \\"Halo: Combat Evolved\\", a finales de los años 90. Originalmente fue concebido como un juego de estrategia en tiempo real para Mac, pero a lo largo de su desarrollo, evolucionó a un juego de disparos en primera persona (FPS). Este cambio de género fue solo uno de los varios giros que tuvo el desarrollo del juego antes de su lanzamiento. # Orígenes e Innovaciones La creación de \\"Halo: Combat Evolved\\" fue inicialmente impulsada por la visión de crear un juego que combinase la mecánica emocionante de los shooters en primera persona con la amplitud y la inmersión de los mundos de ciencia ficción. La idea era ofrecer a los jugadores una experiencia profunda y rica en un entorno de ciencia ficción convincente. # Cambio de Plataforma y Desarrollo Inicialmente destinado a ser lanzado para Mac OS y Windows, \\"Halo\\" cambió de dirección cuando Microsoft adquirió Bungie en 2000. Este movimiento llevó el juego a ser un título de lanzamiento para la nueva consola de Microsoft, la Xbox, en noviembre de 2001. Esta decisión fue crucial para el éxito tanto de \\"Halo\\" como de la Xbox, ya que el juego se convirtió en un vendedor de consolas y estableció la base para una de las franquicias más exitosas en la historia de los videojuegos. # Desafíos y Logros en el Desarrollo Uno de los mayores retos durante el desarrollo de \\"Halo: Combat Evolved\\" fue integrar una narrativa convincente con la jugabilidad. Bungie quería asegurarse de que \\"Halo\\" no fuera simplemente otro juego de disparos, sino que ofreciera una experiencia rica en historias y personajes. El equipo de desarrollo logró un equilibrio entre acción intensa y momentos de exploración y narrativa, algo que no era común en los shooters de la época. \\"Halo\\" también innovó en la jugabilidad al introducir mecánicas como el escudo de energía regenerativa, que cambió la forma en que los jugadores abordaban el combate en los FPS. Además, el juego ofreció una experiencia multijugador que se convirtió en un estándar para el género. # Impacto Cultural El impacto de \\"Halo: Combat Evolved\\" fue inmediato y masivo. No solo ayudó a consolidar a la Xbox como una plataforma de juegos seria, sino que también influenció el diseño y desarrollo de futuros juegos de disparos en primera persona. La serie \\"Halo\\" ha crecido significativamente desde entonces, expandiéndose a libros, cómics, series de TV, y más, convirtiéndose en un fenómeno cultural. # Fuentes En cuanto a las fuentes directas de información, detalles adicionales sobre el desarrollo de \\"Halo\\" pueden encontrarse en entrevistas y documentales proporcionados por Bungie y Microsoft, así como en análisis retrospectivos y making-of publicados en revistas especializadas y sitios web dedicados a la industria del videojuego. Es importante destacar que, dado el formato de esta respuesta, las referencias específicas a fuentes detalladas no pueden incluirse, pero se recomienda buscar fuentes primarias y documentales para obtener información detallada y verificada sobre el desarrollo de \\"Halo\\"."},{"instruction":"cuanto dura una visita con audio guia en la basilica de san pedro?","output":"La duración de una visita con audio guía en la Basílica de San Pedro puede variar dependiendo de varios factores, como el interés del visitante, la velocidad a la que se mueva, cuánto tiempo se detenga en cada punto de interés, y si decide escuchar toda la información disponible en la audio guía.

The claim process can vary significantly based on jurisdiction, the nature of the case, and the specifics of the judgment. However, there are common steps involved in many jurisdictions: 1. **Obtaining the Judgment**: The first step is the formal conclusion of the case, where the judge or jury renders a decision. This decision, or judgment, is documented and made official by the court. 2. **Judgment Entry**: The court will enter the judgment into the public record. There is often a waiting period before the judgment is considered final, allowing for any appeals by the opposing party. 3. **Assessment of the Judgment**: If the judgment involves a monetary award, the exact amount must be determined—accounting for any interest accrued from the date of judgment and costs associated with the lawsuit. 4. **Notification of the Judgment Debtor**: The winning party (now the creditor) must notify the losing party (now the debtor) of the judgment and demand payment or compliance with the judgment. 5. **Collection of the Judgment**: If the debtor does not voluntarily comply with the judgment, the creditor may need to take additional steps to collect. This can involve: - **Garnishment**: Withholding a portion of the debtor's wages or bank accounts. - **Levies**: Seizing assets or property belonging to the debtor. - **Liens**: Placing a claim on the debtor’s property, such as a house or car, until the debt is paid. 6. **Post-Judgment Motions or Appeals**: The debtor may file motions to contest or reduce the judgment or initiate an appeal to a higher court. This can delay collection efforts. 7. **Satisfaction of Judgment**: Once the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied (for example, through the transfer of property, or the performance of a specific act), the creditor is responsible for filing a satisfaction of judgment with the court, indicating that the matter is resolved. Each of these steps can involve specific forms, deadlines, and procedures, which can vary widely between jurisdictions. It’s often necessary to consult with a lawyer or a legal advisor who can guide you through the process in your specific case and jurisdiction. Additionally, the process can be complicated and time-consuming, especially when attempting to collect a judgment from a debtor who is unwilling or unable to pay. Bear in mind this is a general outline, and specific cases, especially those involving complex or unusual judgments, may involve additional steps or procedures."},{"instruction":"Based on this abstract, can you give a brief description on the microbiome method? Plant nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is important in reducing fertilizer costs and mitigating negative impacts on agriculture and the environment. The goal of this research was to differentiate various strawberry cultivars based on their growth on compost versus inorganic nitrogen sources. The hypothesis posits that different strawberry cultivars display varying effects on the soil and plant microbiome. Given the variability in cultivars and their effects on the soil and microbiome, it is evident that different cultivars may influence the soil differently. Moreover, plants play a pivotal role in the development of microbiomes, subsequently supporting plant growth. For instance, plants exude amino acids from their roots to foster their beneficial microbiome. This hypothesis was tested by growing X cultivars of strawberries for six weeks in a mixture of peat moss and turface with and without added compost. The plants were watered daily with a complete soluble fertilizer with and without added nitrogen. Leachate was collected daily and the nitrogen content (loss of nitrogen) determined. Relative growth rate and tissue N uptake was determined at the end of the experiment. The results of this research revealed that strawberry cultivars exhibit distinct effects on the soil and microbiome when grown with and without compost. The hypothesis that different cultivars influence the soil differently was supported, demonstrating the importance of plant selection for sustainable agriculture and environmental protection.","output":"The microbiome method described in the abstract involves investigating the impact of different strawberry cultivars on the soil and plant microbiomes by observing their growth under various nutritional conditions. This method can be outlined in several key steps: 1. **Selection of Strawberry Cultivars**: Selecting various strawberry cultivars to test the hypothesis that different cultivars have distinct influences on the soil and plant microbiomes. 2. **Growth Conditions**: Growing the selected cultivars for six weeks in a controlled environment using a mixture of peat moss and turface as the growth medium. This setup aims to simulate conditions conducive to examining the interaction between the strawberries, their microbiome, and the growing environment. 3. **Nutritional Variations**: The strawberry plants are subjected to two nutritional regimes: one with added compost as an organic nitrogen source and another with complete soluble fertilizer, with and without added inorganic nitrogen. This step is designed to uncover how different nitrogen sources affect plant growth, nitrogen uptake, and their impact on the microbiome. 4. **Monitoring Nutrient Loss**: Collecting leachate daily from the plants and analyzing the nitrogen content (loss of nitrogen). This measure helps to understand how efficiently the plants utilize the available nitrogen under the different treatment conditions. 5. **Assessment of Plant Growth and Nitrogen Uptake**: At the end of the experiment, evaluating the relative growth rate and tissue nitrogen uptake of the strawberry plants. These parameters provide insights into the effectiveness of the different nitrogen sources and the potential influence of the strawberry cultivars on the soil's nutrient dynamics and the plant-soil microbiome interaction. 6. **Analysis of Soil and Plant Microbiome**: Though not detailed in the abstract, the method would likely include analyzing changes in the soil and plant microbiome composition resulting from the growth of different strawberry cultivars under varying nitrogen sources. This could involve molecular techniques such as DNA sequencing to identify and quantify microbial communities. In summary, the microbiome method described focuses on the complex interplay between strawberry cultivars, their nutritional environment, and the associated soil and plant microbiomes. It underscores the hypothesis that different cultivars can uniquely influence the microbiome, which in turn can have implications for plant growth, nutrient use efficiency, and sustainable agricultural practices."},{"instruction":"Дай список тем, которые никогда не упоминались ни в одном фильме или книги или сериале.","output":"Составить полный список тем, которые никогда не были упомянуты в кино, литературе или сериалах, крайне сложно, если не невозможно, по нескольким причинам: 1. **Обширность и разнообразие контента:** Существует огромное количество фильмов, книг и телесериалов, охватывающих практически бесконечное множество тем.

To resolve this issue, here are several steps you can follow: 1. **Verify the UEFI Firmware Installation**: Ensure that the UEFI firmware (sometimes referred to as \`QEMU_EFI.fd\` or similar) is correctly installed on your system. On many distributions, this might be included in a separate package. 2. **Check the Actual Location**: The correct path to the firmware might differ depending on your distribution. For instance, on Fedora, the UEFI firmware for aarch64 might be located at a different path or under a different name. Use a command like \`find /usr/share -iname '*uefi*aarch64*.bin'\` to search for it. 3. **Install or Reinstall the UEFI Package**: If the firmware is not present, you may need to install it. On Fedora, this might be available in a package like \`edk2-aarch64\` or \`qemu-uefi-aarch64\`. Install it using the package manager: \`\`\`bash sudo dnf install edk2-aarch64 \`\`\` or if the exact package name is different, search for it using: \`\`\`bash dnf search uefi | grep aarch64 \`\`\` 4. **Update the Command**: Once you've located or installed the correct UEFI firmware, update the path in your original command accordingly. 5. **Alternative --bios Option**: If for some reason you're unable to get the specific \`qemu-uefi-aarch64.bin\`, you could use an alternative like \`QEMU_EFI.fd\` in your command, adjusting the path based on its location on your system. 6. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the firmware file. Running the command with \`sudo\` might resolve the issue if it's permission-related, but it's generally best to ensure that the file is readable by your user. By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and proceed with your QEMU session. If issues persist, check if there are any additional dependencies or configurations specific to your system that might be affecting the setup."},{"instruction":"Unable to complete install: 'internal error: QEMU unexpectedly closed the monitor (vm='win11'): 2024-04-22T20:32:33.148555Z qemu-system-aarch64: can't apply global host-arm-cpu.hv-relaxed=on: Property 'host-arm-cpu.hv-relaxed' not found' Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/asyncjob.py\\", line 72, in cb_wrapper callback(asyncjob, *args, **kwargs) File \\"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/createvm.py\\", line 2008, in _do_async_install installer.start_install(guest, meter=meter) File \\"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/install/installer.py\\", line 695, in start_install domain = self._create_guest( ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/install/installer.py\\", line 637, in _create_guest domain = self.conn.createXML(initial_xml or final_xml, 0) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"/usr/lib64/python3.12/site-packages/libvirt.py\\", line 4523, in createXML raise libvirtError('virDomainCreateXML() failed') libvirt.libvirtError: internal error: QEMU unexpectedly closed the monitor (vm='win11'): 2024-04-22T20:32:33.148555Z qemu-system-aarch64: can't apply global host-arm-cpu.hv-relaxed=on: Property 'host-arm-cpu.hv-relaxed' not found","output":"The error message you're encountering suggests that there's an issue with the virtual machine configuration, specifically with an attempt to use a CPU feature (\`hv-relaxed\`) that is not recognized or supported by the QEMU version or configuration you are using, at least in the context of emulation for ARM architecture (\`aarch64\`). Here are some steps and considerations to address the problem: # 1. Check QEMU and libvirt Versions Ensure that you're running recent versions of both QEMU and libvirt. Older versions might lack support for certain features or contain bugs that have been fixed in later releases. - To check the version of QEMU, you can run: \`\`\`bash qemu-system-aarch64 --version \`\`\` - To check the version of libvirt, run: \`\`\`bash virsh --version \`\`\` If either is significantly out of date, consider updating them according to the guidelines of your Linux distribution. # 2. Review the Virtual Machine Configuration - **vm='win11' Configuration**: The issue involves a configuration setting (\`hv-relaxed\`) that is not correctly applied to your Windows 11 virtual machine intended for ARM architecture. It's possible this setting was added manually to the VM configuration or through a template that might not be fully compatible with your system's QEMU or libvirt setup. - **Remove or Modify Unsupported Feature**: If you're directly editing the XML configuration file for your virtual machine, look for the line that tries to enable \`hv-relaxed\` and either modify it to a supported parameter or remove it: - Open the VM's XML configuration: \`virsh edit win11\` - Search for \`host-arm-cpu.hv-relaxed\` and either remove that line or comment it out. - Save your changes and attempt to start the VM again. # 3. Check QEMU and Virtualization Support - **Compatibility and Support**: Ensure that the ARM virtualization features you're trying to use are supported on your hardware and by your QEMU build. Not all features available on x86_64 are directly transferable or available on ARM architecture. - **Custom QEMU Parameters**: If you're using custom QEMU command-line arguments or specific parameters in your VM configuration files, ensure that they are compatible with ARM virtualization. Documentation and forums such as the QEMU and libvirt official sites can be invaluable resources. # 4. Consult Documentation and Community - Given the specificity of the error with respect to ARM CPU virtualization features, consulting the [QEMU documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/) and resources such as the [libvirt Wiki](https://wiki.libvirt.org/) might uncover new insights or workarounds. - Community forums and mailing lists related to QEMU, libvirt, and your specific Linux distribution can also be helpful. Someone else might have encountered a similar issue or configuration challenge. # Conclusion Addressing the \`hv-relaxed\` error involves ensuring compatibility with your QEMU and libvirt versions, reviewing and potentially adjusting the configuration of your VM, and ensuring that you're using features supported by your hardware and software environment. If after these troubleshooting steps the issue persists, providing detailed information about your setup (versions of QEMU, libvirt, the exact VM configuration) to a community forum or support channel for QEMU/libvirt might offer more tailored advice."},{"instruction":"<domain type=\\"kvm\\"> <name>win11</name> <uuid>222f6755-1086-4a0b-afa0-8a8235e981db</uuid> <metadata> <libosinfo:libosinfo xmlns:libosinfo=\\"http://libosinfo.org/xmlns/libvirt/domain/1.0\\"> <libosinfo:os id=\\"http://microsoft.com/win/11\\"/> </libosinfo:libosinfo> </metadata> <memory>4194304</memory> <currentMemory>4194304</currentMemory> <vcpu current=\\"4\\">4</vcpu> <os firmware=\\"efi\\"> <type arch=\\"aarch64\\" machine=\\"virt\\">hvm</type> <boot dev=\\"hd\\"/> </os> <features> <acpi/> <hyperv> <relaxed state=\\"on\\"/> <vapic state=\\"on\\"/> <spinlocks state=\\"on\\" retries=\\"8191\\"/> </hyperv> </features> <cpu mode=\\"host-passthrough\\"> <topology sockets=\\"1\\" cores=\\"4\\" threads=\\"1\\"/> </cpu> <clock offset=\\"localtime\\"/> <devices> <emulator>/usr/bin/qemu-system-aarch64</emulator> <disk type=\\"file\\" device=\\"disk\\"> <driver name=\\"qemu\\" type=\\"raw\\"/> <source file=\\"/home/jayden/Downloads/Windows11_InsiderPreview_Client_ARM64_en-us_22598.VHDX\\"/> <target dev=\\"vda\\" bus=\\"virtio\\"/> </disk> <disk type=\\"file\\" device=\\"cdrom\\"> <driver name=\\"qemu\\" type=\\"raw\\"/> <source file=\\"/home/jayden/Downloads/virtio-win-0.1.248.iso\\"/> <target dev=\\"sda\\" bus=\\"usb\\"/> <readonly/> </disk> <controller type=\\"usb\\" model=\\"qemu-xhci\\" ports=\\"15\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"pci\\" model=\\"pcie-root-port\\"/> <controller type=\\"scsi\\" index=\\"0\\" model=\\"virtio-scsi\\"/> <interface type=\\"network\\"> <source network=\\"default\\"/> <mac address=\\"52:54:00:c4:72:92\\"/> <model type=\\"virtio\\"/> </interface> <console type=\\"pty\\"/> <channel type=\\"unix\\"> <source mode=\\"bind\\"/> <target type=\\"virtio\\" name=\\"org.qemu.guest_agent.0\\"/> </channel> <tpm> <backend type=\\"emulator\\"/> </tpm> <video> <model type=\\"ramfb\\"/> </video> </devices> </domain> how do i fix i with this xml?","output":"The error you initially mentioned, \\"Property 'host-arm-cpu.hv-relaxed' not found\\", indicates a problem with setting Hyper-V features for an ARM-based Windows 11 VM. The XML configuration snippet provided aims to set up a Windows 11 ARM64 VM with certain Hyper-V features enabled in the \`<hyperv>\` section, but the error suggests that your setup does not support one or more of these features directly. Here, I'll guide you through adjusting your VM's XML configuration to potentially bypass the issue: 1. **Remove Unsupported Hyper-V Features**: Since the error was specifically about the \`hv-relaxed\` setting not being supported, you can try modifying or removing unsupported Hyper-V features from your configuration. However, because your error pertains to an ARM architecture VM and the \`<hyperv>\` section is generally used for tuning Windows VMs on x86_64 architectures, some of these features might not be applicable or might be causing your issue when running on ARM. You can start by commenting out or removing the entire \`<hyperv>\` section: \`\`\`xml <!-- <hyperv> <relaxed state=\\"on\\"/> <vapic state=\\"on\\"/> <spinlocks state=\\"on\\" retries=\\"8191\\"/> </hyperv> --> \`\`\` 2. **Review CPU Mode**: You're currently using \`host-passthrough\` for the CPU mode, which passes through the host CPU with all its features to the guest. This is usually the recommended modo for x86_64 VMs for performance reasons but can sometimes lead to issues on ARM or when specific CPU features (like those needed for certain \`<hyperv>\` settings) are expected by the guest OS. Given you're encountering issues related to CPU feature emulation, you might not need to change this. However, it's worth knowing in case you encounter other CPU feature-related issues. 3. **Adjust Disk Type for VHDX**: Your Windows 11 image is in VHDX format, yet your XML configuration specifies the disk driver type as \`raw\`. While QEMU can work with VHDX files, specifying the type correctly may avoid potential issues. Try changing it to \`vhdx\`: \`\`\`xml <disk type=\\"file\\" device=\\"disk\\"> <driver name=\\"qemu\\" type=\\"vhdx\\"/> <source file=\\"/home/jayden/Downloads/Windows11_InsiderPreview_Client_ARM64_en-us_22598.VHDX\\"/> <target dev=\\"vda\\" bus=\\"virtio\\"/> </disk> \`\`\` After making these changes, save the XML file and reload the VM definition: \`\`\`bash virsh define path/to/your/modified.xml \`\`\` Then, try starting the VM again: \`\`\`bash virsh start win11 \`\`\` These steps should hopefully resolve the initial issue. If the VM still doesn't start, check the latest error messages for any new issues that may need to be addressed. Remember, ARM virtualization, especially for system emulations like Windows on ARM, can sometimes run into specific compatibility and feature-support challenges, so additional adjustments might be necessary depending on your setup."},{"instruction":"how do I use -bios /usr/share/qemu/qemu-uefi-aarch64.bin in the xml file on qemu","output":"To use a specific UEFI firmware with QEMU, especially when configuring through XML for use with libvirt (such as with \`virt-manager\` or \`virsh\`), you need to specify the path to your UEFI firmware file within the \`<os>\` section of your VM's XML configuration file. The firmware file acts as the 'bios' for your virtual machine, initialising the hardware before your operating system boots up. For ARM architecture and using UEFI firmware, follow these steps: 1. **Locate the UEFI Firmware**: Ensure you know the correct path to your UEFI firmware file. According to your question, it's \`/usr/share/qemu/qemu-uefi-aarch64.bin\`. Verify that the file exists at this location. 2. **Edit the VM's XML Configuration**: Open your VM's XML configuration. You can do this by running \`virsh edit your-vm-name\`, replacing \`your-vm-name\` with the name of your virtual machine. 3. **Modify the XML for UEFI Firmware**: Within the \`<os>\` section of the XML, you need to specify the UEFI firmware file using the \`<loader>\` element. Here's how you might adjust it: \`\`\`xml <os> <type arch='aarch64' machine='virt'>hvm</type> <loader readonly='yes' type='pflash'>/usr/share/qemu/qemu-uefi-aarch64.bin</loader> <boot dev='hd'/> </os> \`\`\` - \`arch='aarch64'\` specifies the architecture. - \`machine='virt'\` should be adjusted to your target virtual machine type. - The \`<loader>\` element's \`readonly='yes'\` attribute specifies that the firmware is not writable, which is typical for UEFI firmware. The \`type='pflash'\` indicates that this is a parallel flash image, suitable for UEFI firmware. - The path provided to the \`<loader>\` should be the absolute path to your firmware file. 4. **Save and Apply Changes**: After making these changes, save the file and exit the editor. \`virsh\` will automatically parse and apply the updated configuration. 5. **Start Your VM**: Now, attempt to start your VM with \`virsh start your-vm-name\` to see if the changes have successfully allowed it to use the specified UEFI firmware. These instructions should guide you in configuring a virtual machine to use a specific UEFI firmware file with QEMU and libvirt. This process is particularly useful when setting up an ARM64 VM that requires UEFI, such as for running certain versions of Windows or Linux distributions that rely on UEFI instead of traditional BIOS."},{"instruction":"<domain type=\\"kvm\\"> <name>win11</name> <uuid>ac9517de-618f-4e75-b40c-3444d17064eb</uuid> <metadata> <libosinfo:libosinfo

satisfy 'efi'","output":"The error message \\"Unable to find any firmware to satisfy 'efi'\\" indicates that the libvirt cannot find the EFI firmware files that are needed to boot your virtual machine in UEFI mode. This is a common issue when the UEFI firmware package is not installed on your system, or the path specified in the VM's XML configuration does not point to the correct location of the EFI firmware files. Here are steps to resolve this issue: # 1. Ensure UEFI Firmware Package is Installed For systems running Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL, you often need the \`edk2-aarch64\` package for ARM64 UEFI firmware. Install it using: \`\`\`bash sudo dnf install edk2-aarch64 \`\`\` For Debian, Ubuntu, or similar systems, the package might be named differently, like \`ovmf\`: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get install ovmf \`\`\` # 2. Locate the UEFI Firmware File After installing the package, you need to locate the UEFI firmware file. For ARM64, the filename might be different than \`qemu-uefi-aarch64.bin\`. Commonly, it could be \`QEMU_EFI.fd\` or something similar. Use the \`find\` command to locate it: \`\`\`bash sudo find /usr/share -name \\"QEMU_EFI.fd\\" \`\`\` or for a more broad search: \`\`\`bash sudo find /usr -name \\"*.fd\\" \`\`\` # 3. Update the VM's XML Configuration Once you've located the correct EFI firmware file, update the \`<loader>\` element in your VM's XML configuration with the correct path. If the firmware file is named \`QEMU_EFI.fd\` and is located in \`/usr/share/AAVMF\`, adjust the \`<loader>\` line like so: \`\`\`xml <loader readonly='yes' type='pflash'>/usr/share/AAVMF/QEMU_EFI.fd</loader> \`\`\` # 4. Redefine the VM After updating the XML file, save your changes and redefine the virtual machine with libvirt. Use the \`virsh\` command as shown below: \`\`\`bash virsh define /path/to/your/updated-vm.xml \`\`\` Replace \`/path/to/your/updated-vm.xml\` with the path to your modified XML file. # 5. Restart libvirt Service In some cases, it might be helpful to restart the libvirt service to ensure it correctly recognizes the installed firmware packages: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart libvirtd \`\`\` (Use \`libvirt-bin\` instead of \`libvirtd\` on older Debian/Ubuntu versions.) # Additional Tips - Make sure you are editing the VM's XML configuration file as a user that has permissions to interact with libvirt. Usually, it's done using \`sudo\` or as the \`root\` user, but it can also be configured for less privileged users. - Verify that your VM's architecture matches the architecture of the UEFI firmware. Since you're configuring an \`aarch64\` VM, the firmware should also be for ARM64/aarch64. Following these steps should help resolve the firmware-related issue and allow your VM to start in UEFI mode."},{"instruction":"Дай список тем, которые никогда не упоминались ни в одном фильме или книги или сериале.

Исследователи обнаруживают странный объект, похожий на обычную космическую лавочку, брошенную на орбите неопознанной планеты. При первичном исследовании выясняется, что внутри этого объекта находится самодостаточная экосистема, эволюционировавшая независимо и вдали от человеческих взглядов. Группа учёных решает зайти внутрь, чтобы изучить эту удивительную систему, не подозревая, что на самом деле они являются частью эксперимента. Внутри они обнаруживают сложное сообщество разумных существ, совершенно отличных от любых видов, известных человечеству. Существа воспринимают прибытие людей как начало нового этапа в их \\"искусственно созданном мире\\". Чем дальше учёные продвигаются в исследованиях, тем больше они начинают сомневаться в реальности окружающего мира. Один из исследователей, гениальный учёный-квантист, обнаруживает подсказки, указывающие на то, что вся их Вселенная на самом деле может быть чем-то вроде \\"экосистемы в лавочке\\", созданной высокоразвитой цивилизацией для изучения эволюции разумной жизни. В соответствии с теорией зоопарка, высшие существа преднамеренно скрывают от человечества правду о его происхождении и цели, позволяя людям вести независимое и неограниченное исследование внутри их \\"изолированной экосистемы\\". Исследователи должны решить, стоит ли раскрыть эту тайну остальной части человечества и каким будет их будущее, если они в самом деле живут в мире, который является экспериментальным \\"зоопарком\\" для других, более развитых существ. **Кульминация и окончание:** Исходя из того, что центральной темой является разгадка происхождения и предназначения человечества, книга завершается моментом выбора: сохранить стабильность внутри \\"экосистемы\\", игнорируя полученные знания о своём истинном месте в космосе, или же стремиться к разрушению иллюзии и попытке установить контакт с создателями \\"зоопарка\\". В финале наши герои ставят перед всем человечеством вопрос о том, готово ли оно принять правду о себе и своём месте во Вселенной, пусть даже эта правда кардинально изменит всё, что они знали до этого."},{"instruction":"como le dicen a las horas extras en ingles","output":"A las horas extras en inglés se les llama \\"overtime\\"."},{"instruction":"y de otra forma","output":"Otra forma común de referirse a las horas extras en inglés, aunque menos formal y menos usada, es \\"extra hours\\".

Using \`trim()\` is helpful in this context to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input value. This ensures that the comparison isn't affected by any extra spaces or whitespace characters that might be present in the input. Here's why \`trim()\` is used instead of just comparing the input value directly: 1. **Leading and Trailing Whitespace**: If the user accidentally enters extra spaces before or after the text in the input field, using \`trim()\` removes these spaces before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison accurately detects an empty input. 2. **Whitespace Characters**: Sometimes, users may input invisible whitespace characters that cannot be easily seen. These characters can affect the comparison result if not trimmed. Using \`trim()\` helps to ensure that such characters are removed before comparison. In summary, using \`trim()\` before comparing the input value helps to standardize and clean up the input text, making the comparison more reliable, especially when checking for empty inputs."},{"instruction":"<tr> <td style=\\"text-align:right;padding:5px\\"> الوظيفة : </td> <td style=\\"text-align:center\\"><span style=\\"text-align:center\\" class=\\"professionPrint\\">{{profession}}</span> <input style=\\"text-align:center\\" class=\\"professionInput\\" type=\\"text\\" [(ngModel)]=\\"profession\\" /></td> <td style=\\"text-align:left;padding-left:10px\\">: Profession </td> </tr> i want to add * as required class over input","output":"To add an asterisk (*) as a required indicator next to the input field, you can modify the HTML template by adding the asterisk and styling it accordingly.

Les causes de la faiblesse de l'économie en RDC.","output":"1. **La conceptualisation de l'économie** L'économie repose sur l'étude de la production, la distribution, et la consommation de biens et services. Elle explore comment les individus, les entreprises, les gouvernements et les nations prennent des décisions sur l'allocation des ressources pour satisfaire leurs besoins et désirs, et tenter d'optimiser la gestion des ressources souvent limitées. Elle peut être divisée en deux grandes branches : la microéconomie, qui se concentre sur les actions des individus et des entreprises ; et la macroéconomie, qui examine l'économie dans son ensemble, y compris le chômage, l'inflation, la croissance économique, etc. L'économie d'un pays peut être influencée par un éventail de facteurs internes et externes, y compris, mais sans s'y limiter, les politiques gouvernementales, l'environnement international, les ressources naturelles, et la technologie. 2. **L'état de lieux de l'économie en RDC** La République Démocratique du Congo (RDC) possède d'immenses ressources naturelles, y compris une part significative des réserves mondiales de diamants, or, coltan, et cuivre, ainsi que d’un potentiel agricole énorme. Toutefois, malgré cette richesse en ressources, l'économie de la RDC peine à atteindre son plein potentiel et reste l'une des économies les moins développées au monde. Les indicateurs économiques clés montrent que la majorité de la population vit en dessous du seuil de pauvreté, avec un accès limité à l'emploi formel, aux services de santé et à l'éducation. La RDC est confrontée à de nombreux défis, notamment une stabilité politique fragile, une gouvernance et une gestion des ressources naturelles souvent inefficaces, des infrastructures sous-développées, et une dépendance excessive envers les matières premières, dont les prix sont volatils sur les marchés internationaux. Ces facteurs limitent la croissance économique du pays et l'amélioration de la qualité de vie de ses citoyens. 3. **Les causes de la faiblesse de l'économie en RDC** Les causes de la faiblesse économique en RDC sont multiples et interconnectées: - **Instabilité politique et conflits**: La RDC a été marquée par des décennies de conflits et d'instabilité politique, ce qui a découragé les investissements étrangers et locaux et a grandement perturbé le développement économique. - **Gouvernance et corruption**: La mauvaise gouvernance et la corruption endémique ont conduit à une gestion inefficace des ressources, ce qui a restreint la croissance économique et exacerbé la pauvreté. - **Dépendance aux matières premières**: L'économie de la RDC est fortement dépendante de l'exportation de quelques ressources naturelles, la rendant vulnérable aux chocs externes, comme les fluctuations des prix sur les marchés mondiaux. - **Accès limité aux capitaux et aux marchés**: Le manque d'accès au capital et aux marchés internationaux pour les produits autres que les ressources naturelles limite la diversification économique. - **Infrastructures insuffisantes**: Le manque d'infrastructures adéquates (routes, électricité, eau potable) entrave le développement économique, limitant l'accès aux marchés et augmentant les coûts de production. - **Faiblesse du secteur formel**: L'économie informelle est prédominante, ce qui réduit les recettes fiscales de l'État et limite les investissements dans les services publics essentiels. Pour renforcer l'économie de la RDC, il faudrait s'attaquer à ces défis de manière holistique, en améliorant la gouvernance, en diversifiant l'économie, en renforçant les infrastructures, en favorisant le développement du secteur privé, et en promouvant l'éducation et la formation des compétences."},{"instruction":"Как будет выглядеть мир где возможна неограниченная возможность менять днк и генетику любой органики","output":"Мир, где существует неограниченная возможность менять ДНК и генетику любой органики, будет радикально отличаться от нашего современного общества как в социальном, так и в экологическом аспекте.

The common issue might involve using a combination of HTML and CSS where product cards are intended to be in a row, but they appear in a column instead. This misalignment can occur if the CSS properties for the container or the cards themselves are not set correctly. Here is an example: # HTML \`\`\`html <div class=\\"product-container\\"> <div class=\\"product-card\\">Product 1</div> <div class=\\"product-card\\">Product 2</div> <div class=\\"product-card\\">Product 3</div> </div> \`\`\` # CSS (With a Potential Issue) \`\`\`css .product-container { display: block; } .product-card { width: 100px; margin: 10px; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; /* Incorrect alignment due to lack of display or flex/inline-block setup */ } \`\`\` In the above scenario, the \`.product-card\` elements might not line up in a row as intended due to the lack of proper display properties being set.

Adjust the \`min-width\` and \`max-width\` of the \`.card\` as needed to fit your design requirements. The \`flex-wrap\` property enables the cards to wrap to the next row if the screen or containing element's width cannot accommodate them side by side, making the layout responsive."},{"instruction":"Words similar to: raffle, prize","output":"lottery, drawing, reward, award, gift, giveaway, jackpot, sweepstake"},{"instruction":"from 10 am to 5pm how many hours worked","output":"If you work from 10 AM to 5 PM, you have worked for 7 hours."},{"instruction":"answer these questions correctly: How would you handle a situation where a customer leaves a negative review due to a misunderstanding? * 10 points A) Ignore the review since it’s based on a misunderstanding.

Uno de los ejemplos más emblemáticos de esto es la creación de \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", desarrollado por Nintendo. # Super Mario Bros. El origen: \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" se lanzó en 1985 para la consola Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), convirtiéndose en uno de los videojuegos más influyentes de todos los tiempos. Su desarrollo estuvo liderado por Shigeru Miyamoto, quien trabajó en estrecha colaboración con Takashi Tezuka y el programador Koji Kondo, quien compuso la música inconfundible del juego. La creación de Mario: La aparición de Mario no fue inicialmente para \\"Super Mario Bros.\\". El personaje debutó en \\"Donkey Kong\\" (1981), donde era conocido simplemente como \\"Jumpman\\". Sin embargo, fue en \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" donde Mario adquirió su rol de plomero italiano, gracias en parte a las limitaciones técnicas de la época que influenciaron su diseño icónico. El bigote y la gorra, por ejemplo, fueron soluciones creativas para evitar tener que detallar expresiones faciales y cabello debido a la resolución limitada de los gráficos. Innovaciones y desafíos: La creación de \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" implicó varios desafíos técnicos y narrativos. Miyamoto y su equipo querían explorar nuevas fronteras en términos de jugabilidad y diseño de niveles, alejándose del formato de pantalla única que era común en aquel entonces. Esto llevó al desarrollo de un mundo expansivo que los jugadores podían explorar horizontalmente, lo cual fue una innovación en aquel tiempo. El diseño de niveles de \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" fue meticuloso, con Miyamoto centrando esfuerzos en asegurarse de que el juego fuera desafiante pero justo, y que introdujera gradualmente a los jugadores a nuevos conceptos y mecánicas de juego a medida que avanzaban. Impacto y legado: \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" estableció muchas de las convenciones del género de plataformas y jugó un papel crucial en la revitalización de la industria del videojuego después del colapso de 1983. La popularidad del juego llevó a numerosas secuelas, spin-offs y adaptaciones a otros medios. Mario se ha convertido en la mascota de Nintendo y uno de los iconos culturales más reconocibles a nivel mundial. Para una revisión más detallada de la creación de \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" y el impacto de Mario en la cultura popular, algunas fuentes recomendables incluyen: - \\"Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America\\" por Jeff Ryan, donde se explora la historia de Nintendo y la creación de sus juegos más emblemáticos, incluido \\"Super Mario Bros.\\". - \\"Game Over: How Nintendo Conquered the World\\" por David Sheff, ofrece una mirada detallada a la historia de Nintendo y el desarrollo de varios de sus juegos más influyentes. Estas fuentes bibliográficas proporcionan un testimonio del ingenio y la creatividad detrás de \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", así como un análisis del impacto cultural y económico que el juego ha tenido desde su lanzamiento."},{"instruction":"I am trying to boot arm windows on an aaarch64 fedora install using qemu.

libvirt. However, the error message \\"Image type x64 cant be loaded on aarch64\\" suggests that there might be confusion around the architecture of the image that is attempting to be booted. Here are several checkpoints and suggestions for troubleshooting and ensuring an appropriate setup: 1. **Verify the Image**: Double-check that the Windows 11 ARM image you've downloaded is indeed for ARM64 architecture. The file name you've provided (\`Windows11_InsiderPreview_Client_ARM64_en-us_22598.VHDX\`) suggests it is correct, but it's worth verifying its integrity and architecture. Use a tool that allows you to inspect VHDX files or consult the source where you downloaded the image from for confirmation. 2. **Image Type Conversion**: You're using a VHDX image directly. While QEMU can theoretically use VHDX images, it's generally more compatible and common to use qcow2 format images or raw images. Consider converting the VHDX to a raw image or a qcow2 format image using qemu-img, for example: \`\`\`bash qemu-img convert -O raw /path/to/original.vhdx /path/to/new/image.raw \`\`\` Or for a qcow2 format: \`\`\`bash qemu-img convert -O qcow2 /path/to/original.vhdx /path/to/new/image.qcow2 \`\`\` After conversion, ensure you update the \`<source file=\\"/path/to/new/image.format\\"/>\` in your XML configuration to point to the new image file. 3. **Disk and Bus Compatibility**: You've configured the Windows disk to attach via USB (\`<target dev=\\"sda\\" bus=\\"usb\\"/>\`). Windows ARM might have issues booting from a USB-attached disk. Changing the disk bus to \`virtio\` or \`scsi\` might help. For an ARM-based VM, \`virtio\` is usually a good choice for performance and compatibility. Update your disk device section to use \`virtio\` like this: \`\`\` <disk type=\\"file\\" device=\\"disk\\"> <driver name=\\"qemu\\" type=\\"raw\\"/> <source file=\\"/path/to/new/image.qcow2\\"/> <target dev=\\"vda\\" bus=\\"virtio\\"/> </disk> \`\`\` 4. **Ensure QEMU and libvirt Support**: Make sure your QEMU and libvirt installations support ARM Virtualization fully. You're already using \`qemu-system-aarch64\`, but ensure all dependencies are up to date, especially those related to EFI for ARM. 5. **NVRAM and Firmware Check**: Your configuration points to the appropriate ARM EFI firmware and NVRAM template paths. Ensure these files exist and are accessible by QEMU. Sometimes, issues can arise if the firmware files are not the correct versions or are corrupted. 6. **Secure Boot**: You've disabled Secure Boot in your XML (\`<feature enabled=\\"no\\" name=\\"secure-boot\\"/>\`). This is usually a good troubleshooting step, but ensure that the Windows ARM image you're using doesn't require Secure Boot to be enabled. If it does, you'll need to ensure your setup supports Secure Boot for VMs. After making sure all these points are checked and possibly applying the suggested adjustments, try starting the VM again. If the problem persists, consider looking at QEMU logs for more detailed error information, which might provide further clues on what's going wrong."},{"instruction":"Воспользовавшись Типовыми нормами бесплатной выдачи сертифицированных специальной одежды, специальной обуви и других средств индивидуальной защиты работникам сквозных профессий и должностей всех видов экономической деятельности, занятым на работах с вредными и (или) опасными условиями труда, а также на работах, выполняемых в особых температурных условиях или связанных с загрязнением, утв. приказом Минтруда России от 09.12.2014 № 997н, сформируйте комплекты необходимых средств индивидуальной защиты для следующих профессий: 1.

Давайте разберём её по частям для лучшего понимания: 1. **\\"Дайма\\"** — происходит от глагола \\"даймаха\\", что в переводе означает \\"пожелать\\". Это форма императива (повелительного наклонения) для выражения просьбы или команды. 2. **\\"са\\"** — местоимение в дательном падеже, означающее \\"мне\\". В чеченском языке, как и во многих других, словоформы могут изменяться в зависимости от падежа, числа и лица. 3. **\\"веза\\"** — это существительное \\"успех\\" или \\"удача\\". В этом контексте оно используется как объект пожелания. Вместе эти элементы образуют выражение \\"Пожелай мне удачи!\\" на чеченском языке. Важно отметить, что языковые конструкции и выражения могут варьироваться в зависимости от диалекта, контекста и культурных особенностей."},{"instruction":"Объясни, пожалуйста, разницу между few, a few, little, a little","output":"Конечно, я с радостью объясню разницу между \\"few\\", \\"a few\\", \\"little\\", \\"a little\\". Эти фразы используются для выражения количества, но их значения и контексты использования различаются. # Few и A Few Оба этих выражения относятся к небольшому количеству существительных, которые могут быть пересчитаны (исчисляемые существительные). - **Few** указывает на отсутствие достаточного количества чего-либо. Оно имеет оттенок негатива, подразумевая, что чего-то мало и это неудовлетворительно. Например, \\"I have few friends\\" (У меня мало друзей) может подразумевать, что кому-то обидно или грустно по этому поводу. - **A Few** имеет положительный оттенок и указывает на наличие небольшого количества чего-то, но это количество воспринимается как достаточное или положительное. Например, \\"I have a few friends\\" (У меня есть несколько друзей) звучит так, будто человек доволен наличием этих друзей. # Little и A Little Эти два выражения относятся к количеству неисчисляемых существительных (то есть к тому, что не может быть легко пересчитано или посчитано в единицах). - **Little** схоже с \\"few\\" тем, что также несёт негативное значение, указывая на недостаток чего-либо. Например, \\"I have little money\\" (У меня мало денег) подразумевает, что денег недостаточно для каких-то целей. - **A Little** аналогично \\"a few\\" имеет положительный оттенок. Оно указывает на наличие небольшого количества чего-то, но это количество воспринимается как достаточное или хотя бы как некоторое количество. Например, \\"I have a little money\\" (У меня есть немного денег) может звучать так, будто у человека есть достаточно денег для какой-то конкретной маленькой покупки или нужды. Важно понимать контекст, в котором используются эти словосочетания, так как оттенок (положительный или негативный) может значительно изменить смысл высказываний."},{"instruction":"Yesterday the international students ….about the Kremlin by the guide. Варианты ответа: were told, told, will tell, is tolded. Я ответ знаю, но хочу написать шпаргалку подруге, чтобы она потом ошибки в таких предложениях не делала. Можешь написать шпаргалку, как не ошибиться, пожалуйста?","output":"Конечно, давайте создадим небольшую шпаргалку по правильному выбору времени и формы глаголов в английском языке, особенно в контексте пассивного залога, как в вашем примере. # Основы пассивного залога: 1. **Определение**: Пассивный залог (Passive Voice) используется, когда действие важнее, чем тот, кто это действие совершает, или когда субъект действия неизвестен или неупомянут. Структура: *be + past participle* (прошедшее причастие). 2. **Формула пассивного залога**: - **Present Simple**: am/is/are + past participle - **Past Simple**: was/were + past participle - **Future Simple**: will be + past participle 3. **Выбор глагола \\"to be\\"**: Глагол \\"to be\\" должен соответствовать времени и числу субъекта. В примере с международными студентами действие происходило в прошлом, и субъект (студенты) — множественное число, следовательно, нужна форма \\"were\\". 4. **Прошедшее причастие**: Независимо от подлежащего, прошедшее причастие глагола остаётся неизменным. В вашем случае это \\"told\\" (рассказанный). # Пример использования с вашим предложением: - **Правильный ответ**: \\"Yesterday the international students were told about the Kremlin by the guide.\\" - Почему? \\"The international students\\" — множественное число, действие в прошлом (вчера), значит нужно использовать \\"were\\" от \\"to be\\" и прошедшее причастие основного глагола \\"tell\\" -> \\"told\\". # Шаги для определения правильной формы: 1. Определите, нужен ли пассивный залог (когда действие важнее субъекта). 2. Определите время действия (настоящее, прошедшее, будущее). 3. На основе времени и числа субъекта выберите правильную форму глагола \\"to be\\". 4. Добавьте прошедшее причастие основного глагола действия. # Помните о временах и числах: - Для **Present Simple** в пассивном залоге используйте \\"am/is/are\\". - Для **Past Simple** — \\"was/were\\". - Для **Future Simple** — \\"will be\\". Используя эту шпаргалку, можно точно определить, когда и как использовать пассивный залог в английском языке, а также избежать ошибок при его формировании."},{"instruction":"Ещё проще!!!","output":"Хорошо, давайте упростим: # Как не ошибиться с \\"were told, told, will tell, is tolded\\" в предложениях: 1. **Когда и что использовать**: - **\\"were told\\"** - для группы людей в прошлом. - **\\"told\\"** - когда кто-то конкретно что-то сказал. - **\\"will tell\\"** - когда кто-то скажет что-то в будущем. - **\\"is tolded\\"** - не существует в английском языке. 2. **Проверь время**: - Если событие уже случилось (вчера, в прошлом), нужен \\"were told\\". 3. **Проверь субъект**: - Если говорится о группе людей (множественное число), и действие было в прошлом, используй \\"were told\\". # Примеры: - Вчера студентам **рассказали** (было сказано) про Кремль. Правильно: Yesterday the international students **were told** about the Kremlin. # Твоя шпаргалка: 1. Событие в прошлом + группа людей = **\\"were told\\"**. 2.

Здесь главное - это было в прошлом и с кем-то что-то случилось. - Если действие просто кто-то **делает** (активный залог), и это прошлое, используй просто *\\"told\\"*. - Если действие будет совершено в будущем, используй *\\"will tell\\"*. # От \\"is tolded\\" - отказываемся: - Это неправильная форма, не используй её. # Пример: - Если вчера гид **рассказал** студентам о Кремле, то правильно будет: \\"Yesterday the international students **were told** about the Kremlin.\\" # Чтобы было ещё проще: - Случилось в прошлом и не зависит от того, кто сделал действие?

Универсальный для этой конструкции, чтобы она могла им пользоваться","output":"Конечно! Вот универсальный алгоритм для использования конструкций с \\"were told\\", \\"told\\", \\"will tell\\": 1. **Определи время действия:** - Прошлое → использовать \\"was/were told\\". - Будущее → использовать \\"will tell\\". - Настоящее или конкретное действие в прошлом → использовать \\"told\\". 2. **Определи, кто делает действие и кто его принимает (субъект и объект):** - Если действие совершено над кем-то (некто рассказал информацию), тебе нужен пассивный залог. - Один человек → \\"was told\\". - Несколько людей → \\"were told\\". - Если мы говорим о том, кто совершил действие (некто рассказывает информацию): - Просто используй \\"told\\". 3. **Выбери правильную форму \\"to be\\" для пассивного залога:** - Прошлое + единственное число → \\"was told\\". - Прошлое + множественное число → \\"were told\\". - Будущее (для всех случаев) → \\"will be told\\" (если тебе нужно указать на будущее действие в пассивном залоге, но помни, что \\"will tell\\" используется чаще в активном залоге, когда кто-то будет что-то говорить). 4. **\\"Is tolded\\" – забудь эту форму.** Она неправильная и не существует в английском языке.

L’état de lieux. (c’àd faire le diagnostic par rapport à l’économie en RDC) 3. Les causes de la faiblesse de l’économie en RDC.","output":"**1. La conceptualisation de l'économie** L'économie est une science sociale qui étudie la manière dont les individus, les entreprises, les gouvernements et les nations prennent des décisions sur l'allocation de ressources rares pour satisfaire leurs besoins et désirs illimités. Elle se concentre sur la production, la distribution et la consommation de biens et services, cherchant à comprendre le fonctionnement des systèmes économiques et la manière dont les agents économiques interagissent. L'économie se divise en deux grands champs d'analyse : la microéconomie, qui examine le comportement des entités individuelles telles que les consommateurs, les entreprises et les marchés; et la macroéconomie, qui étudie l'économie dans son ensemble en examinant des indicateurs globaux comme le PIB, le taux de chômage, et l'inflation pour comprendre les tendances économiques à grande échelle. **2. L'état de lieux de l'économie en RDC** La République Démocratique du Congo (RDC) détient d'immenses ressources naturelles, y compris dans des secteurs clés tels que l'exploitation minière (cuivre, cobalt, diamants, or, etc.), l'énergie hydroélectrique, et possède une importante superficie de terres arables. Malgré cela, l'économie de la RDC est confrontée à de nombreux défis qui freinent son développement. Le pays affiche l'un des plus bas revenus par habitant de la planète, une grande partie de la population vit en dessous du seuil de pauvreté, et l'instabilité politique ainsi que les conflits armés ont affecté son économie. La croissance économique de la RDC est largement tributaire du secteur minier, ce qui rend son économie vulnérable aux fluctuations des prix des matières premières sur les marchés internationaux. Bien que le potentiel agricole du pays soit énorme, le secteur reste sous-développé, en grande partie à cause de l'infrastructure insuffisante et du manque d'investissements. **3. Les causes de la faiblesse de l'économie en RDC** Plusieurs facteurs contribuent à la faiblesse de l’économie en RDC, parmi lesquels : - **Instabilité politique et conflits** : La RDC a été, au fil des décennies, le théâtre de nombreux conflits armés et d'instabilités politiques, ce qui a entravé les investissements et le développement économique. - **Dépendance au secteur minier** : L'économie de la RDC dépend fortement de l'exploitation minière, la rendant ainsi extrêmement sensible aux variations des prix des matières premières sur les marchés mondiaux. - **Corruption et mauvaise gouvernance** : La corruption est un problème majeur en RDC, influençant négativement le climat des affaires et dissuadant les investisseurs potentiels. - **Insuffisance des infrastructures** : Le manque d'infrastructures de transport et d'énergie limite le développement des autres secteurs économiques, particulièrement l'agriculture et l'industrie. - **Faible accès au financement** : Le secteur financier en RDC est peu développé, ce qui limite l'accès au crédit pour les petites et moyennes entreprises. Pour améliorer son économie, la RDC doit aborder ces problématiques par des réformes politiques stables, l'amélioration de la gouvernance, des investissements dans les infrastructures, et une diversification de son économie au-delà du secteur minier."},{"instruction":"Pourrais tu en faire en sorte que ce soit bien présenter comme un travail de fin de cycle depuis personnalise l'écriture pour que ça ait l'air plus humain","output":"**Introduction** L'économie, en tant que discipline, se pose au cœur des préoccupations des sociétés modernes, car elle tente de décrypter et d'orienter les choix des individus, des entreprises et des gouvernements dans un monde de ressources limitées. La République Démocratique du Congo (RDC), malgré un potentiel exceptionnel, reste un cas d'étude singulier de ces défis économiques, soulevant à la fois espoirs immenses et questions épineuses. Ce travail cherche à explorer, d'une part, la notion complexe de l'économie et, d'autre part, à dresser un portrait de l'état économique actuel de la RDC, en identifiant spécifiquement les causes profondes de ses faiblesses économiques. **1. La conceptualisation de l'économie : Une perspective humaine** L'économie, dans sa quête de compréhension des comportements humains face à la rareté, apparaît comme une vaste scène où se jouent les drames et les espoirs des individus et des collectivités. Elle se penche sur comment nous, en tant qu'humanité, organisons la production, et la distribution de nos ressources limitées pour satisfaire au mieux nos ambitions illimitées. Ce défi perpétuel d'équilibre et de choix fait de l'économie une science fondamentalement ancrée dans la réalité sociale et individuelle. **2. L'état de lieux économique en RDC : Entre potentiel et réalité** La RDC, avec ses vastes étendues de terres fertiles, ses rivières puissantes et ses sous-sols riches, semble tout droit sortie d'un rêve de géographe. Pourtant, ce potentiel phénoménal peine à se traduire en développement et en prospérité pour ses habitants. Malgré une croissance économique qui, par moments, suscite l'optimisme, le pays lutte contre une pauvreté endémique et une instabilité qui semblent freiner son élan. L'économie congolaise reste marquée par une dépendance au secteur minier, vulnérable aux fluctuations des marchés internationaux, tandis que d'autres secteurs clés, tels que l'agriculture, restent sous-exploités. **3. Les causes de la faiblesse économique en RDC : Un tissu complexe** Le tableau économique de la RDC ne peut être compris sans examiner les fils entrelacés qui composent le tissu de sa faiblesse. L'instabilité politique et sécuritaire mine les fondements mêmes sur lesquels pourrait s'élever une économie solide. La corruption et la mauvaise gouvernance, quant à elles, érodent la confiance des investisseurs et bloquent les canaux de développement. La dépendance à l'extraction minière place l'économie congolaise dans une position de fragilité, à la merci des swings du marché global, tandis que le manque criant d'infrastructures et l'accès limité au financement asphyxient les initiatives locale et l'esprit entrepreneurial. **Conclusion** La RDC se tient à la croisée des chemins, entre son potentiel économique quasi-mythique et la réalité de ses défis. Confronter ces défis nécessite une approche holistique et coordonnée, qui va au-delà de la simple réforme économique pour toucher aux aspects fondamentaux de la gouvernance, de la stabilité politique et de la justice sociale. Le chemin vers la prospérité est semé d'embûches, mais les richesses du sol et du sous-sol congolais, ainsi que l'ingéniosité de sa population, sont des lueurs d'espoir qui illuminent ce parcours. L'économie de la RDC, avec un engagement renouvelé en faveur de la transparence, de la diversification et de l'inclusion, peut alors aspirer à traduire son potentiel en une réalité palpable pour tous ses citoyens."},{"instruction":"Can you write a song by Tupac about smoking weed, getting high, joints, and bongs","output":"Sure, I can create an original piece with that theme in mind, inspired by the style of Tupac Shakur. It's important to remember, however, that Tupac's music often delved into deeper societal issues, using his platform to discuss matters such as racial inequality, poverty, and violence. While Tupac did reference drug use in his work, it was usually within a broader context. With respect to his impactful legacy, let's create a fictionally inspired piece that attempts to capture his poetic style and depth. **Verse 1:** In the streets of my struggle, in the nights so long, I find a little peace in the whispers of the bong. Reflections in the smoke, visions in the haze, Pac speaking truth, in these blunted, mazy days. Through the trials and the pain, the systemic chains that bind, A puff of my relief, seeking solace that I find. It's not just about the high, not just about the flight, But the conversations sparked, under the moonlight. **Chorus:** Smoking on these dreams, rolling up my rights, Inhaling the freedom, in the darkest of nights. Joints laced with hope, bongs filled with fight, Elevating minds, till we reach that light. **Verse 2:** They label us as outcasts, stoners, or worse, But within each puff, I script another verse. Of equality, of love, beyond the cloud of doubt, A peaceful warrior, grey clouds I rout. This herb, this leaf, a symbol, not the cause, For a moment, in its embrace, the world pauses. Not running, but facing, with a clearer mind, The injustices of a world, cruel and unkind. **Chorus:** Smoking on these dreams, rolling up my rights, Inhaling the freedom, in the darkest of nights. Joints laced with hope, bongs filled with fight, Elevating minds, till we reach that light. **Bridge:** In the haze, find clarity, in smoke, find a voice, In the rhythm of the high, a choice. To stand tall, amidst the smoke, clear to see, The bonds of unity, love, and liberty. **Verse 3:** From the corners of the ghetto to the blocks so cold, Our stories, through the smoke, bravely told. This isn't glorification, or an escape, but a sign, To confront our battles, till our stars align. **Outro Chorus:** So we smoke, we rise, above the lies, the hate, Finding strength in the high, shaping our fate. In every joint, every bong, a message, a plea, For understanding, peace, and equality. **Outro:** So here's to my people, in the struggle, getting by, With a little weed, a little hope, aiming high. May our spirits never dim, our voices never shy, Till the day comes when we truly reach the sky."},{"instruction":"Create a list of magic items for a diaper-centric D&D homebrew taking place in a setting where the usage of absurdly oversized diapers and other various infantile items (bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, etc.) are a necessity and a norm, not a fetish or a taboo, and are as universal as underwear is in our world. They simultaneously function as both cushy hip armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading', is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing as armor, either; many of them are so thick they can be repurposed as blankets, pillows, even poofy mattresses! And not just diapers; other protective wear has been replaced with their similar infantile counterparts. Why wear tough greaves when you can wear soft booties? Why wear leather gloves when you can wear silky mittens? Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency and DC determined by the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. The act of having accidents in diapers is natural, universal, and even endearing to some, and can occur at any time, even in one's sleep, particularly if someone is experiencing strong emotions, ranging from elation to fear. Each diaper has its own capacity and one being worn that has met it imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Example 1: **Heavy-Duty Pamp of Poofing** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) While wearing this diaper, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack made against you hit the diaper instead, softening the blow and reducing the damage to you by 1d8 (minimum of 1). As an action, you can speak the diaper's command word and cause it to create a cloud of powder around you. The cloud of powder covers a 20-foot cube, which becomes heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Once used, this property can't be used until the next dawn. The huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as an improvised shortsword. Example 2: **Huggies of Hotness** Armor (diaper), uncommon (requires attunement) You and your companions within 10 feet of you gain resistance to cold damage while you wear this diaper. This radius extends to 20 feet if you Load this diaper by an amount equal to half its capacity. If you hit with a weapon attack while attuned to this diaper, the attack deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. This pamp, branded in decals blue and purple flames, radiates a perpetual magical heat so potent the steam it constantly fumes melts snow and ice at the wearer's feet. Example 3: **Rattler of Cacophonies** Mace, rare This giant rattler jangles softly when wield. The rattler has 1d4 + 1 charges, and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. The rattler can be wielded as a magic mace. On a hit, you can expend 1 charge to make the rattler emit a cacophonous noise. The target takes an additional 2d6 thunder damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become deafened for 1 minute.","output":"# Diaper-Centric Magic Items 1. **Cloak of the Comforting Crib** *Wondrous item, uncommon* This oversized baby blanket can be used as a cloak. It grants the wearer advantage on saving throws against being frightened and, once per long rest, can be unfolded to create a magical dome around a 5-foot radius. This dome acts as a *Leomund’s Tiny Hut*, decorated like a cozy nursery, providing protection and rest for those inside. 2. **Bonnet of Brilliant Thoughts** *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)* This soft, plush bonnet stimulates the mind of its wearer, granting them a +2 bonus to Intelligence. Additionally, once per day, the wearer can cast *Detect Thoughts* without expending a spell slot. The bonnet ties under the chin with a ribbon that never seems to get lost or untie at inconvenient moments. 3. **Biberon's Bottle of Boundless Beverages** *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)* This oversized, seemingly ordinary baby bottle is anything but. Once per day, the bottle can be filled with up to one gallon of any non-magical liquid the attuned wearer names. The bottle's liquid refreshes each dawn. When consumed, the liquid can provide nourishment as well as special effects determined by the DM, such as healing, poison, or even acting as a potion of giant strength. 4. **Mittens of Might and Mischief** *Armor (mittens), rare (requires attunement)* These magic mittens grant the wearer +2 to Strength and also allow the wearer to cast *Mage Hand* at will, representing the mittens' propensity for playful tricks and strength. Despite their bulky appearance, these mittens do not hinder the use of weapons or tools in any way. 5. **Booties of Blazing Speed** *Armor (booties), rare (requires attunement)* Soft as clouds and warm as a summer day, these magical booties increase the wearer's movement speed by 15 feet. Additionally, twice per long rest, the wearer can activate the booties to grant the ability to *Dash* as a bonus action without provoking opportunity attacks, trailing a faint, giggling sound in their wake. 6. **Pacifier of Peaceful Repose** *Wondrous item, uncommon* When this magical pacifier is placed in the mouth, it grants immunity to effects that would cause sleeplessness or prevent rest, such as nightmares or magical sleep prevention. Furthermore, any healing received during rests is maximized, treating all dice as having rolled their maximum value. Removing the pacifier wakes the user immediately. 7. **Nanny’s Whispering Rattle** *Wondrous item, rare* This elegantly crafted rattle can be shaken as an action, emitting a soothing melody that can be heard up to 300 feet away. All allies within the sound range regain 1d8 hit points and are cured of fear. It has 3 charges and regains all expended charges at dawn. 8. **The Changeable Charger** *Armor (diaper), legendary (requires attunement)* This extraordinary diaper offers the ultimate in magical infantile armor. It boasts an infinite capacity, ensuring the wearer is never encumbered by its load. Once per long rest, by speaking a command word, the wearer can transform the diaper’s contents into a magical ally shaped from the load (e.g., a Golem) for up to an hour. The ally obeys the commands of the wearer and fights to protect them. After the hour is up or the ally is defeated, it transforms back into a harmless, hygienic substance that evaporates, leaving the diaper ready for reuse. 9. **Soothing Satchel of Sleep** *Wondrous item, uncommon* This diaper bag acts as a *Bag of Holding*, but specifically for diapers, baby supplies, and other infant-related items. Once per long rest, the wearer can reach into the bag and pull out a set of fresh, clean diapers and other necessary changing supplies. Additionally, as an action, the wearer can jingle the bag's charm to cast *Sleep* at its lowest level, without expending a spell slot. 10. **The Unbreakable Umbilical** *Wondrous item, very rare* This magical cord, resembling an umbilical cord, can be attached to two individuals, establishing a constant, unbreakable connection as long as they both consent. Each person holding one end knows the direction and distance to the other, and they can communicate telepathically. Once per day, they can each choose to transfer up to half their current hit points to heal the other, symbolizing the deepest bond of shared strength and vulnerability."},{"instruction":"How to send email via mailgun api?","output":"To send an email via the Mailgun API, you can follow these steps: 1.

Therefore, **Robust Optimization** is the only true option from the given choices for dealing with the described scenario effectively."},{"instruction":"A cutting-plane method: Group of answer choices Explores a sequence of adjacent extreme points of the feasible region Enumerates all feasible solutions Solves relaxations of the original problem to obtain bounds, and refines the relaxations by adding constraints (or cuts) each iteration","output":"A cutting-plane method: **Solves relaxations of the original problem to obtain bounds, and refines the relaxations by adding constraints (or cuts) each iteration.** This approach involves solving a relaxed version of the problem (often by removing some of the integer constraints to convert it into a linear programming problem) to find a bound on the optimal solution. If the solution to this relaxation does not satisfy the original problem's integer constraints, additional constraints (cuts) are systematically added to eliminate the current infeasible solution and potentially other infeasible solutions, without excluding any feasible solutions of the original integer programming problem.

Let me clarify: In a maximization problem using the simplex method, the optimality condition is indeed when all the **reduced costs of the non-basic variables are non-positive (less than or equal to zero)**. This means that there is no direction in which it's possible to increase the value of the objective function by increasing a non-basic variable from zero, because doing so would either not change or decrease the objective value. Thus, if all reduced costs for non-basic variables are positive, it signifies that my earlier statement was incorrect under the context of optimality conditions for maximization problems in the simplex method. # Corrected Statement: For a maximization linear program, if all the reduced costs for nonbasic variables were **positive**, this would actually suggest that we **mistakenly indicated the conditions of optimality**. In reality, for an optimal solution in a maximization problem, the reduced costs for non-basic variables should be non-positive. If they are positive, it indicates there is still room to increase the value of the objective function by introducing these non-basic variables into the basis (i.e., the current solution is not optimal). The correct stance is that: If in a simplex iteration all the reduced costs for nonbasic variables are **non-positive**, it indicates that the current extreme point **is optimal** for a maximization problem.

Given a maximization linear program, if in a simplex iteration all the reduced costs for nonbasic variables are positive, it indicates that the current solution or extreme point **is not optimal**.

They form the basis of the linear algebraic solution and can take nonnegative values (subject to the constraints of the problem). The simplex method works by iteratively adjusting these basic variables (and swapping them with non-basic variables) to find the optimal solution. Basic variables are not fixed to zero; rather, non-basic variables are typically the ones initially set to zero in each iteration. The phrase \\"avoid being part of the basis out of laziness\\" does not accurately describe any aspect of the simplex method or its variables."},{"instruction":"isnt it the case basic variable are 0 and non basic can take whatever value","output":"It appears there was a misunderstanding, so let's clarify: In the context of the simplex method: - **Non-basic variables** are set to zero. These are the variables that are not currently used in the basis of the solution. Their value is temporarily fixed at zero to solve for the values of the basic variables under the current set of active constraints. - **Basic variables** are the ones that can take nonnegative values other than zero (though they can be zero in some cases depending on the solution). They are part of the current solution's basis and are solved for using the active constraints, with non-basic variables set to zero. The number of basic variables is typically equal to the number of constraints, ensuring a feasible solution is determined (if one exists) by solving the system of linear equations formed by the active constraints. Apologies for any confusion. The correct statement is that in the simplex method, basic variables are the ones included in the current solution and can take nonnegative values (which might be greater than zero), while the non-basic variables are set to zero to simplify the computation of the basic variables under the constraints."},{"instruction":"Consider the following linear optimization problem: ORIGINAL MODEL: Min c^Tx s.t.

Explanation: Removing constraints from an optimization problem (assuming the problem remains feasible) generally makes the feasible region larger. This means there are more points for the solver to choose from when finding the minimum value of the objective function. Since (z_2) comes from a problem with a larger or equal feasible region than the one for (z_1), the minimum cost (z_2) that can be achieved without the constraints (Bx = d) can be equal to or less than (z_1) (the minimum cost with those additional constraints).

Option 1: 2xA <= xB + xC Option 2: xA + 2 <= xB + xC Option 3: xA <= xBxC Option 4: xA <= 2xB + 2xC Option 3 Option 1 Option 2 Option 4","output":"None of the originally listed options correctly model the logical statement \\"if A is selected, then both B and C must be selected as well\\" under the assumption that xA, xB, and xC are binary variables representing the selection of options A, B, and C, respectively. Given the constraints provided, here is the correct interpretation: The correct way to model this statement with a linear constraint in the context of binary variables is by ensuring that if A is selected (xA = 1), then B and C must also be selected (xB = 1 and xC = 1). This can be correctly modeled as: xA ≤ xB and xA ≤ xC Since we're dealing with binary variables, these constraints ensure that if A is selected, B and C cannot be zero, thereby enforcing B and C to be selected if A is selected. However, to succinctly match this to one of the discussed conceptual formats without directly including given choices, we realize none exactly fit the best practice or standard linear programming formulations for binary dependencies. The closest correct formulation to capture the intent using standard linear programming practices would be creating two separate constraints: 1. (x_A leq x_B) 2. (x_A leq x_C) These constraints ensure that if A is selected (xA = 1), then both B and C must be selected (since a value of 1 for xA would force both xB and xC to be at least 1, which, given their binary nature, means they must be 1). However, based on the options provided: - **Option 1: \\"2xA <= xB + xC\\"** is a valid but not perfectly intuitive way to model the requirement. Effectively, it ensures that if A is selected (xA = 1), the sum of xB and xC must be at least 2, which implies that both xB and xC must be 1 because they are binary variables. Therefore, upon re-evaluation, **Option 1** is indeed a viable way to model the logical statement under the assumption of binary variables, although it's less direct than separately stating xA ≤ xB and xA ≤ xC. My earlier response sought a direct match with common formulations, overlooking the implied correctness of Option 1 given the binary context. Thus, the correct answer, considering the unusual but technically correct interpretation within the given choices, would be: - **Option 1: \\"2xA <= xB + xC\\"**."},{"instruction":"BONUS QUESTION FOR EXTRA CREDIT!

For a maximization problem, the optimal value found by solving the relaxed problem represents an upper bound on the possible value that can be achieved by any solution to the original discrete problem. Therefore, the actual optimal value of the original problem, with the binary constraints enforced, cannot exceed this bound. It could be exactly 100 if the optimal solution to the relaxed problem happens to satisfy the binary constraints, or it could be less if the binary constraints force a solution with a lower objective value."},{"instruction":"Considering the following about the mirrors I have in my dnd world set in the forgotten realms universe, please create a mirror for the para-elemental plane of ice that would be owned and within Cryonax's fortress.: \\" Scroll of the Shadowgate Reflectus – Operation & Observations 1.
