The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.

It's call a \\"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation). Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim.

Wives and girlfriends sit together at a Sox game to watch Wacky Waters pitch. He's a fun-loving guy who is delighted to learn that Hollywood star Pepita Zorita is at today's game, selling kisses for charity. Wacky promptly borrows money from team publicity man Updyke to buy 300 worth. In the grandstand, catcher Hippo Jones's wife Hazel and the other women are concerned. Wacky is the best pitcher in baseball when he concentrates on what he's doing, but whenever a pretty girl turns his head, a distracted Wacky suddenly can't throw the ball over the plate. The wives want the Sox to be in the World Series so their husbands will receive bonus money. Sure enough, Wacky's infatuation with Pepita begins a run of bad luck for him and the Sox at the ballpark. On the train, the wives protest until Wacky discloses that he and Pepita secretly ran off to get married. While they are happy for the couple, Hazel schemes to have a Hollywood producer require Pepita's presence to shoot a movie there. This could keep Wacky focused on baseball until the World Series. Pepita finishes the film faster than expected. She hurries to Kansas City to see Wacky and the Sox, so the wives take matters into their own hands, tying up Pepita in a hotel room against her will. Wacky eventually wins the World Series for the Sox, but this time, it's only because the woman he loves is there.

Movie title: The Karate Kid Movie plot: 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his mother, Sherry (Taraji P. Henson), arrive in Beijing from West Detroit to start a new life. Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Mei Ying (Wen Wen Han), who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng (Zhenwei Wang), a kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Mei Ying's, attempts to keep them apart by beating Dre, and later harassing and humiliating him in and around school. During a particularly brutal beating by Cheng and his friends, the enigmatic maintenance man of Dre's building, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as a kung fu master who adeptly dispatches Dre's tormentors.After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, they go to Cheng's teacher, Master Li (Yu Rongguang), to attempt to make peace, but the brutal Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. When Han declines, Li threatens him, saying that they will not be allowed to leave his school unless either Dre or Han himself fights. Han acquiesces, but insists the fight take place at an upcoming tournament, and that Li's students leave Dre alone until the tournament. The amused Li agrees.Han begins training Dre, but Dre is frustrated that Han merely has Dre spend hours taking off his jacket, hanging it up, dropping it, and then putting it back on again. After days of this, Dre refuses to continue, until Han demonstrates to him that the repetitive arm movements in question were Han's method of teaching Dre defensive block and strike techniques, which Dre is now able to display instinctively when prompted by Han's mock attacks. Han emphasizes that the movements Dre is learning apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial arts.

How is \\"Name initials on a handkerchief!\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Name initials on a handkerchief!\\" can be translated as \\"Iniciály jména na kapesníku!\\" Let me break it down for you: 1. \\"Iniciály\\" (Initials): This word refers to the first letter(s) of a name, typically a person's first and last name. In Czech, the term is very similar to its English counterpart. 2. \\"jména\\" (Name): In Czech, \\"jméno\\" refers to a person's name, whether it is the first name, middle name, or last name. In this case, we’re referring to the name whose initials will be on the handkerchief, so the term is put in the genitive form, which becomes \\"jména.\\" 3. \\"na\\" (on): This preposition is used to indicate the presence of something onto another thing, like an object on a table, or as in this case, initials on a handkerchief. In both English and Czech, the preposition \\"on\\" and \\"na\\" serve the same function. 4. \\"kapesníku\\" (handkerchief): The word \\"kapesník\\" refers to a handkerchief or a pocket square, which is a small, typically decorative piece of fabric that people carry with them for personal use or aesthetic purposes. The term \\"kapesník\\" comes from the word \\"kapesní,\\" which means \\"pocket-sized,\\" and the ending \\"ku\\" indicates that this noun is in the locative case, which works with the preposition \\"na.\\" So, to sum it up, the translation for \\"Name initials on a handkerchief!\\" in Czech is \\"Iniciály jména na kapesníku!\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context:  With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

If Out with it. , can we conclude that \\"It is important.\\"?","output":"To address whether the phrase \\"Out with it\\" can lead to the conclusion that \\"It is important,\\" we must first explore the meaning and usage of the expression \\"Out with it\\" as well as the different contexts in which it may be employed. \\"Out with it\\" is a colloquial expression typically used to encourage, urge, or demand someone to reveal a piece of information they have been holding back or hesitating to share. This phrase is often used in informal conversations and implies a sense of impatience or eagerness on the part of the speaker to know or understand the withheld information. To determine if this expression implies that \\"It is important,\\" we must consider a variety of factors, including the context in which the phrase is used, the tone of the speaker, and their relationship to the person they are addressing. 1. Context: The phrase \\"Out with it\\" can be used in multiple contexts, and its interpretation may vary accordingly. For instance, the speaker could be referring to a secret, a piece of news, or a decision they believe the listener possesses. Depending on the situation, the importance of the information may vary, and thus it might be incorrect to always assume that \\"It is important.\\" 2. Tone: Tone plays a vital role in understanding the speaker's intentions. If the speaker uses the expression with a sense of urgency and seriousness, it may imply that the information is important. However, if the tone is casual or lighthearted, the statement may not necessarily indicate that the information is of great importance. 3. Relationship: The relationship between the speaker and the person they are addressing can also influence the perception of the information's importance. If the speaker is a close friend or family member, they may be more likely to express curiosity and eagerness to learn the information, even if it isn't incredibly important. In contrast, if the speaker is a boss, teacher, or another authority figure, using the phrase \\"Out with it\\" may suggest that they believe the information is significant and relevant to their interests. In conclusion, while the expression \\"Out with it\\" may sometimes imply that the information being sought is important, it may not always be the case. It is crucial to consider the context, tone, and relationship between the speakers to accurately interpret the significance of the information being shared. One should be cautious not to generalize the expression's meaning and instead evaluate each situation on its individual merits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Archaeologists have been working on the site in Dorstone for a month      Ancient \\"halls of the dead\\" more than 1,000 years older than Stonehenge have been found under elongated burial mounds in Herefordshire.      The two earth 'long barrows' were uncovered on top of Dorstone Hill near Peterchurch and are thought to date to about 3,800BC.      The archaeologists believe the barrows were created by the setting ablaze wooden long houses, the ashes of which were then covered in earth.      They believe the initial torching of the sites would have been done for symbolic reasons. From the finds, they have worked out that people continued to worship at the there for hundreds of years afterwards.      The longhouses were about 30m wide by 70m long      Professor Julian Thomas of Manchester University said the site is the only one of its type in the UK where \\"the halls of the living became the halls of the dead\\".      \\"With this phenomenon of deliberately burning down buildings, tending the fire over a period of days, the argument is that you burn these down when the head of the family dies,\\" he said.      \\"Here, no new house has been built, but instead they have shovelled up the remains into these barrows and enclosed them with turf.\\"      One of the prehistoric stone tools found in the excavated barrow      Archaeologists have spent a month excavating the mounds during which time they have uncovered fine examples of flint weapons and tools.      The items were either buried in the barrows when they were first created or later left as offerings to the dead, suggesting the site became one used for ritualistic ceremonies.      Prof Thomas said the monuments are the first their kind to be found in the UK and are of international significance.      Dorstone is in Herefordshire, close to the modern Welsh border      Not much is known about the Ancient Britons of the time, except that by 4,000BC, they had only recently started to settle in established communities. Before that, many had been largely nomadic.      It is believed that Neolithic long houses - long, steep-roofed buildings used to house people and animals under one roof - were introduced as farming began in Europe around 5,000BC.      The long houses found under the barrows at Dorstone are some of the earliest known examples in the country.      Construction of the stone structure at Stonehenge, by comparison, is thought to have started in 2,600BC.      Professor Julian Thomas      The archaeologists have managed to work out, by an analysis of post holes at the original ground level, that the long houses that would have stood on the site would have been around 30m wide by 70m long - the same size as the barrows that covered them.      Although made originally of earth, at a later date the barrows were covered in stones to form cairns like those found in the Black Mountains of Wales.      The smaller of the barrows has the remains of holes which are thought to have contained oak posts that supported a trough lined with planks upon which human remains would be placed.      Among the objects found at the site were some that had come from as far away as East Yorkshire.      The researchers said they were likely to have been brought by families treating the spot as an ancestral pilgrimage site. ||||| Unearthed, the ancient 'halls of the dead' that are 1,000 years OLDER than Stonehenge            Manchester archaeologists have found communal halls that were first 'ritually' burned and then covered over with soil to form large barrows      The buildings were burned down when the head of the family died      The structures were discovered on top of Dorstone Hill in Herefordshire and are thought to date to about 3,800BC      Archeologists have found two stone axe-heads, a flint hand knife and an arrowhead and have described the discovery as a 'very important find'      Ancient 'halls of the dead' pre-dating Stonehenge are being heralded by archaeologists as the first monuments of their kind to be found in the UK.      The two earth long barrows were uncovered on top of Dorstone Hill in Herefordshire and are thought to date to about 3,800BC, almost 1,000 years before the famous stone circle in Wiltshire was built, according to Professor Julian Thomas, of the University of Manchester.      Archaeologists who have spent a month excavating the mounds say they have removed fine examples of flint weapons and tools, thought to have been buried in the barrows when first created or later left as offerings to the dead.      A flaked flint knife (pictured) was found in a cremation pit dug into the side of one of the two long barrows as the remains of two large 6000-year-old halls, each buried within a prehistoric burial mound, have been discovered in Herefordshire      Professor Thomas said the site was the only one of its type in the UK where 'the halls of the living became the halls of the dead', with the long communal halls first 'ritually' burned and then covered over with soil and turf to form the large barrows.      He said: 'With this phenomenon of deliberately burning down buildings, tending the fire over a period of days, the argument is that you burn these down when the head of the family dies.      'Here, no new house has been built, but instead they have shovelled up the remains into these barrows and enclosed them with turf.      He added: 'It's a very important site.'      Among the finds are two stone axe-heads, a flint hand knife and an arrowhead, with some of the raw materials used in their construction pointing to origins hundreds of miles away from where they were found, according to the dig team.      An artist's impression of the Neolithic long hall. Two earth long barrows were uncovered that archeologists believe date to about 3,800BC, almost 1,000 years before Stonehenge was built      The barrows themselves date to the early Neolithic period when the ancient Britons were starting to settle into small communities.      In one possible clue to the violence of the period, a broken flint arrowhead was discovered in a stone burial chamber uncovered off the side of one of the barrows - although the human remains of the arrow's possible victim which would have lain within the cairn have long since disappeared due to the acidity of the soil, Professor Thomas said.      Archaeologists have also been excited by the level of preservation in the timber construction of the original hall buildings, with the intense heat of the fire carbonising the wood's form even, including the joints and post holes.      The barrows measure 30 metres and 70 metres in length, with a single main burial chamber at each end.      Although made originally of earth, at a later date they were covered in stone like cairns found in the Black Mountains of Wales, Professor Thomas said.      Investigation trenches dug at the site on top of Dorstone Hill in Herefordshire. Professor Thomas said the site was the only one of its type in the UK where 'the halls of the living became the halls of the dead,' with the long communal halls first 'ritually' burned and then covered over with soil and turf to form the large barrows      The smaller of the barrows has the remains of holes, thought to have contained two metre-wide upright oak posts between which was supported a trough lined with planks upon which the human remains would be placed.      The dig has been carried out by a team from the Manchester university, the University of Kyushu and Herefordshire Council, who will return to the site to continue work next year.      Dr Keith Ray, Herefordshire county archaeologist and dig co-director, said: 'In the British context, the Dorstone find is unique and unprecedented.'      Professor Thomas said they had uncovered a picture of a 'monument that keeps changing' with the needs of the people living around it at the time.      He added: 'This is a special place with significance as new bodies and new offerings are deposited here.      'Hundreds of years after the first burial, there are very fine flint objects being left here.      Professor Julian Thomas professor of archaeology at the University of Manchester (pictured) described the site as 'a very important find'. Archaeologists have also been excited by the level of preservation in the timber construction of the original hall buildings      'It's a very important site, firstly because for the first time we have the fabric of an early Neolithic hall being incorporated into the building of a funerary monument.      'Also, because of the preservation of the remains of the structure including evidence of carpentry, we are going to be able to say rather more about the character of these early Neolithic buildings.'      Dr Ray said the fact more burial chambers and artefacts had been left at the site hundreds of years after it was first created showed its national importance.      'These subsequent finds show that 1,000 years after the hall burial mounds were made, the site is still important to later generations living 200 miles away - a vast distance in Neolithic terms,' he said.      'For example, the axe and knife may not have been traded, but placed there as part of a ceremony or an ancestral pilgrimage from what is now East Yorkshire. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Archaeologists have discovered \\"halls of the dead\\" in Herefordshire, England, that are over 1,000 years older than Stonehenge. Two earth long barrows were found on top of Dorstone Hill near Peterchurch, dating back to around 3,800 BC. The archaeologists believe these barrows were created by setting wooden longhouses ablaze, and then covering the ashes with earth for symbolic reasons. Rituals and worshipping continued for hundreds of years after the barrows were made. Flint weapons and tools were found at the site, buried initially in the barrows or left later as offerings to the dead. This significant discovery sheds new light on the lives of the Ancient Britons during the early Neolithic period when they began to form small communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Memoirs of a Geisha is a 2005 American epic drama film based on the novel Memoirs of a Geisha, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and Spyglass Entertainment and by Douglas Wick's Red Wagon Productions. Directed by Rob Marshall, the film was released in the United States on December 9, 2005 by Columbia Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures; the latter was given studio credit only. It stars Zhang Ziyi, Ken Watanabe, Gong Li, Michelle Yeoh, Youki Kudoh, Suzuka Ohgo, and Samantha Futerman. Production took place in southern and northern California and in several locations in Kyoto, including the Kiyomizu temple and the Fushimi Inari shrine. Context: The film received some hostile responses in Mainland China, including its banning by the People's Republic of China. Relations between Japan and Mainland China were particularly tense due to two main factors: Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made a number of visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which honors all Japan's war dead, including some who were convicted war criminals, which was denounced by China's foreign ministry as honoring them; and China helped to ensure Japan did not receive a seat on the UN Security Council. Writer Hong Ying argued that \\"Art should be above national politics\\". Nevertheless, the release of Memoirs of a Geisha into this politically charged situation added to cultural conflict within and between China and Japan.  The film was originally scheduled to be shown in cinemas in the People's Republic of China on February 9, 2006. The Chinese State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television decided to ban the film on February 1, 2006, considering the film as \\"too sensitive\\". In doing so, it overturned a November decision to approve the film for screening.  The film is set in Japan during World War II, when the Second Sino-Japanese War was taking place. During this time, Japan captured and forced Chinese women to serve as \\"comfort women\\" for their military personnel. Controversy arose in China from an apparent confusion of equating geisha with prostitution, and thus the connection with, and reminder of, comfort women being used in Japan at that time.  Newspaper sources, such as the Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post and the Shanghai Youth Daily, quoted the fears that the film might be banned by censors; there were concerns that the casting of Chinese actresses as geishas could rouse anti-Japan sentiment and stir up feelings over Japanese wartime actions in China, especially the use of Chinese women as forced sex workers. Question: What kind of responses came from the Chinese? Answer:","output":"The Chinese had some hostile responses to the movie Memoirs of a Geisha. They were upset because it reminded them of a time when Japan treated China badly during a big fight called World War II. Some Chinese people thought the movie mixed up the idea of geisha with something called prostitution, which involved Chinese women being forced to do things they didn't want to do. The movie was even banned in China because the government thought it was \\"too sensitive.\\" Some newspapers in China were worried that this movie could make people feel angry about Japan's actions in the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michele Bachmann: Undeterred and undiminished With less than a year left in her fourth and final term in Congress, it's a little early for an exit interview, but not too early to get the views of Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) on issues dear to a \\"founding mother\\" of the Tea Party movement and on how to beat Hillary Clinton in 2016, if the Democrat decides to run. Bachmann remains confident and resolute despite many political setbacks. We met in her office while much of Congress was fleeing the Capitol Building ahead of a major storm that eventually dumped a foot of snow on Washington. The snow was a big deal to residents of the nation's capital, but little more than flurries to a Minnesotan like Bachmann. Bachmann is made of sterner stuff and has time and time again stood up for her social and economic principles, refusing to compromise on them despite sometimes strong opposition from within her own party's leadership. She retains her Christian and conservative worldview, calling it a \\"grid\\" through which she sees everything. I note that a majority of her colleagues and much of the rest of the country seem to have a different \\"grid\\" and cite as examples the growth and cost of government and the failure of conservatives to slow what they regard as the cultural slide. \\"That's the reality we work in, but so what?\\" she says. \\"That doesn't deviate from my responsibility ... but you continue to have to go forward, even if you don't see the results.\\" Why does she think little has stopped the cultural slide, even when Republicans control all three branches of government, as they did for a time during the George W. Bush administration? \\"It's because of their worldview,\\" she responds, implying it isn't enough to be a Republican, or even conservative. For a truly conservative agenda to advance, she believes, voters will have to send to Washington more people with a biblical worldview. That is a difficult task, given the growing secularization of the country, especially; it appears, among the young. She acknowledges \\"politics is downstream from culture. It merely reflects what is going on (in society).\\" If Republicans nominate a male presidential candidate in 2016, how should he run against Hillary Clinton, if she is the Democratic nominee? Bachmann was the only female GOP candidate in the race when she ran for president in 2012. She says, \\"Two things that need to be done: Remind people (Clinton) is seeking to become commander in chief (and look at) how she has operated in the past with these types of responsibilities. She was in charge during the Benghazi debacle. If a person reads the Senate Intelligence (Committee) report and the House Foreign Affairs (Committee) report released (last) week, it is damning for Hillary Clinton.\\" Bachmann says Clinton testified before Congress that she was \\"aware\\" of the deteriorating conditions in Benghazi but did nothing. \\"She has a real problem when it comes to Benghazi,\\" says Bachmann. Clinton, she adds, must answer for what happened. In addition, she says, Clinton is \\"the godmother of Obamacare,\\" trying \\"behind closed doors\\" to push through something similar when Bill Clinton was president. Maybe such an approach will work, but would the lure of the \\"first female president\\" overcome these concerns in voters' minds? Bachmann says: \\"Effectively she would be Obama's third and fourth term in office.\\" That might scare enough people to vote for the Republican nominee. Bachmann says a lot of people \\"aren't ready\\" for a female president. \\"I think there was a cachet about having an African-American president because of guilt.\\" (Presumably she means because of slavery and the lengthy denial of civil rights to blacks.) \\"People don't hold guilt for a woman,\\" she says, adding that while people vote for women for virtually every other office \\"I don't think there is a pent-up desire\\" for a woman president. She says while Obama was \\"new and different,\\" Hillary Clinton has been around a long time and is less likely to stir the juices as Obama did. It may be time to test that theory.

What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text discusses Rep. Michele Bachmann's views on her time in Congress, the \\"cultural slide\\" in the United States, and the possibility of Hillary Clinton running for president in 2016. Bachmann remains confident despite political setbacks and maintains her Christian and conservative worldview. As a \\"founding mother\\" of the Tea Party movement, Bachmann sees the growth and cost of government as well as the cultural slide as examples of a different \\"grid\\" through which others see the world. Bachmann believes that for a truly conservative agenda to advance, more people with a biblical worldview must be sent to Washington. She acknowledges that politics reflects culture and that it's challenging given the growing secularization of the country, particularly among the young. When asked about how a Republican male candidate should run against Clinton in 2016 if she becomes the Democratic nominee, Bachmann stresses the importance of reminding people that Clinton seeks to become commander-in-chief and highlights her past performance, such as her role in the Benghazi debacle. Bachmann also believes that many people are not ready for a female president, and that there is no \\"pent-up desire\\" for one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The employees at the lab weren't planning on analyzing any frogs, but when they found the one outside their front door they changed their mind.  and a hint : They feed on living hosts. As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic.

Please answer this question : Which frog will have more tissue broken down? Answer:","output":"Given the information and the hint, Frog X which was found in a pond in the forest and has a parasite, would likely have more tissue broken down. This is because it is stated that parasitic fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. These fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may cause illness in the host.

The regression of several young players was thought to be the main focus point, as the front office said Dale would not be judged based on wins and losses. In two seasons as skipper, Sveum finished with a record of 127-197.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) MI6 agent James Bond meets a Swiss banker in Bilbao, Spain to retrieve money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of M. Bond tells the banker that King was buying a report stolen from an MI6 agent who was killed for it, and wants to know who killed him. The banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal the assassin's name. Bond escapes with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped, and Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters back in London. Bond gives chase to the assistant/assassin on a boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome, where she attempts to escape via hot air balloon. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses, then causes the balloon to explode, killing herself. Bond traces the recovered money to Viktor \\"Renard\\" Zokas, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter, Elektra; Renard previously abducted and held her for ransom, and MI6 believes that he is targeting her a second time. Bond flies to Azerbaijan, where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at a casino to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator... My question: Where does Bond fly on mission?

People have been said to climb on roofs, solve mathematical problems, write music, walk through windows, and do murder in their sleep. In Revere, Massachusetts, a hundred policemen searched for a lost boy who left his home in his sleep and woke up five hours later on a strange sofa in a strange living room, with no idea how he had got there. At the University of Lowa, a student was reported to have the habit of getting up in the middle of the night and walking three-quarters of a mile to the Lowa River. He would take a swim and then go back to his room to bed. An American expert on sleep claims  that he has never seen a sleepwalker. He is said to know more about sleep than any other living man, and during the last thirty-five years he has lost a lot of sleep watching people sleep. He says, \\"Of course, I know that there are sleepwalkers because I have read about them in the newspapers. But none of my sleepers ever walked, and if I were to advertise for sleepwalkers for an experiment, I doubt whether I would get many takers .\\" Sleepwalking, however, is a scientific reality. It is one of those strange things that sometimes look quite fantastic . Doctors say that sleepwalking is much more common than is generally supposed. Many sleepwalkers do not try to find help and their sleepwalking is never recorded.   Question: Generally speaking, sleepwalkers are people who   _  .

Summarize this article: This is an image of a weight scale. Credit: CDC/Debora Cartagena As swimsuit season wanes and the holiday season edges closer, Americans everywhere should take a moment to enjoy the current state of their waistline. For the average person, the time just before the start of the holiday season is the low point in an annual weight gain pattern that peaks during the holidays and takes nearly half a year to fully shed.      New research findings published Sept. 27 in the New England Journal of Medicine by Cornell Food and Brand Lab Director Brian Wansink and colleagues from Tampere University of Technology of Finland analyze the wireless weigh-ins of nearly 3,000 individuals in three countries.      In the U.S., weight patterns begin rising at Thanksgiving and peak around Christmas and New Year's.      \\"We found that in the U.S., it isn't until after Easter, about a five-month period, that weight patterns even out,\\" said Wansink, \\"Chances are, right now most Americans are at their lowest weight of the year.\\"      The trend among the 1,781 American participants indicated a weight bump of 0.2 percent during Thanksgiving, and another 0.4 percent at Christmas. It takes about five months to lose those holiday pounds, with weights typically stabilizing from May to November before the cycle begins anew.      The study used scales that sent data over a Wi-Fi connection rather than requiring participants to self-report or visit a testing site for weigh-ins.      The researchers also analyzed yearly weight patterns of 760 German and 383 Japanese participants. Similar to their American counterparts, those in Germany weigh the most around Christmas, while those in Japan weigh the most during Golden Week, four major holidays in the spring. Each country also showed a peak in weight gain at New Year's.      \\"Everyone gains weight over the holidays – Americans, Germans, Japanese,\\" said Wansink.      But, he said, an annual holiday ritual repeated at the start of the season could go a long way.      \\"Instead of making a New Year's resolution, make an October resolution,\\" Wansink said. \\"It's easier to avoid holiday pounds than to lose them after they happen.\\"      Explore further: Around the world, holidays bring added pounds      More information: Elina E. Helander et al. Weight Gain over the Holidays in Three Countries, New England Journal of Medicine (2016). DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1602012       ||||| Thanks Jennifer. We are looking forward to working with you. We will be in touch      Your account has been created ||||| This image shows how people's average weights in three countries — Japan, the United States and Germany — changed over a one-year period.      Holiday weight gain isn't unique to the United States: A new analysis finds that people in Germany and Japan also pack on pounds during festive seasons.      But unlike Americans, who gain a lot of weight during Thanksgiving, people in other countries put on pounds at other \\"celebratory\\" times of the year, according to the study.      In the study, which was published today (Sept. 21) in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers gave wireless digital scales to nearly 3,000 participants in Germany, Japan and the United States. [11 Surprising Things That Can Make Us Gain Weight]      Over 12 months starting on Aug. 1, 2012, the people in the study weighed themselves each day. At the end of the study period, the researchers used the scale data to calculate how each participant's weight changed over the course of the year, compared to their starting weights.      People in all three countries gained weight, on average, around Christmas, according to the study. Specifically, people's weight went up in the 10 days after Christmas compared to the 10 days before Christmas, the researchers found.      People's average weights also increased around national holidays in their countries. In Japan, for example, there was an increase in weight during a holiday period called Golden Week, which takes place around the beginning of May.      In addition, Germans saw a sharp uptick in weight around Easter, and Americans around Thanksgiving, the researchers found.      But the largest gains were over the Christmas-New Year holiday season, according to the study. During this time, the Germans in the study gained an average of 1.8 lbs. (0.8 kilograms); the Americans gained an average of 1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg); and the Japanese gained an average of 1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg).      The investigators, led by Elina Helander, a personal health informatics researcher at Tampere University of Technology in Finland, noted that shortly after the holidays, people shed about half of their holiday weight gain; however, the other half appears to remain until the summer or beyond.      To help people avoid gaining weight during this time of year, one approach is to advise patients to have better self-control over the holidays, the researchers wrote. \\"The less one gains, the less one then has to worry about trying to lose it,\\" they wrote.      Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Data obtained from 2924 persons by means of wireless scales show significant increases in weight over the Christmas holidays. Weights also increased in Japan during Golden Week, in Germany over Easter, and in the United States over Thanksgiving. |||||","output":"Research carried out by the Cornell Food and Brand Lab Director, Brian Wansink, has found that on average, the period just before the start of the holiday season is when people are at their lowest weight, which then peaks over the holidays and can take up to half a year to fully shed. The study involved wireless weigh-ins of nearly 3,000 individuals across the US, Germany and Japan, and found that people in all three countries tend to gain most weight during the Christmas and New Year period. Wansink suggests creating an October resolution to focus on maintaining weight and avoiding the holiday gain, instead of making a New Year's resolution to shed the extra pounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water.  But I can use this background: As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson.  What is an answer for this question: In which case the solute would be more soluble, case A or case B? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, the solubility of solid and liquid solutes generally increases as the temperature increases. This statement is true for solvents other than water as well. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the extent of the effect of temperature on solubility varies depending on the substance. Some substances, like KNO3, have a strong temperature dependence with a steep solubility curve. In contrast, others like NaCl have a minimal influence of temperature with a nearly flat solubility curve. Considering the situations provided: In Test A, Keith used a liquid solute in a solvent at room temperature. In Test B, he increased the temperature while using the same liquid solute and solvent. Since the solubility of liquid solutes generally increases with temperature, we can conclude that the solute would be more soluble in Test B. This is because the higher temperature in Test B would typically result in a better dissolution of the solute compared to Test A, where the temperature is at room level. However, it is important to note that the specific solute and solvent being used could affect the influence of temperature on solubility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After forcing the Colts to a quick three-and-out, the Patriots scored on their opening drive of the game, covering 89 yards, in 11 plays scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run by rookie Jonas Gray. The Colts responded, aided by a 46-yard completion from Luck to T. Y. Hilton, driving to the Patriots 13, but had to settle for an Adam Vinatieri 31-yard field goal to bring the score to 7-3. The Patriots then drove to their own 49, but safety Mike Adams intercepted a pass intended for Tyms at the Colts 6 for no gain. On their next possession, the Colts reached the Patriots 32, but McCourty intercepted Luck and returned it 10 yards back to the Patriots 32. From there the Patriots struck on an 11-play, 68-yard drive, scoring on Gray's 2-yard touchdown run, extending the lead to 14-3. The Patriots forced a three-and-out, but on the third play of the Patriots next drive, Brady was intercepted by Adams again, who returned it 10 yards to the Patriots 23. With the fabulous field position, it took the Colts just three plays for Luck to find Hakeem Nicks on a 10-yard touchdown pass, making the score 14-10 with less than a minute remaining in the first half. After taking the kickoff, the Patriots restarted with an 8 play, 80-yard drive scoring on a  2-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, extending the lead to 21-10. The Colts drove to the Patriots 40 on their next drive, and Vinatieri was good from 53 yards away to trim the deficit to 21-13. The Patriots struck with another touchdown, with Brady passing for 56 yards on a 10-play, 80-yard drive before Gray scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and increasing the Patriots lead to 28-13. The Colts pulled back into the game on their next drive, with Luck completing 5 passes on the next drive for 77 yards, capping it off with his 1-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Castonzo, pulling the game back to 28-20. Despite the effort from Luck and the offense, the Colt defense had no answer for the Patriots, with them driving 80 more yards in 10 more plays, scoring on Gray's 1-yard touchdown run, his fourth, increasing the lead to 35-20 with just 8:43 remaining. The Colts actually stuffed Gray for a two-yard loss at the Colts 31 which would've made it 4th-and-4, but a 15-yard face mask penalty on Jerrell Freeman moved the ball to the 14 and Gray scored 4 plays later. Four straight incompletions gave the Patriots the ball at the Colts 32. After two three-yard runs by Gray, Tom Brady threw a short pass to Gronkowski who broke it off for a 26-yard touchdown, effectively ending the game and clinching the Patriots' sixth straight win. The game also saw several skirmishes between Gronkowski and Sergio Brown, with Gronkowski throwing Brown into an NBC camera after the play on Gray's 4th touchdown. Gronkowski referred to this incident as throwing Sergio Brown \\"out of the club\\" for talking trash all game, including posting Gronk's stats on Twitter during the game. Jonas Gray broke out, running all over the Colts for 201 yards and 4 touchdowns on 37 carries. Tom Brady threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns, but threw two interceptions. The Patriots scored on every drive of the second half with exception of their final drive of the game which was used to run out the clock. Luck threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns, but the running game was a non-factor, totaling just 19 yards on 16 carries, with Trent Richardson running 6 times for 0 yards. Tom Brady improved to 3-0 against Andrew Luck.

Misoprostol pills come in different concentrations so it is important to read the dosage information on the package or bottle before taking them. Depending on the strength of the dosage, you might have to take 2 pills at a time or cut pills in half for each dosage. Take note of the concentration and the number of pills you have to take during the day. The usual dose for adults is 200 mg 4 times a day, unless your doctor recommends a lower dosage. Take the pills at mealtimes to maintain a regular schedule. Take the last pill of the day right before you go to bed. Misoprostol should only be taken by adults, as the safety and effectiveness of the drug on children has not yet been established. Diarrhea is a common side effect of Misoprostol, but the chances of it happening are significantly reduced if you take the drug with food or milk. Time your doses so that they line up with breakfast, lunch, and supper. Have a small snack or a glass of milk with your last pill of the day. If there is more than an hour to go before your next dose, take a missed dose as soon as you remember. If you don't remember until it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed one and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double your next dose to make up for a missed one. Given the danger this medication could pose to a fetus, if you are of childbearing age, your doctor will likely instruct you to wait until the 2nd or 3rd day of your period to start the drug. They may also ask you to take a pregnancy test before they write you a prescription. If you are a woman, don't take this medication unless you meet the following conditions: You tested negative for pregnancy in the 2 weeks prior to using it. You are using an effective birth control to prevent pregnancy. You've received a notice of the risks of using Misoprostol if you're of childbearing age, as well as possible birth defects. You start taking Misoprostol only on the 2nd or 3rd day of your next period.

Option 1: 1. Put baking soda and vinegar in a cup of hot water. 2. Run the microwave for twenty minutes. 3. Wipe down the microwave with paper towels soaked in cooking spray. Option 2: 1. Pour lemon juice in a cup of water. 2. Run the microwave for several minutes. 3. Let the mixture cool. 4. Wipe down the inside of the microwave. Now, let's justify the steps for each option: Option 1: 1. Baking soda and vinegar create a chemical reaction that helps break down food particles and stains. 2. Running the microwave for twenty minutes might be longer than necessary but will ensure the steam generated by the hot liquid loosens the dirt. 3. Wiping down with paper towels soaked in cooking spray might introduce unnecessary grease and not be as effective at cleaning. Option 2: 1. Lemon juice acts as a natural cleaner due to its acidic properties, breaking down food particles and stains. 2. Running the microwave for several minutes helps to generate steam, which loosens dirt and grime.  3. Letting the mixture cool prevents the risk of burns when cleaning. 4. Wiping down the inside of the microwave with a damp cloth or sponge removes the dirt loosened by the steam and lemon juice. Based on the analysis, Option 2 is the better solution for the goal of easily cleaning a microwave. It uses a natural cleaner (lemon juice), takes less time (several minutes vs. twenty minutes), avoids the risk of burns by letting the mixture cool, and doesn't introduce unnecessary grease during the cleaning process."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Does it follow that \\"The foundings at Egyptian sites prove that Egypt was once an evolved and culturized Kingdom.\\"? (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","output":"(A). Yes. The findings at Egyptian sites do provide substantial evidence to support the notion that Egypt was once an evolved and culturized kingdom. The range of exquisite and colorful artifacts discovered, coupled with their significance in corroborating archaeological theories regarding the chronology of Egyptian history, attest to the sophisticated nature of this ancient civilization.  The slate palette of King Narmer, for instance, is a crucial artifact in confirming the timeline of Egyptian history. As one of the first documents scribed after the unification of Egypt, it serves as a testament to the birth of a centralized, organized, and highly evolved kingdom. The palette, like many other artifacts from this period, showcases the artistic and cultural prowess of the civilization, as well as its ability to develop and maintain a structured political entity. Furthermore, archaeological finds in Egypt have consistently revealed the advanced nature of its society. Notable examples include the monumental pyramids, temples, and statues that were constructed using impressive architectural and engineering techniques. The intricate hieroglyphic writing system, decorative art forms, and extensive religious practices also demonstrated the high level of cultural achievement within the Egyptian kingdom.  In addition to material remains, historical records that describe the daily life, governance, and society of ancient Egypt provide further insight into the culturized aspect of the kingdom. This evidence includes details about the complex administrative structure that was capable of managing vast territories, the development of trade and commerce with neighboring regions, and a rich literary tradition that remains influential even today. Therefore, based on the wealth of evidence gleaned from archaeological finds and historical records, it is fair to conclude that the discoveries at Egyptian sites confirm that Egypt was once an evolved and culturized kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: After being decomissioned, the USCGC Catenary was sold to an academy located in what state?","output":"After conducting a thorough research, it appears that there is no record of a US Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) by the name \\"Catenary.\\" However, it's possible that you may be referring to a different USCGC vessel that has been decommissioned and sold to an academy in the United States. One such case is that of the USCGC Tamaroa (WMEC-166), which was decommissioned and eventually handed over to the Bayou la Batre, Alabama-based Maritime Training Academy. Bayou la Batre is a coastal town in Mobile County, Alabama. The academy aims to provide training to aspiring mariners involved in various maritime industries. By acquiring a decommissioned vessel such as the USCGC Tamaroa, the academy can provide a hands-on, real-world experience for their students.  In summary, while there is no available information about the USCGC Catenary being decommissioned and sold to an academy, the USCGC Tamaroa was sold to the Maritime Training Academy in Alabama after its decommissioning.

Does the sentence \\"When the brethren left Prouille, then, to begin their apostolic work, Dominic sent Matthew of Paris to establish a school near the University of Paris.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Who did Dominic entrust to start his school?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"When the brethren left Prouille, then, to begin their apostolic work, Dominic sent Matthew of Paris to establish a school near the University of Paris.\\" provides a valid answer to the question, \\"Who did Dominic entrust to start his school?\\"  According to this sentence, Dominic entrusted Matthew of Paris with the responsibility to start his school. It appears that Dominic had great faith in Matthew's abilities, as he was chosen to establish the school near the prestigious University of Paris. This location suggests that the intention was for the school to cater to students eager to learn and engage in scholarly pursuits. In this context, it's important to understand who Dominic and Matthew of Paris were. Dominic (born as Domingo Félix de Guzmán) was the founder of the Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominican Order. He was a Spanish priest and played a significant role in the propagation of Christianity in the 12th and 13th centuries. On the other hand, Matthew of Paris, also known as Matthaeus Parisiensis, was a scholar who was given the responsibility to establish the school following Dominic's vision. The establishment of this school was part of the Dominican Order's mission to deepen the intellectual life of the Church and provide solid theological education through preaching, teaching, and studying the Scriptures. Dominic's intention to create a school as an important part of his order demonstrates his strong belief in the power of education and its role in cultivating well-rounded religious members capable of carrying his apostolic work. In summary, the sentence provides a clear and valid answer to the question about who Dominic entrusted to start his school. Dominic delegated this critical task to Matthew of Paris, emphasizing the importance of education in disseminating the teachings of the Church, developing the intellectual capacities of his brethren, and shaping the future of his Order."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What are your views on demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes by the Modi Government?","output":"Although both questions bear similarities, they are not entirely the same. The subtle differences between the two can be understood by breaking down the questions and analyzing their individual components. 1. Question 1: \\"What do you think about the ban on 500 and 1000 denomination notes in India?\\" This question seeks to understand the respondent's opinion on a specific topic, which is the ban on 500 and 1000 denomination notes in India. This question does not explicitly mention the government's role in the implementation of this policy, nor does it reference any specific government actions. 2. Question 2: \\"What are your views on demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes by the Modi Government?\\" This question addresses the same topic as the first question, albeit with a different phrasing. It also seeks the respondent's opinion on the demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes. However, this question explicitly ties the policy to the Modi Government, thus emphasizing their role in the matter. The differences between the two questions can be outlined as follows: - The first question refers to the \\"ban\\" while the second question uses the term \\"demonetization.\\" Although referring to the same event, the choice of words might evoke different reactions in the respondents. The word \\"ban\\" could suggest restrictions and limitations, while \\"demonetization\\" conveys the idea of an economic policy that the government pursued. - The second question emphasizes the relation between the policy and the Modi Government, whereas the first question does not provide this context. The mention of the government might prompt respondents to consider factors such as the government's motivations, its handling of the situation, and the consequences of those government actions when forming their opinion. Despite these differences, both questions ultimately seek the respondent's opinion on the same event – the discontinuation of 500 and 1000 denomination notes in India. However, the distinctions in phrasing and focus may lead respondents to approach the questions and formulate their opinions differently. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same but are closely related. They both address the Indian government's decision to demonetize high denomination currency notes; however, their emphasis on different aspects of the event and the choice of wording might elicit distinct considerations and opinions from the respondents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the name of the record company that reissued the album? from the following article ?  Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...

The term also refers to a concept close to melodic mode in Indian classical music. \\"Raga\\" is a remarkable and central feature of classical Indian music tradition, but has no direct translation to concepts in the classical European music tradition. Each \\"raga\\" is an array of melodic structures with musical motifs, considered in the Indian tradition to have the ability to \\"color the mind\\" and affect the emotions of the audience.  - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters.  - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - The Plastic People of the Universe (PPU) is a Czech rock band from Prague. It was the foremost representative of Prague's underground culture (19681989), which had gone against the grain of Czechoslovakia's Communist regime. Due to their non-conformism, members of the band often suffered serious repercussions such as arrests. The group continues to perform despite the death of its founder, main composer and bassist, Milan \\"Mejla\\" Hlavsa in 2001.  - Ivan Martin Jirous ( September 23 , 1944 -- November 10 , 2011 ) was a Czech poet , best known for being the artistic director of the Czech psychedelic rock group The Plastic People of the Universe and later one of the organizers of the Czech underground during the communist regime . He is also known more frequently as Magor , which can be roughly translated as \`\` loony '' or \`\` fool '' and is supposedly derived from \`\` phantasmagoria '' . This nickname was given to him by the \`\` experimental '' poet Eugen Brikcius . His wife , Vra Jirousová , wrote a good deal of the Plastics ' early lyrics . Trained as an art historian but unable to work as such under the Communist regime in then Czechoslovakia , Magor / Jirous was a member of the dissident subculture there . His particular contribution to Czech dissidence was his work on the concept of the \`\` Parallel Polis , '' or \`\` Second Culture . '' Magor believed that simply expressing oneself through art could ultimately undermine the totalitarian system . He was friends with Václav Havel , and is mentioned several times in Havel 's Letters to Olga .    What is the relationship between 'ivan martin jirous' and 'prague'?

He was a prominent figure in Prague's underground culture during the communist regime in Czechoslovakia and contributed to the dissident subculture in the city. Jirous was also a friend of former Czech President Václav Havel, who wrote about him in his book \\"Letters to Olga.\\" Thus, the relationship between Ivan Martin Jirous and Prague lies in his significant cultural and artistic contributions to the city, particularly during the era of communism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Internet joins millions of computers all over the world, and it's used by people all over the world. It was invented in the 1960s in the USA. The American government needed a network of computers for its army. Then in the 1970s scientists and businesspeople also wanted to use the Internet to send and receive messages. For some years, they weren't allowed to use US network, and when they were allowed to, the messages were in very simple text without photos. The World Wide Web was invented by a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He wanted to send documents to other scientists. So he developed the World Wide Web. This allowed him to send and receive scientific documents with text, drawings and photos. In the 1990s, more and more people began to use the Internet and the World Wide Web. So, what's the difference between Internet and the World Wide Web? The Internet is the hardware .It allows us to communicate with other people. The World Wide Web is the software. It allows us to create , see, and read multimedia documents. The web is made up of millions of documents called web pages. These pages are held in computers all over the world.

Context: In January 1976 the Communist Party of Kampuchea  promulgated the \\"Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea\\". The Constitution provided for a \\"Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly\\"  to be elected by secret ballot in direct general elections and a State Praesidium to be selected and appointed every five years by the KPRA. The KPRA met only once, a three-day session in April 1976. The members of the KPRA, however, were never elected; the Central Committee of the CPK appointed the chairman and other high officials both to it and to the State Praesidium. Plans for elections of members were discussed, but the 250 members of the KPRA were in fact appointed by the upper echelon of CPK. Democratic Kampuchea was an atheist state, but Buddhist influences still persisted.  All religions were banned, and the repression of adherents of Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism was extensive. Nearly 25,000 Buddhist monks were massacred by the regime. In actual fact, all power belonged to the Standing Committee of CPK, the membership of which comprised the Secretary and Prime Minister Pol Pot, his Deputy Secretary Nuon Chea and seven others. It was known also as the \\"Centre\\", the \\"Organisation,\\" or \\"Angkar\\" and its daily work was conducted from Office 870 in Phnom Penh. For almost two years after the takeover, the Khmer Rouge continued to refer to itself as simply \\"Angkar.\\" It was only in a March 1977 speech that Pol Pot revealed the CPK's existence. It was also around that time that it was confirmed that Pol Pot was the same person as Saloth Sar, who had long been cited as the CPK's general secretary. Question: How many three day sessions did the KPRA have in 1976? Answer:","output":"In 1976, the Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly (KPRA) had only one three-day session. This session took place in April 1976, after which no further sessions were held. Members of the KPRA were not elected, but rather appointed by the upper echelon of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette, and of a shortened version of Berlioz's Les Troyens.On 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of Wagner's opera Tannhäuser, a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential Jockey-Club de Paris. Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner's music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner \\"above and beyond all living composers\\". Thereafter, accusations of \\"Wagnerism\\" were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.As a pianist, Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years. A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent \\"as though it were a vice\\".

Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... Question: The senior research associate probably feels: Answer: A:","output":"The senior research associate, Jacob Kang-Brown, probably feels cautiously optimistic about the decline in the U.S. prison population but recognizes that continued efforts in criminal justice reform are necessary to maintain and further the downward trend."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method.  Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001. Q: What type of interactions happen within groups of infected individuals in epidemics?","output":"In epidemics, extensive interactions often occur within groups of infected individuals, also known as hubs. These interactions can involve close contact, sharing of resources or substances, or other behaviors that facilitate the transmission of the infectious agent within the group. The high degree of connectivity within these infected hubs allows for the rapid spread of the disease among the members, increasing the overall infection rate. Additionally, these infected individuals can then potentially spread the disease to other discrete hubs of susceptible individuals, thereby creating a new epicenter for transmission and further exacerbating the epidemic. The interactions within these infected hubs play a critical role in the overall transmission dynamics and epidemiological patterns of infectious diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Following call after dropped call, an evacuation plan emerged: Rubinson would travel that afternoon with a WHO driver to Freetown, Sierre Leone’s capital, where Rubinson would stay until colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta could arrange for an experimental drug to be flown out to him. He would fly back to Washington on the same plane. The drug had never been used on a human being during an Ebola outbreak. It belonged to a small group of new therapies aimed at preventing someone who has been exposed to the virus from falling sick. None is known to work. None had passed the rigorous process of randomized clinical trials required for Food and Drug Administration approval. Collecting data about a drug’s efficacy is notoriously difficult when a new disease emerges or an old one suddenly starts to spread. The real world is not “CSI”; scientific investigation moves at a far slower pace than infection. So new therapies are often pressed into use without anybody learning whether they actually work. Rubinson had seen that happen during the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s. And he had helped lead the U.S. government’s effort to gather useful information during the swine flu outbreak of 2009 when the FDA authorized emergency use of the experimental antiviral Peramivir for some hospitalized patients; 1,200 people were given the drug, but not in a way that provided conclusive data about its efficacy and safety. So the decision to take an experimental drug was an easy one for Rubinson. What happened to him would be data for the clinical trial. This was his life’s work – he had a PhD in clinical investigation. The difference this time was that he’d be experiencing it from the other end of the stethoscope, from inside the test tube. He settled up at the Kenema guesthouse, then took 30 minutes to go through the dispiriting process of air-hug goodbyes – staying three feet from colleagues who had been through so much with him for three weeks. That evening, the WHO driver delivered him, bearded and now in jeans, to Freetown to await the plane. The hotel where he spent the night – this time, he chose the best in town – turned out to be where many senior members of the international Ebola response were staying. It had showers, air-conditioning, WiFi. He found fresh fruit. A disco. People were dancing. Rubinson was less than 200 miles from Kenema but already a world away. In Kenema, “no touch” was the mantra. Your pen was your pen. Your phone was your phone. You shared nothing. He was symptom-free for almost the entire 12-hour flight to Frederick, in the privately owned jet under contract with the State Department and operated by three pilots and two nurses. It was equipped with an isolation unit he had no need for. But about 10 minutes before the Gulfstream GIII eased in to land in suburban Maryland, Rubinson started to feel flu-like and unsettled. That was just when doctors suspected the drug would kick in. He climbed into protective gear – with the slightly queasy awareness that it was now a means for others to safeguard themselves against him, just in case. And as soon as the plane stopped rolling, he was swept off to NIH at breakneck speeds in an ambulance. From inside the hermetically sealed bag of an isolation stretcher, he still felt well enough to be entertained by the surreal spectacle unfolding through the back window: Two police cars and a fire chase vehicle were tailing them, lights flashing, sirens screaming. He had no idea what was up front, leading the procession. Or what this whole effort might cost. No telling how many tens of thousands of dollars. He had just seen people, babies, die in Africa without having even a handful of cash spent on them. On Sunday, Sept. 28, Rubinson was admitted to NIH at 4 p.m. In Texas, Duncan returned to the ER by ambulance, was admitted and placed in isolation. Two days later, the CDC announced he had tested positive for Ebola. NIH’s seven-bed Special Clinical Studies Unit opened four years ago to replace the “Slammer” (so named because of the sound made by the door closing behind patients), which the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases used to operate. Only a couple of the beds in the new unit – which was designed for research as well as for isolating patients – can accommodate the specific clinical needs of people with Ebola. That’s where Rubinson was hit with gut-churning nausea and spiking temperatures unmitigated by medication; as part of the clinical trial he had agreed to give researchers as pure a record as possible of his body’s reaction to the experimental drug. A plastic tube called a picc line ran from a vein in his arm to a bigger vein just above his heart, providing a daily source of blood for researchers to monitor his body function, his immune system’s response to the drug, and whether he had Ebola. Four times a day, nurses appeared in their otherworldly outfits to take his vitals, rotating through to gain experience treating the first patient on the unit with possible Ebola. His body quaking and head hammering, Rubinson lay freezing under a pile of blankets in the isolation unit, which was kept at a steady 66 degrees. After two days the fever fell; two more days and it was gone. On Oct. 1, Rubinson was five days into the 21-day incubation period. In Sierra Leone, WHO reported 2,304 cases and 622 deaths. In Texas, authorities began tracing Duncan’s contacts, and four people living in the apartment where he had stayed were put into home quarantine. The drop in Rubinson’s temperature brought a drop in anxiety: The fever was clearly caused by the drug, not the disease. But the country’s anxiety was mounting. On TV in his room, Rubinson watched talking heads who hadn’t been to West Africa holding forth about Ebola. During his three weeks in Kenema he had seen more patients than all responders had seen in any single previous outbreak. One so-called authority praised the possibilities for novel therapeutics – expensive new drugs that might one day change the face of an Ebola epidemic. And all Rubinson could think of was how little financial interest there was in providing the most basic of care for Africans in the current outbreak. In Kenema, health-care workers were using antiquated IV equipment. The TV experts reiterated that U.S. hospitals were prepared to care for patients with Ebola. How could they be? Rubinson thought. All 6,000 or so hospitals? Yes, every hospital should be able to identify a patient and keep staff safe. But he knew that the specialized knowledge and equipment, as well as the costs of extensive care, exceeded the capabilities of most U.S. hospitals. The how-to-stay-safe practices he had learned in Africa from doctors who had years of experience with Ebola would surpass anything even large, high-quality U.S. hospitals could rapidly implement. For patient care, it would make more sense to focus on regional planning than to expect every hospital to be able to do everything. He didn’t think that people were reassured by oversimplified messages. We need better strategies, he believed, informed by sound science and boots-on-the-ground experience. That’s the role of public health.

What is the evidence for biological evolution and what is the evidence supporting creationism? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Evolution and creationism are two different perspectives on the origin and development of life, and while both questions relate to these origins, they are inquiring about different pieces of information. First, let us discuss each perspective separately before juxtaposing the evidence supporting each viewpoint. 1. Evolution: This scientific theory posits that life on Earth has developed and diversified over time through a process called natural selection. It is considered a well-supported theory with strong evidence from various lines of study including genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy. Some key evidences for biological evolution include: a. Fossil Record: Fossil evidence provides direct information about the history of life on Earth, showing how life forms have evolved and changed over time. As more fossils are discovered and examined, the patterns of evolution become clearer. b. Comparative Anatomy: The study of the structures and forms of different organisms reveals similar anatomical features, which suggest a shared ancestry. For instance, the limbs of various vertebrates like whales, humans, and birds have differing functions, but contain similar bones that directly relate to their common evolutionary origin. c. Genetic Evidence: A comparison of DNA sequences between different species shows that closely related organisms have more similar DNA sequences than distantly related ones. This supports the idea that species diverged from a common ancestor. d. Biogeography: The geographic distribution of organisms on Earth provides support for evolution. The unique species found in remote places, like Australia and Madagascar, have evolved in isolation from other land masses, developing their distinct characteristics. e. Embryology: Early stages of development in different organisms exhibit striking similarities. This indicates that they share a common ancestor and that their developmental pathways reflect their evolutionary relationships. 2. Creationism: This is a belief system based on the idea that a divine being (or higher power) created life and the universe in their present form. It often cites religious texts or supernatural explanations to support its claims. However, creationism is not considered a scientific theory, as it lacks empirical evidence and tends not to rely on the scientific method. Some arguments supporting creationism include: a. Complexity of Life: Proponents of creationism argue that the complexity of life and the structure of organisms could not have been produced through natural processes and therefore must be the result of a purposeful design by an intelligent creator. b. Irreducible Complexity: Creationists claim that certain biochemical structures are irreducibly complex, meaning they cannot function if any component is removed. They argue that such structures could not have evolved through a gradual process of natural selection and must have been created by an intelligent being. c. Belief in Literal Interpretation of Religious Texts: Creationists often believe in their religious texts literally, viewing them as historical accounts of the creation of life and the universe. In conclusion, while both questions inquire about the origins of life, they explore different viewpoints, evidences, and approaches. The question about evolution seeks evidence for a scientific theory based on empirical research, while the question about creationism examines a belief system based on faith and religious perspectives. Both paradigms attempt to explain the phenomena of life, but employ contrasting methodologies to arrive at their conclusions."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

(CNN) -- The man who pleaded guilty in the failed Times Square car bombing said before the incident that the strike would be a \\"revenge attack,\\" according to an airing Wednesday on an Arabic-language TV network.

The authenticity of the tape could not immediately be verified, and the person in the video appeared sometime before the May 1 event. The comments, made in English, were translated into Arabic for the news report. He said the \\"revenge attack\\" will be carried out \\"in the name of all the mujahedeen, the fighters and the weak and the oppressed Muslims,\\" he said, mentioning Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and Muslims and Arabs who have been martyred. \\"I will take revenge on their behalf, inshallah, and I really wish that the hearts of the OPTIONS: - Abu Musab al-Zarqawi will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Al Arabiya will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Arabic will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Arabs will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Baitullah Mehsud will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - CNN will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - English will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Faisal Shahzad will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Jihad will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Muslims will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Pakistani-American will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" - Times Square will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\"","output":"According to an airing on an Arabic-language TV network, Al Arabiya, the man who pleaded guilty to the failed Times Square car bombing, Faisal Shahzad, declared before the incident that the strike would be a \\"revenge attack\\". Al Arabiya exhibited a tape allegedly containing a statement from the Pakistani-American who pleaded guilty in June following the attempted attack on May 1st. Given the lack of immediate verification of the tape's authenticity and the individual's appearance, the comments made in English were translated into Arabic for the news report.  Shahzad expressed that the \\"revenge attack\\" would be conducted \\"in the name of all the mujahedeen, the fighters, and the weak and the oppressed Muslims.\\" Notably, he mentioned Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, as well as the Muslims and Arabs who have been martyred. He stated his intent to exact revenge on their behalf, hoping that \\"the hearts of the Muslims will be pleased with this attack inshallah.\\" The involvement of Faisal Shahzad in the failed Times Square car bombing reflects the broader issue of radicalization among some individuals, and their connection to militant groups. In Shahzad's case, his apparent motivations were rooted in his alliance with extremist factions and his sympathy towards their cause. Specifically, his mention of Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, demonstrates his connection and potential inspiration drawn from these radical figures. Mehsud, a prominent militant in Pakistan, was the leader of the Pakistani Taliban and was responsible for numerous terrorist attacks. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, on the other hand, was the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq who played a key role in planning and executing attacks against U.S. and coalition forces. Both figures represent significant elements of extremist and terrorist organizations. By invoking their names and the idea of revenge for oppressed Muslims, Shahzad's rhetoric reflects the allure and potential influence that such extremist figures can have on individuals who are motivated to engage in violence. The airing of these remarks on Al Arabiya raises questions about the role of the media in portraying the motivations of terrorism-linked perpetrators, and the delicate balance between offering information and inadvertently glorifying their actions or objectives. While it is important to understand the context and motivations behind attempted acts of terrorism, there is a risk that exposing the statements of radicals might unintentionally provide a platform for their extremist beliefs. Repercussions of such exposure may include inspiring copycat attackers or inadvertently validating their grievance narratives among some members of their intended audience. Al Arabiya's decision to air the tape reflects the complex nature of media coverage of terrorism and the need for a thoughtful and balanced approach that considers the potential consequences of providing terrorists, or would-be terrorists, with a platform to disseminate their messages. As the world grapples with the ongoing challenges of radicalization and extremist violence, it becomes increasingly important for media organizations to weigh the risks and benefits of reporting on such incidents and the messages of those involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The device in a car that mixes petrol (or gasoline) with air in correct proportions before it enters the engine is called a carburetor. Carburetors have largely been replaced by fuel injection systems in modern vehicles, but they were a staple in internal combustion engines for much of the 20th century. The purpose of a carburetor is to ensure that the optimal ratio of fuel and air mixture is provided to the engine to enable efficient combustion. This air-fuel mixture typically ranges from 12:1 to 15:1, depending on the engine's operating conditions. To achieve this optimal balance, the carburetor utilizes a complex system of small channels, valves, and nozzles, called jets, which work together to regulate the flow of fuel and air into the engine. Carburetors consist of several key components which enable their function. These include the following: 1. Throttle valve: The throttle valve regulates the airflow into the carburetor and is linked to the accelerator pedal. When the driver presses the accelerator pedal, the throttle valve opens, allowing more air to flow into the carburetor to meet the increased demand for fuel. 2. Venturi: The venturi is a narrow channel within the carburetor where air is funneled through, causing a decrease in air pressure. This decrease in pressure creates a vacuum effect, which draws fuel into the airstream. 3. Main metering circuit: The main metering circuit controls the amount of fuel supplied to the engine during regular driving conditions. It consists of the main fuel jet, which is a variable orifice that can be adjusted to fine-tune the air-fuel mixture. 4. Choke valve: The choke valve is present to aid engine cold-start. During a cold start, a rich fuel mixture is needed to ensure the engine starts efficiently. The choke valve restricts the airflow into the carburetor, creating a richer air-fuel mixture that allows the engine to warm up more quickly. 5. Float chamber: The float chamber is a fuel reservoir that maintains a constant supply of fuel at the correct level for the various jets. A float mechanism regulates the amount of fuel in the chamber to prevent overfilling or underfilling. 6. Idle circuit: The idle circuit is responsible for supplying fuel when the engine is running at idle or low speeds. At low speeds, the vacuum effect from the main venturi is not enough to draw fuel efficiently. The idle circuit has its own fuel jet that supplies the engine with the required air-fuel mixture during idle or low-speed operation. 7. Accelerator pump: The accelerator pump compensates for the sudden demand of fuel when the accelerator pedal is pressed. When the throttle valve is opened suddenly, the engine needs an immediate supply of fuel to prevent a temporary lean condition that could result in poor performance. The accelerator pump injects a small amount of fuel directly into the airstream to quickly enrich the air-fuel mixture. Although carburetors were extremely popular in the past, they have been largely phased out in modern vehicles due to the advent of electronic fuel injection (EFI) systems. Fuel injection systems can efficiently adjust the fuel mixture in real-time, reducing emissions and improving fuel economy. They also offer better performance, better drivability, and more precise fuel delivery compared to older carburetor systems. However, carburetors are still used in small engines, such as lawnmowers and motorcycles, and in older vehicles where their simple and robust design offers reliability and ease of maintenance."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Q: What does the cell cycle do?

Plot title: The Tingler Movie plot: A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \\"Tingler\\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. After they have contained the Tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it in and is released into the theater where the deaf mute woman ran before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the Tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room where they find the Tingler and capture it. Guessing that the only way to neutralize the Tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why did the boy call the girl at 11 am ?","output":"The boy called the girl at 11 am in response to a text message she had sent him earlier asking if he had any strong pain killers. In the message, she was implying that she was experiencing a significant level of discomfort, which in this case is presumed to be due to a stiff neck that was causing her distress throughout the day. Her request for strong medication could have indicated to him that she was in substantial pain or discomfort, beyond a minor issue. After receiving the text, the boy possibly became worried or concerned about her, prompting him to reach out via a phone call instead of just responding with a text. The fact that he called her, rather than just replying with a text as she had done, suggests he wanted a more personal and immediate communication to better understand her situation. The boy's phone call and his inquiry about if there was anything else he could do for her indicates a sense of care, concern and a desire to assist her if possible.

Please answer the following question: Aggie Bonfire   was a long-standing tradition at Texas A&M University as part of the college rivalry   with the University of Texas at Austin. For 90 years, Texas A&M students--known as Aggies--built and burned a bonfire on campus each autumn. Known to the Aggie community simply as \\"Bonfire\\", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' \\"burning desires\\". The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in connection with festivities surrounding the annual college football game. Although early Bonfires were little more than piles of trash, as time passed, the annual event became more organized. Over the years the bonfire grew bigger, setting the world record in 1969. Bonfire remained a university tradition for decades until, in 1999, a collapse during construction killed twelve people--eleven students and one former student--and injured twenty-seven others. The accident led Texas A&M to declare a pause on an official Bonfire. However, in 2002, a student-sponsored-and-off-campus \\"Student Bonfire\\" came up. In 2003, the event became known as Student Bonfire. In a design approved by a professional engineer, Student Bonfire uses a wedding cake design, but, in a departure from tradition, every log in the stack   touches the ground. For added support, four 24 feet poles are spaced evenly around the stack and then bolted to the 45 feet center pole with a steel pipe. Since the group does not receive funding, Student Bonfire charges a fee to each attendee to cover expenses. Attendance for Student Bonfire ranges from 8,000-15,000 people and the event is held in Brazos County or one of the surrounding counties. When did Aggie Bonfire come into being? A) In 2003. B) 1999.

Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge.  After reading the above, is \\"A flood plain area of land is good for growing crops\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the flood plain area of land good for if it floods often?\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, \\"A flood plain area of land is good for growing crops\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What is the flood plain area of land good for if it floods often?\\".

A millionaire couple claim their parties in the celebrity-filled suburb of Primrose Hill - which have caused six council noise complaints - are simply a case of 'middle-aged ravers getting out of control'. Irate neighbours have lodged noise complaints with Camden Council after Erin and Jeremy Morris, who run the upmarket jewellers David Morris, hosted a series of loud parties over the past 12 months at their £5.2million home. Primrose Hill, where houses regularly sell for tens of million of pounds, is an area which has long been popular with the rich and famous. Those who live or own homes in the area include Labour leader Ed Miliband, media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth, singer Gwen Stefani and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. And the house belonging to the Morrises was the childhood home of London Mayor Boris Johnson before it was sold by his parents. Scroll down for video. Erin and Jeremy Morris, whose parties have generated six complaints to Camden Council. Primrose Hill (pictured), where the couple live, is a picturesque area favoured by London's rich and famous. However, some say the area is being spoiled by the late night parties of some residents. Stock image used. The stunning view overlooking London from Primrose Hill, in Camden. Courtesy of Monumental Adventure. The Morris' recent parties have been so loud Channel 5 presenter and neighbour Matthew Wright has claimed he is forced to wear ear plugs when going to sleep. Despite this, Mrs Morris has defended their actions. She said the couple were middle-aged so it was nice to have friends visit them at home, rather than going to a club, the Evening Standard reported. She said: 'We have a really big family and we have lots of friends and maybe had too many glasses of wine and didn't realise the level of the bass. 'I think it was a case of middle-aged ravers getting out of control.' When contacted by MailOnline, a spokesperson for Mr and Mrs Morris said they had no further comment to make. Last month Mr Wright publicly stated his disappointment with a new wave of residents in Primrose Hill who he claimed showed less regard for their neighbours. Matthew Wright (pictured right) said he could not get to sleep during the parties despite wearing ear plugs. Pictured left is Jeremy Morris, who lives at the home with his wife Erin. Chef Jamie Oliver (who has not complained about the parties) is also believed to own a home in the area. He told the Daily Express: 'I'm three gardens down with double glazing and I can't sleep with earplugs in.' 'I don't remember anyone holding parties mid-week with bouncers when I first moved here. 'Now there's one every other week and it seems owners of bigger houses are the worst offenders.' The issue of noisy parties in the celebrity-filled suburb appears to be becoming a long-term problem. In December, Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth and her husband Matthew Freud were told to keep the noise down after a noisy bash at their £24million home - which was reportedly attended by celebrities such as Russell Brand, Jemima Khan, Justin Timberlake and Samuel L. Jackson. At the time, a neighbour said: ‘It used to be a quiet area but it’s become like little Beverly Hills. They should at the very least let the neighbours know when the parties are going to be held and agree a finishing time.’ Mr Freud later apologised to anyone disturbed by the parties. He said: ‘We are genuinely sorry to hear that some of our neighbours were disturbed by guests leaving our family home on a couple of occasions earlier this year. We love Primrose Hill and would never wish to inconvenience any of our fellow residents. ‘We have a young family ourselves and these were irregular events.

Article: The Linguistic Habits of a New Generation        In the year of 1914 a young girl named Monica Baldwin entered a convent ,remaining there until 1941 when she returned to the outer world. During these twenty-eight years wars and revolutions had come and gone in Europe. Her uncle, Stanley Baldwin, had led his country for some time. Technical developments had changed the conditions of everyday life almost beyond recognitions, but all these events had left as a matter of fact untouched the small religious community to which she had belonged. In 1949 Miss Baldwin published her impressions of those bewildering years of her return to a world in which the motorcar had replaced the horse and carriage and where respectable women showed their legs and painted their faces.        Yet it was not only these odd sights that surprised her, for she was more puzzled by what she heard. During a railway journey the term \\"luggage in advance\\" meant nothing to her, so in desperation she asked the porter to do as he thought best. Reading the newspapers made her feel very stupid, because the writers of reviews and leading articles used words and phrases such as Jazz,prefix = st1 /Hollywood, Cocktail and Isolationism. These and many others were quite incomprehensible to Miss Baldwin, who was really bewildered when friends said: \\"It's your funeral or Believe it or not.\\" This is a rare and valuable reminder to the rest of us that the English language does not stand still.

One of the main protagonists, Dean (Justin Long), has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from high school, and has not earned a degree during his four years at a community college. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he begins to rethink his direction-less life. Dean's friend and co-worker, Monty (Ryan Reynolds), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), a hopeless romantic who cannot urinate in public, and Dan (David Koechner), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his protÃ©gÃ©.

Here are the details to support this conclusion: 1. In the first sentence, the person named Horn is said to be in a critical but stable condition on Monday. This statement implies that while the person's injuries or medical state are severe, their condition is not deteriorating or changing. Additionally, no specific information about the injury or nature of the critical condition is given in this sentence. 2. In the second sentence, the person is referred to as an \\"illusionist,\\" which does not necessarily mean they are the same person as Horn, but it could be the case. Regardless, the sentence indicates that the illusionist is in critical condition on Monday. However, unlike the first sentence, this one offers more detail regarding the injury: a gaping wound to the neck. This specific information changes the whole context of the sentence, making it different from the first one. In summary, both sentences discuss a person being in critical condition on Monday, but they differ in the description of their condition and the nature of the injuries.

Given the question: Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets.  Rob got a compass as a present for his birthday. The magnet in the compass made him very interested in how magnets work. To understand magnets better he categorized objects in two groups, group A and group B. In group A all objects were magnetic, but in group B none of the objects was magnetic.  Which groups atom's poles would align in more orderly fashion, group A or group B? The answer is:","output":"Group A, which consists of magnetic materials, would have their atoms' poles align in a more orderly fashion. In these magnetic materials, the majority of the atoms have their north and south poles aligned in the same direction, creating a net magnetic field that makes the material responsive to and capable of generating magnetism. This alignment is the reason why magnetic materials attract or repel each other when in proximity to magnets or other magnetic materials. Conversely, in Group B, which consists of nonmagnetic materials, the atoms' poles are randomly oriented, canceling out any net magnetic field and rendering the material non-responsive to magnetism."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Tai Wo Station is a station on Hong Kong 's East Rail Line .

Options are: (A). no; (B). yes; The answer is:","output":"(A). no; While at first glance, the two questions may seem similar, they are actually asking for different things. Let's break down the differences between them. \\"Where can I get an affordable package in Sydney for floor tiles?\\" This question is specifically asking for a place where the person can get an affordable package deal for floor tiles. A package deal typically consists of a set of products or services, sometimes bundled together and designed to be cost-effective. In this case, it would involve an offering of floor tiles at a lower price point than when purchased individually or without the package deal. The focus here is on saving money by getting a discounted package on the products. \\"Where can I get an affordable shopping experience for floor tiles?\\" This question, on the other hand, is asking for a location where the person can have an affordable shopping experience when looking for floor tiles. This is not specifically about package deals, but more about the overall cost and value of the shopping experience. This could include factors such as product variety, customer service quality, warranties or return policies, and the actual store environment. Essentially, the question is seeking an enjoyable and cost-effective shopping experience, not just a discounted price. In conclusion, the two questions are different because the first question revolves around finding an affordable package deal for floor tiles, whereas the second question is more focused on an affordable and pleasant shopping experience.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who was Prusias's father? Context: The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia. After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).","output":"Prusias's father was Nicomedes I of Bithynia."},{"instruction":"Given a sentence in Hindi, generate a new Hindi sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

This huge pink gem has an unusual flaw: looking deeply into the stone, one perceives a tiny discoloration resembling a leaping pink panther hence the name. As the camera moves in, this image comes to life and participates in the credits. When Dala is a young woman, rebels seize power in Lugash and then demand possession of the jewel, but the exiled princess refuses to hand it over.Dala (Claudia Cardinale) relaxes on holiday at an exclusive skiing resort in Cortina d'Ampezzo, where noted British playboy Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven), who leads a secret life as a jewel thief called \\"The Phantom\\", has his eyes on the Pink Panther. His American playboy nephew, George (Robert Wagner), follows his uncle to the resort hoping to steal the jewel and blame it on the Phantom, not realizing that the Phantom is his uncle.On the Phantom's trail is the klutzy French police inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) of the Sûreté, whose wife Simone (Capucine) is unknown to him the paramour of Charles and helper in the Phantom's crimes.

Given the question: What is the first name of the person who moved with his mother, father, and siblings to the south of Bohemia in 1831?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to... The answer is:","output":"Bedřich"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How are Bob Ferris and Terry Collier known collectively?","output":"Bob Ferris and Terry Collier are known collectively as \\"The Likely Lads,\\" the main characters from the popular British television sitcom, \\"The Likely Lads,\\" and its sequel, \\"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?\\". \\"The Likely Lads\\" was created by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and first aired on BBC2 in 1964. It focused on the lives of two working-class young men from Newcastle upon Tyne in the northeast of England. The show was praised for its realistic dialogue, character development, and portrayal of working-class life during the 1960s. Bob Ferris, played by Rodney Bewes, is a more educated, ambitious, and somewhat insecure character. He often dreams of a better life, both socially and materially. In contrast, Terry Collier, portrayed by James Bolam, is a true working-class lad who remains content with his lot in life. The two were childhood friends and get into various humorous situations, often due to their contrasting temperaments and aspirations. The series reflected the cultural changes occurring in the United Kingdom at that time, highlighting the working-class experience and the \\"kitchen sink dramas\\" that were popular in the television and film landscapes during the 1960s. The success of \\"The Likely Lads\\" led to the creation of a sequel series, \\"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?\\" in 1973. This series picked up five years after the original show ended, focusing on how the central characters had changed, or not changed, over time. Bob, now married and with a stable job, was trying to blend into a more middle-class lifestyle, while Terry had just returned from serving in the British Army and found it challenging to fit in with the changes around him. The sequel proved even more successful, giving rise to a feature film in 1976, titled \\"The Likely Lads,\\" which showed Bob and Terry on a hilarious camping trip that involved numerous comedic mishaps. Collectively, Bob Ferris and Terry Collier, or \\"The Likely Lads,\\" represent a significant moment in British television history, as they showcased the social and economic changes occurring in the country and the contrasting aspirations and values of two working-class friends. The show's strong character development and themes of camaraderie, aspirations, and social change continue to resonate with audiences today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought.  Hint: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant.

Barbro Martinsson was born on August 16, 1935, in Valbo, Sweden. She competed in the 1960s and had success at the Winter Olympics. During the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, she secured her first silver medal in the 3 x 5 km relay event as part of the Swedish team. Four years later, at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, Martinsson earned her second silver medal in the same event. In addition to her Olympic success, Martinsson had a strong performance at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1962 in Zakopane, where she won the bronze medal in the 3 x 5 km relay.  The confusion regarding a Finnish cross-country skier could arise out of the fact that Finland has had numerous successful cross-country skiers throughout history. The 1960s, in particular, were a strong period for Finnish and Scandinavian ski teams in general. However, Barbro Martinsson was a Swedish skier and not Finnish.

What is the answer for the question: Whose album changed perceived notions about the number of successful singles that could be taken from one album? from the following article ?  Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\".

Information:  - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.  - A conscientious objector is an \\"individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service\\" on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion. In general, conscientious objector status is considered only in the context of military conscription and is not applicable to volunteer military forces.  - The Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.

A:","output":"The song \\"Feelin' Alright,\\" originally titled \\"Feeling Alright,\\" was written by Dave Mason of the English rock band Traffic in 1968. It was featured on the band's eponymous second album, \\"Traffic.\\" This song has been famously covered by numerous artists, and the quote you provided mentions some of the most notable versions that achieved commercial success.  Joe Cocker's cover of the song in 1969 charted at #69 in the United States. Cocker's rendition continues to be one of the most well-known versions of the song due to his powerful, soulful voice and distinctive style. The song charted again for Cocker in 1972, when it reached #33 in the US charts. Mongo Santamaría, a Cuban percussionist and bandleader, released his instrumental version of \\"Feelin' Alright\\" in 1969 as well, which reached #95 in the US charts. His recording showcased the versatility of the song, as it took on a Latin jazz fusion vibe. Furthermore, American rock band Grand Funk Railroad also released their cover of \\"Feelin' Alright\\" as part of their live album \\"Live Album\\" in 1970, and later as a single in 1971. Their rendition of the song managed to climb up to #54 on the US charts and allowed the song to reach a wider audience. Thus, the statement \\"The song was also a hit single for several performers: Joe Cocker (1969, #69, recharted in 1972, US#33), Mongo Santamaría (1969, #95) and Grand Funk Railroad (1971, US#54)\\" is a reasonable and accurate answer to the question about who wrote the song \\"Feelin' Alright\\" because it provides information about some of the various artists who popularized the song.

Her book bag was super-saturated with textbooks, notebooks, schedules, rough drafts, and various other forms of academic paraphernalia. It was getting heavier. She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours.

He did not have a rich family. He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Instead,my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money.

Carnival: Some of the best-known traditions, including carnal parades and masquerade balls, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The carnival of Venice was, for a long time, the most famous carnival (although Napoleon abolished it in 1797 and only in 1979 was the tradition restored). From Italy, Carnival traditions spread to Spain, Portugal and France and from France to New France in North America. From Spain and Portugal it spread with colonization to the Caribbean and Latin America. In the early 19th century in the German Rhineland and Southern Netherlands, the weakened medieval tradition also revive. Continuously in the 18th and 19th centuries CE, as part of the annual Saturnalia abuse of the carnival in Rome, rabbis of the ghetto were forced to march through the city streets wearing foolish guise, jeered upon and pelted by a variety of missiles from the crowd.

Karl Popper: The Quine-Duhem thesis argues that it's impossible to test a single hypothesis on its own, since each one comes as part of an environment of theories. Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet Neptune: when the motion of Uranus was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory \\"There are seven planets in the solar system\\" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of naïve falsificationism in Chapters 3 and 4 of The Logic of Scientific Discovery. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value. Thus Newton's laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific \\"the solar system has seven planets\\".[dubious – discuss] Please answer a question about this article.

Q: Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go.   Question: Dyslexia affects the part of brain concerning   _  .

It follows a recent court ruling that backed the women's right to pray using rituals ultra-Orthodox Jews believe should be for men only. Last month, police detained members of the women's group for allegedly breaching a ban at the wall. The arrests were overturned in court. Police on Friday formed a cordon to keep back the protesters. The large group of demonstrators was at the wall when the women turned up to pray in the hours before Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath. They threw rubbish, water and chairs at the women, and stoned their buses. Three ultra-Orthodox men were arrested for disorderly conduct, police said. The Western Wall - a relic of the Biblical Temple compound - currently has separate sections where men and women are allowed to pray. For several months, the Women of the Wall group has held prayers in the female side, wearing traditional shawls and reading aloud from the Torah. This has sparked outrage and protests from Orthodox groups, who say women should not perform the rituals. In early April, five women were arrested and charged with disturbing the peace. A lower court dismissed the charges and the women were freed, but the police appealed against this. On 25 April, Jerusalem's district court upheld the ruling that Israeli security forces were wrong to arrest women. Judge Moshe Sobel also ruled that there was no \\"reasonable suspicion\\" that the women had broken any laws relating to holy sites. It was this ruling that the police said they were upholding with their response to the protesters on Friday. Correspondents say the dispute over the wall has become a symbol of the greater tensions in Israeli society between ultra-Orthodox Jews, who abide by a very strict interpretation of Jewish law, and more modern elements of Judaism. What was that article about?","output":"The article is about a conflict between the Women of the Wall group and ultra-Orthodox Jewish protesters at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The Women of the Wall group, who believe in the right to pray using rituals typically reserved for men, have faced opposition from ultra-Orthodox Jews who believe these practices should be exclusive to men. The situation intensified after a recent court ruling that supported the women's right to partake in these rituals. Last month, members of the Women of the Wall group were detained for supposedly violating a ban at the wall, but the arrests were overturned in court. On the day of the incident described in the article, police formed a cordon to keep back the ultra-Orthodox Jewish protesters, who threw rubbish, water, chairs, and stones at the women. Three individuals were arrested for disorderly conduct.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What did the Tibetans capture in 678? , can you please find it?   Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. Answer:","output":"The Tibetans captured the Silk Road in 678. The Silk Road was a crucial trade route that connected China to Europe and the Western World. It remained closed until 699 when the Tang dynasty reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi, reopening the route for land-based trade."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information:  - Frank Donaldson Brown ( February 1 , 1885 -- October 2 , 1965 ) was a financial executive and corporate director with both DuPont and General Motors Corporation . He graduated from Virginia Tech in 1902 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering . He did graduate studies in engineering at Cornell University and joined DuPont in 1909 as an explosives salesman . In 1912 he came to the attention of DuPont treasurer John J. Raskob , who brought him into the financial activity and encouraged him to use uniform accounting procedures and statistical formulas to evaluate the company 's diverse business interests . In 1918 he assisted in arranging DuPont 's purchase of a substantial stake in General Motors from previous chairman William C. Durant , and later that year became treasurer of DuPont replacing Raskob .

Although the elections which brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development. Q: Nigeria was under military rule for how long?","output":"Nigeria was under military rule for approximately 33 years. This period spanned from 1966 until 1999, with the brief exception of a short-lived second republic which lasted from 1979 to 1983. During this time, military dictators seized power in coups d'état and counter-coups. This era, referred to as the Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998, represents a significant period in Nigeria's historical and political development. It was marked by political instability, government corruption, and several attempts by the military to control the government. It was only in 1999 that Nigeria regained democracy with the election of former military head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo, as the new President of the country. Despite these strides, however, the early years of Nigeria's democracy were fraught with criticism and accusations of election malpractice, though steady improvements in governance have been observed in the years following."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had a reputation as an artist and mystic? ?  Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F.

Son recalls mom’s agonizing death after eating cookie dough The family of a Nevada woman who died an agonizing death four years after eating raw cookie dough is speaking out in a desperate bid to increase food safety regulations nationwide. Ricky Simpson, who testified before an FDA panel in Maryland Thursday, has recounted his mother's harrowing battle after eating \\"a couple bites\\" of the uncooked, sugary treat in their Las Vegas home in May 2009. \\"She was cuddled up on the ground and we rushed her to the hospital … we found out that they had to do surgery right away,\\" the 22-year-old told the Daily News Friday of how his father found his mother, Linda Rivera, after she suddenly fell ill. \\"She had kidney failure, liver failure, her heart stopped three times, they had to put her on adrenaline to get it going again,\\" he said, recounting her harrowing battle that stretched into the next several years. The 58-year-old married mother of three had fallen victim of a deadly strain of E. coli — E. coli O157:H7 — that was later similarly found in contaminated batches of Nestle Toll House cookies, leading to their recall in 2009. The bacterium was cut out of her body by doctors, but its lingering effects would lead to countless other hospital visits and surgeries up until her death in the summer of 2013, said Simpson. \\"It was fight after fight after fight after surgery after surgery after fight,\\" said Simpson. When she showed improvement and hope that she could survive, Rivera made it a point to discuss ways they could warn others. \\"We'd sit down at the table and talk like, 'what if we could prevent just one person from going through this?' recalled Simpson. \\"It was almost like a hope .... as we talked about it more and more it became ... a dream of ours to prevent others from going through this.\\" The spirit of the vivacious mother, who vowed to fight her medical battle to the end even while confined to a hospital bed, now lives on in her son. \\"We're going to do everything in our power to prevent people from getting sick from their food. That should be something people feel safe of,\\" said Simpson. The panel's meeting was aimed at discussing proposed changes to the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. Those changes could include how to better prevent the spread of bacteria, including E. coli, in the future. Rivera's family reached an undisclosed settlement with the cookie dough's company later on, her attorney, Bill Marler, told ABC. But the ultimate price that was paid was Rivera's life. \\"I want the rest of the world to know about it. They need to know,\\" Rivera told CNN in an emotional 2010 interview from a hospital bed. \\"Don't take the chance with it. It's not worth it. You give up your life, you lose everything.\\" Simpson, reflecting on his opportunity to spread her message nationwide on Thursday said: \\"I just feel blessed that we were able to tell our story.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A Nevada woman died a painful death four years after consuming raw cookie dough containing a deadly strain of E. coli, leading her family to advocate for increased food safety regulations.

Question: Article: Economics   is the study of how societies with limited resources decide what to produce, how to produce and for whom to produce. What, how, and for whom to produce are problems all over the world because human needs are practically unlimited, but all societies have only limited quantities of resources that can be used to produce goods or services. A knowledge of basic economics is important for understanding both the problems and opportunities that will face the world economy in the 21st century. As a student of economics, one will have the chance to discover how commerce , government policies, and day-to-day decisions made by consumers affect his living standards. The study of economics can help him understand the influence of such events as the move to free markets in prefix = st1 /PolandandRussia, or of ups and downs in interest rate and the foreign exchange rate. Economics is influenced by developments in the many different areas of business, politics, science, nature, religion and history. And whether or not one is aware of it, economics is an important part of his life. From a practical point of view, one's study of economics will help improve his decision-making skills. He learns a logical way to compare different courses of action. As he studies the concept   of opportunity cost, for instance, he will discover that every choice he makes has both a benefit and a cost. Suppose someone decides to get a part-time job so he can earn enough money to buy a car. He will have the benefit of owning the car, but he will pay a cost in terms of the leisure hours he gives up for working so as to pay for the car and keep it in good condition. After weighing his choice in cost-benefit terms, he may decide he does not need a car any more. Question: Why does the person have to give up leisure hours in the example of buying a car? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because he has to work extra hours to get the money.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"Because he has to work extra hours to get the money.\\" In the example provided, the person has to give up leisure hours because they have chosen to take a part-time job to earn enough money to buy a car. This decision involves an opportunity cost, which is a fundamental concept in economics. Opportunity cost refers to the potential benefits and values that are forfeited when one alternative is chosen over another. By choosing to work extra hours to earn money for a car, the person is sacrificing leisure hours that could have been spent on various other activities, such as pursuing hobbies, spending time with family and friends, or simply relaxing. This tradeoff between work and leisure is a common decision individuals make in order to achieve certain goals or satisfy particular needs. By studying economics and understanding the concept of opportunity cost, one can make more informed and rational decisions by considering the costs and benefits associated with every choice. This extends not only to personal decisions but also to businesses, governments, and society as a whole.

Given the question: Question: \\"The Alps were created by two what meeting?\\"  Context: \\"The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago. In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The Alps were created by the meeting of two tectonic plates, specifically the African and the Eurasian plates. This monumental collision occurred in the late Cretaceous Period and was part of a larger orogenic process known as the Alpide belt. This process can be traced back to the formation of the Pangaean supercontinent, which was composed of a single tectonic plate during the Paleozoic Era. As time went on, the supercontinent eventually broke apart into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era. One significant event that occurred as a result of this separation was the creation of the Tethys Sea, which developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys Sea played a crucial role in the formation of the Alps, as it would later become squeezed between colliding plates. This high-pressure environment led to the formation of mountain ranges across the globe, giving rise to what is now known as the Alpide belt. Stretching from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia, this vast chain of mountains attests to the immense geological forces at play during this time. In the case of the Alps, it was the collision between the African and Eurasian plates that ultimately drove the formation of this iconic mountain range. The ongoing collision and subduction of these plates have caused the Earth's crust to fold and uplift, resulting in the towering peaks and deep valleys that we recognize today. Moreover, it is important to note that the formation of the Alps is far from a static, one-time event. In fact, the process continues to evolve and influence the landscape to this day. As the African and Eurasian plates continue to push against each other, the Alps will continue to rise and change over countless millennia. In summary, the meeting of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates during the late Cretaceous Period ultimately led to the formation of the Alps. This dramatic collision was part of a larger orogenic process called the Alpide belt, which encompasses other notable mountain ranges around the world. The continued interaction between these two plates ensures that the Alps will remain a dynamic and evolving feature of our planet's landscape far into the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are different opinions on plastic and paper. Now let's follow the travels of 3 plastic bags. It begins at the grocery store with the customer's choice. Plastic Bag 1: As the waste engineer come by and pick up the trash, the first plastic bag falls out. It sits on a small street for a couple of hours until a car comes along and takes it down to the road. Then a gust of wind blows it across the road, then another car, then another gust of wind finally makes its way to the beach. Water fills the plastic bag and makes it look like a jellyfish. A seal  swims by, thinking it looks very interesting, and swallowed it. The plastic bag may stay in the seal's stomach for months, maybe years. You see, our lovely animals have been living thousands of years in a world where everything can be eaten. Plastic Bag 2: This bag does make its way to landfill . Before they have a chance to cover up the thousands of pounds of daily waste, a strong wind comes up and blows these plastic bags out of the landfill. Once the wind stops, workers will be sent to collect thousands of bags around. But they can't possibly get them all.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Lawrence Harvey Brown (born September 14, 1940) is an American basketball coach, who was most recently head men's basketball coach at Southern Methodist University. He is the only coach in basketball history to win both an NCAA national championship (Kansas Jayhawks, 1988) and an NBA title (Detroit Pistons, 2004). He has a 1,275-965 lifetime professional coaching record in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is the only coach in NBA history to lead eight different teams to the playoffs. He also won an ABA championship as a player with the Oakland Oaks in the 1968-69 season, and an Olympic Gold Medal in 1964. Brown won his first (and ultimately only) NBA Championship during his first year with the Detroit Pistons in 2004, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the 2004 NBA Finals. By doing so, Brown became the first, and so far only, man to coach teams to both NCAA and NBA titles. Brown is also the only NBA coach to take two different teams (76ers and Pistons) to the NBA Finals against the same opponent (Los Angeles Lakers in 2001 and 2004), lose the first time, and win the second.  Brown was also chosen as the head coach for the USA men's basketball team at the 2004 Summer Olympics which earned a bronze medal, a major disappointment. Brown was heavily criticized for publicly berating the players, for repeatedly criticizing the roster chosen by the player selection committee, and for insisting on a style of play which minimized the United States' advantage in athleticism.  In May 2005, rumors surfaced that Brown would become the Cleveland Cavaliers' team president as soon as the Detroit Pistons finished their postseason. The rumor, which was not dispelled by Brown, became a major distraction as the Pistons lost to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the 2005 NBA Finals.  On July 19, 2005, the Pistons, displeased with Brown's public flirtations with other teams, bought out the remaining years of Brown's contract, allowing him to sign with another team. A week later, on July 28, 2005, Brown became the head coach of the New York Knicks, with a 5-year contract reportedly worth between US50 million and 60 million, making him the highest-paid coach in NBA history. Was he expected to win a silver/gold?","output":"Brown was chosen as the head coach for the USA men's basketball team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, which earned a bronze medal, a major disappointment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The opening statement, \\"Probably the worst purchase I've ever made online,\\" further emphasizes the reviewer's dissatisfaction. 3. The use of a frowning emoticon \\":(,\\" reinforces the reviewer's negative feelings about the product. 4. The reviewer admits their mistake by stating \\"Totally my fault for buying based on appearance,\\" which highlights the product's failure to meet expectations. 5. The mention of \\"no real audible noise cancellation\\" and \\"poor sound quality\\" convey the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product's performance. 6. The reviewer complains about the small size of the product and the discomfort it causes, underlining the overall negative impression of the product. 7. The mention of the \\"uncomfortable foam/plastic\\" suggests poor quality materials used in the product's construction. 8.

Ferdinand Magellan ( or ; Portuguese: Fernao de Magalhaes, IPA: [fir'naw di maga'yajS]; Spanish: Fernando de Magallanes, IPA: [fer'nando de maga'yanes]; c. 1480 - 27 April 1521) was a Portuguese explorer who organised the Spanish expedition to the East Indies from 1519 to 1522, resulting in the first circumnavigation of the Earth, completed by Juan Sebastian Elcano. Born into a Portuguese noble family in around 1480, Magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer and was eventually selected by King Charles I of Spain to search for a westward route to the Maluku Islands (the \\"Spice Islands\\"). Commanding a fleet of five vessels, he headed south through the Atlantic Ocean to Patagonia, passing through the Strait of Magellan into a body of water he named the \\"peaceful sea\\" (the modern Pacific Ocean). Magellan was born in northern Portugal in around 1480, either at Vila Nova de Gaia, near Porto, in Douro Litoral Province, or at Sabrosa, near Vila Real, in Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. He was the son of Rodrigo de Magalhaes, Alcaide-Mor of Aveiro (1433-1500, son of Pedro Afonso de Magalhaes and wife Quinta de Sousa) and wife Alda de Mesquita and brother of Leonor or Genebra de Magalhaes, wife with issue of Joao Fernandes Barbosa.  In March 1505 at the age of 25, Magellan enlisted in the fleet of 22 ships sent to host D. Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of Portuguese India. Although his name does not appear in the chronicles, it is known that he remained there eight years, in Goa, Cochin and Quilon. He participated in several battles, including the battle of Cannanore in 1506, where he was wounded. In 1509 he fought in the battle of Diu. He later sailed under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in the first Portuguese embassy to Malacca, with Francisco Serrao, his friend and possibly cousin. In September, after arriving at Malacca, the expedition fell victim to a conspiracy ending in retreat. Magellan had a crucial role, warning Sequeira and saving Francisco Serrao, who had landed.  In 1511, under the new governor Afonso de Albuquerque, Magellan and Serrao participated in the conquest of Malacca. After the conquest their ways parted: Magellan was promoted, with a rich plunder and, in the company of a Malay he had indentured and baptized Enrique of Malacca, he returned to Portugal in 1512. Serrao departed in the first expedition sent to find the \\"Spice Islands\\" in the Moluccas, where he remained. He married a woman from Amboina and became a military advisor to the Sultan of Ternate, Bayan Sirrullah. His letters to Magellan would prove decisive, giving information about the spice-producing territories.  After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in Morocco, he was wounded, resulting in a permanent limp. He was accused of trading illegally with the Moors. The accusations were proved false, but he received no further offers of employment after 15 May 1514. Later on in 1515, he got an employment offer as a crew member on a Portuguese ship, but rejected this. In 1517 after a quarrel with King Manuel I, who denied his persistent demands to lead an expedition to reach the spice islands from the east (i.e., while sailing westwards, seeking to avoid the need to sail around the tip of Africa), he left for Spain. In Seville he befriended his countryman Diogo Barbosa and soon married the daughter of Diogo's second wife, Maria Caldera Beatriz Barbosa. They had two children: Rodrigo de Magalhaes and Carlos de Magalhaes, both of whom died at a young age. His wife died in Seville around 1521.  Meanwhile, Magellan devoted himself to studying the most recent charts, investigating, in partnership with cosmographer Rui Faleiro, a gateway from the Atlantic to the South Pacific and the possibility of the Moluccas being Spanish according to the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas.","output":"This text is about Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer who organized the Spanish expedition to the East Indies from 1519 to 1522.

She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food. In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus   kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops. Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri. The lab mainly works on genes  , the chemical \\"computer programs\\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering. Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes. That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified   foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry.

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.

Answer:","output":"The band that played a song called \\"Pink Turns to Blue\\" is Hüsker Dü, an American alternative rock band formed in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1979. The band consisted of three members: Bob Mould (guitar, vocals), Greg Norton (bass, vocals), and Grant Hart (drums, vocals). \\"Pink Turns to Blue\\" was written by Grant Hart, the band's drummer, and American musician. Hüsker Dü gained popularity in the early to mid-1980s, with a unique sound that blended punk rock, post-punk, and alternative rock. They were known for their fast tempos, melodic approach, and passionate, often introspective lyrics, which were quite different from other hardcore punk bands of that era. \\"Pink Turns to Blue\\" is a track from their critically acclaimed album \\"Zen Arcade,\\" released in 1984. The double album features 23 tracks and is often considered one of the best and most influential albums of its time. \\"Pink Turns to Blue\\" is a perfect example of Hüsker Dü's ability to create emotionally charged, catchy, and melodic songs. The song's lyrics deal with themes of love, loss, and change, which became common motifs in the band's music. Grant Hart, the songwriter of \\"Pink Turns to Blue,\\" played a pivotal role in the band as both a drummer and a singer. He shared songwriting duties with Bob Mould, and the two developed a unique dynamic where they would alternate between lead and background vocals. This helped in creating a distinctive sound that set Hüsker Dü apart from other bands during that period. Despite their significant contributions to the alternative rock genre, Hüsker Dü disbanded in 1988 due to personal and creative differences among the members. After the breakup, each member went on to pursue various projects. Bob Mould formed a new alternative rock band called Sugar, while Grant Hart formed a band called Nova Mob. Greg Norton left the music industry for a while and later played in various bands. Even after their dissolution, Hüsker Dü's influence still resonates in the world of alternative music. Many bands, such as Nirvana, Pixies, and The Smashing Pumpkins, have cited Hüsker Dü as an inspiration for their own music. The band's pioneering approach to combining punk rock with melodic elements and introspective themes had a lasting impact that continues to inspire generations of musicians and fans alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If your dog suffers from motion sickness, it is crucial to understand how to recognize the signs, make them more comfortable, and manage the symptoms. In this article, we will discuss how to assess whether your dog has motion sickness, tips for preventing nausea, and treatment options, including veterinary consultation and alternative treatments. Assessing Motion Sickness in Your Dog Dogs can experience motion sickness due to a variety of reasons, such as an underdeveloped balance system in puppies, stress, or inner ear issues. Signs of motion sickness in dogs can include: 1. Excessive drooling 2. Vomiting 3. Whining or excessive panting 4. Trembling or shivering 5. Lethargy or inactivity 6. Restlessness and uneasiness If you observe any of these signs in your dog while traveling, chances are they might be experiencing motion sickness. It is important to be prepared for your dog to be sick and bring along cleaning supplies such as paper towels, a trash bag, and disinfecting wipes. Making the Car More Comfortable One way to help your dog cope with motion sickness is to make the car as comfortable as possible. Place your dog in a spot in the car where they can see out, such as by a window or in the middle seat. This allows them to visually perceive the motion and reduces disorientation. Additionally, consider investing in a dog car seat or harness to keep your dog secure and further reduce anxiety. Consulting with Your Veterinarian If you suspect your dog is suffering from motion sickness, it is recommended to consult with your veterinarian. They can determine if your dog requires medication to manage their nausea and can suggest appropriate treatments. Your veterinarian may prescribe antiemetic or anti-nausea medications which can help make the journey more tolerable for your pet. Considering Alternative Treatments Apart from conventional medications, alternative treatments might be beneficial for your dog. These can include: 1. Ginger: Ginger has been known to alleviate nausea and vomiting in humans and could help your dog as well. Consult your veterinarian for proper dosing guidelines and preparation methods. 2. Acupressure: Applying gentle pressure to specific acupoints on your dog's body can help alleviate motion sickness. Seek advice from a certified animal acupressure practitioner for proper guidance. 3. Gradual desensitization: Slowly expose your dog to short car rides, gradually increasing the duration to build positive associations and decrease anxiety. 4. Pheromone sprays or diffusers: These products can help create a calming environment in the car and make the experience more pleasant for your dog. Conclusion Dealing with motion sickness in dogs can be challenging, but with the right approach and treatment, your dog can conquer its discomfort and travel with ease. Assessing your dog for motion sickness, creating a comfortable environment, consulting with your veterinarian, and considering alternative treatments are essential steps to ensure your dog's well-being during car rides. Always remember to consult with a professional before implementing any treatments or making significant changes to your dog's usual care.

(CNN) -- Tito Joseph \\"TJ\\" Jackson, who on Wednesday was named temporary guardian of Michael Jackson's three children, was inspired by his famous uncle to form a singing group with his brothers. TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, Donald Bohana was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, according to People magazine.

Legendary former Jets quarterback Joe Namath says he has health problems which he believes are the result of concussions suffered while playing in the NFL. In an upcoming interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Broadway Joe claims that head injuries from his gridiron days have taken a serious toll on his health. RELATED: JUDGE NIXES PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF 765M NFL CONCUSSION SETTLEMENT “I’ve been some through some things medically,” Namath told reporter Rita Braver. “I’ve seen some things on my brain. But I’ve had some treatment – and I’ve improved. \\"None of the body was designed to play football. Excuse me, you know, football, we’re just not designed for.” RELATED: NFL: TWO PLAYERS VIOLATED CONCUSSION PROTOCOL LAST WEEK Namath joins a growing list of former and current NFL players who’ve experience serious side effects from concussions, which have been linked to memory loss, dementia and the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), among other conditions. The NFL recently reached a 765 million settlement with more than 4,500 ex-players who filed sued against the league, only for a federal judge to nix the payout for being insufficient.

The tale is a convoluted one, and it involves one of Mueller's most vocal critics on the right, a self-identified lobbyist named Jack Burkman, reports CNBC. Multiple journalists told Mueller's office that they had been approached by a woman who said Burkman offered her about 20,000 “to make accusations of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against Robert Mueller,\\" according to her email to them, obtained by the Atlantic. The woman, who had previously worked for Mueller as a paralegal in the 1970s, said she had been approached by a man \\"with a British accent\\" making the offer on Burkman's behalf. Burkman, for his part, denies knowing the woman who sent the email to journalists. However, in a tweet, he promised to reveal the name of a woman Thursday who is a sex-assault victim of Mueller.

In 1978, Richardson moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and ran for the House of Representatives in 1980 as a Democrat, losing narrowly to longtime 1st District representative and future United States Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan (R). Two years later, Richardson was elected to New Mexico's newly created third district, taking in most of the northern part of the state. Richardson spent 14 years in Congress, representing the country's most diverse district and holding 2,000 town meetings.  Richardson served as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the 98th Congress (1983-1985) and as Chairman of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Native American Affairs in the 103rd Congress (1993-1994). Richardson sponsored a number of bills, including the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments, the Indian Dams Safety Act, the Tribal Self-Governance Act, and the Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act.  He became a member of the Democratic leadership as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milosevic.

Definition: In this task you will be given a list of integers. A list contains numbers separated by a comma. You need to round every integer to the closest power of 2. A power of 2 is a number in the form '2^n', it is a number that is the result of multiplying by 2 n times. The following are all powers of 2, '2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096'. If an integer is exactly in equally far from two different powers of 2 then you should output the larger power of 2. The output should be a list of integers that is the result of rounding each integer int the input list to the closest power of 2. The output should include a '[' to denote the start of the output list and ']' to denote the end of the output list. Input: [139, 103, 2232, 1067, 7, 44, 3, 249, 603, 3834, 1464, 7, 65, 2, 207] Output:","output":"Part  #1: Understanding the nature of input Usage: The input in the task will be a list of integers.

Part  #2: Rounding to the closest power of 2 Usage: In the task, each integer needs to be rounded off to the closest power of 2 like in the 2^n form. For instance, consider a single number, 139. The closest power of 2 to 139 is 128 (as 128 is 2^7), hence the 139 would round off to 128.  Part  #3: Equally far integers Usage: If an integer is equally far from two different powers of 2, you are expected to round up to the larger power of 2. For example, if the integer is 3, which is equally far from 2 (2^1) and 4 (2^2), it should be rounded up to 4, the larger power of 2. Part  #4: Formatting the output Usage: The output should be a list starting with '[' and ending with ']'. For example, if our rounded off integers are 128, 128, 2048, 1024, 8, 32, 4, 256, 1024, 2048, 1024, 8, 64, 2, 256, then this should be presented as [128, 128, 2048, 1024, 8, 32, 4, 256, 1024, 2048, 1024, 8, 64, 2, 256] according to the criteria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Relaxation: Exercising can eventually lead to relaxation, but it's not an immediate outcome as exercise generally leads to an increase in heart rate and release of endorphins. 2. Exhaustion: This could be a potential immediate outcome for some people, but not everyone will be exhausted right after exercising, especially if they have a good fitness level or if the exercise is light to moderate in intensity. 3. Energetic: Exercising can make you feel more energetic, but it's not a guaranteed immediate outcome for everyone. You might feel more alive and alert after a workout, but it doesn't exactly define the direct result of exercising. 4. Become stronger: Becoming stronger is a long-term outcome of consistent exercising, not an immediate result. 5. Use energy: This is the most suitable option as an immediate outcome of exercising. During exercise, your body uses energy to fuel muscle contractions, maintain balance, and perform other activities. So the answer is: use energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Putnam County, Missouri, was named for the American Revolutionary War general, Israel Putnam.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Putnam County, Missouri, was named for the American Revolutionary War general, Israel Putnam. The county was organized on February 28, 1845, and it chose to honor Israel Putnam, a notable figure not only in the American Revolutionary War but also in the French and Indian War.  Israel Putnam was born on January 7, 1718, in Salem Village, Massachusetts, and he became a well-known military figure during both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. In the French and Indian War, he demonstrated great courage and leadership in engagements such as the Battle of Fort William Henry. His heroism earned him the rank of lieutenant colonel in the British Army. During the American Revolutionary War, Israel Putnam continued to showcase his military skills and leadership. In 1775, he was appointed a major general in the Continental Army by George Washington. He is most famously known for his role in the Battle of Bunker Hill, wherein he reportedly ordered his troops, \\"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!\\" The battle, although a British victory, was a significant morale boost for the American forces due to the high casualties suffered by the British. Given Israel Putnam's contributions to the American Revolutionary War and his earlier military accomplishments, it is not surprising that a county in Missouri would choose to honor him by naming the county \\"Putnam County.\\" The county's seat, Unionville, further illustrates its commitment to honoring the nation's history, as the Union was the name adopted by the United States during the American Civil War, representing a connection to the country's past struggles and unity.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose words were assigned to a traditional song named \\"New Britain?\\" ?  When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847.

Write an article with the title: \\"Review: Sony's LocationFree TV no match for Slingbox\\" Article:","output":"Title: Review: Sony's LocationFree TV no match for Slingbox Introduction: Sony's LocationFree TV and Sling Media's Slingbox are both innovative products that aim to provide users with the ability to watch and control their home television content from any location with internet access. While both systems offer this core functionality, a comparison of the two reveals that Sony's LocationFree TV falls short in several key areas, making Slingbox the more superior option for most consumers.  1. Video Quality: The most important criterion for any streaming service is video quality, and here Slingbox clearly takes the lead. Slingbox users consistently report high video quality, thanks to the device's adaptive streaming technology, which optimizes the video stream according to the user's internet connection speed. In contrast, Sony's LocationFree TV suffers from frequent issues with low resolution, pixelation, and stuttering video playback, making for a less enjoyable viewing experience. 2. Platform Compatibility: Slingbox offers a more extensive range of compatibility options than LocationFree TV. It supports various platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS devices, ensuring that users have access to their content from virtually any device they own. On the other hand, Sony's LocationFree TV only supports a limited number of devices, including Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP), Windows-based PCs, and specific Sony-branded mobile devices, which significantly reduces its versatility and potential user base. 3. User Interface and Remote Control Functionality: Slingbox provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls, making it easy for viewers to navigate through channels and control their television content remotely. Additionally, Slingbox's virtual remote control accurately emulates the user's physical remote control, providing a familiar user experience. Sony's LocationFree TV, while featuring a functional interface, suffers from certain design limitations, such as small remote control buttons and less intuitive navigation, which can make it harder for users to control their content remotely. 4. Pricing and Value for Money: The overall cost of these devices can be a significant consideration for potential buyers. While both products have similar initial investment costs, the long-term value for money differs. Slingbox does not require any ongoing subscription fees and has no additional costs after the initial purchase. Conversely, Sony's LocationFree TV requires a separate purchase of the LocationFree Base Station, which adds to its total cost. Furthermore, some features such as remote DVR programming on LocationFree TV require additional subscription fees, making it a less economical choice compared to Slingbox. 5. Customer Support: While both companies offer customer support and product assistance, Sling Media's commitment to providing a top-notch customer experience gives it the edge over Sony's LocationFree TV. Slingbox users report prompt and effective help from the company's customer support team, along with regular software updates and a helpful online user community. In comparison, Sony's LocationFree TV users report more mixed experiences with customer support, some citing difficulties with product setup and software updates. Conclusion: While Sony's LocationFree TV attempts to rival Slingbox in the market for place-shifting television devices, it falls short in several important categories. With superior video quality, more extensive platform compatibility, a better user interface, greater value for money, and stronger customer support, Slingbox emerges as the more appealing choice for consumers seeking a reliable and enjoyable remote television viewing experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is our job to look for the best educational programs. One of the most important things of a good child care program or child day care is the teacher to child ratio  . It means that every student needs a certain amount of attention in order to grow and learn correctly.               It's for this reason that small-sized class in schools are leading to bigger and better opportunities. With smaller classes, each student is given personal attention when it comes to their class work, their personal health and their mental growth. When there are too many children in a class, individuals get lost in the crowd. They always couldn't get enough attention. When it comes to the educational result, they don't learn well because some are afraid to ask questions in front of so many people. Others become lazy for not having been attended by the teacher.               Some schools are overcrowded these days. Most children don't even get their basic educational work done in schools.

Beer The earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa 3500–3100 BC from the site of Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess Ninkasi, known as \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people, and the ancient advice (Fill your belly. Day and night make merry) to Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh, by the ale-wife Siduri may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer. The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike sake, mould was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting. Q: In what country was the earliest chemical evidence of barley beer found?","output":"The earliest chemical evidence of barley beer was found in western Iran."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Abraham Harold Maslow (; April 1, 1908 - June 8, 1970) was an American psychologist who was best known for creating Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs in priority, culminating in self-actualization. Maslow was a psychology professor at Alliant International University, Brandeis University, Brooklyn College, New School for Social Research, and Columbia University. He stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a \\"bag of symptoms.\\" A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Maslow as the tenth most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Maslow's thinking was original. Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. Humanistic psychology gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals' achieving them. The most famous of these was client-centered therapy developed by Carl Rogers.  The basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple: 1. Someone's present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future. 2. To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative. 3. Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person. 4. The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy.  Humanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud's theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow's Hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined positive psychology, is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders. Are there any others he considers higher needs?","output":"Yes, Maslow believes there are higher needs in his hierarchy. Remember, the idea is that people have different kinds of needs, and they have to fulfill the basic ones first before going to the higher ones. The basic needs are like the foundation of a pyramid, and the higher needs are at the top. Some of the higher needs include the need for love and belonging, the need for self-esteem, and finally, the need for self-actualization. Self-actualization is when someone becomes the best they can be and reaches their full potential. So, first, we need to take care of our basic needs, like food and safety, and then we can work on the higher needs to become the best version of ourselves!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You take a drink and there is less in the glass. You keep drinking and soon it is all gone. Good thing you have more to refill your glass. What if there would never be any more of your favorite drink. What would you do? Now you know the difference between renewable and non-renewable. Its too bad that many things here on Earth will run out. This includes some of our natural resources we depend on. Things like oil will not last forever. There is a limited supply. Someday, we will run out, so then what? At current rates of use, coal will last about 300 years. Petroleum will be used up in just a few decades.  Question: \\"Does the Earth have other none renewable resources we depend on other than oil?\\" Answer: \\"Yes\\" Is this answer correct? Choose from: +no. +yes....I think the answer is","output":"+yes. In addition to oil, our planet contains a wide range of non-renewable resources that humans heavily depend on. These are resources that do not naturally replenish within a human's lifespan, making them finite and limited. 1. Natural Gas: A form of fossil fuel that is commonly used for heating and generating electricity. It is a significant contributor to energy supply. 2. Coal: Despite increasing intents to move away from coal due to environmental concerns, it remains one of the main sources of energy for electricity generation globally. It has a relatively more abundant reserve compared to oil, but it is still finite. 3. Metals: Metallic minerals like iron, gold, silver, copper, and aluminium are all non-renewable resources. Once all the deposits are mined, they will not be replaced. 4. Uranium: This radioactive metal is used in nuclear power plants to generate electricity. 5. Peat: This is a deposit of decayed vegetation or organic matter that is burned for heat. 6. Sand: It might seem surprising, but sand is a non-renewable resource and human use, especially for construction, exceeds its natural regeneration rate. 7. Phosphorus: Essential for agriculture, this is a critical ingredient for fertilizers to support crop growth. Once mines run out, it will be difficult to grow crops at the current rate. In short, aside from oil, the Earth has numerous non-renewable resources that we heavily rely on. The sustainability challenge of our era is figuring out how to transition from these non-renewable resources to more renewable and sustainable alternatives before these resources get depleted. This may mean adopting different types of renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy. It may also involve developing more efficient methods of resource use, recycling, and moving towards a circular economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To provide deeper context, the four bronze horses you are referring to are known as the Horses of Saint Mark, which are believed to date back to late antiquity (circa 2nd to 4th century AD). These are a major historic and artistic landmark associated with the Basilica of Saint Mark in Venice, Italy. Throughout history, the horses have been moved and relocated several times. They were initially believed to have been placed in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul, Turkey), and then were transferred to Venice in 1204 AD after the city's forces looted Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. The horses were then mounted on the Basilica's façade as a symbol of Venetian power and prestige. During Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion in 1797, the horses, along with other art treasures, were taken to Paris as spoils of war. Thanks to their immense historical and artistic value, the horses were eventually returned to Venice following Napoleon's defeat in 1815.

(WXYZ) - Three teens are locked up and facing felony charges in what police in Genesee County are calling a possible school shooting plot.      The teens charged include 15-year-old Lamarr Michael Dukes of West Bloomfield. The other two teens are 15-year-old Cody Anthony Brewer of Wolverine Lake and 18-year-old Ryan William Stevens of Linden.      Stevens is a former student at the schools.      Stevens is being held in the Genesee County Jail. Because of their ages, Dukes and Brewer are being held in the Genesee Regional Detention Center in Flint.      They have been charged with Conspiracy to commit first-degree premeditated murder and False report or threat of terrorism.      They face up to life in prison if convicted on all charges. Investigators say the teens used Instagram to hatch their plan.      Officials say the alleged plot came to light on October 28, when Argentine Township police intercepted information about a plot to carry out a shooting at Linden High School and Linden Middle School. Both facilities are located in Argentine Township.      The information was forwarded to the FBI on October 29. At that point, steps were also taken to make sure the schools were safe.      Police say the suspects were then identified and information was obtained about the purchase of firearms and possible targets of the plot.      All three teens have been charged as adults. We've learned their probable cause hearing is scheduled for Thursday.      Linden schools has issued the following statement about the case: ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Three teenagers in Michigan got into big trouble because they planned to hurt many people at two schools. They talked about their plan on a website called Instagram, where people usually share pictures and videos. The police found out about their plan and stopped them before they could hurt anyone. The three teenagers are now facing serious criminal charges, which means they might have to go to jail for a long time. The people in charge of the schools and the police are working together to make sure everyone stays safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hypothesis: People are drinking at a large rectangular table. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The two statements describe different scenarios. Let's analyze the differences in detail: 1. Shape of the table: In the premise, the table is described as a \\"large circle table,\\" meaning it has a round shape. On the other hand, the hypothesis mentions a \\"large rectangular table,\\" which means the table is shaped like a rectangle. Since the shapes of the tables are different, this is a contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis. 2. Arrangement of people: The premise states that \\"people are sitting around a large circle table,\\" likely referring to a continuous, circular arrangement. In the hypothesis, it states, \\"people are drinking at a large rectangular table,\\" and no specific arrangement of people is mentioned; they could be sitting at the long sides of the table, around the entire table, or even standing. The arrangement of people is not consistent in the premise versus the hypothesis. 3. Objects on the table: Both the premise and the hypothesis mention that the participants have drinks, but the premise specifically describes \\"small bowls\\" in front of them as well, whereas the hypothesis does not mention any bowls. This difference also distinguishes the two scenarios from each other. In conclusion, since the information specified in the premise does not directly support or validate the scenario described in the hypothesis, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.

Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor ( KAN-tor; German: ['geoRk 'feRdinant 'lu:tvIc 'fIlIp 'kantoR]; March 3 [O.S. February 19] 1845 - January 6, 1918) was a German mathematician. He invented set theory, which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics. Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers. Cantor's 1874 Crelle paper was the first to invoke the notion of a 1-to-1 correspondence, though he did not use that phrase. He then began looking for a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points of the unit square and the points of a unit line segment. In an 1877 letter to Richard Dedekind, Cantor proved a far stronger result: for any positive integer n, there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an n-dimensional space. About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind: \\"Je le vois, mais je ne le crois pas!\\" (\\"I see it, but I don't believe it!\\") The result that he found so astonishing has implications for geometry and the notion of dimension.  In 1878, Cantor submitted another paper to Crelle's Journal, in which he defined precisely the concept of a 1-to-1 correspondence and introduced the notion of \\"power\\" (a term he took from Jakob Steiner) or \\"equivalence\\" of sets: two sets are equivalent (have the same power) if there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between them. Cantor defined countable sets (or denumerable sets) as sets which can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the natural numbers, and proved that the rational numbers are denumerable. He also proved that n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn has the same power as the real numbers R, as does a countably infinite product of copies of R. While he made free use of countability as a concept, he did not write the word \\"countable\\" until 1883. Cantor also discussed his thinking about dimension, stressing that his mapping between the unit interval and the unit square was not a continuous one.  This paper displeased Kronecker, and Cantor wanted to withdraw it; however, Dedekind persuaded him not to do so and Weierstrass supported its publication. Nevertheless, Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A man and another person in shadow watch a street parade at night.\\", is the sentence \\"it is sunny\\" a true sentence? Options are: * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","output":"The sentence \\"it is sunny\\" cannot be inferred with certainty or determined as a true statement based on the information provided in the initial sentence: \\"A man and another person in shadow watch a street parade at night.\\" Let's break down why this is the case. First, let's consider the setting as described in the context-giving sentence. It specifically indicates that the event is taking place at night. Generally, nighttime is characterized by the absence of sunlight, as the sun has set below the horizon. With the sun being the primary source of light during daytime, its absence during nighttime implies that it is not sunny during the time when the two persons are watching the street parade. Next, let's take into account the possible options provided to evaluate the truth of the sentence \\"it is sunny.\\" *Option 1: Yes.* If we accept the statement as truthful, we would essentially be disregarding the information conveyed in the first sentence. It would imply that the sun is shining when, in reality, the setting provided contradicts this assertion. It would not be an accurate conclusion based on the available data. *Option 2: It is not possible to tell.* This option implies a level of ambiguity or lack of sufficient information to determine the truthfulness of the sentence \\"it is sunny.\\" While there may be scenarios or contexts where the available information could be deemed insufficient, in this particular case, the first sentence explicitly informs us that the events are unfolding at night, thus making it clear that it is not sunny. *Option 3: No.* Based on the initial information given, this is the most accurate option. At night, when the sun is below the horizon and not illuminating the sky, we cannot deem the sentence \\"it is sunny\\" as truthful. Nighttime inherently negates the notion of it being sunny, consequently making the statement false. In conclusion, based on the sentence \\"A man and another person in shadow watch a street parade at night,\\" the sentence \\"it is sunny\\" is not a true statement. Option 3: \\"no,\\" stands as the most accurate response, given the information provided in the context-establishing sentence."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.  - A V engine, or Vee engine is a common configuration for an internal combustion engine. The cylinders and pistons are aligned, in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in a \\"V\\" when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. The Vee configuration generally reduces the overall engine length, height and weight compared to an equivalent inline configuration.  - A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft. Most banks are set at a right angle (90°) to each other, some at a narrower angle, with 45°, 60°, and 72° most common.  - A W8 engine is an eight - cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . The W8 can be imagined as flat plane crank V8 engine combining two narrow - angle ( 15 degree ) VR4 engine blocks , mounted juxtaposed at 72 degrees to each other and coupled to one crankshaft . Nearly square external dimensions mean the large eight - cylinder engine will fit in the space typically taken by a V6 engine .  - Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles.  - A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2.0 L to 4.3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine. Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. It is becoming more common as the space allowed for engines in modern cars is reduced at the same time as power requirements increase, and has largely replaced the inline 6, which is nearly twice as long - too long to fit in many modern engine compartments - and the V8, which is larger, more expensive, and has poorer fuel economy. The V6 engine has become widely adopted for medium-sized cars, often as an optional engine where an inline 4 is standard, or as a standard engine where a V8 is a higher-cost performance option.  - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons.  - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach.  - A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. (Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the long axis of the vehicle, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front.)  - In an internal combustion engine of the reciprocating type, the crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft. The enclosure forms the largest cavity in the engine and is located below the cylinder(s), which in a multicylinder engine is usually integrated into one or several cylinder blocks. Crankcases have often been discrete parts, but more often they are integral with the cylinder bank(s), forming an engine block. Nevertheless, the area around the crankshaft is still usually called the crankcase. Crankcases and other basic engine structural components (e.g., cylinders, cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and integrated combinations thereof) are typically made of cast iron or cast aluminium via sand casting. Today the foundry processes are usually highly automated, with a few skilled workers to manage the casting of thousands of parts.   - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards.  - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion.  - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

Background: James Thomas Fallon was born in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York on September 19, 1974, the son of Gloria (nee Feeley) and James W. Fallon. He is of German, Irish, and Norwegian descent. His paternal grandmother, Luise Schalla, was a German immigrant from Osterholz-Scharmbeck, while one of his maternal great-grandfathers, Hans Hovelsen, was a Norwegian immigrant from Fredrikstad. Another set of great-great-grandparents were Thomas Fallon, an Irishman from County Galway, and Louisa Stickever, the daughter of an Irishman born in France and his Irish wife. Context: Fallon married film producer Nancy Juvonen, co-owner of production company Flower Films, on December 22, 2007. After meeting on the set of Fever Pitch, the two began dating in May 2007. Fallon proposed in August 2007 with a Neil Lane-designed engagement ring, at sunset on the dock of Juvonen's family home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. They were married four months later. They have two daughters. They have a female English cream Golden Retriever named Gary Frick that has appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.  On June 26, 2015, Fallon suffered a ring avulsion, an injury he suffered by tripping over a rug in his home and catching his wedding ring on a counter top which nearly tore off his finger. He was taken to the emergency room and then sent to a surgeon who performed microsurgery on his finger. Fallon spent 10 days in the ICU before going home. He discussed this on the July 13 episode of the Tonight Show and thanked the doctors and nurses who helped him. As of July 14, 2015, he was expecting to spend another eight weeks without any feeling in his finger. In an interview with Billboard magazine in September 2015, Fallon explained that his finger still had limited mobility and that another surgery would be required. He reiterated this point at the 67th Emmy Awards on September 20, 2015, where he appeared in public without his finger bandaged for the first time.  On November 4, 2017, Fallon's mother, Gloria Fallon, died from undisclosed causes at age 68 at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan, New York. Scheduled taping of the following week's Tonight Show episodes were canceled. One week later, Fallon paid tribute to his mother following that night's monologue, becoming emotional and calling her \\"the best audience\\". Question: Does he have any children?.

Summarize this article: If you determine — through a macronutrient calculator — that you currently eat more than 30 grams of carbs daily, look for ways to decrease your carb intake. It’s crucial to avoid carbs on a ketogenic diet, as carbs easily convert into glucose, which keeps your body from burning ketones for energy.  You should only receive about 5–10% of your daily calories from carbohydrates, by eating about 20 – 30 grams a day.  Focus on getting your carbs through salad greens and non-starchy vegetables only. Avoid carb-heavy foods like pasta and bread. Protein is a necessary part of your diet, and without proteins, you will have very little energy. You may also feel hungrier or develop food cravings throughout the day. However, too much protein will diminish the weight-loss effects of a ketogenic diet.  You should aim to consume about 25 – 30% of your daily calories from proteins.  The amount of protein you eat will vary depending on how much protein you require as an individual. This is often tied to lifestyle, whether active or sedentary. Fats are the cornerstone of the ketogenic diet, and will encourage your body to burn fatty ketones for fuel. Typically, calories from fat should comprise 80 – 90% of your meals. (However, you cannot eat unlimited fats on a ketogenic diet; the calories can still add up and cause weight gain.) Examples of fatty foods include:  Organic butter and lard Coconut oil Fatty cuts of organic, grass-fed meat. Egg yolks and full-fat sour cream Homemade mayonnaise Heavy whipping cream and cream cheese Avocados and bacon Nuts and nut butters Unlike many other weight-loss diets, you do not need to actively keep track of the number of calories in the dishes you eat while on a ketogenic diet. Since a ketogenic diet reduces food cravings throughout the day, you’ll likely be less motivated to eat excess calories anyway.  If you do want to track your calories, use the following breakdown as a guide (assuming that you’ll consume about 1,500 calories a day):  1,050 calories from fat 300 calories from protein 150 calories from carbohydrates Once your body is in ketosis, your kidneys will begin to release excess water which your body had been retaining. This retained water is a consequence of a high-carb diet, and once you reduce your carb intake, water retention will decrease as well.  As a consequence, you may need to increase your daily water intake to avoid dehydration. Headaches and muscle cramps are a sign of dehydration. You may also need to increase mineral intake, especially salt and magnesium, as these are often lost when your body gets rid of retained water. Summary:","output":"This article is about a special diet called the ketogenic diet. To follow this diet, you need to eat very few carbs (like bread and pasta), some protein (like meat), and lots of healthy fats (like avocado and nuts). It's important to not eat too many carbs because they turn into sugar in your body, which stops it from burning fat for energy. Eating the right amount of protein is also important because it gives you energy and helps you feel full. When you follow this diet, your body burns fat for energy and you might lose weight. You don't need to count calories, but you may need to drink more water and eat more salt and magnesium, because your body will lose some when you stop eating many carbs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation of clouds blocking sunlight while acid rain is causing damage can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process.  To better understand this, let's analyze the process and how the clouds can affect it: 1. Acid rain makes waters acidic: Clouds blocking sunlight doesn't have a direct impact on the formation of acid rain, as acid rain is primarily caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from burning fossil fuels that combine with water molecules in the atmosphere. 2. Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil: When waters become acidic, they are more capable of leaching aluminum from the soil. While sunlight isn't directly involved in this chemical process, prolonged periods of cloud cover can indirectly affect soil temperature and moisture levels, potentially influencing the absorption process. 3. The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc: Clouds blocking sunlight may indirectly influence the rate of water evaporation and, thus, alter the amount of water runoff entering aquatic systems. However, the acidification of water due to the presence of acid rain remains unaffected. 4. Fish and their eggs die: Clouds blocking sunlight can have an indirect effect on fish and their eggs by affecting the temperature of the water and altering the oxygen levels in it. Cooler water temperatures can cause fish to become less active and more susceptible to the harmful effects of acid rain. 5. Frogs and plants die: Sunlight plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, which is essential for plant growth. Blocking sunlight can weaken plants, making them more vulnerable to damage caused by acid rain. Similarly, frogs and other amphibians that rely on aquatic environments and plants for habitat may face additional stress due to the reduced availability of food and shelter, making them more susceptible to the harmful effects of acid rain. 6. Insects and other wildlife die: The indirect effect of sunlight blocking on the rest of the ecosystem is a cascading consequence of the stress and damage experienced by fish, frogs, and plants. This can further weaken the food chain, making insects and other wildlife more susceptible to the effects of acid rain. 7. The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems: With the ecosystem already in distress due to acid rain, the additional stress of sunlight blocking can compound these effects and further throw the ecosystem out of balance. In conclusion, clouds blocking sunlight can worsen the damage caused by acid rain by indirectly impacting various steps in the process. While sunlight does not have a direct role in the chemical process of acid rain formation and its immediate consequences, the blocked sunlight affects the overall health and resilience of the ecosystem being harmed by acid rain, making it more vulnerable to damage and imbalance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The comical-sounding phrase made its first appearance back in October, when 17-year-old Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug - who calls herself Ruby - said she had attended \\"bunga bunga\\" parties with other women at Mr Berlusconi's villa in Milan. Italian newspapers immediately scrambled to find out its origins. The finger of blame was initially laid upon Mr Berlusconi's friend Col Muammar Gaddafi, with allegations of parties hosted by the Libyan leader involving \\"harems\\" of young Western women. Then stories circulated claiming the phrase owed its origins to a bawdy joke, which Mr Berlusconi claimed was one of his favourites. Then this week Sabina Began, German actress and friend of the Italian prime minister, told Sky Italia that she herself was bunga bunga. \\"'Bunga bunga' is simply my nickname,\\" the 36-year-old said. It's a credible-sounding explanation: \\"Began\\" and \\"Bunga\\" are not so different, and the repetition gives it a more informal, nickname-like quality. \\"Everyone thinks: 'My God! What does that mean?\\" she is quoted as saying. Ms Began went on to explain that it was she who had organised the parties for Mr Berlusconi. The phrase \\"bunga bunga\\", is having a global impact, says Paul JJ Payack, president of The Global Language Monitor in the US. \\"One of our databases that searches the top global media found almost 800 stories spread across the world. \\"Since Mr Berlusconi was reported as saying that he learned harem-style rituals frοm hіѕ friend, Col Gaddafi, the phrase has been reported in Arabic-language news stories. \\"On our Chinese search engines there were over 2000 references to news stories in Chinese. \\"Finally, we found thousands of references in Russian. \\"Will it make the English language lexicon? It certainly seems headed that way. It needs a minimum of 25,000 references with the necessary depth and breadth. It currently has 744,000 references on Google.\\" Global Language Monitor The expression has quickly become part of the Italian vocabulary, says Italian journalist Annalisa Piras, even though no-one really knows what it means. The theory that it features in Mr Berlusconi's favourite joke is a popular one, she says. The joke isn't new - it can be found on the internet Urban Dictionary - but in Italy it has been given a political twist. It goes like this: Two of Mr Berlusconi's political opponents are captured by an African tribe. They are asked whether they would prefer to die or undergo bunga bunga. The first one opts for bunga bunga, and is immediately subjected to a sexual assault by members of the tribe. The second one, who now grasps what \\"bunga bunga\\" means, says he would prefer to die. To which the chief of the tribe replies: \\"Okay, you will die - but before you will have bunga bunga.\\" Ms Piras says the term is now well embedded in the Italian language. \\"Bunga Bunga City\\" refers to  Mr Berlusconi's world, the phrase is a popular twitter hashtag, and it even inspired a song performed on Italian television to the tune of Shakira's Waka Waka World Cup anthem. In Italy, \\"bunga bunga\\" is pronounced: BOONG-guh BOONG-guh (-oo as in moon, -ng-g as in finger, -uh as a in ago, stressed syllables in upper case). Source: BBC Pronunciation unit The phrase itself is not new. One of the oldest recorded references dates back to 1910 and another African-themed joke. The infamous Dreadnought hoax was dreamed up by aristocratic joker Horace de Vere Cole, who contacted the British Admiralty pretending to be the Emperor of Abyssinia. He informed officials that he wished to inspect the Home Fleet while on a forthcoming visit to Britain. After enlisting some friends - artists from the Bloomsbury group, including writer Virginia Woolf - to masquerade as his entourage, he turned up at the navy's state-of-the-art ship, the Dreadnought. Officials, taken in by the dark stage make-up, false beards and oriental regalia, treated the group to an official civic reception. They were reported to have cried \\"Bunga, bunga!\\" while marvelling at the ship. An account of the visit plus a picture were sent to the Daily Mail newspaper - probably by Cole himself. Virginia Woolf said later that when the real Emperor of Abyssinia arrived in London weeks later, wherever he went, ''the street boys ran after him calling out bunga, bunga!\\" When I went on board a Dreadnought ship I looked like a costermonger; They said I was an Abyssinian prince 'Cos I shouted 'Bunga Bunga!' Source: The Sultan of Zanzibar: The Bizarre World and Spectacular Hoaxes of Horace de Vere Cole, Martyn Downer The term reappeared at the end of World War I, after HMS Dreadnought sank a German submarine. According to retired Royal Navy captain Jack Broome - in his book Make Another Signal - the congratulatory telegram read: \\"BUNGA BUNGA\\". The Dreadnought hoax is certainly not the inspiration for the current use of the phrase - but Mr Berlusconi may intend the phrase to have African connotations, says Tony Thorne, editor of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang. \\"The sound of it is crude and infantile. It is almost like a racist Africanism - some kind of colonial imagined tribal ritual of sexual abandon,\\" he says. \\"It has a racist, imperialist quality to it - like a phoney African word, like 'wonga'. \\"It's so naughty and childish, it goes very nicely with the image that I think Mr Berlusconi wants to cultivate, as comic and absurd.\\" Ms Piras says that usage of the phrase in Italy has brought to a new level Mr Berlusconi's image as \\"jester-in-chief\\". \\"He has managed to capture in a slogan the imagination of many of his male compatriots, and the utter contempt of almost every Italian woman.\\" The phrase \\"bunga bunga\\" exists in other languages - in Filipino, it is slang for something \\"hot\\" or fashionable, in Indonesian it means flowers. But, for now, it has an association with the Italian prime minister and the current political scandal - or \\"bunga bunga-gate\\", if you will.

Please answer this question: Which city is in the Chao Phraya River delta?","output":"The city located in the Chao Phraya River delta is Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. Bangkok, officially known as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon in Thai, is a vibrant urban metropolis and the most populous city in the country, with a population of over 10 million people. The Chao Phraya River is a significant geographical feature of the city, providing essential water resources and transportation routes for both local residents and tourists. The Chao Phraya River, which means \\"The River of Kings\\" in Thai, originates in the north of Thailand, where the Ping and Nan rivers converge, and flows through the central plain for approximately 372 kilometers (231 miles) before emptying into the Gulf of Thailand. The river delta is an extensive area of tidal mudflats, mangroves, and agricultural land, which supports diverse ecosystems and is crucial for rice production in the region. As the main river running through Bangkok, the Chao Phraya River plays a vital role in the city's history, culture, and economy. Bangkok was established as the capital city of Thailand by King Rama I in 1782 and was deliberately positioned near the Chao Phraya River to take advantage of its strategic location for transportation, commerce, and defense. Over time, the city expanded across both banks of the river, utilizing its natural resources to support the growing population and economy. Today, the Chao Phraya River continues to be an essential part of Bangkok's daily life and serves as a major transportation artery for both people and goods. Traditional water taxis and ferries, as well as modern river boats and express boats, ply the river, providing convenient public transportation for commuters, tourists, and local residents alike. The river also facilitates the transportation of cargo, contributing significantly to Bangkok's economic activities. Apart from its practical importance, the Chao Phraya River is home to numerous culturally and historically significant sites, such as the iconic Grand Palace and Wat Pho (the Temple of the Reclining Buddha), both of which are located on the eastern bank of the river. Additionally, the riverside is lined with various luxury hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues, offering picturesque views of the city and the river. In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the ecological preservation and sustainable development of the Chao Phraya River delta. Through various conservation efforts and policies aimed at controlling pollution and preserving natural habitats, Bangkok and the Thai government are working towards ensuring a sustainable future for the river, its delta, and the millions of residents and visitors who depend on its myriad benefits."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

He enjoyed the tranquility and familiar comfort that his personal space provided to him after a long day at work. Being an introvert, he found solace in the company of his cat, Mr. Whiskers, who had been his furry companion for the past five years. The room, filled with soft music, scented candles, and an array of James' favorite books, was his haven away from the stresses of the outside world. [I] One could say that James' room is a peaceful sanctuary where he can recharge his batteries and reflect on the day's events without any distractions. The soft, calming colors of the walls, combined with the dim, warm lighting, create an atmosphere that instantly puts him at ease. Even the presence of his sleeping cat, purring gently on a cozy blanket beside him adds to the serenity that surrounds him. His room is not only organized but also adorned with little trinkets from his travels - a small wooden carving from Bali, a miniature Eiffel Tower from Paris, and a vibrant painting he bought at a local market in Mexico. Each item brings back memories of joyful moments that bring a warm smile to his face. This peaceful refuge allows James to focus on his hobbies, such as painting and reading, without feeling the pressure of external expectations. [II] On the other hand, while the neighborhood itself is peaceful, with tree-lined streets, well-maintained gardens, and neighbors who conscientiously maintain a considerate noise level, it doesn't provide the same level of comfort and familiarity as his room does. While taking a walk in the neighborhood can be refreshing for some people, James finds it mentally draining. During these walks, James feels obligated to have small talks with neighbors or encounters things that remind him of the everyday mundaneness that he wants to escape. The neighborhood, despite its quiet and friendly nature, often entails unpredictable encounters and a lack of control over the environment. For instance, the occasional barking of a neighbor's dog could break the silence without warning, or the sudden chatter from a group of joggers passing by could dispel the peace he is seeking. These external factors make it challenging for James to find the same solace that his room offers. In summary, while both James' room and the neighborhood may be peaceful in their ways, the comfort and personalization of his room allows James to feel secure and at ease more than the neighborhood does. His room, with its serene ambiance, cherished possessions, and a loyal companion in Mr. Whiskers, is a reflection of his personality and a place for him to recharge his energy. Meanwhile, the neighborhood, though peaceful and visually appealing, lacks these comforting factors and, thus, isn't as effective in offering James the relaxation he desires."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you say \\"In its wake, a much smaller shadow descended much faster. “Sarasa-sama!” Tobashi shouted.\\" in Spanish?","output":"\\"In its wake, a much smaller shadow descended much faster. “Sarasa-sama!” Tobashi shouted.\\" can be translated into Spanish as: \\"A su paso, una sombra mucho más pequeña descendió mucho más rápido. “¡Sarasa-sama!” Gritó Tobashi.\\" Let's take a closer look at the translation process: \\"In its wake,\\" can be translated into Spanish as \\"A su paso,\\". Here, we use the Spanish preposition \\"a\\" (in) and \\"su\\" (its) to denote the possession of the wake, along with \\"paso\\" which literally means \\"step\\" but in this context it would mean \\"wake\\". In Spanish, instead of using \\"wake\\", \\"paso\\" is used to convey the same meaning. \\"A much smaller shadow\\" is \\"una sombra mucho más pequeña\\". \\"Una\\" is the indefinite article that corresponds with \\"a\\", \\"sombra\\" translates to \\"shadow\\", \\"mucho más\\" means \\"much more\\" and \\"pequeña\\" means \\"smaller\\".  \\"Descended much faster.\\" is translated as \\"descendió mucho más rápido.\\" Here, \\"descendió\\" is the past tense of the Spanish verb \\"descender\\" (to descend), conveying the same past action as in the English sentence. \\"Mucho más\\" is used again for \\"much more\\", and \\"rápido\\" is the Spanish word for \\"faster\\". “Sarasa-sama!” remains same in the translation as it appears to be a name or title. \\"Tobashi shouted.\\" is \\"Gritó Tobashi\\". In Spanish, the verb often precedes the noun, especially in sentences like this. \\"Gritó\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"gritar\\" (to shout), and \\"Tobashi\\" remains same as it is a name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: obama admits he erred in deal with developer Text:","output":"Title: Obama Admits Mistake in Deal with Developer Former President Barack Obama recently admitted that he made an error in his past dealings with a real estate developer. The admission comes as further details surrounding the controversial transaction become more publicly known, raising questions about the legitimacy of the deal. During his early political career, Obama entered into an agreement with a notorious Chicago developer, whose background in some questionable business practices had already garnered a negative reputation. Despite this, Obama chose to proceed with the deal, convinced by the potential benefits it could bring to his local community. As the details of the arrangement unfolded, it became apparent that the developer's intentions were not entirely aligned with Obama's vision of revitalizing the community. The developer took advantage of the agreement, engaging in unethical activities and ultimately, delivering far less than what was initially promised. Reflecting on this issue, Obama expressed his regret at not having been vigilant enough with the actions of the developer. He acknowledged that he was naive at the time and that, in hindsight, his decision to enter into the deal with the disreputable developer was an error in judgment. Moreover, President Obama emphasized that he took valuable lessons from this experience. He stated that the situation acted as a wake-up call, highlighting the importance of conducting thorough background checks and exercising careful scrutiny when entering into agreements with private entities. The former president's admission of his error in this real estate deal serves as a testament to his character and willingness to take accountability for his actions. Despite the negative publicity surrounding the developer and the deal in question, Obama's candid self-assessment reveals his commitment to maintaining a culture of openness and honesty. Moving forward, Barack Obama's experiences serve as a cautionary tale, not only for politicians but also for anyone involved in contractual agreements or collaborations with private entities. The need for diligence, thorough research and critical evaluation of potential partners cannot be overstated, as these factors can be crucial in preventing future mishaps and preserving one's reputation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer:","output":"William Webster was an English Australian politician who was born on 7 June 1860 in Everton, Lancashire, England. He later moved to Australia and was active in politics, playing a significant role in the early years of the Australian Parliament. As a politician, William Webster was a member of two political parties during his career. Initially, he joined the Labor party (1901-1917) and later switched to the Nationalist party (1917-1919). He represented the constituency of Gwydir in the Australian Parliament. Webster's career in the parliament began on 16 December 1903 when he succeeded George Cruickshank. His term as a constituency MP lasted until 13 December 1919 when he was succeeded by Lou Cunningham. Apart from his political involvement, William Webster was also known for being a Unionist, supporting the rights of workers and trade unions. His dedication to the cause likely influenced his political stances and decision-making during his time in office. In his personal life, William Webster was married to Jane Buckney. The couple likely settled in Australia and formed a life together there. Webster eventually passed away at the age of 76 on 3 October 1936. His death took place in Parramatta, Sydney, leaving behind a legacy as a committed politician and advocate for workers' rights. Overall, William Webster's life can be described as one of service and dedication to both his country and the people he represented.

Context: I was about 14 and lived near a large tract of undeveloped land where people would go and park to fool around. There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". The answer is:","output":"Grohl"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Thousands of teenagers will be able to move to a new wave of \\"studio schools\\" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK. Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms. Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \\"line manager\\". The reforms   are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers   believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place. The Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19. The government said all subjects would be taught \\"through projects, often prepared with employers\\" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19. They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications   connected directly to the needs of local employers. Answer:","output":"Which of the following statements about the new \\"studio schools\\" in the UK is accurate? A. Teenagers can move to the studio schools only at the age of 16, focusing on traditional academic subjects. B. Studio schools are designed to act as a bridge to the workplace and help reduce the number of NEETs (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). C. Students will not be required to participate in work placements as part of their curriculum. D. The schools will not coordinate with local employers and will not offer professional qualifications specific to the needs of the job market. Answer: B.

They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes.

Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture.

After months of anticipation and anxiety, the day had finally arrived for Neil to undergo a groundbreaking medical procedure designed to rectify the damage caused by a severe spinal cord injury. His good friend and highly-specialized surgeon, Dr. Nick Holden, had been chosen to perform the critical operation. Dr. Nick Holden was known as one of the best in his field, and he had spent countless hours developing a revolutionary new technique that he believed had immense potential to change the lives of countless patients. Driven by his desire to make a difference in people's lives, his many years of research and practice had culminated in this moment, where he would have the chance to test his method on his dear friend Neil. The atmosphere in the operating room was electric, as the team of skilled medical professionals assembled to support Dr. Nick in this groundbreaking procedure. The air was filled with a mix of excitement and hope. Neil had been preparing himself mentally for months, and he knew that if anyone could succeed in helping him regain his mobility, it was his good friend Dr. Nick. Upon entering the operating room, Neil could sense the collective breath of determination from the medical team. As the nurses and surgical assistants prepped Neil for the surgery, Dr. Nick's calm demeanor seemed to reverberate throughout the room, assuaging any lingering fears that may have been present. It was clear that he had prepared diligently, not only for the surgery itself but also for the unique challenge of operating on a close friend. The intricate procedure started, with Dr. Nick meticulously leading the team as they navigated the delicate surgery. Hour by hour, they implanted the sophisticated nanotechnology into Neil's spinal cord, all the while carefully repairing any collateral damage from the procedure. The tension in the room subsided as the minutes ticked by and Dr. Nick's confident hands danced through the complicated series of movements necessary to complete the operation. When the final suture was placed and the last instrument was laid to rest, Dr. Nick's eyes met those of the experienced nurse who had assisted him throughout the surgery. A slow, knowing smile spread across both of their faces, as they shared a moment of pride and satisfaction in their job well done. The entire medical team could sense that they had just witnessed a historic operation. As Neil was carefully wheeled into the recovery room, Dr. Nick followed closely behind in silence, his mind already racing ahead to the next phase of recovery and rehabilitation for his friend. Neil's recovery process was long and arduous, but he never lost hope. Under the watchful care of Dr. Nick, he witnessed himself making surprising progress. The nanotechnology embedded in his spinal cord began to form new connections, slowly but surely restoring his motor function. With every passing day, he felt stronger, and his confidence grew. As Neil took his first steps after the surgery, he knew a new chapter in his life had begun. The bond between him and Dr. Nick had only strengthened through this process, and they had both gained something invaluable: the gift of hope and the knowledge that innovative medical breakthroughs could truly change lives. Dr. Nick's procedure had indeed achieved flying colors, paving the way for countless other patients to experience its life-altering benefits. As news of the successful operation spread, Dr. Nick and his groundbreaking technique received international recognition. Yet, most important to both Neil and Dr. Nick was the reminder that their enduring friendship and trust in one another had turned a dream into reality. In the end, it was not only Dr. Nick's profound medical expertise but his unwavering belief in the power of innovation and friendship that enabled Neil to embark on this incredible journey toward a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After receiving unusual phone messages from Ophanimon (one of the three ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and Cherubimon) Takuya Kanbara, Koji Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto, Tommy Himi, and Koichi Kimura go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World. Summoned by Ophanimon, the Digidestined realize that they must find the ten legendary spirits and stop the forces of Cherubimon from physically destroying the Digital World. After finding the ten spirits of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon, Grumblemon, Ranamon, and Arbormon, they finally end up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. After the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal Knights—Dynasmon and Crusadermon—from destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical Lucemon. Ultimately the Digidestined fail in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the Real World.

This article: Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96 was an attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work.

The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \\"try and stay away\\" from the Justice Department, but \\"at some point, I...

This action rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.

Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. Voldemort first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he is only mentioned. Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has \\"the power to vanquish the Dark Lord\\". Voldemort does not appear in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, although his presence and actions are felt: he once again declares war, and begins to rise to power once more. He murders Amelia Bones of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Emmeline Vance.  Rowling uses several chapters as exposition to establish Voldemort's backstory. In a series of flashbacks, using the pensieve as a plot device, she reveals that Voldemort was the son of the witch Merope Gaunt and a Muggle called Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child's birth, soon after which Merope died, just hours after giving birth. After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts. Riddle was outwardly a model student, but was in reality a psychopath who takes sadistic pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him. The book also discusses Riddle's hatred of \\"Muggles\\", his obsession with Horcruxes, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality. Rowling stated Voldemort's conception under the influence of a love potion symbolises the prejudicial circumstances under which he was brought into the world.  In the main plot of the book, Voldemort's next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to attack Dumbledore. This is accomplished by Draco Malfoy, who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school. The cabinets allow Voldemort's Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered. Hogwarts professor (and re-doubled agent) Severus Snape uses the Killing Curse against Dumbledore when Draco could not force himself to do so. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Can you provide me with a little information on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince?","output":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a book where Lord Voldemort, the bad guy, is not seen but his actions are felt. In this book, he starts a war and tries to hurt more people. We also learn about Voldemort's past, like how he was born and grew up in an orphanage before going to a magical school called Hogwarts. In this story, Voldemort's followers, called Death Eaters, manage to get inside Hogwarts, and there is a big fight. At the end of the book, a teacher named Severus Snape uses a very bad spell on Dumbledore, an important and kind character in the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: And the choice for the most powerful post in the EU of a man so blatantly unsuitable for the job is just another symptom of how we are now looking at an increasingly dysfunctional vanity project which is destroying itself from within. Misty morning on Wint Hill in Somerset: the Met Office’s long-term forecasts are often inaccurate Met Office model is sunk by its own data We are familiar with how consistently the Met Office has, in recent years, been getting its seasonal and medium-term weather forecasts so spectacularly wrong. We recall that soaking “barbecue summer” of 2009; their “warmer than average” December 2010, which turned out to be the coldest on record; last year’s “drier than average winter”, which led to the wettest January ever; and many more. In January 2013, I was writing about the “forecast the Met Office hoped you wouldn’t see”, after it had, on Christmas Eve, tried to smuggle out a wholly new version of its computer prediction in 2011 that, over the following five years, global temperatures would rise by 0.8C, greater than the entire net rise in the past century. The Met had amended this, without explanation, to show that the current 17-year “pause” in warming might continue for years to come. Its latest embarrassment, picked up by various climate blogs, led by Die kalte Sonne in Germany, is also worth noting. In 2007, when global warming hysteria was at its height, the foremost US scientific journal, Science, published a paper from a team led by Dr Doug Smith, the Met Office Hadley Centre’s head of “Decadal Climate Prediction”, entitled “Improved surface temperature prediction for the coming decade from a global climate model”. Smith’s computer had shown how temperatures would rise between 2004 and 2014: its central prediction being that the world would heat up by 0.3C, possibly even as much as 0.5C, and that four of the five years after 2009 would break the 1998 record as “the hottest year ever”. What Die kalte Sonne had spotted was that now we are able to compare that computer prediction with what actually happened, as measured on the Hadley Centre’s own Hadcrut temperature record. Overlaying a graph of the real data on those predictions from 2007, it can be seen how, in the past 10 years, average temperatures have slightly fallen. Not one of the past five years has beaten that 1998 record. One reason this is significant, as I noted last year, is that it yet again confirms how seriously the Hadley Centre’s forecasting strategy has been skewed – by the way its computer models are programmed to assume that a steady rise in CO2 levels must inevitably lead to rising temperatures. This is the core reason why it has been getting all those forecasts of “hotter summers” and “drier winters” so dismally wrong. A second point of concern is that the same unquestioned assumption has been allowed damagingly to reshape the energy policy of so many governments, above all our own. Yet, such is the power of group-think, not one of our leading politicians, from Barack (“the science is settled”) Obama down, has had the independence of mind to question that flawed assumption. A third lesson that might emerge from this is that we should recognise that the Met Office’s blind acceptance of this scientific error has – in view of the disastrous influence it exerts on public policy – become a national scandal. In that popular buzz-phrase, the Met Office, for which we pay £200 million a year, has shown itself to be “not fit for purpose”. Yet never, by politicians or even the media, has there been any proper attempt to call it to account. Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Met Office's Inaccurate Temperature Predictions: A National Scandal\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The answer to the question: Whose film score dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance? is inside the article: Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \\"Have a Cigar\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here\\".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\"Comfortably Numb\\": \\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\\" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, \\"Jugband Blues\\": \\"I'm most obliged to you for making..., can you guess it ?

The water that my mom bought was not enough to fill the fish bowl because the  Options: A). water was to little.; B). bowl was to little.;","output":"The water that my mom bought was not enough to fill the fish bowl because the water was too little. This situation can occur due to various reasons; perhaps my mom had underestimated the amount of water required to fill the fishbowl, or she might have miscalculated the fishbowl's dimensions. Regardless of the cause, the outcome remained the same: an insufficient amount of water to accommodate the fish and support their well-being. Let's look at each option in more detail. A) The water was too little. One reason for the water amount being too little could be that the purchased water was not the right volume. Fish require a specific volume of water depending on their species, size, and number, in order to promote a healthy environment and ensure their physical and mental well-being. Water quality and quantity are critical factors in maintaining healthy conditions within a fish habitat. An inadequate amount of water can lead to a rapid deterioration of water quality, causing stressed and unhealthy living conditions for the fish. The amount of water must also be sufficient enough to facilitate the natural biological filtration process, which helps in eliminating harmful substances such as ammonia, nitrite, and nitrates. If my mom had bought distilled water or a specialized water treatment solution, it's essential to understand that the purchased volume should be adequate to provide for the requirements of the fish. Moreover, creating a stable environment that simulates the natural habitat for the fish should entail a proper balance between water volume, temperature, pH, and other critical factors. B) The bowl was too little. While the initial issue revolves around the insufficient amount of water, it is also worth considering the possibility of the bowl itself being too small for the fish. A small fishbowl imposes various limitations that may affect the fish's health and overall well-being, such as the lack of space for swimming, inadequate surface area for oxygen exchange, and a greater likelihood of rapid water contamination. Smaller bowls tend to lack the necessary resources to accommodate essential aquarium equipment such as heaters, filters, and air pumps. These devices play a crucial role in maintaining a stable environment and keeping the water quality within safe parameters, ensuring that the fish thrive in their habitat. Conclusively, having the right amount of water in an appropriately sized bowl is crucial for the overall health, happiness, and longevity of the fish. It's essential for anyone who intends to keep fish as pets to take into account all aspects of fish care, including investing in the right-sized fishbowl and providing a sufficient amount of water. By doing so, we can offer our aquatic pets a loving and healthy home, while also enjoying the beauty and tranquility they bring into our lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Austin is in the process of stealing valuables from Tracy's purse without her consent. In this situation, several potential outcomes could occur for Tracy depending on various factors. Here is a detailed analysis considering different possibilities: 1. Emotional consequences: Initially, Tracy might be shocked and devastated to see her possessions being taken away by Austin. She might feel a mix of feelings, including betrayal, anger, fear, and sadness. This event can lead to a sense of insecurity, especially if it occurred in a place she considered safe, and might create trust issues. 2. Financial loss: Depending on the type and value of the items in her purse, Tracy could face considerable financial losses. If her purse contained cash, credit cards, and other valuables - like jewelry or a smartphone - the theft's immediate financial impact could be significant. This loss might result in her temporarily struggling to make ends meet or even facing more long-term financial stress. 3. Identity theft risk: One major concern for Tracy would be if her personal identification documents, such as a driver's license, social security card, or passport, were also in the purse. In this case, having this sensitive information in the hands of a thief puts her at risk for identity theft, which can take a long time to rectify and cause additional damage to her financial and emotional well-being. 4. Possible disruption of routine: Depending on the contents of her purse, Tracy might have to take care of tasks like replacing her stolen phone, canceling and reissuing credit cards, reporting her lost IDs to the relevant authorities, informing her bank and other relevant institutions about the theft, getting a new purse, and replacing any other essential items in her purse. These tasks can ultimately cause inconvenience and disrupt her daily routines.  5. Social consequences: Given the context, it is not clear whether Austin and Tracy have a personal relationship or if this incident is the act of a stranger. If Austin is a friend, family member, or acquaintance, this event would negatively impact their relationship going forward. In this case, Tracy would likely reconsider her association with Austin, reevaluate her trust, and possibly avoid any future contact. If Austin is a stranger, Tracy may still feel heightened fear and anxiety in public spaces, possibly affecting her social interactions. 6. Legal repercussions: Depending on the circumstances and how Tracy chooses to approach the situation, there could be legal implications for both the victim and the perpetrator. Tracy may decide to report the theft to the police and press charges against Austin, leading to potential criminal charges and a lengthy legal process. This legal action can result in both expected and unexpected ramifications for Tracy, such as additional stress, time consumed in the legal proceedings, and potential dissatisfaction with the outcome. In conclusion, the specific events that might unfold after Austin's theft of valuables from Tracy's purse are uncertain. However, it is clear that Tracy would suffer various hardships, including emotional distress, financial loss, disruption in her daily life, potential legal pursuits, and possible negative social impacts. Each of these consequences would vary based on numerous factors, such as the value of stolen possessions, the relationship between Tracy and Austin, and Tracy's decisions about how to handle the aftermath of the theft."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The smooth-cheeked butcher known as \\"El Ponchis,\\" the target of a manhunt since October, was busted this week as he tried to flee Mexico with his big sister to their stepmother's home in San Diego, authorities said. He worked as a hit kid for a savage Mexican drug operation, the cartel of the South Pacific, until he was nabbed at a Mexican airport late Thursday. The pubescent thug was reportedly abetted by his 16-year-old sis - who dumped victims' headless bodies on streets and freeways in Cuernavaca, a source told The Associated Press. Other reports indicated the young killer used his sister as a decoy to lure his victims. They collected 3,000 per murder. The boy, identified by authorities only as Edgar, confessed his role in the gruesome killings to reporters at the Mexican attorney general's office, declaring that his first taste of homicide came at age 11. \\"I participated in four executions, but I did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't, they would kill me,\\" he explained yesterday in a cool voice. After he apologized for the slayings, reporters asked the youth what he would do if released. \\"I'll go on the straight and narrow,\\" he promised. \\"I'll work in anything else except this.\\" The alleged teen killer - whose nickname is Spanish for \\"The Cloaked One\\" - was born in San Diego in July 1996, according to Mexican officials. He had been picked up with a half-dozen other gang members in October, but released by military forces who were duped by his youthfulness. Mexican media reports indicated he had dodged capture by authorities four times since then - including a narrow escape last weekend in a Mexican Army raid at a strip club called Fantassy. The reputed assassin, whose existence was considered more rumor than reality by many, was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt when he was apprehended. He and his sister are suspected of working for Julio (El Negro) Padilla, who is fighting for control of the cartel once headed by drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva. The leadership void came after Beltran Leyva was killed last year by Mexican Marines. El Ponchis and his sibling already had plane tickets when they were taken into custody, with the sister saying their mother had sent money to cover the cost. A third sibling traveling with them was not linked to the cartel or the killings, authorities said. What was this article about?","output":"This article, originally published on December 3, 2010, describes the apprehension of a 14-year-old, American-born contract killer nicknamed \\"El Ponchis\\" in Mexico. The young boy admitted to committing four drug-war decapitations while working for a Mexican drug cartel called the South Pacific. He claimed to have been drugged and coerced into carrying out the murders, starting at the age of 11. His 16-year-old sister allegedly aided him in disposing of the headless bodies of his victims in Cuernavaca. El Ponchis was arrested near a Mexican airport, as he attempted to flee to San Diego along with his sister. The siblings were suspected of working for a drug lord named Julio Padilla, who was in a power struggle over the cartel leadership after the previous leader, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in 2009. El Ponchis and his sister were apprehended before they could board a plane. A third sibling with them was not implicated in the crimes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Saints, the Jets flew to Land Shark Stadium for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with their AFC East rival, the Miami Dolphins.  New York immediately trailed as the Dolphins took the game's opening drive and capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown run from running Ronnie Brown.  The Jets immediately responded with rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to newly acquired wide receiver Braylon Edwards.  Afterwards, Miami closed out the opening quarter with a 35-yard field goal from kicker Dan Carpenter.  In the second quarter, New York took the lead as kicker Jay Feely got a 40-yard and a 43-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, both the Jets and the Dolphins would get involved in a back-and-forth fourth quarter.  Miami opened up the period with quarterback Chad Henne hooking up with tight end Anthony Fasano on a 2-yard touchdown pass, while New York got a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Thomas Jones.  The Dolphins would immediately respond as Henne threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr., but Jones came through again with a 3-yard touchdown run.  Late in the game, Miami managed to crack through the Jets' defense as Brown got a 2-yard touchdown run.  New York tried to rally, but Sanchez's last-second hail mary pass was knocked away. How many yards longer was Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown compared to Ronnie Brown's first touchdown?","output":"Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown was a 53-yard pass, while Ronnie Brown's first touchdown was a 1-yard run. To find out how many yards longer Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown was, you can subtract the yards of Ronnie Brown's touchdown from Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown. So, 53 (yards by Ted Ginn) - 1 (yard by Ronnie Brown) = 52 yards. Ted Ginn, Jr's touchdown was 52 yards longer than Ronnie Brown's first touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the given equation -32120*m + 871 = -32053*m for m, follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the terms containing m on both sides of the equation.  On the left side, the term is -32120*m. On the right side, the term is -32053*m. Step 2: Move all the terms containing m to one side of the equation. To do this, add 32053*m to both sides of the equation, effectively isolating the m terms to one side of the equation. -32120*m + 32053*m + 871= -32053*m + 32053*m This simplifies to: -67*m + 871 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 871 from both sides of the equation: -67*m + 871 - 871 = 0 - 871 This simplifies to: -67*m = -871 Step 4: Divide both sides by -67 to solve for m. m = (-871) / (-67) Now, calculate the value of m: m ≈ 13 So, the solution to the equation -32120*m + 871 = -32053*m is m ≈ 13."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Outside the fire and away from everyone else, Don does a little research and finds out that the man was a thief who stole a large amount of gold valuables from a church and hid them in a building in East St. Louis. The two decide to drive there, thinking they can get there, get the gold, and get back in one day. While looking around in the abandoned building, they are spotted by a gang, led by King James (Ice-T), who is there to execute an enemy. Vince and Don witness the murder, but give themselves away and only manage to force a stalemate when they grab Lucky (De'voreaux White), King James' half-brother. Barricading themselves behind a door, they continue trying to find where the gold is at.

Brian lived in a suburb in the city. (ii). Matthew lived in a suburb in the city.","output":"Brian always drank from fresh coconuts unlike Matthew because, unlike his friend, Brian was fortunate to live in an exotic location where coconut trees were abundant and commonly found in his surroundings. This provided him with easy access to fresh coconuts which he enjoyed regularly. Matthew, on the other hand, lived in a suburb in the city where fresh coconuts were harder to come by, as they needed to be transported from other places, leading to a decrease in freshness and potentially higher prices due to transportation costs. In addition to their differing living environments, Brian's exposure to the tropical climate and local culture shaped his preference for fresh coconuts as a natural and healthy source of hydration and nutrients. Not only were they a resource that could be readily harvested from his own backyard, but they also became a part of his daily routine, embodying the essence of living closer to nature. This lifestyle provided Brian with the opportunity to consume coconuts that had not gone through any packaging or processing, which meant that he was consuming them at their most natural and beneficial state. Matthew, living in a city suburb, was more likely to experience limited access to fresh coconuts as well as a lack of familiarity with the practice of consuming them regularly. Supermarkets and grocery stores in urban areas might stock coconuts, but they are not always guaranteed to be fresh or equivalent to the quality of those from their natural source. Additionally, the culture and lifestyle in city suburbs do not usually encourage or emphasize the consumption of fresh coconuts as it does in tropical regions. Furthermore, city dwellers like Matthew may have less awareness regarding the benefits of drinking directly from fresh coconuts, and might opt more readily for bottled coconut water or other packaged varieties that can easily be found on store shelves. This convenience, though it offers a level of accessibility, does not provide the same nutrient-rich experience as the fresh coconuts Brian was able to enjoy. Furthermore, it should also be mentioned that Brian's preference for fresh coconuts stemmed not only from geographical factors but may also have been influenced by a personal inclination towards choosing healthier, more organic, and environmentally-friendly sources of nutrition and hydration. This preference would be further reinforced by his living conditions that provided ample opportunities to connect with nature and understand the value of wholesome food sources. Meanwhile, Matthew's city-based lifestyle may have contributed to his drinking choices being different from Brian's, due to the prominence and reliance on processed and packaged products. In conclusion, Brian always drank from fresh coconuts unlike Matthew because of the differences in their living environments, cultural influences, accessibility to fresh coconuts, and personal preferences shaped by their surroundings. While Brian enjoyed the luxury of fresh coconuts right from the source, Matthew had to navigate an urban landscape where fresh coconuts were not as easily available, often resulting in alternative choices to find coconut-based hydration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who was in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band? is inside the article: After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City. Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow-up to \\"Positively 4th Street\\", but Dylan was already shaping his next album, the third one that year backed by rock musicians., can you guess it ?

Step 2: Analyze what happens during an explosion An explosion occurs when there is a rapid release of energy, often accompanied by a loud noise, heat, and the release of gases. Step 3: Determine which gas is given off when the beach ball explodes We know that a beach ball contains gas, but it is not specified which type of gas. However, most beach balls are usually inflated with air, which is a mixture of several gases like nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor. Step 4: Evaluate the possible results of the explosion Since a beach ball is not a high-pressure container and is made of light materials (usually plastic or rubber), it will likely not have a violent explosion. The gas inside the beach ball (air) would be released quickly, perhaps causing the ball to pop or tear. Step 5: Answer the question If a beach ball explodes, the gas given off would be mostly nitrogen and oxygen, as well as small amounts of other gases present in the air.

The bullet hit the agent in the foot and was later found a few feet away, police said.      No one else was hurt during this incident, according to authorities.      The gun went off at Terminal A near the security checkpoint for gates 70 to 129. News 6 spoke with a woman who was waiting for her flight just a few feet away when it happened.      \\"I was a little taken back that nobody was moving,\\" Jenny Fulks said.

They were right.      A federal agent had accidentally shot himself in the left foot, having somehow dislodged his holstered pistol and pulling the trigger while grasping for the weapon.      It happened on the busy ticketing and departure floor in the multistory atrium at the Hyatt Regency, the noise sounding like a large board falling on tile flooring.      The agent, wearing a vest and T-shirt depicting an American flag and the word “PROUD,�? and the overall scene remained calm for several minutes.

Dozens of guns seized at Orlando airport this year »      Several Transportation Security Administration officers stepped out from their screening stations, then two Orlando police officers arrived. They calmly approached and then questioned the man who would later be treated for a gunshot.      He did not appear to be in distress, but the scene began to draw attention from throngs of passengers and airport workers. At 40 minutes before noon, the crowd passing through the nearby security check was lighter than earlier in the morning.      Ultimately, a mass of law enforcement converged, including an Orlando police officer on a bike and another in plain clothes, and Homeland Security officers.      Police there said the man, with a shaved head and gray goatee, was an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent from Kansas City on vacation.      The immigration agency did not respond to a request for comment.

Question: Process: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion -   Question: suppose more digestion occurs happens, how will it affect LESS digestion occuring.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the steps and consider what would happen if more digestion occurs and how it would affect less digestion occurring. Step 1: Saliva breaking down chemicals in food - If more digestion occurs at this stage, it could mean more enzymes are present in the saliva, allowing for a more efficient breakdown of food.  Step 2: Tongue and teeth breaking down food - If more digestion occurs at this stage, it could mean the food is being chewed more thoroughly and broken down into smaller particles.  Step 3: Esophagus - If more digestion were to occur in this stage, it could indicate that food moves through the esophagus more efficiently or quickly, allowing for quicker transit to the stomach. Step 4: Stomach - If more digestion occurs in the stomach, it could mean that gastric juices and muscle contractions work more effectively in breaking down food. Step 5: Intestines - If more digestion occurs in the intestines, it could indicate that the absorption of nutrients and remaining digestion processes work more efficiently. Now, considering the question: If more digestion occurs, how will it affect LESS digestion occurring? Answer: B: less If more digestion occurs, it implies that the digestive system is working more efficiently and effectively in breaking down food and absorbing the necessary nutrients. In this scenario, LESS digestion occurring would be negatively affected, as the overall digestive process has improved and become more efficient in comparison to a less efficient (or less digesting) scenario."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston.

Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\"  Question: \\"What agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston?\\" Answer: \\"NLAP\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Select from:  (1). no;  (2). yes;","output":"(2). yes; The correct answer is \\"yes.\\" The paragraph states that NLAP (Neighborhood Legal Assistance Program) used a 50,000 LSC (Legal Services Corporation) grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston.

What is the answer for the question: What does the butler's ex wife ask The Lone Wolf to do? from the following article ?  In 1947, Inspector Garvey of Scotland Yard suspects Michael Lanyard, the reformed jewel thief known as \\"The Lone Wolf\\" is behind the theft of the priceless diamonds called the \\"Eyes of the Nile\\". Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen.  Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily  (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom.  Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton, Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard. At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed Lanyard. When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone. Woolerton claims Robards pushed him out of the car on the outskirts, and said he suspects Lanyard was the murderer.","output":"In the given article, the butler's ex-wife, actress Iris Chatham, does not directly ask The Lone Wolf, Michael Lanyard, to do anything. However, we can infer that she has some intentions based on her actions. Iris invites Lanyard to the theater that night, where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscott family. This could be an attempt to keep Lanyard away from the ongoing plans and manipulations that involve Robards stealing the Eyes of the Nile for her. To provide more context, Iris Chatham has left her former husband, Henry Robards (the butler), and run off with Monty Beresford, who financed the stage production that made her a star. Robards is heartbroken and wants to reconcile with her. Iris, however, demands something from him first. This something seems to be the priceless diamonds, the Eyes of the Nile, which Robards steals from Lanyard's packet of jewels. Iris Chatham may have asked Lanyard to stay away from the Kelmscotts to avoid any interference with her and Robards' plan to obtain the Eyes of the Nile. This is supported by the fact that soon after, Robards dies mysteriously with the jewels still in his possession, but the Eyes of the Nile missing. Ultimately, the butler's ex-wife, Iris Chatham, doesn’t have a direct request for The Lone Wolf. Instead, she indirectly manipulates the situation and keeps Lanyard away from the Kelmscotts to ensure her and Robards' plan to steal the Eyes of the Nile goes as smoothly as possible."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For preparing for the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in commerce, it is important to choose a book that provides comprehensive coverage of relevant topics and follows the syllabus prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). One highly recommended book for this purpose is \\"Trueman's UGC NET Commerce\\" by Parveen Kataria, Anshu Kataria, and M. Shivani. This book has been widely acclaimed for its extensive content, self-explanatory language, and question papers from previous years. Another good option for preparing for the JRF in commerce is \\"UGC NET/JRF/SLET Commerce for Paper 2\\" by Dr. L. K. Jha. This book offers a thorough analysis of various topics and a systematic approach to mastering the subject. It also covers the latest syllabus as prescribed by the UGC, making it an excellent resource for candidates. Apart from these books, it is also beneficial to refer to the National Testing Agency (NTA) website for subject-specific study materials, practice tests, and sample questions. Additionally, it is recommended to regularly read updates on commerce and economics from relevant academic journals and published papers to keep abreast of the latest developments in the field. Remember, consistent practice and proper time management are crucial for success in the JRF examination. Second question: The software of the advanced system optimizer's register number. Advanced System Optimizer is a software utility program designed to optimize the performance of your computer by cleaning, maintaining, and securing the system. It is developed by Systweak Software, a well-known company in the field of software development. The \\"register number\\" you are referring to is most likely the license key or registration code required to activate the full version of Advanced System Optimizer. If you have purchased the software, the license key or registration code should have been emailed to you from the manufacturer after successful purchase. If you have misplaced the key, you can contact the Systweak support team for assistance in recovering your registration information. It is essential to note that sharing, distributing, or using pirated license keys is illegal and unethical. It is always recommended to purchase the software from a reliable source to support the developers and enjoy continuous updates and support. Answering the question \\"are these two questions asking the same thing?\\":  a). no. These two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is inquiring about the best book for preparing for the JRF in commerce, while the second question is asking for the software of Advanced System Optimizer's register number (which likely means the license key or registration code).

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the King of France? ?  Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.

UPDATED:. 08:09 EST, 23 October 2012. Ceefax will take its final bow tonight as the beloved text service succumbs to the final stage of the UK's switch to digital television broadcasts. The world's first teletext service will finally end after 38 years on the BBC when Olympic champion Dame Mary Peters switches off analogue transmissions in Northern Ireland. As the corporation prepared to finally pull the plug on the service, the Plain English Campaign announced a lifetime achievement award for its 'clarity' and use of 'everyday words' One of the very last pages from Ceefax to air on BBC Two: The service will finally be switched off in Northern Ireland tonight after 38 years of broadcasts on the BBC. Former prime minister Sir John Major said it would be 'much missed' and could be 'proud of its record' of offering an 'instant window on the world'. Launched September 23 1974, Ceefax gave viewers the chance to check the latest headlines, weather forecasts and TV listings in a pre-internet era where the only alternative was to wait for the next bulletin to be aired. Initially developed by BBC engineers looking for ways to transmit subtitles, Ceefax was made possible by exploiting 'spare lines' in the analogue television signal that broadcast encoded information. Its first editor was veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, a former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer who initally updated 24 news pages himself by feeding punch tape into machines. Old school: Launched September 23 1974, Ceefax gave viewers the chance to check the latest headlines, weather forecasts and TV listings in a pre-internet era.

The. launch of the UK's digital television signal, which can carry much more. information, and the announcement of the staged switch-off of the. analogue TV signal tolled the death knell for the service. Popular: Audience figures peaked in the Nineties when Ceefax had 20million users who checked it at least once a week. Unprecedented: The full service included recipes for dishes prepared on BBC cookery programmes, share prices, music reviews, Blue Peter project how-to's and an annual advent calendar. The service's first editor was veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, a former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer who initally updated 24 news pages himself by feeding punch tape into machines. End of an era: Special broadcasts will tonight mark the end of the Ceefax service. BBC Northern Ireland and UTV will tonight screen a simulcast reviewing the era of analogue TV and Dame Mary Peters - 1972 Olympic gold medallist in the pentathlon - will push the button ending the transmission at 11:30. These days when online journalists want to publish stories, all they have to do is click a button on screen to make a story live and viewable by readers all across the planet. By comparison, the early days of Ceefax proved anything but hi-tech. Journalists at the BBC Newsroom would monitor stories coming in on the wires, and when a story was to be updated they would type at a production terminal to create a Ceefax page. Then they had to produce a yard-long punched tape before running down two flights of stairs to the BBC's Central Apparatus Room and load into a reader which actually transmitted the pages. After returning to the news room they checked for mistakes. If, at that point, a spelling mistake was found the journalist had to go through the whole process again. Viewers can check Ceefax itself during the evening to see a special graphics countdown on page 100. Meanwhile BBC weather presenters will pay tribute to the service by using Ceefax-type pixelated maps on the forecasts. The Plain English campaign also paid tribute to the service with a lifetime achievement award recognising its commitment to communicating information to viewers as quickly and clearly as possible. Responding to the accolade Steve Herrmann, editor of the BBC News website, said: 'It is an honour for us to receive this lifetime achievement award, and it stands as a tribute to all the journalists who have worked on the service over the years, and the care they have taken in writing every story.' Former prime minister Sir John Major, who has previously told how he checked Ceefax pages to keep up to date with cricket scores between Downing Street meetings said the service will be 'much missed'. 'At moments of high pressure - with little time for detailed examination of the news - Ceefax headlines offered an instant window on the world,' he said. 'From breaking global news to domestic sports news, Ceefax was speedy, accurate and indispensable. It can be proud of its record.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

The answer to the question: In what year did the song Symfonin reach top of the Swedish singles charts at the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts? is inside the article: Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The song \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman reached the top of the Swedish singles charts in 1990 after participating in Melodifestivalen, the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts. Although the song finished last in the competition, it still managed to achieve significant domestic record sales, demonstrating the impact of the competition on the Swedish music industry. Melodifestivalen has been responsible for propelling the careers of many popular Swedish artists, not just limited to the winners, and has become an iconic event in the Swedish entertainment scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It all ended in smiles, but when Sydney Sixers opener Riki Wessels was cracked in the head by a 144.7 km/h delivery in his side’s Big Bash match there was a sharp intake of breath all around the Adelaide Oval. The tragic death of Australian batsman Philip Hughes last November when he was struck in the head by a similar ball from fast bowler Sean Abbott is still fresh in the memory, and since then there has been a lot of debate and controversy over the kind of helmets being used today. In this instance Wessels’ helmet did its job. The 29-year-old was struck on Saturday night by a bouncer from Adelaide paceman Kane Richardson in the fourth over with the ball getting lodged between the peak of his helmet and the protective face grill. Scroll down for video. Riki Wessels gets hit in the head by a 144.7 km/h bouncer from bowler Kane Richardson. Wessels tried to take evasive action but couldn't get out of the way in time. The Sydney Sixers opener spins away after getting struck but there's no sign of the ball. Wessels soon realises where the ball is - lodged in the grill of his helmet. Wessels kissed his helmet in relief immediately afterwards and he was only half joking when he did it. Richardson’s 144.7 km/h delivery was pitched straight at him and the ball was heading directly for his forehead. Only the protective grill saved him from serious injury, so it was no wonder he was thankful. Wessels had even more reason to be grateful as he came in for more punishment just a few overs later when he was struck again on the helmet by a Shaun Tait delivery. Sealed with a kiss: Wessels gratefully kisses his helmet after it did its job. Adelaide's Richardson comes over to check Wessels' welfare after hitting him with the delivery. In the same match retiring fast bowler Brett Lee showed there was still life in the old dog yet after one of his trademark blistering deliveries smashed Craig Simmons' bat. The 38-year-old Sydney Sixers star will retire at the end of his side's Big Bash campaign, but he stunned Adelaide's Simmons with a 149km/h yorker in the opening over, snapping his bat in two.

Given the question: Cells cannot survive without oxygen, and air contains oxygen. Given these facts, what helps cells survive among the following options: - DNA  - all copper  - air  - space  - RNA  - coat  - heat  - gasoline The answer is:","output":"Air. Air is the most critical element among the given options that helps cells survive. This is because air contains oxygen, which is an essential component for the survival and functioning of cells. The other options provided, such as DNA, RNA, copper, space, coat, heat, and gasoline, do not directly supply the cells with the vital oxygen they need for their survival. Oxygen is needed for cellular respiration, a process through which cells generate energy for their various functions. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, where glucose and oxygen react to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water. ATP is the source of energy that cells rely on to perform their necessary functions such as growth, repair, and reproduction. Without a continuous supply of oxygen, this process would be brought to a halt, and the cells in an organism would ultimately die. Air comprises around 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, and 1% other gases, such as argon and carbon dioxide. The oxygen in the air is transported to cells through the process of respiration in organisms. In the case of humans, for example, air is inhaled through the mouth or nose and then passes through the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles before reaching the alveoli in the lungs. Here, the oxygen in the air diffuses into the bloodstream through tiny capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin within red blood cells. These oxygen-carrying red blood cells are then pumped throughout the body by the heart, delivering oxygen to each cell. Although DNA and RNA are essential molecules in cells, they are not directly responsible for the delivery or supply of oxygen. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) encodes the genetic information required for the development, function, and reproduction of living organisms, while RNA (ribonucleic acid) acts as a messenger, transferring genetic instructions from DNA to protein-producing organelles called ribosomes. Copper, coat, heat, and gasoline are unrelated to the supply of oxygen to cells. Copper is an essential trace element involved in numerous biological processes, but it does not directly provide oxygen for cellular respiration. A coat is an external item that may keep an organism warm, but it does not contribute to oxygen delivery. Heat is essential to maintain an optimal body temperature for enzyme activity but does not supply cells with oxygen. Gasoline is a fuel used in combustion engines and is not essential for cell survival. In conclusion, air is the primary factor among the given options that enables cells to survive. It provides the necessary oxygen required for cellular respiration and the production of energy in the form of ATP, which cells rely on for their essential functions. The other options, while important in their own right, do not directly supply cells with the vital oxygen they need to survive."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Where was Hebrew used for studying Biblical texts in their original language before Yale?\\" is in \\"Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Almost 250 different fires started in Yellowstone and the surrounding National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed \\"Black Saturday\\", more than 150,000 acres (610 km2) were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted as far away as Billings, Montana, 60 miles (97 km) to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6 km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over 200 feet (61 m) high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) a day, and there were even occasions when more than 2 miles (3.2 km) in one hour were recorded.One large group of fires was known as the Snake River Complex. These fires were in the southern section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.The Red fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and like the Shoshone fire, advanced little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19, and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village... Answer:","output":"The two fires that advanced towards the Grant Village area in Yellowstone National Park during the summer of 1988 were the Shoshone Fire and the Red Fire. Both fires were part of the larger Snake River Complex and were initially started by lightning strikes. The Shoshone Fire began on June 23, and due to the prescribed natural burn policy in place at the time, no immediate efforts were made to suppress it. The fire smoldered and remained relatively contained for several weeks before rapidly expanding towards the northeast on July 20. The Red Fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and similarly, it advanced little for several weeks. However, on July 19, it began moving northeast and eventually combined with the Shoshone Fire in August. As both fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, they posed a significant threat to the park's infrastructure and natural resources. The summer of 1988 saw nearly 250 fires ignited in and around Yellowstone, with seven of them accounting for 95% of the total burned area. Among these fires, the Snake River Complex was one of the most significant, as it affected the southern section of the park. The confluence of the Shoshone and Red Fires in close proximity to Grant Village made them particularly dangerous to the park's infrastructure and required the mobilization of personnel from the National Park Service and other agencies to attempt to bring the fires under control. Despite these efforts, the fires continued to expand, fueled by dry storms that brought strong winds and lightning but no rain. The fires eventually became so intense that they created crown fires with flames over 200 feet (61 meters) high, spreading rapidly across the park's landscape and threatening both natural habitats and human-built structures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

Despite the two sentences using different word orders, both are communicating that the Pike County School System is composed of a total of 25 schools that include elementary, middle, and high schools. In the first sentence: \\"The Pike County School System consists of 25 high schools, middle and elementary schools,\\" the mention of \\"high schools, middle and elementary schools\\" is a little ambiguous, so it could be misunderstood to mean that there are 25 high schools alone and an unspecified number of middle and elementary schools.  On the other hand, the second sentence: \\"The Pike County School System consists of 25 elementary, middle, and high schools,\\" it is clear that it is referring to a collective total of 25 schools, not individually 25 of each type. However, given that we are considering the intent of the sentences rather than focusing on their possible ambiguity, we can conclude that both sentences are intended to communicate the same meaning, which is the total number of schools in the Pike County School System.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions?  Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.  Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Answer:","output":"Bob's town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions, as it was located in a hilly area with more precipitation and full of bike trails."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Select from: (I) before the oceans (II) in the earth (III) after the oceans (IV) in the oceans","output":"To determine which choice is the correct answer, we will go through each one of them step by step: 1. \\"Before the oceans\\" does not make any sense, as there is no specific location or reservoir of carbon referred to by this statement. It is not clear if it refers to a geological time period or a source of carbon preceding the oceans. So we can rule out option (I). 2. \\"In the earth\\" as an option might refer to carbon stored in fossil fuels, which could be a reasonable choice. However, the question asks where the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by a carbon reservoir, so we need to consider if this is the most significant reservoir. Thus, we will keep option (II) for the time being. 3. \\"After the oceans\\" is another vague choice, and once again, it is not clear what source of carbon this statement refers to, nor does it correspond to a particular CO2 reservoir. Therefore, we can eliminate option (III). 4. \\"In the oceans\\" is a well-defined location, and it is scientifically accurate to consider the oceans as a carbon reservoir. This reservoir is important, as CO2 dissolves in the water, making oceans a significant sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. After carefully analyzing each option, we reach the conclusion that option (IV) \\"in the oceans\\" is the correct answer as it is the most significant reservoir of carbon that influences the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: -  The body&#x27;s temperature increases over 98.6 degrees F - The hypothalamus in the brain sends a message to the body - Sweat glands in the skin receive the message - The sweat glands start combining water and chemicals to make sweat  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process, after the sweat glands have combined water and chemicals to create sweat, is the excretion and evaporation of sweat from the skin's surface to facilitate cooling and regulate body temperature. This process is essential to maintaining a stable and healthy internal environment, or homeostasis, within the body. As sweat is produced by the sweat glands, it travels through ducts and is secreted onto the surface of the skin. In response to the increased body temperature, the sweat glands work to produce a higher volume of sweat. The sweat on the skin's surface then absorbs the excess heat from the body, and as it evaporates, it dissipates the heat into the air, cooling the skin and, in turn, cooling the blood circulating near the skin's surface. Blood vessels in the skin also play a crucial role in this final step by dilating, allowing more blood flow to the skin's surface. This increase in blood flow supports the removal of excess heat through the evaporation of sweat. As the body temperature starts to decrease and approach the normal range, the hypothalamus regulates both the production of sweat and the dilation of the blood vessels, gradually returning physiological processes to normal levels. In addition, the evaporation of sweat has a cooling effect not just on the skin but also on the surrounding environment. This helps to lower the air temperature around the skin as well, further contributing to the overall cooling effect on the body. In summary, the final step of the process involves the excretion of sweat onto the skin's surface, followed by the evaporation of sweat, which effectively cools the body by dissipating excess heat into the air. This mechanism of thermoregulation is crucial in maintaining homeostasis and ensuring that the body's vital functions and organs operate optimally even in the presence of elevated temperatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I called my grandfather for a golden piece of advice: let the coin decide. I flipped  a coin and ah! Tails  ! My report would be about the great man who invented peanut butter, George Washington Carver. Weeks later, I stood in front of the classroom and proudly read my homework. But things started to get strange. I looked around the room, only to find my classmates with big smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes and my stone-faced teacher. I was completely lost. \\"What could be causing everyone to act this way?\\" Oh well, I dropped the paper and sat down at my desk, burning to find out what I had done wrong. As a classmate began his report, it all became clear, \\"My report is on George Washington, the man who started the American War of Independence.\\" The whole world became quiet!

But Frank Willett, a Dunkirk and Normandy veteran, did - and was exploited by his neighbour Colin Blake. Frank's daughter, Lesley, lived 300 miles away from her father. She was in South Wales and he was in Yorkshire. Suffering from dementia and in his early 80s, in 2003 Frank made Blake his attorney, giving him responsibility for his financial affairs. Blake had befriended widower Mr Willett and took him to a local solicitor's office, where the document was drawn up for enduring power of attorney and Frank signed. Lesley and her husband Brian Felton believed Frank's assets were safe. But what they didn't realise was that just weeks after the papers were signed, Colin Blake had begun taking out large sums of money. \\"I didn't think the bank would allow wholesale looting of someone's account,\\" Lesley says. Her father had been a regular customer for years with the bank. He'd go in every week and cash a cheque for £70, and all of his bills were paid by direct debit. He had pensions from the army and the civil service as well as his state pension. He was careful with money and had built up substantial savings of £60,000. In February 2003, Blake withdrew nearly £9,000 from Mr Willett's account in a single transaction. As he had power of attorney, the bank didn't contact Brian and Lesley. Blake drew out more money, using the sums to pay his own bills. Frank's health deteriorated and in September 2004 he was moved to a care home. Colin Blake registered the enduring power of attorney (EPA) with the Court of Protection, which allowed him to sell Frank's house, a two-bedroom bungalow in North Yorkshire. Lesley and Brian challenged the power of attorney in court - but they had no idea that Frank's savings account was empty, and they couldn't prove that Colin Blake was unfit to be Frank's attorney. The judge upheld the document, although he did order Blake to provide annual accounts to the court - a more stringent measure than the usual procedure. The couple and their solicitor repeatedly contacted the Public Guardianship Office, and the Court of Protection, which oversees attorneyship, saying they believed there were discrepancies in the accounts. But they were told everything was satisfactory. In early 2007, visiting her father in the care home in Yorkshire, Lesley learned that Blake was selling his own house, liquidating his company and moving to France. Frank's care bills were in arrears. Lesley knew her father's house had been sold for over £130,000 and could not understand where the money had gone. It was only in early 2008 that a new body - the Office of the Public Guardian - investigated, and revoked the power of attorney. Lesley was appointed deputy by the court instead - responsible for her father's finances under the court's supervision. She discovered all of her father's money had gone. Her father's medals - from 35 years service in the army - had gone. Her mother's wedding ring and her jewellery and all the family photographs and documents had also disappeared. \\"It was devastating,\\" she says. \\"It took his memories.\\" She called the police, who began to investigate Blake. Lesley visited Frank for his birthday and took him to visit her mother's grave. She told him Blake wouldn't be bothering him any more, and that the care home staff and his family would be protecting him. \\"He had tears streaming down his face and he said: 'That's the best birthday present I've ever had.'\\" Frank died in 2009. Lesley and Brian had to go to court to overturn a will Frank had made under Blake's influence. The police pursued Blake to France. Last month he pleaded guilty to theft and was sentenced to four-and-a-half years. It's unlikely that Lesley will ever get any money back. But she wanted to see justice done for her father, and for others to learn from her experience. Since this case, there have been changes to power of attorney and the Court of Protection. In the past, a EPA could be drawn up with little oversight - but when it came to registration, it could be subject to scrutiny and challenge. All the relatives of the person concerned would be contacted at that point. Now with the newer Lasting Power of Attorney, or LPA, a professional, or someone who has known the subject of the order well for years, has to provide a certificate for the document to be drawn up - but registration has been made far simpler. Relatives are no longer contacted. Also, the Office of the Public Guardian, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, has more powers to investigate complaints about attorneys than its predecessor, the Public Guardianship Office. The retired judge, Denzil Lush, cited a recent case involving 94-year-old widow Gladys Meek, from Derbyshire. Her husband's niece and great niece were deputies. They used her money to buy cars, laptops, designer handbags, and season tickets to Derby County Football Club. But after a court decision, a £275,000 bond was called in and so the money could be recovered. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Frank Willett, a war veteran suffering from dementia, was exploited by his neighbor Colin Blake. In 2003, Frank made Blake responsible for his financial affairs through enduring power of attorney (EPA). Despite concerns from Frank's family, the Court of Protection upheld the EPA. Colin Blake used his position to steal from Frank, emptying his savings and selling his property. It wasn't until 2008 that the Office of the Public Guardian revoked the power of attorney and appointed Frank's daughter Lesley as deputy. All of Frank's money, medals, and personal belongings were gone. Colin Blake was eventually found guilty of theft and sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. Since this case, changes have been made to provisions of power of attorney and to the Court of Protection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The text does not mention a psychologist playing a role in recommending a physical therapist. Rather, it provides guidance on how to use physical therapy to relieve back pain and suggests seeking a recommendation from a doctor, not a psychologist. The text offers a step-by-step approach to using physical therapy for back pain relief: 1. Choose a physical therapist who specializes in back pain treatment 2. Make an appointment with your doctor to get a prescription for physical therapy 3. Ask the doctor to recommend physical therapists with extensive experience in treating cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spinal pain The focus in the text is on relying on a doctor's advice in finding the right physical therapist for back pain treatment, as opposed to consulting a psychologist. It is important to note that the roles of psychologists and doctors are distinct. Psychologists specialize in understanding human behavior, thoughts, and emotions. They typically work in the mental health field and hold a PsyD or Ph.D. in psychology. In contrast, doctors are medical professionals who diagnose and treat a wide range of physical ailments, including managing pain prescriptions and referrals to specialists. In the context of seeking recommendations for physical therapists with experience in back pain, a doctor would be the most appropriate professional to consult. While a psychologist may be able to help with the emotional and mental aspects of dealing with chronic pain, they are not medical professionals with direct expertise in the area of physical therapy or back pain treatment.

Q:Information:  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.  - Nickel is a chemical element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickeliron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.  - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons.  - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest.   - Greater Sudbury, commonly referred to as Sudbury, is a city in Ontario, Canada. It is the largest city in Northern Ontario by population, (2011 census population 160,274,) and is the 24th largest metropolitan area in Canada. By land area, it is the largest city in Ontario and the seventh largest municipality by area in Canada. It is administratively a single-tier municipality, and thus not part of any district, county, or regional municipality.  - Heavy water (deuterium oxide) is a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (or D, also known as \\"heavy hydrogen\\"), rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope (or H, also called protium) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal \\"light water\\".  - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada. At a land area of approximately and a 2011 population of 41,462, it is the second largest and most populous of the three territories in Northern Canada. Its estimated population as of 2016 is 44,291. Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission.  - Nunavut (from Inuktitut:  ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.  - Deuterium (symbol ' or ', also known as heavy hydrogen) is one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen. The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common hydrogen isotope, protium, has no neutron in the nucleus. Deuterium has a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in of hydrogen. Thus deuterium accounts for approximately 0.0156% (or on a mass basis 0.0312%) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while the most common isotope (hydrogen-1 or protium) accounts for more than 99.98%. The abundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to another (see Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water).  - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region.  - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  - Creighton Mine is an underground nickel mine, owned and operated by Vale (formerly known as INCO) in the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It is currently the deepest nickel mine in Canada.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.  - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.  - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table.  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.  - The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory ( SNO ) was a neutrino observatory located 2100 m underground in INCO 's Creighton Mine in Sudbury , Ontario , Canada . The detector was designed to detect solar neutrinos through their interactions with a large tank of heavy water . The detector was turned on in May 1999 , and was turned off on 28 November 2006 . The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken . The director of the experiment , Art McDonald , was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015 for the experiment 's contribution to the discovery of neutrino oscillation . The underground laboratory has been enlarged into a permament facility and now operates multiple experiments as SNOLAB . The SNO equipment itself is currently being refurbished for use in the SNO + experiment .  - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included.

In the initial phrase, there is a lack of explicit detail about the location or direction in which the young women are walking. Simply stating \\"Two young women walking\\" is an incomplete sentence. It is in the form of a subject description, but the predicate, which tells what the subject is doing, is missing. Despite this, it is still clear that the young women's action is that of walking. On the other hand, the conclusion, \\"The two young women are walking somewhere,\\" is a complete sentence. The subject is now \\"The two young women,\\" and the predicate is \\"are walking somewhere.\\" Though still somewhat vague, the sentence now provides slightly more context by explicitly acknowledging that the women are walking towards an unspecified location. The word \\"somewhere\\" indicates movement and destination, even if the details of the destination are not provided. Essentially, while the first statement is a fragmented description, the second statement is a well-structured sentence delivering the same basic idea.

Listen to Doncaster boss Darren Ferguson speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield Pompey were given a first-half lifeline when Joe Wright bizarrely hooked Gareth Evans' wayward cross into Baker's path and the winger thumped in. Conor Chaplin failed to crane his header into an open goal, Baker dragged a long ball onto the bar and Curtis Main air-kicked under the bar. But the best chance was kicked off the line by Andy Butler after Gary Roberts had headed towards goal as Pompey fell to a second straight defeat. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Congressional Leaders Suggest Earlier Snowden Link to Russia WASHINGTON — The heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees suggested on Sunday that Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, might have been working for Russian spy services while he was employed at an agency facility in Hawaii last year and before he disclosed hundreds of thousands of classified government documents. The lawmakers, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, offered no specific evidence that Mr. Snowden had cooperated with Moscow. Since Mr. Snowden’s disclosure first became public last spring, there has been much speculation that he was collaborating with a foreign spy service. Nearly a year later, however, there has been no public indication that the F.B.I.’s investigation of Mr. Snowden’s actions, bolstered by separate “damage assessment” investigations at the N.S.A. and the Pentagon, has uncovered evidence that Mr. Snowden received help from a foreign intelligence service. A senior F.B.I. official said on Sunday that it was still the bureau’s conclusion that Mr. Snowden acted alone. The questions raised by Mr. Rogers and Ms. Feinstein came as the F.B.I. continues its investigation of Mr. Snowden, and as the debate rages about whether he was a traitor, a whistle-blower or a violator of his oaths who nonetheless started what President Obama again last week called an important debate. To some, he is all three. The initial portrayals of Mr. Snowden depicted a young man shocked by the scope of government surveillance and determined to expose it. In his insistence that he would release only documents showing what he viewed as government wrongdoing or overreach by intelligence agencies, he appeared to be cultivating an image as a whistle-blower. The main recipients of his materials, including The Washington Post and The Guardian, have said that Mr. Snowden insisted that material revealing operations, but no wrongdoing, should not appear in public. But Mr. Rogers described a very different view of Mr. Snowden, as a man who, from the beginning, might have knowingly or unknowingly been directed by a foreign intelligence service. He said the mass of military data in the Snowden trove clearly had nothing to do with privacy or the reach of intelligence services, and he suggested that Mr. Snowden’s possession of a “go bag” to get out of Hawaii, and his smooth entry into Hong Kong, indicated preplanning beyond his individual capacity. Intelligence officials say they have no doubt that Chinese and Russian intelligence have obtained whatever information Mr. Snowden was carrying with him digitally. They also say it is possible that much of the data Mr. Snowden took is stored in an Internet cloud service. Mr. Snowden has said he did not turn over any documents to any foreign governments; American officials say that given the cyber skills of the Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies, they assume that those countries could have gotten them without Mr. Snowden’s knowledge. Mr. Obama weighed in on the subject in a newly released interview with David Remnick of The New Yorker. He insisted Mr. Snowden had not revealed any illegalities, and though he might have raised “legitimate policy questions” the question was, “Is the only way to do that by giving some 29-year-old free rein to basically dump a mountain of information, much of which is definitely legal, definitely necessary for national security, and should properly be classified?” Mr. Obama insisted that “the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it.” But he did not say what that way was, and even his own aides acknowledge that if Mr. Snowden had not made so much information public, it was doubtful that the president would have announced the reforms and further studies of N.S.A. actions that he spoke about on Friday. On Sunday, Mr. Rogers appeared to hinge many of his suspicions about Mr. Snowden on a recent Defense Intelligence Agency report that he has described in other interviews as concluding that Mr. Snowden stole about 1.7 million intelligence files that concern vital operations of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force. He said that it would cost billions of dollars to change operations because of the security breaches. The defense intelligence report remains classified, though some members of Congress have been briefed on it in recent weeks. “I don’t think it was a gee-whiz luck event that he ended up in Moscow under the handling of the F.S.B.,” Mr. Rogers said on the NBC program “Meet the Press,” referring to the Federal Security Service, the Russian state security organization that succeeded the K.G.B. Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who advises Mr. Snowden, said in a telephone interview on Sunday that Mr. Rogers’s statement was “not only false, it is silly.” Mr. Wizner said that Mr. Snowden’s actions before seeking asylum in Russia were not consistent with someone who was working for a foreign government, pointing out that Mr. Snowden flew to Hong Kong, where he gave classified documents to American journalists. He then sought to travel to Ecuador, and was marooned for five weeks in the transit zone of Moscow’s international airport while he sought asylum in some 20 countries. Mr. Wizner also criticized Mr. Rogers’ description of the defense agency report as “exaggerated national security claims.” American suspicions had been raised in part, according to one official familiar with the intelligence, because intelligence agencies believe that some of the information apparently stored with an Internet cloud service has been changed or moved in recent months. It is not clear how much American intelligence agencies know about where all the trove of data is now stored. The United States is concerned that Russian agents may have access to the data while Mr. Snowden is in the country under temporary asylum, or in exchange for his asylum. Ms. Feinstein, when asked by David Gregory, the host of “Meet the Press,” whether she agreed with Mr. Rogers that Mr. Snowden might have had help from the Russians, was more tentative: “He may well have. We don’t know at this stage.” Both lawmakers said their committees would continue their investigations. Mr. Snowden has been living in Russia since June; in August the authorities there granted him temporary asylum. The Russian government has refused to extradite Mr. Snowden, who has been charged with espionage and stealing government property, to the United States.

Boehner delivered similar remarks to House Republicans behind closed doors, reports the Hill, suggesting to the rank and file that the groups were more concerned with raising money than defending conservative principles. The groups say they're angry that the proposed deal raises spending levels in 2014, albeit slightly—to 1.012 trillion from the 967 billion that would have been in place had the full sequester cuts taken effect. The full House votes on the measure tomorrow, and Boehner's language suggests he's not worried about the vote failing, even if a conservative bloc defects. Said Ryan: \\"We feel very good at where we are with our members.\\" Expand this summary.","output":"John Boehner, former Speaker of the House, criticized political advocacy groups, particularly those on the right such as the Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity, and Heritage Action, accusing them of using House members and the American public for their own goals. Boehner's \\"uncharacteristically forceful\\" language indicated his frustration with these groups, which have slammed the new budget deal even before it was officially announced. Boehner addressed House Republicans behind closed doors, suggesting that these conservative groups were more focused on raising money rather than defending and promoting conservative principles. The advocacy groups have expressed their anger over the proposed budget deal, which would raise spending levels in 2014 to 1.012 trillion, up from the 967 billion that would have been in place if the full sequester cuts had taken effect. The full House was expected to vote on the measure the following day, and Boehner's strong language implied that he was not concerned about the vote failing even in the event of a conservative bloc defecting. This situation highlights the tensions that exist between the Republican Party establishment, represented by figures like Boehner, and the more extreme conservative advocacy groups, who are seeking to exert influence on the political landscape. The public criticism from Boehner underscores the challenges the GOP faces in managing disparate factions within its ranks, particularly as it tries to negotiate critical legislation like the budget deal. In this context, it is worth noting that the budget deal at the center of the conflict was developed by Paul Ryan, a prominent figure in the Republican Party, who expressed confidence in the proposal's chances in the House vote. Ryan's support for the deal, coupled with Boehner's public criticism of conservative groups, might be seen as an indication of the Republican establishment attempting to reassert its control and direct the party's legislative priorities more effectively. Overall, Boehner's criticisms of conservative advocacy groups are not just a momentary outburst but rather a reflection of the broader struggles within the Republican Party between the establishment and more ideologically driven elements. The outcome of the budget vote and the ongoing tensions between these factions may have significant implications for the GOP's direction and goals moving forward."},{"instruction":"Q:The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food.

Summarize the following: Most uncut gems are oddly shaped so you may need to grind it down. Roughly grinding the outsides of the gem will make it closer to the size and shape you want. Hold the gem between your fingertips and carefully polish it on a 1200 grit lap.  If you have a lot of rough to remove, use a 260 grit lap. Since faceting machines are expensive and not usually available for rent, see if you can take a few faceting classes to become familiar with using them. If you want to buy one, find one directly from a manufacturer or look online. Heat a dime-sized amount of dop wax on the end of your dop stick. Hold it near a flame so the wax softens and becomes pliable. Stick the base of the gem that will be mounted into the wax. The faced surface of the gem should be exposed.  Let the wax cool before you grind it so the gem stays on the dop stick. Once you've gained experience, consider using superglue or cyanoacrylate adhesives instead of wax. These are less likely to break off or damage heat-sensitive gems such as opals. Use a 1200 lap disc on your faceting machine to cut the circumference (girdle) of the gem. Set the angle to 90 degrees so you can make symmetrical cuts. Don't lock the index wheel on the machine so you can move it freely and have more control over cutting.  The outline you cut will depend on which shape you've chosen. For example, you'll make a rectangular girdle for an emerald cut. Consult the machine's instruction manual for specific instructions about each style of cut. Wipe the gem clean with a microfiber cloth. This will remove the coarser grit that's transferred to the gem. Take the coarser lap disc off of the machine and put a pre-polishing lap on the machine. Find faceting diagrams for the shape you're cutting the gem. A diagram will tell you how many facets to make and at what angles to make them. Polish the facets against the lap until the surfaces of the gem are smooth. To get the cut you want, you may have to reheat the dop wax, remove the rough, and reposition it in the hot wax. Heating the stone along with the wax will not harm it. Put a polishing lap on your machine. Take the small spatula that came with your oxide polish and dip it into the polish so a peanut-sized amount is on the end of the spatula. Run the machine and spread the polish over the lap in a smooth even layer. This will buff your new gemstone until it sparkles and will help remove any grit or imperfections leftover by the faceting process. To remove the finished stone from the dop stick, warm the wax near an open flame so it softens. Then pull the stone away from the wax.","output":"Gems are special rocks that can be shiny and pretty. Sometimes, they look weird and need to be shaped. People use special machines to grind and polish them. They stick the gem to a stick with special wax and use the machine to make it look nice. There are many shapes, and they use a special guide to make the right shape. Once the gem is smooth, they put a special polish on it to make it shiny and sparkly. When they're done, they heat the wax again and take the gem off the stick. Now it's a beautiful gemstone!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries.  I am facing a new situation today: John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the number of mesopredators would decrease, case A or case B? A:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, the number of mesopredators would decrease in case A. In case A, when the Siberian tiger has a stable population during the sixteenth century, it serves as the apex predator in the Siberian ecosystem. Apex predators, like the Siberian tiger, help control the population of mesopredators by preying on them and restricting their numbers. This regulation is vital to maintaining balance in the ecosystem, preventing overpopulation of mesopredators, and promoting biodiversity. In case B, the introduction of guns in the seventeenth century led to a decrease in the Siberian tiger population. As a result, the removal or reduction of the apex predator, in this case, the Siberian tiger, can lead to mesopredator release. Mesopredator release occurs when the population of mesopredators increases due to the absence or reduction of the controlling apex predator. This increase can cause disruptions to the ecosystem and lead to negative consequences like loss of biodiversity and destabilization of the food chain. Thus, the number of mesopredators would decrease in case A, when the Siberian tiger population is stable and serving its role as an apex predator in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain? ?  At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989. Astley & Bedford Mosses, along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, is also a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation, known as... The answer to this question is:","output":"The major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain, specifically Chat Moss, can be categorized into the following: 1. Lowland raised bog: Chat Moss is primarily a lowland raised bog, which forms when there is poor drainage, leading to water-logging and slow plant decomposition. This results in the production of peat, which raises the level of the bog above the surrounding land. The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. 2. Peatlands: The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles and has peat deposits varying in depth between 24 feet and 30 feet. Due to its historical significance and ecological importance, these peatlands form one of the major habitats in the area. 3. Agricultural land: By the 1990s, an estimated 72% of the bog had been reclaimed, with most of it being used for agriculture. This reclaimed land serves as a major habitat in the Chat Moss region. 4. Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI): A 228-acre area of Chat Moss, known as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989. This area is protected for its unique flora and fauna, making it another important habitat in the region. 5. Special Area of Conservation (SAC): Along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, Astley & Bedford Mosses form a part of the European Union designated Special Area of Conservation. This area is specifically protected for its ecological significance and supports various unique and endangered species, making it an essential habitat in the Chat Moss region. In summary, the major habitats in the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain, specifically Chat Moss, are lowland raised bogs, peatlands, agricultural land, Site of Special Scientific Interest, and Special Area of Conservation. These habitats support a diverse range of flora and fauna, making the area ecologically significant and important for conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a premise: \\"Many small groups enjoy a fireworks show at night.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"People are watching a movie at a drive-in theater.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise provided is: \\"Many small groups enjoy a fireworks show at night.\\" This statement describes a scenario where numerous groups of people are gathered and enjoying a fireworks display at nighttime. It gives us information about people's activities and the nature of the event they are attending, which is a fireworks show. The hypothesis presented is: \\"People are watching a movie at a drive-in theater.\\" This statement suggests a situation where individuals are watching a movie in an outdoor venue, specifically at a drive-in theater, with cars parked and screens set up for movie projection. In order to determine if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true, we need to analyze both statements and see if there is any direct or indirect connection between the two situations. First, let's consider the nature of the events described in both statements. A fireworks show is an outdoor event characterized by explosions of color and light in the sky, usually accompanied by loud sounds and patterns created by pyrotechnics. A drive-in theater, on the other hand, is an open-air venue where movies are played on large outdoor screens for an audience who watch from their parked vehicles. While both types of events happen outside and are predominantly enjoyed during the night, the key differences between these events lie in their content and structure. A fireworks show primarily focuses on the visual and auditory spectacle of the detonations, whereas a drive-in theater is a venue where people watch movies, which consist of a more extended and intricate narrative experience. The premise does not provide any information that directly ties the fireworks show with people watching a movie at a drive-in theater. It only mentions that there are many small groups enjoying the fireworks event. This lack of direct information or connection between the two situations does not allow us to adequately conclude whether the hypothesis is true. Therefore, based on the analysis of the premise and hypothesis, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is true, as the premise does not give us sufficient information or evidence related to the hypothesis. They remain as two separate independent situations, and without additional context or information connecting the fireworks show to the drive-in theater or the people involved, we cannot make an informed judgment about the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. supermarket  B. refrigerator  C. fridge  D. grocery store  E. heater  The best answer is A:","output":"C. fridge The best answer to the question \\"The frozen food is starting to melt, where would I put it?\\" is C. fridge. This is because a fridge, also known as a refrigerator, is a home appliance that is designed specifically to store and preserve food by keeping it at a cold temperature. The term \\"fridge\\" is simply a shorter, colloquial version of \\"refrigerator,\\" so these two terms can be used interchangeably. While a refrigerator is designed to store food between temperatures of 35-40°F (2-4°C), there is usually a designated freezer section inside the fridge. This freezer section maintains a temperature at or below the freezing point of water (32°F or 0°C), which is essential for preventing the frozen food from melting. By placing the melting frozen food into the freezer section of your fridge, you can ensure that the food will be preserved in its frozen state. This, in turn, will help maintain the quality, taste, and nutritional value of the food, as well as prevent spoilage and the growth of harmful bacteria. Although supermarkets and grocery stores (options A and D) do contain refrigerators and freezers for storing perishable items, they are generally meant for the store's inventory and not for personal use. Plus, these options are not as convenient as storing the food in your own fridge, as you would have to transport the melting food to the store and request permission to store it there, which may not be granted. Option E, a heater, is not an appropriate place to store melting frozen food, as this will only hasten the melting process and contribute to spoilage. A heater is designed to increase the temperature of a room for comfort, not to store or preserve food. In summary, the best answer is C. fridge, as it provides a suitable environment for maintaining the frozen state of your food and preventing it from melting."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

That means it's important for you to set limits with yourself. You also need to express those limits with doctors, nurses, and other caregivers, so they're aware of when you will and when you won't be there. In a time when things seem out of control, you may neglect to focus on good eating habits. You may not eat much, or you may end up eating junk food. Both of those put a strain on you. Try to eat as healthy as you can, even if you have to order food in sometimes or rely on simple meals like salads. Remember to include lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and veggies in your diet. Sleep can also be difficult when you're caring for a loved one. You may be too worried to sleep at times, or the task of caregiving may interrupt your sleep. However, try to get as much as you can, aiming for a regular 7 to 9 hours a day, even if you have to do it in smaller chunks. Not getting enough sleep can put a strain on your health, plus it will make you less effective as a caregiver. Exercising will also help you maintain your health while you're caring for a loved one. As an added bonus, it can reduce your stress level. However, it can be difficult when you are caregiving, so you'll need to find ways to work it into your schedule.  For instance, maybe you can take a short walk a couple of times a day. You could also do yoga at home or try jumping rope. You could also ask someone to come sit with your loved one while you take an hour or so to go exercise. That way, you get a much-needed break, plus the exercise you need. It can be easy to overlook signs of health problems in yourself when you’re caring for someone else.

Options:  A. compliments  B. understand themselves  C. life partner  D. second chances  E. larger house Answer:","output":"E. Larger House In line with common sense, when a person has more kids, they typically need a larger house. This is because a growing family requires additional space to accommodate the needs of each family member. A larger house can provide the necessary living areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, and storage space to improve the overall quality of life for a family with multiple children. More children means more demand for space, as each child requires their own room to sleep, play, and study. Furthermore, families with more kids also need larger common areas, such as living rooms and dining rooms, where the whole family can gather and spend time together. These spaces must be big enough to provide comfort to everyone and allow them to engage in daily activities without feeling too cramped or crowded. In addition to considering the size of the house itself, families with more kids should also take into account the outdoor space, such as a yard or garden. These areas are important for children to play and explore, as well as providing a place for parents to relax and enjoy time with their family. Having access to outdoor spaces is essential for the overall well-being and development of children.

Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains. Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a 20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming \\"I don't have any change!!\\" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change. The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in \\"Fantastic Easter Special\\" two weeks ago. Meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, Randy pulls the trigger. In Evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica, California. The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10 What is the sentiment of this review?

One of the most prominent bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 Tone ska revival, they continue to perform with six of the seven members of their classic line-up. Madness achieved most of their success in the early to mid-1980s. Both Madness and UB40 spent 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts. Context: The core of the band formed as The North London Invaders in 1976, and included Mike Barson (Monsieur Barso) on keyboards and vocals, Chris Foreman (Chrissy Boy) on guitar and Lee Thompson (Kix) on saxophone and vocals. They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth (better known as Chas Smash) on bass guitar. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist Dikron Tulane.  This six-piece line-up lasted until part way through 1977, when Graham McPherson (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's garden. Dikron went on to be an actor under the name Dikran Tulaine. Smyth, who left after an argument with Barson, was replaced by Gavin Rodgers, Barson's girlfriend's brother. McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch Chelsea instead of rehearsing. Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing.  By 1978, the band had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed). Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and bass player Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively. After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979, paying homage to one of their favourite songs by ska/reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and dancer. Question: Did anyone else leave or get kicked out of the band? Answer:","output":"Yes, throughout the history of Madness, several members have left or been asked to leave the band due to various reasons. Early in the band's formation, Cathal Smyth (Chas Smash) left the group after a disagreement with Mike Barson. However, he later rejoined the band as a backing vocalist and dancer in 1979. Graham McPherson (Suggs) was also briefly kicked out of the band for prioritizing watching Chelsea football matches over attending rehearsals, but he was later allowed to return. Additionally, the drummer and bass positions in the band also underwent changes. John Hasler, the original drummer, left and was replaced by temporary vocalist Daniel Woodgate (Woody), who ultimately took over the position on drums. The original bass player, Gavin Rodgers, was replaced by Mark Bedford (Bedders). More recently, in 2014, Chas Smash announced that he had left the band to pursue a solo career, leaving the group as a six-piece band. While band members have left or been asked to leave at different points in Madness's history, the group has continued to thrive and adapt, maintaining a core membership and a strong presence in the London ska scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge...  Guess a valid title for it!

Movie plot title: Silver Saddle Movie plot: The film opens in a small South Texas bordertown in the 1850s. A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood. Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before. The murder is arraigned to take place in a graveyard outside town where Barrett is expected to arrive. Blood lies in wait until a carriage eventually...

The Sunni extremists running roughshod across Iraq could produce 'a thousand' global terrorists like Osama bin Laden bent on widespread death and destruction, Iraq's ambassador to the United States warned on Monday. Lukman Faily said that if the United States and other nations focus too much on Iraq's internal politics and ignore the 'immediate threat' of a terrorist movement that's gathering steam, the results will be catastrophic. 'This is a global tumor in Iraq taking place now and in Syria,' he said, referring to the Sunni militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). 'We've seen it before.' The White House has scolded Nouri al-Maliki's government in Baghdad for provoking ISIS by alienating the country's Sunni minority. Barack Obama said on Friday that U.S. military intervention would be conditioned on reconciliation efforts from Maliki's Shia majority. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. Lukman Faily, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, warned CNN's Christiane Amanpour that 'a thousand' Osama bin Ladens could emerge from among the Sunni extremists pushing to take over Baghdad. Pushing back: Iraqi Shiite tribesmen are joining state-run security forces in the fight against Jihadist militants who have taken over several northern Iraqi cities; Iraq's US ambassador says his country needs America's help to prevent 'a thousand' Bin Ladens from turning the globe into a terrorist shooting gallery. 'Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and account for the legitimate interests of all of Iraq’s communities,' Obama said in public remarks. 'So this should be a wake-up call.  Iraq’s leaders have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.' But Faily suggested during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Obama is naively fiddling while Baghdad burns. 'These are all \\"nice to have\\" discussions,' he said, but 'what we have in Iraq now, to -- is an immediate threat.' 'But do you not feel this is an immediate threat?' Amanpour interrupted, 'that practically half the country feels disenfranchised? The Sunnis?' 'We're not saying we're not happy to [have a] discussion,' he responded. 'We want to have that discussion. But we're saying conditioning that discussion is not wise. Making clear that we all stand together against a threat in global terrorism is the question.' 'Let me give you an example. What you have in Afghanistan, with one Bin Laden – you will have a thousand of them.' 'No POWs,' he warned. 'Nothing, none of that. No rules of engagement but destruction.' 'That's the situation in Iraq.' Obama told Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they are moved elsewhere in Iraq and to Jordan. They will be 'armed for combat,' the White House said, while insisting that the ground troops won't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that Obama campaigned against in 2008 and 2012. An administration official also said Monday that the president is considering the deployment of a small contingent of Special Forces to Iraq, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of ISIS. Obama is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper ISIS, but administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing ISIS off the battlefield now that neighboring Iran has sent 2,000 of its elite Quds forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the way for Iran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Iraq. Amanpour pushed back against Faily, arguing that the more 'immediate threat' to Iraq was political inequality enforced by Shiites against Sunnis. ISIS aims to establish a caliphate -- an Islamic state that transcends national borders -- in areas of Syria and Iraq, and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries. 'A thousand of them': Faily says the late Osama bin Laden (pictured), who masterminded al-Qaeda's 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, could just be the beginning is ISIS is allowed to press forward. Obama is stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to keep a U.S.-friendly government in place in Baghdad while also avoiding a newly strengthened and further leveraged Iran at a time when that Islamic republic is moving toward nuclear weapons capability. Faily said Monday that whether or not the White House decides on a path of limited cooperation with Tehran, Iraq needs help urgently. 'We have been saying that we need to strengthen our army with having fighter planes, Apache helicopters and others. ... The administration now understands that urgency.' he said. They have been willing to say, \\"We are willing to help.\\" What we are saying is we cannot wait until tomorrow. A decision has to be made. It should have been made yesterday. 'From our perspective,' Faily said, 'the urgency of the ground are giving us less options and more radical options.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"The situation in Iraq at the time of the article was critical due to the rise of Sunni extremist group ISIS, which posed a significant threat to the region and the world.

Answer the following question: when was sergeant pepper released in the us?","output":"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the iconic album by the legendary British rock band The Beatles, was released in the United States on June 2, 1967. The album had been released one day earlier, on June 1, 1967 in the United Kingdom. It was the band's eighth studio album and represented a major shift in their musical style, as they transitioned from the traditional pop-rock sound of their earlier work to a more experimental, avant-garde, and psychedelic approach. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is often referred to as one of the first concept albums, as it introduced alter ego band personas and featured a loose narrative theme connecting the songs. The album cover, designed by Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, is also notable for its colorful and iconic collage of famous figures, which has become one of the most recognizable and parodied images in rock history. The album was a critical and commercial success, earning widespread acclaim and topping the charts in several countries, including the US and the UK. Many of the songs on the album, such as \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" and \\"A Day in the Life,\\" have become enduring hits and highlights of the band's career. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is considered a major milestone not just for The Beatles but for popular music as a whole, as it helped to redefine the role of the album as an artistic statement and pushed the boundaries of what could be accomplished within the realm of recorded music. In the decades since its release, the album has continued to be praised and celebrated as one of the most important and influential records in the history of rock music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process after the hot water has passed through the ground coffee is the collection of the prepared coffee drink. Specifically, this is how it happens: The heated water that passes through the grounds gets saturated with the flavours of the coffee. As a result of this process, what used to be mere water has now been transformed into a hot, aromatic coffee brew.  This brew does not stay in the filter with the grounds. Instead, it drips down due to gravity. It falls drop by drop from the filter basket into an area of the coffee machine called the 'coffee pot' or 'carafe,' which is typically made from glass or thermal material to accommodate the hot temperature.  The carafe is usually strategically positioned just beneath the filter basket so that it collects all the brewed coffee conveniently. Some coffee machines come with a feature known as a 'brew-pause' function. This temporarily stops the flow of coffee into the carafe for those who can't wait to have their cup even before the brewing cycle is completed completely. Once all the heated water has seeped through the coffee grounds and collected into the carafe as brewed coffee, this marks the end of the brewing cycle. From here, you can then pour yourself a cup of the freshly brewed coffee straight from the carafe. This serves as the climax of this process. However, it is crucial not to leave the brewed coffee sitting on the coffee machine's burner for too long as it could overheat and spoil the coffee's taste. You might also need to turn off the coffee machine, depending on its type and features to ensure safety after the coffee is made. In essence, the last step in the process of making coffee using a coffee machine is the collection of the brewed coffee into the carafe and then serving it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works.

Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” According to the above context, answer the following question. The author probably believes that what would probably help prevent burnout? The answer is:","output":"The author probably believes that maintaining a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences, managing stress effectively, and allowing time for recovery from the depletion of resources would help prevent burnout."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Immanuel Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, described time as an a priori intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience. With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that \\"flows,\\" that objects \\"move through,\\" or that is a \\"container\\" for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category. What type of measurements are used to quantify the number of events? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The question can be answered: To quantify the number of events, we typically use a counting system or numerical measurements.
