Please answer the following question: Who did Mr. Thomas want to remain in the family wall paper business?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Mr. and Mrs. Thomas are affluent New Yorkers who are unhappy that their adult children, Ralph Thomas and Phyl Thomas, spend so many evenings at parties instead of spending time with family.  Their disapproval deepens when they discover both children want to move out to pursue lifestyles that the parents deem unacceptable: Phyl moves into her own apartment so that she can conduct an affair with a married man, Duff Wilson. Her brother, Ralph, goes to Paris to pursue his dream of being a painter, thus disappointing his father who expected him to remain in the family wallpaper business. Mrs. Thomas repeatedly tries to invoke guilt in both children for not being with her, especially after Mr. Thomas dies of a stroke. Eventually, Phyl marries her paramour and Ralph returns to New York, having failed as an artist. Mrs. Thomas dies shortly after Ralph's return. At the end of the film, Phyl, her twin infants, her husband Duff, and her brother Ralph are all living in the family home, with a newfound appreciation for the benefits of family life. In the film's last scene, Ralph and Duff are laughing together about how Phyl has evolved into a protective maternal figure, much like her own mother.

(CNN) -- One of the telephone numbers used to report claims of abuse at a polygamist sect's Texas ranch was previously associated with a Colorado woman whom authorities have named a \\"person of interest,\\" a court document says. Rozita Swinton, 33, has been arrested in a case that is not directly related to the Texas raid. The telephone calls in late March prompted authorities to raid the Yearning For Zion (YFZ) Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, where 437 children were removed. The ranch is owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy. Although OPTIONS: - CNN officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Caller officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Colorado officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Eldorado officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Mormon officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Rozita Swinton officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Swinton officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Texas Rangers officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. - Yearning For Zion (YFZ) Ranch officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch.","output":"- Texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch.

The other options are wrong because they involve different groups or people who are not directly responsible for investigating the ranch in Texas.

Savage struggled in the first half against the Bengals' stout defense, being sacked on two back-to-back plays in the first quarter for a huge loss. The first score of the game came on a last second 43-yard field goal from Randy Bullock to put Cincinnati up 3-0 going into halftime. The Texans responded on their first possession in the second half with a 25-yard field goal from Nick Novak to tie the game at 3-3. The Bengals punted the ball on their next possession.

Cincinnati tried to respond to the Houston field goal, but a tipped pass from Andy Dalton was intercepted by Quentin Demps. The Texans came up short on the interception and were forced to punt the ball back. After receiving the kick, the Bengals quickly struck with Dalton finding Brandon LaFell for an 86-yard touchdown pass.

Such a mechanism may be involved in peripheral neuropathic pain.', 'A possible direct analgesic effect of BTX-A pain processing was investigated in 29 patients with focal painful neuropathies and mechanical allodynia using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Patients received a one-time intradermal administration of BTX-A (20-190 units) into the painful area.

Answer:","output":"(a). No. The provided statement, \\"It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation,\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question about the relationship between the directions of the velocity and force vectors in a circular motion. The statement describes the types of circular motion (uniform and non-uniform) but does not explain the relationship between force and velocity vectors. A more appropriate answer is as follows: In circular motion, the velocity vector is always tangent to the path of motion, pointing in the direction of the object's movement around the circle. The force vector, on the other hand, points toward the center of the circle, which is known as centripetal force. Centripetal force is responsible for keeping the object in its circular path. In a uniform circular motion, the object moves at a constant speed around the circle, meaning its angular rate of rotation is also constant. Although the speed remains constant, the direction of the velocity vector continually changes as the object goes around the circle. Therefore, acceleration exists, which also acts centripetally towards the center of the circle. In non-uniform circular motion, the rate of rotation (angular speed) is not constant. The object might experience angular acceleration, leading to changes in both speed and direction. In this case, the force vector still has a centripetal component that acts towards the center of the circle, but it might also have a tangential component that causes the change in the object's speed. So, the relationship between the velocity and force vectors in circular motion is that the velocity vector is always tangent to the circular path, while the force vector has a centripetal component directed towards the circle's center. This relationship holds in both uniform and non-uniform circular motion, although additional tangential force components may exist in non-uniform motion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading \\"like a disease\\" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane. Against her programming, a female servant android refuses a guest's request for sex. The failures increase until the robotic Black Knight kills a guest in a sword-fight in MedievalWorld. The resort's supervisors, in increasing desperation, attempt to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. Unfortunately, this results in trapping them...

U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: After President Buhari's meeting with Trump, how does he really feel about President Trump? Options:  A. He doesn't believe President Trump feels remorse for his comments  B. He is very cautious, but will use the relationship to his advantage  C. He believes they both suspended any ill feelings  D. not enough information  === The correct answer is","output":"D. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Definition: Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a counterfactual context, the task is to generate a new story ending aligned with the counterfactual context and as close to the original ending as possible. Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story.

She added water to the tank and turned on the machine.   Counterfactual Context: She took a nap. Output:","output":"The task here is asking you to rewrite the story's ending in a way that is consistent with a new, altered circumstance (counterfactual context), while keeping the ending as similar as possible to the original ending. The guidelines provided are: 1. The premise: This is the first sentence of the story, which sets the scene or explains the initial situation. In the given example, the premise is \\"Anna was still a little tired.\\" 2. The initial context: This is the second sentence which makes the story more specific. It provides more information about the situation, early action, or plans the character has. For this task, it's \\"So she decided to make more coffee.\\" 3. The original ending: These are the last three sentences, which form the initial ending of the story. Here it is about Anna emptying out the coffee pot, putting in a new filter along with coffee grounds, adding water to the tank, and then turning on the machine. 4. The counterfactual context: This is a modified version of the initial context, which changes the direction of the story. In this case, instead of making more coffee to tackle her tiredness, \\"She took a nap.\\" To perform the task, you need to write an ending to the story that fits the counterfactual context but still stays as close as possible to the actions and themes of the original ending. You have to gauge the modifying impact of the counterfactual context on the original ending and accordingly write the new ending.  For example: New ending: \\"Anna settled down on the couch comfortably. She pulled the warm blanket over her. Soon she was lost in a peaceful nap.\\" Here, the new ending is crafted considering that Anna, instead of making coffee, elects to take a nap, but the actions - settling down and getting comfortable - still represent the care taken in the preparation steps from the original ending."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Two teams of runners took part in a study about exercise.

Your answer:","output":"A rapid extinction of organisms, also known as a mass extinction, is a catastrophic event that leads to a significant reduction in the number of species on Earth in a relatively short period. Mass extinctions have occurred several times throughout Earth's history, with the most famous example being the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) event that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs. Several factors can cause mass extinctions, such as intense volcanic activity, climate change, invasive species, or cosmic events like asteroid impacts. The event that would most likely cause a rapid extinction of organisms is a large-scale cosmic impact event, specifically a collision with a massive asteroid or comet. Here's why a large-scale cosmic impact event would be the most likely cause of a rapid extinction of organisms: 1. Sudden and widespread devastation: A massive asteroid or comet impact would cause enormous destruction upon collision with Earth. The impact would release an immense amount of energy equivalent to the explosion of millions of nuclear bombs. This instantaneous release of energy would cause widespread fires and a massive heat pulse, incinerating a large portion of Earth's biomass and killing a considerable number of organisms in the direct vicinity of the impact. 2. Global climate change: The massive amounts of debris and dust ejected into the atmosphere as a result of the impact event would lead to a dramatic decrease in sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. This phenomenon, called an \\"impact winter,\\" would result in a rapid drop in global temperatures, often lasting for years or even decades. A sudden, extreme shift in the climate would have severe consequences for many species, disrupting food chains, ecosystems, and habitats. 3. Ocean acidification: The impact event could also release substantial amounts of sulfur and other gases that would react with water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere, causing precipitation to become acidic. This acid rain could alter the chemistry of the oceans, leading to ocean acidification and directly affecting marine ecosystems. Many marine species would not be able to survive the drastic change in their environment, leading to a cascade of extinctions throughout the food chain. 4. Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem collapse: The combination of widespread destruction, global climate change, and ocean acidification would have long-lasting effects on Earth's biodiversity. Entire ecosystems could collapse as species struggle to adapt to these rapid environmental changes. The loss of numerous species, especially those that play crucial roles in ecosystems (such as pollinators, predators, and decomposers), would significantly affect other organisms and further contribute to the rapid extinction of organisms. In conclusion, a large-scale cosmic impact event, such as a collision with a massive asteroid or comet, would be the most likely cause of a rapid extinction of organisms due to the vast and sudden devastation it would inflict upon Earth. The immediate destructive effects, coupled with the long-lasting and widespread ecological consequences, would lead to the collapse of ecosystems and the extinction of numerous species in a relatively short period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The invention of stained glass windows can be attributed to a man who likely lived where? Context: Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.

On the right side, we can combine the l terms: -12*l - 19*l = (-12 - 19)*l = -31*l. So, the equation becomes: -47*l - 336 = -31*l Step 2: Isolate the variable (l) by moving it to one side of the equation. To do this, start by adding 31*l to both sides to eliminate it from the right side: -47*l + 31*l - 336 = -31*l + 31*l This simplifies to: -16*l - 336 = 0 Step 3: Isolate l by moving the constant term (-336) to the other side of the equation. To do this, add 336 to both sides: -16*l - 336 + 336 = 0 + 336 This simplifies to: -16*l = 336 Step 4: Solve for l by dividing both sides by the coefficient of l, which is -16: -16*l / -16 = 336 / -16 This gives: l = -21 So, the solution for the equation -47*l - 336 = -12*l - 19*l is l = -21."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: BEIRUT (AP) — An Internet video purports to show the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State group.      Sotloff, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syrian in August 2013 until he appeared in a video released online last month by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.      Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq.      In the video distributed Tuesday and entitled \\"A Second Message to America,\\" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine      This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds)      The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| Story highlights \\"Stay tuned\\" for plans to combat ISIS, a State Department official says      A video has emerged showing the 31-year-old journalist being beheaded      Footage threatens the life of another man      ISIS beheaded journalist James Foley; in that video, the terrorist group threatened to kill Sotloff      A video that shows the beheading of American Steven Sotloff was delivered as a \\"second message to America\\" to halt airstrikes in Iraq, following through on a threat to kill the journalist.      In the video posted Tuesday online, Sotloff says -- in a message surely scripted by his captors -- that he is \\"paying the price\\" for U.S. military intervention.      The intelligence community in the United States is working to confirm the authenticity of the video, and the journalist's family was waiting for that formal authentication that Sotloff has been killed.

The killing of Sotloff follows a threat last month by ISIS made during the videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley. The latest video threatens the life of another man.      A masked ISIS figure in the new video speaks to U.S. President Barack Obama, telling him, \\"Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.\\"      The Islamic State has thrived and mutated during the civil war in Syria. It swept into Iraq in June, seizing large swaths of the country's Sunni-dominated northern and western provinces.      Obama ordered targeted airstrikes in Iraq to begin in early August after ISIS fighters began targeting ethnic Yazidis and launching attacks toward the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.      ISIS appeared to date the execution video of Sotloff, referencing specific U.S. military actions in recent days, including U.S. airstrikes that helped over the weekend to break the siege of Amerli -- a northern Iraqi town home to thousands of minority Shiite Turkmen.      Intelligence officials are analyzing the video, trying to answer some key questions, a senior U.S. administration official said.      Among the questions, the official said: When was it shot? Where was it shot? Is the killer in the Sotloff video the same one in the Foley video?      Until they answer those questions, the official said the administration does not want to speculate.      It's believed ISIS is still holding a \\"small number\\" of Americans hostage, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

CNN could not immediately confirm when he was taken captive.      But the Washington Post reported he was an aid worker abducted in March 2013. The newspaper, citing unnamed aid workers involved in efforts to gain his release, said he was abducted near a refugee camp in the northern Syrian province of Idlib.      British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters he was aware of reports about the video and called Sotloff's killing \\"an absolutely disgusting and despicable act.\\"      Who was Sotloff?      Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public. Out of public view, the family and government agencies had been trying to gain his release for the past year.      Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.      \\"Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,\\" she said. \\"He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.\\"      Her plea was met with taunting responses on social media by ISIS supporters.      Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians including the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies including \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and \\"The Big Lebowski\\" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a \\"stand-up philosopher from Miami.\\"      He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and The Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey -- among other countries -- and eventually Syria.

Response from the White House      White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration \\"has obviously been watching very carefully since this threat against Mr. Sotloff's life was originally made a few weeks ago.\\"      A top U.S. State Department official told CNN's Christiane Amanpour to \\"stay tuned\\" on U.S. plans to combat the organization.      \\"We are putting the features in place, developing a broad regional coalition, a broad international coalition, working to get a new Iraqi government stood up, working to get our plans in place.

Obama, who was briefed on the videotaped execution of Sotloff, came under fire from Republicans and Democrats who called on the President to take stronger against ISIS, also known as ISIL.      The criticism came a week after Obama said, \\"We don't have a strategy yet\\" to deal with ISIS in Syria. Obama said he has asked America's top defense officials to prepare \\"a range of options.\\"      \\"Mr. President, if you can't come up with a strategy, at least tell us what the goal is regarding ISIL,\\" said Sen.

Her heart swelled with affection, and she knew that today would be one of the most memorable days of her life. Entering the fenced-in play area, her eyes sparkled with anticipation. Several puppies ran toward her, tails wagging excitedly, eager to greet their newest visitor. Kaylee knelt down, her arms outstretched to welcome them. The soft fur and playful nips sent shivers of happiness down her spine. She could see that each of the puppies had a unique personality and charm, making the decision even more difficult. Kaylee's parents lovingly watched from a distance as she interacted with the frisky bunch. Knowing how much their daughter had wanted a furry companion, they were overjoyed to see her dreams finally coming true. As they chatted with the breeder about the puppies' care, they couldn't help but feel a heartwarming sense of accomplishment for giving their precious girl this incredible gift. As the minutes went by, Kaylee began to carefully observe the puppies. She considered which one would make the perfect addition to their family and home. One in particular caught her attention - a slightly smaller beagle with a distinctive white patch on its chest. The puppy seemed to possess a curious and gentle nature, repeatedly inching forward to sniff at Kaylee's hand and then scampering back to the safety of its siblings. Drawn to its endearing shyness, Kaylee reached out to the timid pup and scooped it up into her arms. The puppy whimpered a little, unsure of its new situation, but soon began to relax and snuggle into Kaylee's embrace.

Title: Videodrome Movie plot: Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of CIVIC-TV (Channel 83, Cable 12), a Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalistic programming. Displeased with his station's current lineup (which mostly consists of softcore pornography and gratuitous violence), Max is looking for something that will break through to a new audience. One morning, he is summoned to the clandestine office of Harlan (Peter Dvorsky), who operates CIVIC-TV's unauthorized satellite dish which can intercept broadcasts from as far away as Asia. Harlan shows him Videodrome, a plotless television show apparently being broadcast out of Malaysia which depicts the brutal torture and eventual murder of anonymous victims in a reddish-orange chamber. Believing this to be the future of televisionâ(staged) snuff TVâMax orders Harlan to begin unlicensed use of the show. Appearing on a talk show, Max defends his station's programming choices to Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry), a sadomasochistic psychiatrist and radio host, and Professor Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley), a pop-culture analyst and philosopher who will only appear on television if his image is broadcast into the studio, onto a television, from a remote location. O'Blivion delivers a speech prophesying a future in which television supplants real life. Max dates Nicki, who is sexually aroused when he shows her an episode of Videodrome and coaxes him into having sex with her while they watch it. Max goes once again to Harlan's office, where Harlan tells him that the signal delay which caused it to appear to be coming from Malaysia was a ploy by the broadcaster and that Videodrome is being broadcast out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Max tells Nicki this and she excitedly goes to Pittsburgh to try and audition for the show under the guise of a business trip, but never returns.

Paragraph :  In erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles.  Question:   A fast moving stream is capable of carrying larger or smaller particles than a slow moving stream? The answer to this question is:","output":"A fast moving stream is capable of carrying both larger and smaller particles compared to a slow moving stream. The information given in the paragraph mentions that in erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. This implies that the capacity of a stream to carry particles is influenced by its speed. As the speed of the stream increases, so does its ability to carry more massive particles. Erosion is a natural process where the Earth's surface gets worn down due to wind, water, and ice movement. In the context of streams, the flowing water picks up and transports particles of various sizes like sand, silt, clay, pebbles, and even larger rocks depending on the water's velocity. A fast moving stream possesses a higher kinetic energy that enables it to lift, transport, and carry more massive particles or sediment sizes that a slow moving stream would not be able to move. This higher kinetic energy is instrumental in the erosional process and contributes to the breakdown and transportation of materials from one place to another. Conversely, a slow moving stream has lower kinetic energy and, as a result, can only carry smaller particles like fine sand, silt, and clay. The larger rocks or pebbles remain on the stream bed as they are too heavy for the slow moving stream to lift and transport. In conclusion, a fast moving stream is capable of carrying both larger and smaller particles, whereas a slow moving stream can only carry smaller particles due to its lower kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

The 135,000 piece of equipment was next seen at the site of the ATM. A would-be robber was hoping to make off with with an ATM machine and thought he had the perfect tool. The suspect ended up fleeing the scene without the cash or construction equipment. A wannabe robber tried to pry open a drive-through ATM using a stolen forklift. The 10,000-pound industrial forklift was stolen from a nearby construction site early Monday and driven a half mile to Synovus Bank. Although the machine was smashed, the actual forklift remained intact and with very little damage. No suspect information has been made available. An officer on scene was seen dusting a large industrial sized truck for fingerprints. The ATM was later wrapped with police tape, but remained in its same location. No cash was stolen during the attempted robbery. The thief tried to double down, piercing the bulky ATM machine with twin forks. Despite visible damage to the ATM, it wouldn't budge and held as firm as any bank vault and the wannabe robber walked away empty-handed. The thief left the forklift embedded in the ATM machine and ran off. Police were alerted to the botched theft by a bank employee at 7 a.m. and have been combing the area for fingerprints.

At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States by the fall.Respondents of the surveys also were sharply divided on whether they would be willing to accept refugees from Syria in particular, with 61 percent of Republicans saying the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees, compared to 27 percent of Democrats.

Some options are Wang Lang Market or Tha Tien Market, offering a wide variety of dishes to try. Allocate around 1 hour for lunch. 5. Visit a shopping mall or experience street shopping: To get a sense of Bangkok's modern side, spend some time at one of the famous shopping malls like Siam Paragon or CentralWorld. Alternatively, experience street shopping at markets like Chatuchak Weekend Market or ASIATIQUE The Riverfront. Set aside about 2 hours for this. 6. Eat street food for dinner: Sample Bangkok's famed street food at places like Yaowarat Road in Chinatown or Ratchawat and Sriyan Markets. These areas serve an array of delicious Thai dishes, so allocate approximately 1 hour for dinner. 7. Conclude the day with a rooftop bar experience: To experience Bangkok's nightlife and enjoy its breathtaking skyline, head to a rooftop bar like Sky Bar at Lebua State Tower or Octave Rooftop Lounge at Bangkok Marriott Hotel.

One of the hippies is pregnant and is not taking part in the ritual; she sees Sylvia and drags her into the clearing, where Horace freaks out over the fact that their ritual has been observed. A more recent member of the group, Andy, admits that he met Sylvia in town and invited her along, prompting Horace to violently hit him. Sylvia becomes frightened and runs away, but two other members of the group chase after her and catch her in the woods, where they brutalize her.The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that:  \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\"","output":"The present-day name of the islands that were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris is St Kilda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Each category has specific features that you should use to make your decision. Solution: Sentence: \\"lung, pancreas, ovarian, and cervical cancers.\\" Section: Background To figure out whether the category is correct, let's examine the sentence in the context of each category's definition: 1. Background - This category usually offers context or explains the importance of the problem, previous relevant works, what's lacking in them, high-level research questions, and how this research might benefit other researchers. 2. Purpose - This category entails specific objectives, goals, or hypotheses that the researchers aim to achieve or test. 3. Method - This category involves procedures and steps of the research that the researchers followed to obtain their results. 4. Finding - This category presents the outcomes of the research, such as achievements, conclusions, and observed behaviors. Given the sentence only lists some types of cancers, we can assume it's part of providing context for the research topic and addressing the importance of studying these specific cancers. Therefore, the sentence best fits the Background category. Answer: True In this case, the given category, Background, is correct for the sentence.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Because I am extremely vulnerable to both slick advertising and peer pressure, I've been thinking about getting an iPad. But here's the problem: I'm cheap, and the iPad's not. If I'm going to fork over at least 499 for a new device, I want to try it out and make sure it's not just a larger, shinier version of my iPhone. But if I went to my local Apple Store, I'd get to spend only a few minutes testing out the machine. I wanted more time than that, so I rented one for 15 a day from a guy on SnapGoods. The Internet start-up in Brooklyn runs on simple reasoning: there are people who want to borrow stuff - camping equipment, food processors, robot vacuums, etc. - and there are people who have stuff they want to lend. SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land). But regardless of whether the sharing is free or involves a fee, these transactions often come with a stick-it-to-the-man attitude. \\"Borrow these things from your neighbors,\\" reads one earnest request on neighborrow.com, \\"The owner-ship has SAILED!\\" All of these sites are encouraging something academics call collaborative consumption - in other words, peer-to-peer sharing or renting. Renting something you don't need to use very often makes a lot more sense than buying it and letting it collect dust in your garage. There's a green aspect as well, since sharing helps cut down on overall use of resources. But one of collaborative consumption's most surprising benefits turns out to be social. In an era when families are scattered around the country and we may not know the people down the street from us, sharing things - even with strangers we've just met online - allows us to make meaningful connections. \\"This isn't just about saving the environment or saving a dollar,\\"...

We will examine each usage below to provide a clearer understanding of the similarities and differences in the contexts. In the first sentence from BBC News (2004), the term \\"prise\\" refers to using tools (such as pliers, scissors, rubber gloves, and knives) to force open products. This context clearly highlights the application of physical force or pressure to separate or open the items. In modern English, \\"prise\\" or its more common alternative \\"pry\\" (particularly in American English) is understood to mean the act of using force to move or open something. The second sentence from Sax Rohmer's novel, \\"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper\\" (1919), also utilizes the meaning of \\"prise,\\" but in a slightly different context. Here, the term relates to a character attempting to open a box (presumably locked, closed, or stuck) when he was attacked. In this early 20th-century usage, \\"prise\\" likewise denotes the application of force or leverage to open the box. The subtle difference to note is that, in the early 1900s, \\"prise\\" may have been a more commonly used term for this meaning than in current times where its alternative \\"pry\\" is often preferred. In summary, \\"prise\\" carries the same meaning in both sentences, albeit with a slight shift in usage over time. In both instances, the term refers to the act of applying force or pressure to open or separate objects that are difficult to access."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older... According to the above context, answer the following question. The author probably believes that: OPTIONS:  --not enough information.  --they are only recommended to aging adults.  --laboratory results are accurate.  --laboratory results are easily understandable without interpretations from medical doctors. Answer:","output":"laboratory results are accurate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Where would you carry a small folding knife?  Choices:  - kitchen drawer - fishing boat - pocket - garbage bag - table  The rationale to choose \\"pocket\\" as the answer is that:","output":"A small folding knife is a versatile tool designed for easy transport and accessibility in various situations. The most practical option for carrying a small folding knife would be in your pocket. Here is the rationale behind selecting \\"pocket\\" as the optimal choice: 1. Portability: A small folding knife is designed to be compact and easily transportable. Placing it in your pocket ensures that it is easily accessible at all times, and you can carry it with you wherever you go. This provides you with a convenient tool for various purposes like cutting ropes, opening packages, or even in self-defense situations. 2. Safety: Folding knives are specifically designed with safety features that prevent the blade from accidentally opening while being carried. Storing the knife in your pocket helps ensure that these safety features are utilized, reducing the risk of accidental injuries. 3. Versatility: Carrying a small folding knife in your pocket ensures that you have a useful tool on hand for a wide range of scenarios. Whether you're outdoors camping, hiking, or fishing, or even indoors at home or work, having a folding knife readily available can prove invaluable in many situations. 4. Convenience: Other options, such as placing the knife in a kitchen drawer, a fishing boat, a garbage bag, or on a table, can be limiting and situational. The kitchen drawer, for example, would restrict its accessibility to only when you are indoors. A fishing boat would indicate that the knife is primarily used for fishing activities. Garbage bags and tables are also impractical choices as they can either lead to the knife getting lost or posing a hazard. In summary, carrying a small folding knife in your pocket is the optimal choice due to its portability, safety, versatility, and convenience. Having a folding knife readily available in your pocket ensures that you have a handy tool for various situations, while also minimizing the risk of accidents and providing quick access when needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context:  After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

They were careful to show respect for the sprites' way of life, and to express genuine interest in their stories and experiences. Step 2: Observing daily activities Oraden and Tahir observed the sprites going about their everyday tasks, taking note of their rituals, habits, and the relationships between individuals in the village.

You exclude the assets you use for everyday life. For example, your primary residence, car, clothes and business equipment are not used in your zakat asset calculations. It's based on what's left after you take care of you and your family's living expenses.   Some examples of zakat-eligible assets include stocks, savings, investment properties, cash, business income or precious metals such as gold. Determine how much your zakat-eligible assets are worth for the year. Debt from credit cards, college or other loans subtracts from your personal net worth. These outstanding debts are deducted from your total zakat-eligible assets.  If you obtained a personal loan of any type (car, home, cash), then look at how much you pay per month to your creditors, not the entire outstanding debt. Add up how much you owe each month to your creditors. Multiple this amount by 12 to calculate your annual liability amount. Subtract your liabilities from your zakat-eligible assets. For example, your assets for the year total 6,000 and your liabilities total 2,000. Your zakat net worth or zakat pool of money is 4,000 (6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000).","output":"This article talks about how to figure out how much zakat (charity) you need to pay. First, find out what things you own, but not the things you use every day like your house or car. Then, see how much these things are worth. Take away any money you owe for things like credit cards or loans. Now, you have your zakat net worth.

Article: Television and films are good too, but it's better if you have something you can watch over and over and over and over. You can really get down the content, start noticing things you never noticed before, and your brain can relax instead of flailing about, trying to keep up. Ask some friends if they have a series you can borrow!  Thanks to satellite TV, British, American and Australian television programmes and films are widely available all over the world. Try recording them! Watch with subtitles at first and then without them as you gain confidence. The better you get, the more you'll look forward to \\"studying.\\" Try watching a TV show or movie with English subtitles and a second time with subtitles in your native language. The BBC World Service is just one excellent source of spoken English and even broadcasts programs for learners. Have it on in the background while you go about doing your household tasks. Just streaming English all the time can help you learn it passively. You don't have to sit down and stare at your radio -- just let it soak in!  Radio a little too old-fashioned? You've no excuse -- there's internet radio, too, you know! There are podcasts on virtually every subject and the classics like NPR and \\"This American Life\\" can all be found online. Podcasts allow you to slow down and rewind broadcasts so you can re-listen phrases that are unfamiliar to you. You can listen to the radio online, watch TV clips, read articles, and even play games to improve your English. You can even chat with people! There are also many pages on the web dedicated to teaching English as a foreign language. Real people are better, but the Internet is still a great tool. Both the BBC and Wikipedia have versions of their site aimed at ESL learners. But there are also dozens of other websites that offer worksheets, articles, word problems, and stories that are at specific grade levels, too. If you're not in a class or don't have a native speaker at your disposal, it may seem pretty hard to get better at writing. How do you know if you're doing it correctly? Simple! Use websites that will correct your work! Search through Google to find websites that assist in correcting your grammar - many which are free of charge. Again, no excuses! It's easy to forget about the writing skill. But doing this, too, as much as you can, will make serious waves in your improvements. Write your emails in English, write yourself notes in English, write your blog in English. Even if you can't correct it, make it a habit. Not only is it fun, but you will learn words and pronunciation. And new music! Pick one each day and study it until you know it by heart. Find a genre that appeals to you and choose some songs that don't go too fast -- hardcore rap is not a good place to start when it comes to learning English! Think the Beatles, Michael Buble, Elvis, or even musical theatre. This can be a substitution to listening to the radio. Have the songs you've been learning playing in the background and sing along! And then, who knows, maybe you'll find yourself at karaoke next weekend! Rosetta Stone can cost a pretty penny, but it's useful. Some even offer accessibility to a native speaker! But that's not the only kid on the block -- there's Pimsleur and Michel Thomas as well, just to name two more. Each advocates a different type of learning -- which one would work best for you? Ask around if anyone in your circle has these CDs already. There's no point in paying for them twice! And some of the stuff can be found online, too. You just gotta get a little creative! Download a free app on your smartphone or tablet to help you learn the language. Many apps feature interactive games so you can practice speaking and recognizing the English language. Look for apps like DuoLingo, Memrise, or Busuu. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a variety of suggestions and resources for learning and improving English language skills. These methods include watching TV shows and films, listening to English radio stations or podcasts, using websites and apps designed for English learners, writing emails and notes in English, and learning English through song lyrics.

Hi, Carolyn: Both of my parents died in the past year. I had spent every single Christmas with them at my childhood home. Needless to say, I am dreading the holidays. I have small children of my own now. If one more person tells me to start my own tradition I’ll scream. If we had more money I would go away to someplace warm, but that’s not in the cards. Is there anything I can do that won’t make it suck? Orphan at Christmas: You could just embrace the suck. It sounds as if that’s what you want to do, actually; you’re ruling out the only logical answers as too daunting or expensive. Any time you find yourself asking people for suggestions and then rejecting them all, consider that you already know what you want and just crave others’ permission to want it. I am very sorry about your parents. Losing both in one year makes for a much more abrupt transition. So don’t try to hide from or change any of it: You don’t have what you want, you’re grieving, you have little kids who need you, and you just want to crawl into a hole, and everyone has a pat answer for something you think is anything but. What approach accommodates all of these? Can you hand off the planning to your spouse? Do you have sibs to commiserate with? Can you think of the minimum you need to do for your kids (small kids require minimal holiday fuss), and set aside a block of time for honoring your parents, and one for just giving yourself what you need? If even that’s too much, you really can wing it. Holidays are just days, whenever you need them to be. Some of the freight can come off. Re: Orphan: My father died the week before Christmas. I got sick of people telling us to make our own tradition — I liked our old one just fine. We went with the flow and did what felt right each year. The first year was a movie and Chinese. Ten years later we have traditions back. It took time to heal — don’t deny that process! Re: Orphan: You don’t have to start a tradition as some huge, fully thought-out event that you are locked into for the rest of your life. When our kids were really young I started a Christmas Eve thing where I would buy every single frozen appetizer that looked good. I would just keep throwing sheets in the oven and we would all sit around the fireplace with Christmas music and eat whatever we wanted. The kids loved it so much I still do it — and they are 28 and 30. Just be with people you care about. That is the only tradition that matters. Anonymous: Brilliant idea. Stealing it. Re: Orphan: I’m so sorry for your loss. I lost my mom in February last year, and I was dreading the holidays. And I was paralyzed, like you. So I punted to my husband, and he rose to the occasion and made us a plan. So that’s my answer: Your husband probably isn’t mourning as you are, so please ask for his help.

Choose the next sentence.(CNN) -- Mohamed Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vowed to stand for democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won the Egyptian presidency. He is also an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders \\"vampires\\" and \\"killers.\\" One analyst describes him as an \\"icon\\" of those seeking an \\"extreme agenda.\\" On Monday, the Muslim Brotherhood announced that Morsi, 60, had defeated his rival Ahmed Shafik, who briefly served as prime minister in the waning days of Mubarak's regime, in the weekend run-off election. The official vote count was scheduled to be finished at some point Monday, with final results to be announced Thursday \\"It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President OPTIONS: - Ahmed Shafik.\\" - American.\\" - CNN.\\" - Egyptian.\\" - Freedom and Justice Party.\\" - Islamist.\\" - Israel.\\" - Israeli.\\" - Mohamed Morsi.\\" - Morsi.\\" - Mubarak.\\" - Muslim Brotherhood.\\"","output":"Hosni Mubarak.\\" \\"It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak.\\" This sentence further elaborates on the complex political landscape in Egypt at the time. Following the January 2011 revolution, the country saw the end of President Hosni Mubarak's regime, which had been in power for more than 30 years. The military council then took over, leading to a turbulent transition period marked by ongoing protests and struggles for power. It was within this context that Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, emerged victorious in the presidential run-off election against Ahmed Shafik, who had served as prime minister during Mubarak's final days in power. Morsi's victory was seen as a significant success for the Brotherhood, which had been outlawed and suffered persecution under the previous regime. However, the situation was far from settled, as the military council continued to wield significant power, and suspicion arose that it might undermine the gains made by the Brotherhood and other new political forces since the revolution. As a result, many saw Morsi's election as a test of the commitment to democracy and the new political order in Egypt, as well as a reflection of the challenges and internal divisions that the country faced in its ongoing process of political transformation. Additionally, Morsi's controversial positions and past remarks further fueled the debate about his presidency and its implications for Egypt's future. While he vowed to be a champion of democracy, women's rights, and peaceful relations with Israel, his record and affiliations with the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood raised questions and concerns. Critics pointed to his calls for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and his inflammatory statements against Israeli leaders as evidence of a potentially extremist agenda. Ultimately, Morsi's tenure as president was short-lived, as massive protests and a military coup in 2013 led to his ouster and the suspension of the Egyptian constitution. His presidency serves as a cautionary tale of the difficulties and complexities faced by countries undergoing a transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, as well as the challenges of balancing and reconciling diverse political forces and ideologies in the pursuit of a more inclusive and stable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During his childhood, he made a commitment to work as a servant at Veerabhadraiah's place to buy medicines for his ailing mother. Veerabhadraiah was a wealthy landlord who was well-known in the village. Growing up, Ramudu had a childhood friend named Lakshmi. They were inseparable and looked after each other. As they grew older, Ramudu continued to work at Veerabhadraiah's and stayed true to his commitment, while Lakshmi constantly faced struggles in her life. One day, she found herself in a dangerous situation when she was cornered by Babulu, a notorious thug in the village. In this moment of despair, Seetha, a courageous young woman, came to Lakshmi's rescue. Seetha was an outsider who had witnessed the attempted attack and risked her safety to save Lakshmi. As they managed to escape from Babulu, Seetha and Lakshmi quickly developed a strong bond. Knowing the troubles that Lakshmi had been facing, Seetha decided to help her find shelter. They approached Mohan, a kind-hearted man known for his philanthropy. Touched by Lakshmi's story, Mohan agreed to provide her with shelter at his place. During her stay at Mohan's, Lakshmi often found solace by visiting the local doctor for emotional and physical support. The doctor was impressed by Lakshmi's virtues and resilience amidst the adversities she faced in life. As time went on, the doctor fell in love with Lakshmi and soon, he expressed his desire to marry her. Lakshmi, who had always admired the doctor's kindness and compassion, agreed to the proposal. On the day of their wedding, Ramudu, Seetha, and Mohan attended the joyous event, celebrating the union of Lakshmi and the doctor. As they stood together, the friends marveled at the strength and love that had brought them all together, despite the many challenges they faced.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood.  I am facing a new situation today: Adam and his older brother Chris were born almost 15 years apart from each other. Adam is 27 now which means Chris is 41.  Lately Chris has started noticing grey hairs come in. When Adam and him play games together Chris also seems to lose more often now even though historically he has always been better.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which brother is likely experiencing a decline in strength, Adam or Chris? The answer is:","output":"Chris is likely experiencing a decline in strength. Step 1: Compare ages of the brothers Adam is 27, and Chris is 41 years old.  Step 2: Identify the stage of life for each brother According to the background article, middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. Given their ages, Adam is in early adulthood, while Chris is in middle adulthood. Step 3: Recall the physical changes and decline during middle adulthood The article states that during middle adulthood, people start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Vision, strength, and reaction time also start declining during this stage of life. Step 4: Evaluate the evidence for decline in strength Chris has started noticing gray hairs and losing more often in games, even though he historically has been better than Adam. This suggests that he is likely experiencing a decline in strength and possibly reaction time. Step 5: Answer the question Based on this information, and considering that Chris is in middle adulthood, he is more likely to be experiencing a decline in strength compared to Adam, who is still in early adulthood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: a ) 23 , b ) 27 3 / 4 , c ) 20 1 / 2 , d ) 27 1 / 2 , e ) 11 A:","output":"b ) 27 3 / 4 Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work and the formula: Work = number of men * number of days. From the problem, we know that 14 men can complete the work in 32 days. So, the work can be represented as: Work = 14 men * 32 days Now, we are asked for the number of days required for 16 men to complete the same work. Let's represent the unknown number of days as \\"x\\". Then, we can write the equation for the given scenario: Work = 16 men * x days Since both the equations represent the same work, we can set them equal to each other: 14 men * 32 days = 16 men * x days Next, we need to solve for x. First, divide both sides of the equation by the number of men: (14 men * 32 days) / 16 men = x days The \\"men\\" on both sides of the equation cancels out, leaving only: (14 * 32) / 16 = x days Now, perform the multiplication and division: (448) / 16 = x days x = 28 days However, the closest answer to 28 in the given options is 27 3/4 days.

Article: Sleep helps your body recover and fight inflammation, so it’s important to get a full night’s sleep, which for most people is between 7 and 8 hours. If you’re having trouble getting that much sleep, reorganize your schedule so that you’re devoting enough time to preparing for sleep and sleeping every day.  If you have trouble falling asleep, try relaxing before bedtime and avoiding looking at electronic screens once in bed. These practices can help people fall asleep faster. If you have chronic trouble with insomnia, speak with your doctor about potential medical solutions, like cognitive behavior therapy. One of the many health benefits of exercise is that it can reduce inflammation. Your 2.5 hours of exercise a week only needs to be moderate in intensity, meaning it raises your heartbeat but does not necessarily strain your muscles, like taking a walk. Spread your 2.5 hours of exercise throughout the week. If you’re worried about aggravating an injury, speak to your doctor or physical therapist about how to develop an exercise plan that works for you. Use a Fitbit or other personal fitness tracker to help you meet your exercise goals during the week. High levels of stress can increase inflammation in the body. They can also make it more difficult to sleep, which helps the body fight inflammation. Take small breaks when working during the day, perhaps just to get some fresh air or stretch for a couple minutes. Give yourself time at the end of the day to relax by exercising, engaging in a hobby, or simply spending time with friends or family members. if you need to.

We stopped by Cupcakes-A-Go-Go last Saturday night about about 7:40 and they had a plethora of available flavors. To me this is good AND bad.  Good, because it means that there is more for me to choose from. Bad because it means they are clearly not the type of shop that makes all their cupcakes fresh in the morning and keep them out until they sell out.  It makes me wonder, on the average, how long they DO sit out - are most made the day of? Just wondering...  As for the cupcakes themselves, well, I will review each one individually because I feel like they were all pretty different.  Here is the order I tried them. (For the record, I did not eat these all myself, I did share...a little.) ;)  1. Mint Oreo: This was the first one I tried, and I was very impressed. The cake was moist and dense with excellent flavor. The frosting was their \\"traditional\\" cream cheese based frosting (which I know only from reading other Yelp reviews) and it fit the cupcake well. It was also thick and dense and complimented the cake perfectly. This one was great. :)  2. Lemon Meringue: I was expecting a nice zesty lemon cupcake. I was disappointed. The cake was a bit dry and the flavor just so-so. The meringue frosting tasted fine. I was pretty underwhelmed.  3. Peanut Butter Cookie Dough: I was SO excited for this cupcake. I was SO let down. The cake was very, very dry.  The chunk of cookie dough in the middle was hard. The frosting was the cream cheese based frosting again, which just didn't fit with the rest of it. It did not feel like a cohesive dessert.  None of worked together. It was not good. Bummer.  4. Black Forest: First of all - this cupcake looked incredible. It was like the picture-perfect cupcake with it's chocolate cake, white whipped frosting, and a cherry on top. And, I'm happy to report that it tasted even better than it looked!! The cake was just right - sweet, moist, melted in my mouth.  The cherries were tasty and didn't feel like they came from a can. The whipped topping was just like grandma makes - not super sweet and made of fresh whipping cream. The entire thing my my trip to Cupcakes-A-Go-Go worth it.  THIS is what I hoped all my cupcakes would be.  I also purchased a Strawberries and Cream cupcake and a German Chocolate cupcake, but I was far too generous and gave those to my in-laws. What was I thinking?!    Part of me wants to give this place 3 stars - because only half of the cupcakes I tried were awesome - one was the opposite of awesome.  However, I think I will go with 4.  Really good, but could use some improvements.  I have now am halfway to a free cupcake (Buy 12 get one free - which is great because you don't have to buy all 12 at one time!), so I will definitely be back to try some more. Hopefully the next ones will wow me and force me to add that last star!

Answer the following question: Information:  - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of...  - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at...  - Eating disorders are mental disorders defined by abnormal eating habits that negatively affect a person's physical or mental health. They include binge eating disorder where people eat a large amount in a short period of time, anorexia nervosa where people eat very little and thus have a low body weight, bulimia nervosa where people eat a lot and then try to rid themselves of the food, pica where people eat non-food items, rumination disorder where people regurgitate food, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder where people have a lack of interest in food, and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders. Anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse are common among people with eating disorders. These disorders do not include obesity. The cause of eating disorders is not clear. Both biological and environmental factors appear to play a role. Cultural idealization of thinness is believed to contribute. Eating disorders affect about 12 percent of dancers. Those who have experienced sexual abuse are also more likely to develop eating disorders. Some disorders such as pica and rumination disorder occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities. Only one eating disorder can be diagnosed at a given time. Treatment can be effective for many eating disorders. This typically involves counselling, a proper diet, a normal amount of exercise, and the reduction of efforts to eliminate food. Hospitalization is occasionally needed. Medications may be used to help with some of the associated symptoms. At five years about 70% of people with anorexia and 50% of people with bulimia recover. Recovery from binge eating disorder is less clear and estimated at 20% to 60%. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death. In the developed world binge eating disorder affects about 1.6% of women and 0.8% of men in a given year. Anorexia affects about 0.4% and bulimia affects about 1.3% of young women in a given year. During the entire life up to 4% of women have anorexia, 2% have bulimia, and 2% have...  - Professor Gerald Francis Morris Russell (born 12 January 1928) is a British psychiatrist. In 1979 he published the first description of bulimia nervosa, and Russell's sign has been named after him.  - Bulimia nervosa , also known as simply bulimia , is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging . Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time . Purging refers to attempts to rid oneself of the food consumed . This may be done by vomiting or taking a laxative . Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics , stimulants , fasting , or excessive exercise . Most people with bulimia have a normal weight . The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth . Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression , anxiety , and problems with drugs or alcohol . There is also a higher risk of suicide and self - harm . Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition . The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30 % and 80 % . Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress , cultural pressure for a certain body type , poor self - esteem , and obesity . Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks . Diagnosis is based on a person 's medical history , however this is difficult as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits . Furthermore , the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia . Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder , Kleine - Levin syndrome , and borderline personality disorder . Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary treatment for bulimia . Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI ) or tricyclic antidepressant class may have a modest benefit . While outcomes with bulimia are typically better than in those of anorexia , the risk of death among those affected is higher than that of the general population . At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50 % of people are fully recovered . Globally , bulimia was estimated to affect 6.5...  - Vomiting, also known as emesis and throwing up, among other terms, is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose. Vomiting can be caused by a wide variety of conditions; it may present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis or poisoning, or as a non-specific sequela of disorders ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation. The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea, which often precedes, but does not always lead to, vomiting. Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may be required.  - A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a diagnosis by a mental health professional of a behavioral or mental pattern that may cause suffering or a poor ability to function in life. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. The causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis. Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers, using various methods but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options. Other treatments include social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression. Common mental disorders include depression, which affects about 400 million, dementia which affects about 35 million, and schizophrenia, which affects about 21 million people globally. Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion.   - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the...  - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If...  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial intervention that is the most widely used evidence-based practice for treating mental disorders. Guided by empirical research, CBT focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognitions (e.g., thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), behaviors, and emotional regulation. It was originally designed to treat depression, and is now used for a number of mental health conditions.  - A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry, the branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, study, and treatment of mental disorders. Psychiatrists are medical doctors, unlike psychologists, and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments, or strictly psychiatric.  - Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an interdisciplinary approach to clinical practice that has been gaining ground following its formal introduction in 1992. It started in medicine as evidence-based medicine (EBM) and spread to other fields such as audiology, speech-language pathology, dentistry, nursing, child life specialty, psychology, social work, education, library and information science. EBP is traditionally defined in terms of a \\"three legged stool\\" integrating three basic principles: (1) the best available research evidence bearing on whether and why a treatment works, (2) clinical expertise (clinical judgment and experience) to rapidly identify each patient's unique health state and diagnosis, their individual risks and benefits of potential interventions, and (3) client preferences and values   - Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men. Both environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal.

The woman puts an ice cube on her neck and asks if the man can feel it. She explains that these are goose bumps. Then she puts the ice cube on his neck. A woman in a nurses uniform looks trough the glass door before she enters, calling the woman Sissi (Franka Potente). She has mail and gives a letter to Sissi, who is very surprised about it, and to the man next to her. The man opens the letter immediately. The letter is written in Braille, which reveals that he is blind. Sissi doesnt open the letter immediately.In a big hall, a group of people gather together and sit in a big circle.

The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Letters to the Unseen\\" Step 1: Analyze the plot The plot revolves around a number of distant individuals who connect through letters and unexpected encounters. It involves sensitive topics such as mental health, loss, and existential questioning. The key elements are letter-writing, a mental health clinic, a blind man, and a woman named Sissi. It also touches on death and human connection in a delicate way. Step 2: Develop the title The main idea is about connection amongst unseen and distant people. These characters don't really 'see' each other in the usual ways - either because they're in different locations (such as the woman writing the first letter), in a mental health clinic (like Sissi), or because one is physically unable to see (the blind man). Therefore, the title should represent this idea of unseen connections or correspondences. \\"Letters\\" represent the medium of their connection. Hence, \\"Letters to the Unseen\\" is a fitting title for this movie plot as it touches on the themes of distance, unseen connections, and the significant role of letters within the narrative."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester.

It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves.  - The Seward Peninsula is a large peninsula on the western coast of the U.S. state of Alaska. It projects about into the Bering Sea between Norton Sound, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and Kotzebue Sound, just below the Arctic Circle. The entire peninsula is about long and - wide. Like Seward, Alaska, it was named after William H. Seward, the United States Secretary of State who fought for the U.S. purchase of Alaska.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The Kigluaik Mountains are a mountain chain running east to west on western Alaska's Seward Peninsula.  - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37\\" W.  - The Bendeleben (/bn.dle.bn/) Mountains are a mountain range on the heart of the Seward Peninsula in Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. This range forms a major divide between drainage basins draining into the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. The tallest peak, Mount Bendeleben is at the summit, and is located on the west end. Bits of the range go into the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, but most of the peaks remain unclaimed. The Tubutulik River flows in the area.  - Chukchi Sea is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Long Strait, off Wrangel Island, and in the east by Point Barrow, Alaska, beyond which lies the Beaufort Sea. The Bering Strait forms its southernmost limit and connects it to the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The principal port on the Chukchi Sea is Uelen in Russia. The International Date Line crosses the Chukchi Sea from northwest to southeast. It is displaced eastwards to avoid Wrangel Island as well as the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug on the Russian mainland.  - Kotzebue Sound (\\"Qikiqtaruk\\" in Iñupiaq) is an arm of the Chukchi Sea in the western region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is on the north side of the Seward Peninsula and bounded the east by the Baldwin Peninsula. It is long and wide.  - Seward (Alutiiq: \\"Qutalleq\\") is a city in Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. According to 2014 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city is 2,528. It was named after William H. Seward, United States Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. In 1867, he fought for the U.S. purchase of Alaska which he finally negotiated to acquire from Russia.  - Norton Sound is an inlet of the Bering Sea on the western coast of the U.S. state of Alaska, south of the Seward Peninsula. It is about 240 km (150 mi) long and 200 km (125 mi) wide. The Yukon River delta forms a portion of the south shore and water from the Yukon influences this body of water. It is ice-free from June to October.  - Mount Osborn is the highest point in the Kigluaik Mountains , and also on the Seward Peninsula . It is approximately 4714 feet high and is located on the north end of the range . Despite being almost one thousand feet taller , Osborn 's fame is matched by Mount Bendeleben ( located east of the Kigluaiks ) because Bendeleben is much taller than any of the peaks in its territory .  - The Secretary of State is a senior official of the federal government of the United States of America, and as head of the U.S. Department of State, is principally concerned with foreign policy and is considered to be the U.S. government's equivalent of a Minister for Foreign Affairs.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.  - William Henry Seward (May 16, 1801  October 10, 1872) was United States Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869, and earlier served as Governor of New York and United States Senator.

The WHO finds that poor cooking, heating and lighting technologies are killing millions of people each year. Indoor air pollution results from the use of dangerous fuels and cook-stoves in the home. To help fight the problem, the WHO announced, new guidelines aimed at reducing household pollutants. WHO officials say nearly three billion people are unable to use clean fuels and technologies for cooking? heating and lighting. And they say more than seven million people die from exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution each year. Of that number, the WHO says about 4. 3 million people die from household air pollution given off by simple coal cook-stoves. Most of the deaths are in developing countries. Carlos Dora is Coordinator in the WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. He says people should not use unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. He says opening a window or door to let out the harmful air will not improve the situation. It will only pollute the outdoors. WHO officials say indoor pollution leads to early deaths from stroke, heart and lung disease, childhood pneumonia and lung cancer. Women and girls are the main victims. The United Nations found that more than 95 percent of households in sub-Saharan Africa depend on solid fuels for cooking. It says huge populations in India, China and Latin American countries, such as Guatemala and Peru, are also at risk. Nigel Bruce is a professor of Public Health at the University of Liverpool. He says researchers are developing good cook-stoves and other equipment to burn fuels in a more efficient way. WHO experts note some new, safe and low-cost technologies that could help are already available. In India, you can buy an induction  stove for about   8.00. And in Africa a you can buy a solar lamp for less than  1. 00. Question: According to WHO officials, we can know that Yes or no, is the answer \\"simple coal cook-stoves cause too many deaths\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, according to WHO officials, simple coal cook-stoves cause too many deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 4.3 million people die from household air pollution each year, primarily due to the use of dangerous fuels and cook-stoves in the home. The majority of these deaths are occurring in developing countries where unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel are commonly used indoors for cooking, heating, and lighting. Indoor air pollution, which is a consequence of using these hazardous fuels and technologies in households, is responsible for a significant number of early deaths from various health conditions. These include stroke, heart and lung disease, childhood pneumonia, and lung cancer. Women and girls are predominantly affected due to their more significant involvement in cooking and domestic chores. The United Nations found that over 95% of households in sub-Saharan Africa rely on solid fuels for cooking. Populations in India, China, and Latin American countries like Guatemala and Peru are also at considerable risk as they depend on these dangerous fuels and cook-stoves for their day-to-day needs. In response to this alarming situation, the WHO has issued new guidelines to reduce household pollutants and improve overall indoor air quality. The organization emphasizes that people should avoid using unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. Opening windows and doors to let out toxic air does not significantly improve the situation. Instead, it only contributes to outdoor air pollution. Efforts are being made to develop safer and more efficient cook-stoves and technologies that can significantly reduce the number of deaths caused by household air pollution. Some affordable options, such as induction stoves in India and solar lamps in Africa, are already available for purchase. By investing in and adopting cleaner, better alternatives, the world can significantly lower the tragic death toll associated with simple coal cook-stoves and unsafe household practices."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: One event that helps educate young people about things they can do for others is National Youth Service Day (NYSD). Every year on this day, organizations all over the country celebrate young volunteers, educate young people about how they can help their country, and invite them to participate in service projects. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \\"National Youth Service Day honors young volunteers and is an invitation to others to join hands and do our part as Americans.\\" Founded in 1988, NYSD originally took place on a Tuesday. Now the event lasts from Friday until Sunday so that more people can participate in it. More than 200 organizations work together to create thousands of projects each year. Millions of young people across the United States take part in these service projects. Long before the event, people, community groups, schools, and nonprofit organizations think of ways to meet their communities' needs. Then, they plan projects for young volunteers. Projects include bringing food to hungry people, tutoring younger children and helping senior citizens. During the event, young people from the community do things like planting neighborhood gardens and cleaning up local parks. The organizations that contribute to NYSD believe that volunteering and community service are important activities for people of all ages, but especially for young people. Young people who volunteer are more likely to do well in school, vote, and contribute to charities. More important, they help other people and make the world a better place for everyone.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. His trial's over. And now it turns out that George Zimmerman might need the same thing millions of Americans are looking for: a job. As Zimmerman and his legal team mounted their defense, they convinced people across the country to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him. Living expenses, bodyguards and expert witnesses were costly, they argued on websites set up to raise money in the case. So what's next, now that a jury has acquitted him? For the 29-year-old Florida man, the financial picture is cloudy. Critics have already accused Zimmerman of profiting from the case. Will the donations keep pouring in? Will he win a monetary reward in his defamation lawsuit against NBC? Could he cash in on his personal story with a book or movie deal? Beyond the legal costs, Zimmerman's attorney says the case has come at a high price. Fear for his safety has made him live off the grid for months. \\"I don't know how he gets a job where he is out in public,\\" Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara said, \\"without having the fear of somebody finding out where he works.\\" Expert to Zimmerman: Pick a new career path. Before he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012, Zimmerman had studied criminal justice. He applied to become a police officer in Virginia in 2009, but was rejected due to bad credit, according to testimony in his trial. Even with more money in his bank account, that career path shouldn't be on the table anymore, an expert told CNN. \\"That is the absolute worst thing you can do,\\" said reputation management counselor Mike Paul. \\"It might be your old passion; you need to find a new passion. And it needs to be helping people in a very different way -- a way that is much more compassionate, not just involving law enforcement.\\" So far, Zimmerman's lawyers and family have been tight-lipped about his next steps. O'Mara describes his client as a marked man, arguing that his options are limited due to death threats he faces. \\"The first time that he got out of jail, he slept a lot. I think he is going to have to take a lot of time to relax, to center himself, to get used to his new reality, which is a free man, exonerated,\\" brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Sunday. \\"And he is going to have to take his own steps as he sees fit, whatever brings him the best result.\\" Whatever he does, his brother said, it will have to be under the radar. \\"As he engages the world, as anyone in his situation would, without restrictions,\\" Robert Zimmerman said, \\"he's going to have to learn to move about in a very low-profile way and keep to himself.\\" Race perhaps simplest disagreement in Zimmerman post-trial interviews. Donations fueled defense, led to wife's arrest. But online, at least, being low-profile hasn't exactly been Zimmerman's style. Through websites set up for his defense, he raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars. One site, gzdefensefund.com, raised more than 330,000 in just over a year, according to a spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer. That's in addition to about 200,000 Zimmerman raised on his own through a PayPal account before O'Mara took the case. Where did that money go? A summary on the website gives examples of how Zimmerman spent some of the donations: 95,000 for bail bond, about 56,000 for security and a whopping 61,747.54 for living expenses over an eight-month period. \\"If 61,747.54 sounds like a lot of money for living expenses for 8 months -- you are right,\\" the website says. \\"It's more than most people earn in a year. Most of George's living expenses for the first several months were allocated to providing a safe, secure place for George and his wife, Shellie, to live.\\" At one point after his arrest, the site says, Zimmerman was hiding out in a location that was so remote that it cost 2,500 to connect a phone line. Raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from supporters for your case is a good thing, right? Well, it wasn't for Shellie Zimmerman, who now faces a perjury charge. Prosecutors allege she lied when she told a Florida judge during a bail hearing for her husband in April 2012 that the family was indigent. In fact, they argue, George Zimmerman actually had about 135,000 at the time. She's pleaded not guilty, and has a court date in the case scheduled for next month. Even if donations keep pouring in, Zimmerman shouldn't necessarily take all the money he's offered, said Gene Grabowski, a crisis public relations manager. \\"He's got to be careful to avoid the appearances of creating more divisions by accepting money or support openly from groups that, maybe, that would create more friction because of the tenor of this case,\\" he said. \\"He's got to be careful about who he associates with afterwards, even if they are offering financial support.\\" Despite outrage, federal charges uncertain in case. What about a book? A juror in the high-profile case has already inked a deal with an agent for a possible book. Could a book or a made-for-TV movie be in Zimmerman's future? Last week HLN's Nancy Grace said a multimillion-dollar book for Zimmerman would probably be in the offing. And that possibility is already drawing sharp criticism. In an editorial titled \\"Zimmerman's acquittal shouldn't lead to riches,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer argued Monday that Zimmerman is \\"likely to be offered millions through lucrative book and movie deals.\\" \\"It would be a shame,\\" the newspaper said, \\"if the unnecessary death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin produced more paydays for the man who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager in the heart during a scuffle.\\" Civil lawsuits surge to the forefront. Even with the criminal trial over, Zimmerman still is likely to face several legal battles. Activists are pushing for the federal government to file civil rights charges against him. And it's possible Martin's family will file a civil wrongful death case, which could threaten Zimmerman's pocketbook. They haven't said yet if they will. That could be more likely, some analysts say, if it appeared Zimmerman was profiting from the case. A book or movie deal could make Zimmerman more vulnerable to a wrongful death suit, criminal defense attorney Randy Reep told USA Today. And then there's another case that Zimmerman started, suing NBC Universal over edited versions of a 911 call Zimmerman made. That lawsuit alleges that NBC deliberately edited an audio tape of his 911 call to make Zimmerman sound racist. \\"Because of NBC's deceptive and exploitative manipulations, the public wrongly believes that Zimmerman 'use(d) a racial epithet' while describing Martin during the call to the dispatcher on that fateful night,\\" the suit says. NBC Universal has disputed the accusations. \\"There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly,\\" the company said last year. \\"We intend to vigorously defend our position in court.\\" The lawsuit says Zimmerman is seeking \\"damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit,\\" but doesn't specify a dollar figure. Zimmerman's brother says the family is focusing on getting a fresh start. But so far, the verdict hasn't put a stop to debate over the controversial case. And it's unclear what that could mean for Zimmerman's cash flow. CNN's Thom Patterson, David Mattingly, MaryLynn Ryan, Gustavo Valdes, Chris Cuomo and Kate Bolduan, HLN's Graham Winch and In Session's Jessica Thill contributed to this report. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article discusses George Zimmerman's situation after he was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin case. It highlights the financial expenses Zimmerman faced during the trial, including living expenses, bodyguards, and expert witnesses, and explains how his legal team raised money to assist him in paying these costs. The article also speculates on potential job opportunities and sources of income Zimmerman could pursue after the trial, such as writing a book, participating in a movie deal, or winning a defamation lawsuit against NBC. It touches on the challenges Zimmerman would face in returning to his previous line of work in criminal justice and law enforcement, as well as the possible civil actions that could come from Trayvon Martin's family. Finally, the article notes that Zimmerman's family and lawyers have been quiet about his immediate next steps, and that he will likely need to live a low-profile life due to safety concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Gather ingredients: We'll need sugar, corn syrup, water, cherry flavoring, and red food coloring. 2. Prepare tools: We need a saucepan, a stirring spoon, a candy thermometer, a lined baking sheet or candy molds, and a little bit of cooking spray. 3. Mix ingredients: In the saucepan, mix the sugar, corn syrup, and water. Stir it well to make sure everything is combined. 4. Cook the mixture: Ask an adult to help you place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Let the mixture boil until the candy thermometer reaches 300°F (150°C), which is when it's the right temperature for hard candy. 5. Add cherry flavor and color: Once the mixture is at the correct temperature, turn off the heat, and carefully add the cherry flavoring and red food coloring. Mix everything together to get a pretty and yummy cherry color and taste. 6. Pour into molds: Carefully (and with an adult's help!) pour the mixture into the lined baking sheet or candy molds. If you're using molds, spray them with cooking spray first, so it's easy to take out the candies later. 7. Let it cool: Allow the candies to cool down and harden at room temperature. It might take a couple of hours. 8. Enjoy: Once the candies are hard, break them into pieces or pop them out of the molds. Now we have delicious cherry flavored hard candies to share and enjoy!

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Outlander Movie plot: Outlander begins with a spacecraft streaking across the sky. The ship lands in a lake situated around the local fjords of ancient Norway during the time of the Vikings 709AD. From its wreckage emerge two bitter enemies: One) a soldier from another world that speaks Icelandic and states that he came from an Island to the North Kainan and two) a bloodthirsty creature known as the Moorwen. Man and creature both seek revenge for violence committed against them. Before he has a chance to track down the alien, Kainan the Outlander is captured by a Viking warrior, and is held prisoner in the local village led by King Rothgar. As the Moorwen ravages the Viking lands, killing everything in its path, Kainan forms an alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors. Whilst trying to hunt for the Moorwen, war brews among the Vikings, which culminated with both sides taking immense losses. As the enemy Vikings retreat into the forests, the Moorwen strikes, leaving the vikings no choice but to run for help to their once close enemies. Together, the two sides attempt to destroy the Moorwen as a single band of Vikings. The Vikings thus construct a pit filled with oil to lure the Moorwen inside and plan to ignite the fuel, burning the Moorwen, with the help of Kainan. The plan to incinerate the Moorwen fails, leaving the village to take massive casualties, and with the surprise that the Moorwen had given birth to a new, younger Moorwen, which surprises the Vikings from behind and kills the Viking Leader in the process. This leaves the villages in fear and its warriors demoralised, most of the vikings leave the village in search of a new home and safety. Kainan and the remaining loyal warriors stand together to destroy the Moorwen. Kainan realizes from the last battle, that the Moorwen is almost impenetrable with the current metals used, and assists the Vikings by salvaging pieces of his crashed spacecraft and forging weapons capable of harming the creature. After a harrowing journey, the Vikings and Kainan confront the Moorwen... My question: What does Kainan do to the homing beacon?

Glue a border around the handle. Cut out a long strip of cardboard the same width as the handle and glue it to the pieces.;","output":"In order to glue together your cardboard sniper rifles, you can choose between the following two options: OPTION A: 1. Cut \\"filler pieces\\" or cardboard squares smaller than your rifle hand pieces to fit in the middle. To do this, first measure your rifle hand pieces and determine the size needed for the filler pieces. Make sure the filler pieces are slightly smaller so they can fit in between the two main hand pieces. 2. Glue a border around the handle. To create a border, start by measuring the thickness of your handle and cut strips of cardboard to this size. You can create a consistent border by using a ruler or other straight edge to help you cut the cardboard to the desired dimensions. Once you've cut the strips, apply glue to the edges of the handle and attach the border accordingly. You can also use tape to help hold these pieces in place while the glue dries. 3. Cut out a long strip of cardboard the same width as the handle and glue it to the pieces. Measure and mark the length and width of the strip needed, then cut it out using a straight edge and utility knife or scissors. Apply glue to the strip and attach it to the top of your filler pieces and border, connecting the two main hand pieces in the process. Make sure the strip is properly aligned and apply pressure to ensure the strip adheres correctly. You may also want to use clamps or tape to help hold the strip in place while the glue dries. OPTION B: 1. Cut \\"filler pieces\\" or cardboard squares bigger than your rifle hand pieces to fit in the middle. In this option, the filler pieces will provide some overlap with the main hand pieces. Measure the size needed for these filler pieces and cut them accordingly, keeping in mind that they should be slightly larger than the main hand pieces to create the desired effect. 2. Glue a border around the handle. Similar to Option A, measure the thickness of your handle and cut strips of cardboard for the border. Apply glue to the edges of the handle and attach the border pieces. You can use tape to help keep these pieces in place while the glue dries. 3. Cut out a long strip of cardboard the same width as the handle and glue it to the pieces. Measure the dimensions required for the strip, and cut it out with a straight edge and cutting tool. Apply glue to the long strip and attach it to the top of your filler pieces and border, joining the two main hand pieces. Ensure the strip is aligned and press down firmly. As in Option A, you can use clamps or tape to help keep the strip in place while the glue dries. For both options, it's essential to allow time for the glue to dry properly and ensure that all pieces are securely attached. You can then decorate your cardboard sniper rifle as desired, using paint, markers, or other materials to create a realistic and impressive finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With memories of last year's killer typhoons still fresh, Typhoon Megi roared across the Philippines on Monday, ripping through roofs and cutting off electricity. The cyclone's peak wind speeds decreased as the system moved over the Sierra Madre mountains, but it still packed sustained winds of around 167 kph (103 mph) with gusts up to 204 kph (126 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. This is down from peak sustained winds of 212 kph, with gusts up to 259 kph (161 mph), over the weekend. Megi, also known as Typhoon Juan, was expected to pick up steam again as it heads over the South China Sea. Current forecasts from the Joint Typhoon Center show the storm heading toward the southeastern China coast, just west of Hong Kong. In the Philippines, five people have died in what the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council is billing as the strongest storm of the year, according to Catherine Martin, manager of disaster management services at the Philippine National Red Cross. Emergency workers pulled the body of Vicente Decena, 53, from a bloated river; a tree fell on the house of Aileen Respicio, 20, killing her and injuring her child. Five others were injured elsewhere, the disaster council reported. Even as it weakened, Megi continued to pose a serious threat. Trees swayed and relentless rains inundated roads. Storm chaser James Cabrera, who was in Luzon, said parts of the Philippines could see 300 to 500 millimeters (12 to 20 inches) of rain. \\"Unfortunately, this is a part of the world where the infrastructure is quite fragile, the power grid is quite fragile and a lot of people live in quite basic houses,\\" James Reynolds, a storm chaser who is on Luzon, told CNN on Monday. \\"We have learned our lessons from the grim experiences we had during typhoons Ondoy [known internationally as Ketsana] and Pepeng [Parma],\\" House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. said, according to the Philippine News Agency. \\"We must all cooperate because nature's wrath exempts no one.\\" A year ago, tens of thousands of people were in evacuation centers as four consecutive typhoons drenched the Philippines. About 500 people were reported dead. Journalist Eduardo Lingao in Manila contributed to this report for CNN. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Typhoon Megi, locally known as Typhoon Juan, caused devastation in the Philippines on Monday, tearing through roofs, cutting off electricity, and claiming five lives. Though the cyclone's peak wind speeds decreased as it moved over the Sierra Madre mountains, it still carried sustained winds of around 167 kph (103 mph) and gusts reaching 204 kph (126 mph), substantially lower than its weekend peak sustained winds of 212 kph and gusts of up to 259 kph (161 mph). As it moved across the South China Sea, Megi was expected to regain strength before heading towards southeastern China's coast, just west of Hong Kong. The Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council labeled Megi the strongest storm of the year, leading to large-scale tree damage, heavy rain, and inundated roads. Storm chasers predicted that the hardest-hit areas in the Philippines could experience between 300 and 500 millimeters (12 to 20 inches) of rainfall. The precarious nature of local infrastructure combined with the vast number of people living in basic housing posed significant challenges in responding to the storm's aftermath. Despite Megi's weakening, it continued to be a serious threat, prompting urgent calls for cooperation from Philippine authorities, citing past experiences with typhoons Ondoy (Ketsana) and Pepeng (Parma) and their devastating consequences. Last year, around 500 people died and tens of thousands ended up in evacuation centers due to four consecutive typhoons affecting the Philippines.

Answer the following question: how many students attend school in the united states?","output":"It is challenging to provide an exact number of students attending school in the United States due to fluctuating enrollment rates and to the inclusion of different educational levels and institutions. However, I can offer a general overview based on the most recent data. As of the 2019-2020 school year - before the COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in enrollment - the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that approximately 56.4 million students were enrolled in K-12 public and private schools across the United States. Among them, around 50.7 million students were in public schools, and an estimated 5.7 million were in private schools. This data includes students in traditional, charter, and magnet schools. The approximately 50.7 million public school students were divided as follows: - 35.3 million in prekindergarten through 8th grade (elementary and middle schools) - 15.4 million in 9th through 12th grade (high schools) In higher education, during the 2018-2019 academic year, there were around 19.9 million students enrolled in degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States. This number encompasses students attending community colleges, colleges, and universities at undergraduate and graduate levels. To summarize, based on the most recent data available, there were approximately 56.4 million students attending K-12 public and private schools and an additional 19.9 million enrolled in higher education institutions in the United States, totaling around 76.3 million students.

Article: The first two Earth-like worlds orbiting another star have been detected, although neither are believed to be suitable for life.      But if the planets had water in the past, there's a good chance they could have hung on to it long enough for life to take hold, Linda Elkins-Tanton, with the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, told reporters on a conference call Tuesday.      The planets, known as Kepler-20e and 20f, are the smallest planets found so far by NASA's Kepler telescope, which was launched three years ago to look for Earth-sized worlds around other stars.      SCIENCE CHANNEL VIDEO: Lonely Planet      The newly discovered planets have diameters of 6,900 miles and 8,200 miles -- equivalent to 0.87 times Earth -- slightly smaller than Venus -- and 1.03 times Earth.      They join three Neptune-sized gas giant planets circling the parent star Kepler-20, which is slightly smaller and dimmer than the sun. The system is located about 1,000 light years away in the constellation Lyra.      While Kepler-20e and 20f are not thought to be habitable, it is \\"the next major milestone along the road to finding habitable planets around stars beyond the sun,\\" said Kepler project scientist Nick Gautier, with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.      SLIDE SHOW: Top Exoplanets for Alien Life      The two new discoveries were found by a team led by Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, using NASA's Kepler orbiting space telescope. The results were published online in the journal Nature.      Finding the relatively small planets was a feat.      Kepler monitors more than 150,000 stars for tiny wobbles in light. The wobbles signal a planet as it passes in front of the star and dims the light reaching the telescope.      The discovery follows the announcement earlier this month of Kepler-22b, a planet around twice the diameter of Earth that is orbiting the right distance from its parent star for liquid water to exist on its surface. Water is believed to be a key ingredient for life.      \\"Kepler-22b has the right temperature, but it is too big. What we're announcing today are just the right size, but too hot. But you can bet that the hunt is on to find a planet that combines the best of both worlds, a true earth twin,\\" said astronomer David Charbonneau with Harvard University.      SLIDE SHOW: Exquisite Exoplanetary Art      Unlike our solar system where the rocky planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars orbit closer in to the sun than the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the five planets circling Kepler-20 are a mix of rocky and gas planets and all orbit closer to their parent star than Mercury is to the sun.      \\"The architecture of that planetary system is crazy,\\" Charbonneau said. \\"Rocky planets and gas giants happily mingle together. This is the first time we've seen anything like this.\\"      \\"I really want to dare my fellow astronomers to try to explain how this system could have formed,\\" he said. ||||| MOFFETT FIELD, Calif. - NASA's Kepler mission has discovered the first Earth-size planets orbiting a sun-like star outside our solar system. The planets, called Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, are too close to their star to be in the so-called habitable zone where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface, but they are the smallest exoplanets ever confirmed around a star like our sun.            The discovery marks the next important milestone in the ultimate search for planets like Earth. The new planets are thought to be rocky. Kepler-20e is slightly smaller than Venus, measuring 0.87 times the radius of Earth. Kepler-20f is a bit larger than Earth, measuring 1.03 times its radius. Both planets reside in a five-planet system called Kepler-20, approximately 1,000 light-years away in the constellation Lyra.            Kepler-20e orbits its parent star every 6.1 days and Kepler-20f every 19.6 days. These short orbital periods mean very hot, inhospitable worlds. Kepler-20f, at 800 degrees Fahrenheit, is similar to an average day on the planet Mercury. The surface temperature of Kepler-20e, at more than 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, would melt glass.            \\"The primary goal of the Kepler mission is to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone,\\" said Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature. \\"This discovery demonstrates for the first time that Earth-size planets exist around other stars, and that we are able to detect them.\\"            The Kepler-20 system includes three other planets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. Kepler-20b, the closest planet, Kepler-20c, the third planet, and Kepler-20d, the fifth planet, orbit their star every 3.7, 10.9 and 77.6 days. All five planets have orbits lying roughly within Mercury's orbit in our solar system. The host star belongs to the same G-type class as our sun, although it is slightly smaller and cooler.            The system has an unexpected arrangement. In our solar system, small, rocky worlds orbit close to the sun and large, gaseous worlds orbit farther out. In comparison, the planets of Kepler-20 are organized in alternating size: large, small, large, small and large.            \\"The Kepler data are showing us some planetary systems have arrangements of planets very different from that seen in our solar system,\\" said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist and Kepler science team member at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \\"The analysis of Kepler data continues to reveal new insights about the diversity of planets and planetary systems within our galaxy.\\"            Scientists are not certain how the system evolved but they do not think the planets formed in their existing locations. They theorize the planets formed farther from their star and then migrated inward, likely through interactions with the disk of material from which they originated. This allowed the worlds to maintain their regular spacing despite alternating sizes.            The Kepler space telescope detects planets and planet candidates by measuring dips in the brightness of more than 150,000 stars to search for planets crossing in front, or transiting, their stars. The Kepler science team requires at least three transits to verify a signal as a planet.            The Kepler science team uses ground-based telescopes and the Spitzer Space Telescope to review observations on planet candidates the spacecraft finds. The star field Kepler observes in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra can be seen only from ground-based observatories in spring through early fall. The data from these other observations help determine which candidates can be validated as planets.            To validate Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, astronomers used a computer program called Blender, which runs simulations to help rule out other astrophysical phenomena masquerading as a planet.            On Dec. 5 the team announced the discovery of Kepler-22b in the habitable zone of its parent star. It is likely to be too large to have a rocky surface. While Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f are Earth-size, they are too close to their parent star to have liquid water on the surface.            \\"In the cosmic game of hide and seek, finding planets with just the right size and just the right temperature seems only a matter of time,\\" said Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead and professor of astronomy and physics at San Jose State University. \\"We are on the edge of our seats knowing that Kepler's most anticipated discoveries are still to come.\\"            NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., manages Kepler's ground system development, mission operations and science data analysis.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kiraly grew up in Santa Barbara, California. He began playing volleyball at age six with encouragement from his father, Dr. Laszlo Kiraly, who had been a member of the Hungarian Junior National team prior to fleeing the country during the Hungarian national uprising of 1956. At age 11, Kiraly entered his first beach volleyball tournament paired with his father. Kiraly attended Santa Barbara High School, where he was a member of the boys' varsity volleyball team. Kiraly had a long career on the professional beach circuit, and with 148 career wins is the 'winningest' player in the sport's history. He won at least one tournament in 24 of the 28 seasons he played in a career that spanned four decades. He claimed titles with 13 partners, and in domestic events he made it to the semifinals over 80% of the time. Kiraly competed into his mid-40s.  Kiraly played in his first beach tournament at age 11 as his father's partner. Kiraly has said as an 11-year-old he was thrilled to discover in beach volleyball he could compete with grown men on even terms. He earned his A and AA rating on the beach at the age of 15 and his AAA rating at 17. Kiraly's first big beach breakthrough came at Hermosa Beach in 1978. As a 17-year-old who had just graduated from high school, he shocked Hermosa onlookers by gaining the finals before he and partner Marco Ortega lost to the day's dominant team on the beach, Jim Menges and Greg Lee. In the early 1980s, Kiraly made a successful beach team pairing with UCLA teammate Sinjin Smith. The partnership split up as Kiraly came to focus on the U.S National Team.  In 1992 Kiraly left his indoor career behind, returning to the U.S. to play beach volleyball full-time on the AVP tour. Kiraly chose Kent Steffes as his doubles partner. Steffes was a talented younger player who had left UCLA early to start playing on the professional beach tour. Kiraly and Steffes soon became the dominant pairing on the tour, supplanting former teammate and doubles partner Smith and his partner Randy Stoklos as the beach's top team. In 1996 Kiraly returned to the Olympics, this time competing in beach volleyball with his partner, Steffes. Kiraly and Steffes won the gold medal, the first ever awarded for men's beach volleyball.  Kiraly continued to win tournaments into his 40s, recording two AVP tournament victories with his partner Brent Doble in 2002 and 2003, and four more with Mike Lambert in 2004 and 2005. Kiraly's last victory came in August 2005, when he and Lambert won at Huntington Beach. In 2006, Kiraly partnered with Larry Witt, and in 2007 partnered with Kevin Wong. His teams continued to make high placings. Over his career on the beach, Kiraly won over 3 million in prize money, and earned considerably more in endorsements. Kiraly retired from the AVP tour after the 2007 season.  Ultimately Kiraly won 148 professional beach volleyball titles, 74 of them with Steffes. The next closest player in total wins is Sinjin Smith at 139. Following Smith is his longtime partner, Randy Stoklos, at 122. The next closest player behind these four from the top two teams is Emanuel Rego, with 78 wins. What was his position","output":"in the sport's history, based on career wins?

Information:  - Beatrice Hastings was the pen name of Emily Alice Haigh ( 27 January 1879 -- 30 October 1943 ) an English writer , poet and literary critic . Much of her work was published in The New Age under a variety of pseudonyms , and she lived with the editor , A. R. Orage , for a time before the outbreak of the First World War . Bisexual , she was a friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield , whose work was first published in The New Age . Another of her lovers was Wyndham Lewis . Born in London and raised in South Africa , just before the war , she moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob . She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris . Towards the end of her life she felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due , and blamed Orage , whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain , and she published a pamphlet , The Old New Age , bitterly criticising him in 1936 . In 1943 , probably suffering from cancer , she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker .  - Philip Mairet (full name: Philippe Auguste Mairet; 18861975) was a designer, writer and journalist. He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated.  - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934).  - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888  9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34.  - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874  16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882  28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century.  - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler.  - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period.   - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882  7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, \\"Blasting and Bombardiering\\" (1937) and \\"Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date\\" (1950).

This revelation has inevitably raised a plethora of ethical questions and concerns revolving around the nature of these drug trials and the safety and well-being of the children involved. Background: Approved Schools - What They Were Approved Schools were a type of reform institution for children in the UK, established under the 1933 Children and Young Persons Act. These specialized institutions aimed at rehabilitating juvenile delinquents by offering education, vocational training, and discipline and were under the jurisdiction of the home office. In these schools, students were typically under the age of 18 and were placed there either by court order or voluntarily by their parents. The Drug Trials: Purpose and Execution According to the National Archives files, experimental drug trials were conducted in two undisclosed approved schools in the 1960s. The main objective of these trials was to test the efficacy and safety of newly developed medications. With approval granted by home office doctors, the trials were carried out in a series of phases, with varying dosages and therapeutic schedules. The documents reveal that the experiments included testing tranquilizers, sedatives, and other psychoactive drugs on the young subjects. Given the sensitive nature of the trials, the identity of the schools, doctors, and children involved has not been disclosed. However, it is clear from the records that the subjects of these trials were likely juvenile delinquents attending these institutions, potentially making them vulnerable to emotional, psychological, and physical exploitation. Ethical Concerns and Implications The newly unearthed information raises several ethical concerns. First and foremost, the children were not in a position to provide informed consent to participate in these experimental drug trials. Even if their legal guardians or the courts had given consent, it is questionable whether this consent was informed or voluntary, considering the societal and disciplinary context of the approved schools. Additionally, the protocols for conducting drug tests in the 1960s were significantly less stringent than those in place today. Consequently, issues such as transparency, safety checks, and proper monitoring of negative side effects might not have been adequately addressed at the time. Finally, the use of already disadvantaged young people as subjects in these drug trials highlights the disturbing nature of the power dynamics that made such experiments possible. These children were involuntarily placed in these institutions, making them particularly susceptible to maltreatment and exploitation. Addressing Past Wrongs: The Way Forward Acknowledging this appalling chapter in our history serves as a solemn reminder of the responsibility we have towards future generations. It is essential to learn from this dark past and enforce rigorous protocols for clinical trials, ensuring the well-being and safety of all trial participants, especially vulnerable populations. Furthermore, it is our duty to ensure that access to quality healthcare, education, and rehabilitation remain primary rights for all individuals, regardless of their age or social status. In conclusion, the discovery of these experimental drug trials in approved schools from the 1960s is both shocking and saddening. It provides important insights into the historical context of clinical trials and the mistreatment of vulnerable populations. It is crucial for society to openly address these disturbing findings and work towards rectifying the wrongs committed to ensure that future generations do not suffer from such unethical practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.  - Melodramma (plural: \\"melodrammi\\") is a 17th-century Italian term for a text to be set as an opera, or the opera itself. In the 19th-century, it was used in a much narrower sense by English writers to discuss developments in the early Italian libretto, e.g., \\"Rigoletto\\" and \\"Un ballo in maschera\\". Characteristic are the influence of French bourgeois drama, female instead of male protagonists, and the practice of opening the action with a chorus.  - Opera seria (plural: \\"opere serie\\"; usually called \\"dramma per musica\\" or \\"melodramma serio\\") is an Italian musical term which refers to the noble and \\"serious\\" style of Italian opera that predominated in Europe from the 1710s to c. 1770. The term itself was rarely used at the time and only attained common usage once \\"opera seria\\" was becoming unfashionable and beginning to be viewed as a historical genre. The popular rival to \\"opera seria\\" was \\"opera buffa,\\" the 'comic' opera that took its cue from the improvisatory commedia dell'arte.  - Italian Baroque (or \\"Barocco\\") is a stylistic period in Italian history and art that spanned from the late 16th century to the early 18th century.  - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral.  - Thésée (\\"Theseus\\") is a \\"tragédie en musique\\", an early type of French opera, in a prologue and five acts with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully and a libretto by Philippe Quinault based on Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\". It was first performed on 11 January 1675 by the Paris Opera for the royal court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was first performed in public in April at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris.  - The Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye is a royal palace in the commune of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in the \\"département\\" of Yvelines, about 19 km west of Paris, France. Today, it houses the Musée d'Archéologie Nationale (National Museum of Archaeology).  - Ottone, re di Germania (\\"Otto, King of Germany\\", HWV 15) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, to an Italianlanguage libretto adapted by Nicola Francesco Haym from the libretto by Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino for Antonio Lotti's opera \\"Teofane\\". It was the first new opera written for the Royal Academy of Music (1719)'s fourth season and had its first performance on 12 January 1723 at the King's Theatre, Haymarket in London. Handel had assembled a cast of operatic superstars for this season and the opera became an enormous success.  - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.  - The Paris Opera() is the primary opera company of France. It was founded in 1669 by Louis XIV as the , and shortly thereafter was placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully and officially renamed the ', but continued to be known more simply as the . Classical ballet as we know it today arose within the Paris Opera as the Paris Opera Ballet and has remained an integral and important part of the company. Currently called the ', it mainly produces operas at its modern 2700-seat theatre Opéra Bastille which opened in 1989, and ballets and some classical operas at the older 1970-seat Palais Garnier which opened in 1875. Small scale and contemporary works are also staged in the 500-seat Amphitheatre under the Opéra Bastille.  - Teseo ( \`\` Theseus '' , HWV 9 ; Italian pronunciation : ( tezo ) ) is an opera seria with music by George Frideric Handel , the only Handel opera that is in five acts . The Italian - language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym , after Philippe Quinault 's Thésée . It was Handel 's third London opera , intended to follow the success of Rinaldo after the unpopular Il pastor fido . First performed on 10 January 1713,Teseo featured \`\` magical '' effects such as flying dragons , transformation scenes and apparitions and had a cast of notable Italian opera singers . It was a success with London audiences , receiving thirteen performances even though the stage machinery for the \`\` magical '' effects broke down , and would have received more performances had not one of the theatre 's managers run away with the box office receipts .  - Flavio, re de' Longobardi (\\"Flavio, King of the Lombards\\", HWV 16) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel. The Italian-language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym, after Matteo Noris's \\"Flavio Cuniberto\\". It was Handel's fourth full-length opera for the Royal Academy of Music. Handel had originally entitled the opera after the character of Emilia in the opera.  - Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BC  AD 17/18), known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.  - Dramma per musica (Italian, literally: \\"drama for music\\", plural: \\"drammi per musica\\") is a term which was used by dramatists in Italy and elsewhere between the late-17th and mid-19th centuries. In modern times the same meaning of \\"drama for music\\" was conveyed through the Italian Greek-rooted word \\"melodramma\\" (from  = song or music +  = scenic action). \\"Dramma per musica\\" never meant \\"drama \\"through\\" music\\", let alone music drama.  - Theseus was the mythical king of Athens and was the son of Aethra by two fathers: Aegeus and Poseidon.  - Nicola Francesco Haym (6 July 1678  31 July 1729) was an Italian opera librettist, composer, theatre manager and performer, and numismatist. He is best remembered for adapting texts into libretti for the London operas of George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini. Libretti that he provided for Handel included those for \\"Giulio Cesare\\", \\"Ottone\\", \\"Flavio\\", \\"Tamerlano\\", \\"Rodelinda\\", and several others; for Bononcini, he produced two, \\"Calfurnia\\" and \\"Astianatte\\".  - An organ concerto is a piece of music, an instrumental concerto for a pipe organ soloist with an orchestra. The form first evolves in the 18th century, when composers including Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel wrote organ concertos with small orchestras, and with solo parts which rarely call for the organ pedal board. During the Classical period organ concerto became popular in many places, especially in Bavaria, Austria and Bohemia (whether called there a concerto, pastorella, or sonata), reaching a position of being almost an integral part of the church music tradition of \\"jubilus\\" character. From the Romantic era fewer works are known. Finally, there are some 20th- and 21st-century examples, of which the concerto by Francis Poulenc has entered the basic repertoire, and is quite frequently played.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully.  - Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard.  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Tamerlano (\\"Tamerlane\\", HWV 18) is an opera seria in three acts written for the Royal Academy of Music theatre company, with music by George Frideric Handel to an Italian text by Nicola Francesco Haym, adapted from Agostin Piovene's \\"Tamerlano\\" together with another libretto entitled \\"Bajazet\\" after Nicolas Pradon's \\"Tamerlan, ou La Mort de Bajazet\\".  - Tragédie en musique (Musical tragedy), also known as tragédie lyrique (French lyric tragedy), is a genre of French opera introduced by Jean-Baptiste Lully and used by his followers until the second half of the eighteenth century. Operas in this genre are usually based on stories from Classical mythology or the Italian romantic epics of Tasso and Ariosto. The stories may not have a tragic ending  in fact, they generally don't  but the atmosphere must be noble and elevated. The standard \\"tragédie en musique\\" has five acts. Earlier works in the genre were preceded by an allegorical prologue and, during the lifetime of Louis XIV, these generally celebrated the king's noble qualities and his prowess in war. Each of the five acts usually follows a basic pattern, opening with an aria in which one of the main characters expresses their feelings, followed by dialogue in recitative interspersed with short arias (\\"petits airs\\"), in which the main business of the plot occurs. Each act traditionally ends with a \\"divertissement\\", offering great opportunities for the chorus and the ballet troupe. Composers sometimes changed the order of these features in an act for dramatic reasons.  - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March]  14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Giulio Cesare in Egitto (Italian for \\"Julius Caesar in Egypt\\", HWV 17), commonly known as Giulio Cesare, is a dramma per musica (\\"opera seria\\") in three acts composed for the Royal Academy of Music by George Frideric Handel in 1724. The libretto was written by Nicola Francesco Haym who used an earlier libretto by Giacomo Francesco Bussani, which had been set to music by Antonio Sartorio (1676). The opera was a success at its first performances, was frequently revived by Handel in his subsequent opera seasons and is now one of the most often performed Baroque operas. Composition history. \\"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\\" was first performed at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, London on 20 February 1724. The opera was an immediate success. A contemporary wrote in a letter on 10 March 1724: ...the opera is in full swing also, since Hendell's new one, called Jules César  in which Cenesino and Cozzuna shine beyond all criticism  has been put on. The house was just as full at the seventh performance as at the first.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.  - Giovanni Bononcini (or Buononcini) (18 July 1670  9 July 1747) (sometimes cited also as Giovanni Battista Bononcini) was an Italian Baroque composer, cellist, singer and teacher, one of a family of string players and composers.  - Italian opera is both the art of opera in Italy and opera in the Italian language. Opera was born in Italy around the year 1600 and Italian opera has continued to play a dominant role in the history of the form until the present day. Many famous operas in Italian were written by foreign composers, including Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world.  - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632  22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661.  - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists.  - Opera buffa (plural: \\"opere buffe\\"; Italian for \\"comic opera\\") is a genre of opera. It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as \\"commedia in musica\\", \\"commedia per musica\\", \\"dramma bernesco\\", \\"dramma comico\\", \\"divertimento giocoso\\".   - An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.  - The characters of the \\"\\" usually represent fixed social types, stock characters, such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains. The characters are exaggerated \\"real characters\\", such as a know it all doctor called Il Dottore, a greedy old man called Pantalone, or a perfect relationship like the Innamorati.   - In Greek mythology, Aegeus or Aegeas, was an archaic figure in the founding myth of Athens. The \\"goat-man\\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens.  - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter.    What is the relationship between 'teseo' and 'tragédie en musique'? The answer is:","output":"Teseo is an opera seria with music by George Frideric Handel and Italian-language libretto by Nicola Francesco Haym, which is based on Thésée, a tragédie en musique by Jean-Baptiste Lully and Philippe Quinault.  The relationship between Teseo and tragédie en musique lies in their shared source material and the influence of French operatic style on Handel's composition. Thésée is an early example of a tragédie en musique, a genre of French opera characterized by an elevated, noble atmosphere, and often based on stories from Classical mythology or Italian romantic epics. Teseo, as an adaptation of Lully's Thésée, draws upon the same mythological story of Theseus from Ovid's Metamorphoses. While Teseo is an opera seria, a genre that was predominant in Italy and characterized by serious, often mythological stories, its connection to Thésée and the tragédie en musique reflects the influence of French culture and music, further demonstrating the blending of styles and the exchange of ideas across different European musical traditions during the Baroque era."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits his friend, actor George Raft, on a film set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale. As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole 14,000, and is told he now answers to Cohen. After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy.

According to the story, Cinderella could not go to the dance because she did not have appropriate attire. She only had her usual modest clothing suitable for her chores in the kitchen, and not the beautiful dresses befitting a royal gathering like the one the prince was holding. It was the intervention of a good-hearted fairy who used magic to provide Cinderella with beautiful clothes and a carriage for her to attend the dance.

Coming off their overtime win over the Patriots, the Broncos traveled to Qualcomm Stadium for their first of two matches with their AFC West division rivals, the San Diego Chargers. On the Broncos' opening drive, quarterback Brock Osweiler connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 3-yard touchdown pass. The Chargers had a chance to get on the scoreboard midway through the first quarter, but placekicker Josh Lambo missed wide-right on a 48-yard field goal attempt. Toward the end of the first quarter, the Broncos added to the lead, when linebacker Danny Trevathan intercepted an errant pass by Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers and returned it for a 25-yard touchdown. After forcing a Chargers' punt early in the second quarter, the Broncos marched down the field with a long drive that chewed up seven minutes, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus that increased their lead to 17-0. The Chargers got on the scoreboard just after the two minute warning, with a 51-yard field goal by Lambo, which would be the final scoring play of the game by either team. In the third quarter, the Broncos' defense recovered two forced fumbles, while on offense, McManus missed wide right on a 52-yard field goal attempt and Osweiler threw an interception deep in Chargers' territory. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos' offense punted on all of their possessions (save the final kneel down), while their defense did not allow the Chargers' offense to advance past their own 47-yard line.

Answer based on context: The stock market crashed in October 1929, and ushered in the Great Depression. By the winter of 1932-33, the economy was so perilous that the unemployment rate hit the 25 percent mark. Unions lost members during this time because laborers could not afford to pay their dues and furthermore, numerous strikes against wage cuts left the unions impoverished: \\"one might have expected a reincarnation of organizations seeking to overthrow the capitalistic system that was now performing so poorly. Some workers did indeed turn to such radical movements as the Communist Party, but, in general, the nation seemed to have been shocked into inaction\\". Though unions were not acting yet, cities across the nation witnessed local and spontaneous marches by frustrated relief applicants. In March 1930, hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers marched through New York City, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco and other cities in a mass protest organized by the Communist Party's Unemployed Councils. In 1931, more than 400 relief protests erupted in Chicago and that number grew to 550 in 1932. The leadership behind these organizations often came from radical groups like Communist and Socialist parties, who wanted to organize \\"unfocused neighborhood militancy into organized popular defense organizations\\". How many more relief protests erupted in Chicago between the number recorded in 1931 and the number in 1932?","output":"To calculate the difference in the number of relief protests between 1931 and 1932 in Chicago, I subtract the number in 1931 from the number in 1932. The text mentions that there were more than 400 relief protests in Chicago in 1931 and this number grew to 550 in 1932. To determine how many more protests took place in 1932 as compared to 1931, here are the steps I will follow: 1. Note the number of protests in 1932 (550 protests). 2. Subtract the number of protests in 1931 (400 protests) from this number. Calculation:  550 (protests in 1932) - 400 (protests in 1931) = 150  Therefore, there were approximately 150 more relief protests in Chicago in 1932 compared to 1931. This answer is based on the context provided in the passage and the assumption that the term \\"more than 400\\" can be rounded down to 400 for the purpose of this calculation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nigel Farage faced fury from Jewish community leaders today after he formed a pact with a Polish MEP whose party leader has been accused of denying the Holocaust to get EU funding. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was 'gravely concerned' by Ukip's deal to accept a member of the Polish Congress of the new Right (KNP) into its grouping in the European Parliament. Robert Iwaszkiewicz's decision to join the Eurosceptic EFDD (Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy) group headed by Mr Farage means it has enough members to increase its funding and standing in the parliament. Ukip leader NIgel Farage has come under pressure after his party was joined in an EU grouping by Robert Iwaszkiewicz. But Mr Iwaszkiewicz has been criticised for joking about hitting women and his party's leader has questioned whether Hitler knew about the Holocaust and suggested women are less intelligent and should not vote. Today Board of Deputies vice president Jonathan Arkush said the KNP should be 'roundly rejected' and described Mr Farage's welcoming of Mr Iwaszkiewicz in order to get money as 'beyond belief'. He said: 'Robert Iwaszkiewicz belongs to an extremist party whose leader has a history of Holocaust denial, racist remarks and misogynistic comments. 'Extremists and racists should be roundly rejected, not embraced. Even France's far right Front National rejected the (KNP) as being too extreme. 'For Ukip to choose such a figure as Robert Iwaszkiewicz as a bedfellow, apparently for money, is beyond belief. 'Nigel Farage now has some very serious questions to answer. He has placed in issue the credibility of Ukip.' But Mr Farage said his party needed to do deals to make sure its voice was heard and insisted he would not work with extremists. 'I have found nothing in this guy's background to suggest he is a political extremist at all. He has joined our group to save us,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. 'All of us in the European Parliament have to make compromises to make sure that our voice is heard. I want us to have our voice, I want us to have a group, but I will not do it at any price. 'If it came to a decision that do we cast Ukip into the outer darkness of a non-attached group here or do a deal with a known prominent extremist in Europe, I would not do that deal.' Asked about the MEP's reported comment that there were 'quite a few wives around who'd be brought back down to earth' if their husbands hit them, Mr Farage, said: 'I think that comment was a joke'. But he added: 'I've never met him, I've never spoken to him.' As the row erupted, Mr Farage insisted he had never met or spoken to Mr Iwaszkiewicz. KNP leader Janusz Korwin-Mikke has been described as one of the most controversial figures in Polish politics, but Ukip emphasised that Mr Iwaszkiewicz was joining the group in a personal capacity. The EFDD was thrown into disarray last week when one its members, a Latvian MEP, quit. Groupings need to have at least 25 MEPs from seven different countries. If the group had disbanded it would have meant a loss to Ukip of about 2million euros a year in funding for its MEPs and Mr Farage would have got less speaking time in the parliament. Michael Dugher MP, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: 'Here are UKIP forming an alliance with a far-right party in Europe that denies the fact that millions were murdered in the Holocaust, in order to keep receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from the European Parliament. 'This shows once again that UKIP do not share the values of decent working people in Britain.' However Rabbi Shneur Zalman Odze, a former Ukip MEP candidate,  said: 'Robert Iwaszkiewicz was the only Polish member asked to join the EFDD Group. The only comment he made on Hitler was that he was an evil man who should have been executed. 'Korwin-Mikke is not a member of the EFDD group. 'Both UKIP Party and EFDD Group abhors and rejects any scent of anti-Semitism. As a Jewish rabbi, I was number four on the UKIP North West MEP candidate list, and I can assure you in my many years in UKIP I have never once experienced any anti-Semitism. 'All groups in the European Parliament have very odd bedfellows, for examples, the Tories are part of a pan European party aECR with Islamist AK Party of Turkey, Labour are in a Group with homophobes from Croatia. The Greens were recently led by MEP Danny Cohen-Bendit with very odd views on child sexuality. 'The rules to get Group speaking time and funding are set by the European Parliament, not by Ukip.'

The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster. Yuuki lived with his family in a seaside village, below a small mountain. One day, as he played on top of the mountain, Yuuki felt a small earthquake but it was not strong enough to frighten anybody. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide areas of beach that had never been seen before. Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the new beach land. But no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand. Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the harvested rice. Then he called out, \\"Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!\\" When everyone reached the mountain top, a villager cried out, \\"Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire.\\" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers screamed at him. Just then, someone shouted, \\"Look!\\" In the distance a huge dark wave of water was speeding towards the shore. When it hit the shore, it destroyed everything. On the mountain everyone stared at the village ruins in terror. \\"I'm sorry I burned the fields,\\" said Yuuki, his voice trembling. \\"Yuuki,\\" the village chief answered. \\"You saved us all.\\" The villagers cheered and raised Yuuki into the air. \\"We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,\\" said one, \\"but now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!\\" Options: A He told them about the earthquake.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees? , can you please find it?   In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

Goal: to accommodate many birds at a bird feeder Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options: i. attach many different perches  to the sides of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue ii. attach many different perches  to the bottom of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue...I think the answer is","output":"Option i: attach many different perches to the sides of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue. Both methods can help achieve the goal of accommodating many birds at a bird feeder, but option i is more reasonable for several reasons. Below is a detailed analysis of each option's advantages and disadvantages, leading to the conclusion that attaching perches to the sides of the bird feeder is a more effective approach. Option i: Attach many different perches to the sides of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue Advantages: 1. Attaching perches to the sides can provide more space for birds to land and feed simultaneously. This increases the number of birds that can use the feeder at once without feeling overcrowded or being forced to wait in line. 2. Installing perches on the sides of the feeder offers more options for customizing their length, positioning, and spacing. This allows the accommodation of various bird species, sizes, and preferences. 3. By strategically placing the perches on the sides, the bird feeder can be made more visually appealing. A well-thought-out design can also reduce the chances of birds bumping into each other or getting in each other's way. 4. Attaching perches to the sides and varying their heights can enable birds to choose a suitable perch based on their size or the natural pecking order. This promotes an organized and efficient feeding system. Disadvantages: 1. Nailing or gluing perches to the sides might call for additional maintenance, especially if heavy or large bird species land on them. However, this is a minor issue that can be easily resolved by using sturdy materials and ensuring a vigilant maintenance routine. Option ii: Attach many different perches to the bottom of the bird feeder using a hammer and nails or glue Advantages: 1. Attaching perches to the bottom provides a flat, stable surface for birds to land and feed. This can make it easier for some bird species to access the feeder. 2. Placing perches under the feeder may help to prevent seeds from falling onto the ground or getting scattered, keeping the feeding area clean and minimizing the risk of attracting other animals or pests. Disadvantages: 1. Attaching perches to the bottom of the bird feeder can restrict the number of birds that can feed at once. Since the feeder blocks access from the top, only a few birds will be able to perch beneath it. 2. Installing perches on the bottom risks becoming a sanitation issue. Bird droppings can accumulate on and around the perches, ultimately contaminating the bird seed and posing a health risk to the birds. 3. Positioning perches under the feeder can lead to a cramped and congested landing area. This may deter birds from using the feeder altogether and result in territorial disputes among the birds. Conclusion:  After carefully evaluating both options, it is clear that attaching perches to the sides of the bird feeder (option i) is the more reasonable method to accommodate many birds at once. This solution provides more perching space, caters to various bird species and sizes, and reduces the risk of contamination or territorial disputes. While option ii does have some merits, its disadvantages outweigh the benefits, making option i the more practical choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does \\"While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs.\\" correctly answer the question of Who seemed to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order?","output":"The given statement, \\"While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs,\\" does not directly answer the question, \\"Who seemed to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order?\\" To provide a comprehensive response to the question, we should first understand what is meant by 'geometrical pattern and order'. In art and design, geometrical pattern and order refer to the use of geometry in creating repetitive patterns, structured compositions, and overall harmony in visual works. This can include the use of shapes, lines, and symmetry to create aesthetically pleasing and well-ordered designs. Now, we can approach the question by discussing various artists, architects, or designers who were known for their use of geometrical patterns and order in their work. One possible answer could be the famous painter Piet Mondrian, who was known for his distinctive style that was heavily influenced by geometrical patterns. Mondrian was a Dutch abstract painter who is often regarded as a founder of the De Stijl art movement and was best known for his works featuring rectangular forms, straight lines, and primary colors. His compositions exemplified simplicity, harmony, and the ideal balance between elements. He created a visual language known as \\"neoplasticism,\\" characterized by the use of basic forms and colors. Another example could be the Ancient Greeks, who were particularly conscious of geometric patterns and order in their architecture and art. From the perfectly proportioned Parthenon temple to their intricate pottery designs, the Greeks demonstrated an appreciation for mathematics, symmetry, and harmony. The famous Greek sculptor Polykleitos even introduced the Canon of Proportions, a set of mathematical ratios aimed at creating the ideal human figure. A third example can be found in Islamic art and architecture, where artists skillfully used geometric patterns to create intricate, detailed, and harmonious designs in their work. Islamic artists often regarded geometry as a universal language that transcended cultural boundaries and symbolized the infinity of God. Their works showcase the beauty and complexity that can be achieved from basic geometric shapes, such as squares, circles, or polygons, creating a sense of order and unity in their designs. Therefore, it would be more accurate to answer the question of who seemed to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order by naming artists, architects, or designers like Piet Mondrian, the Ancient Greeks, or Islamic artists and architects, rather than the given statement that each scene has its own character and belongs to its general sequence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Process:  - Greenhouse gases are released into the air by human activities - The earth changes energy from the sun into heat - Heat rises from the ground - Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space - The temperature of the earth increases - The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps - The temperature rises even faster.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a volcano erupts ejecting tons of greenhouse gases happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation, in this case a volcanic eruption ejecting tons of greenhouse gases, will indeed influence the process, both directly and indirectly. Here's how it would affect a smaller greenhouse effect: Step 1: The volcanic eruption will add more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, especially if it's a significant eruption on a larger scale. This is the direct effect. Reasoning: Volcanic eruptions do produce greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as aerosols which can have both a cooling (sulfur dioxide which forms sulfates in the atmosphere and reflects sunlight back to space) and warming effect (soot which absorbs sunlight). Step 2: The additional greenhouse gases caused by the volcanic eruption would enhance the greenhouse effect beyond what human activity contributes because greenhouse gas molecules prevent heat from escaping into space. Reasoning: As the concentration of such gases increases in the atmosphere, more heat will be trapped which will continue to raise the earth's temperature more than it would under the smaller greenhouse effect. Step 3: An increased temperature from the enhanced greenhouse effect will speed up the process of polar ice melting and possibly causing the temperature to rise even faster. Reasoning: The Earth’s surface becomes hotter with an intensified greenhouse effect, speeding up the melting of polar ice caps, which leads to a feedback loop where less sunlight is reflected back into space by ice, further increasing the temperature (known as the ice-albedo effect). In conclusion, the volcanic eruption in the perturbation hypothesis would indeed heighten the greenhouse effect, resulting in increased global temperatures and faster melting of the polar ice caps. However, it is noteworthy that volcanic climatic impacts are generally temporary (a few years) and depending on the scale and content of the eruption, cooling effects (from increased aerosols) could in the short term counteract or exceed the warming effects."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: What county is Farmington Hills, MI in?

Based on the premise \\"All non-urban areas are rural.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Some non-urban areas are still not rural.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"All non-urban areas are rural.\\", the statement suggests a clear dichotomy between urban and non-urban (rural) areas, indicating that there are no other classifications or categories in this context. This implies that if an area is not urban, it must be rural; if it is not rural, it is urban. Now, let us analyze the hypothesis \\"Some non-urban areas are still not rural.\\" The hypothesis attempts to assert that there are non-urban areas that do not belong to the rural category. This goes against the logic of the initial premise, which explicitly states that all non-urban areas fall under the rural category. To further illustrate this point, let's use a Venn diagram as a visualization tool. In this case, we have two categories: urban (U) and rural (R). Since the premise states that non-urban areas are rural, we can imagine a circle containing all urban areas (U) and another circle containing all rural areas (R). Now, according to the premise, every area must be in one of these two circles. In other words, the entire space outside the circle representing urban areas (U) must be part of the circle representing rural areas (R). Hence, the hypothesis \\"Some non-urban areas are still not rural\\" is attempting to propose that there is an overlap between non-urban areas not contained in the rural area circle. However, due to the premise's strict categorization of areas into either urban or rural, there can be no such overlap.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that?

He worked as Hindi and Punjabi film producer, director and writer, and he acted in films and television.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Bhakti Mein Shakti is a 1978 Bollywood film directed by and starring Dara Singh .  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  Now, I have a new situation: Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted.

Answer this question please: Which sample will be viable for longer, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? The answer to this question is:","output":"The sample that will be viable for longer is the one placed in refrigerated storage. This is because lower temperatures help to preserve and maintain the stability of enzymes and other sensitive biological materials. In the case of the rat liver enzymes, the refrigerated storage slows down the rate of degradation, maintaining its activity and stability for a longer period of time. On the other hand, the sample left on the countertop will be exposed to higher temperatures and consequently, suffer from faster degradation, making it less viable than the refrigerated sample."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

People seem to prefer clear liquid over gray liquid because the  OPTIONS: 1. clear liquid looks pure.. 2. gray liquid looks pure..","output":"Once upon a time, in a bustling city called Liquida, an incredible phenomenon occurred that had everyone baffled. The city was renowned for its exquisite and diverse selection of liquids, that had become an integral part of the inhabitant's lives. People from all over the world traveled to Liquida to experience the unique liquids that the city had to offer. Every corner of the city prided itself on providing a wide array of liquids, ranging from water to fruit juices, to even some rare magical potions.  One day, the residents of Liquida noticed an unusual divide in people's choices. People seemed to prefer clear liquid over gray liquid. No one seemed to be able to explain why such a preference had suddenly emerged. After observing the situation for quite some time, the city council decided to gather some experts to unravel the mystery behind this sudden preference. A team comprising the best scientists, researchers, and psychologists took up the task of conducting an extensive study. They analyzed people's choices to determine the possible reasons for their preference. After months of intensive research, the experts narrowed down the potential explanations to two distinct possibilities: 1. clear liquid looks pure, or 2. gray liquid looks pure. As the experts dug deeper into the people's psyche, they discovered that the preference for clear liquid was deeply rooted in the subconscious minds of the residents. The majority of the population equated clear liquid with purity, which had led to a bias in their choices. The clarity of the liquid was commonly associated with cleanliness, transparency, and overall higher quality. Numerous interviews and surveys revealed that the residents believed that clear liquids were more refined, free of impurities, and were believed to have a positive impact on their health and overall well-being. Surprisingly, the few who did prefer gray liquid also associated it with purity. This group of people saw the unique, mystical allure of the gray liquid, which they believed contained hidden powers and properties. For them, the opacity of the liquid represented a mysterious, unexplored territory that held the promise of undiscovered secrets. This small group of enthusiasts was daring and adventurous, eager to challenge conventional norms and explore the unknown. Despite their differences in preferences, both groups maintained that they were drawn to their respective choices out of a desire to experience purity in some form or another. This revelation opened many intriguing doors of exploration for the city council and the experts, who began to question the very concept of purity. The city council, in an attempt to satisfy the diverse preferences of its people, decided to capitalize on this insight. To embrace and celebrate the city's renowned liquid culture, they decided to host a grand festival called \\"The Pure Liquid Festival.\\" During this event, the city would showcase both clear and gray liquids to highlight the different aspects of purity associated with them. The streets of Liquida were adorned with vibrant decorations, signifying the unity in diversity of liquid preferences. The clear liquid and gray liquid were presented side-by-side in sparkling crystal glasses, encouraging people to embrace their fellow citizens' preferences. As the festival progressed, the residents developed a newfound appreciation for one another's choices, cultivating a sense of harmony and understanding within the community. The Pure Liquid Festival became an annual event, enlivening the streets and uniting the city of Liquida under the shared theme of purity. The story of the people's preference for clear liquid over gray liquid gradually turned into a tale of enlightenment and unity, reminding the world that even in our differences, we can find common ground and celebrate the things that bring us together. In the end, the people of Liquida learned a very important lesson: that the essence of purity is not limited to appearances, but lies in the acceptance and appreciation of diversity, supporting one another's choices, and finding beauty in the most unexpected of places. And so, the residents of Liquida carried on, celebrating and cherishing the vast array of liquids that their magical city had to offer, united in their love for the enchanting world of Liquida."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If your doctor agrees that you have a kneecap dislocation, he/she will likely perform a procedure called a “reduction,” which will slide your kneecap back into place.  The doctor will likely give you pain medication before manipulating your knee to minimize the discomfort. Generally he/she will follow this procedure with an x-ray to make sure everything is in the correct place. Again, it’s important to not try this at home as it is difficult to figure out which injuries need surgery or specialized treatments, and further damage can occur if this is not done correctly.

It was known to be made up primarily of Americo-Liberians who had mixed African and European ancestry.  Pick from: I. Yes II. It's impossible to say III. No","output":"I. Yes Based on the given context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that the Republican Party, earlier named the Liberian Party, was a political party founded soon after the establishment of Liberia in 1848. It is mentioned that the party was made up primarily of Americo-Liberians who had mixed African and European ancestry. This information directly supports the hypothesis. The context highlights that the founding of the Republican Party, or the Liberian Party as it was first known, took place shortly after Liberia's establishment. This offers a clear link between the two, since the formation of a political party is common and expected in the wake of a new nation's creation. Moreover, the context provides a brief description of the party's demographic makeup—the Americo-Liberians, who had a mix of African and European ancestry. This information provides additional understanding of the party's character and goals, as well as how its members distinguished themselves from their opponents in the True Whig Party. Furthermore, it can be inferred that the Republican Party was an influential political organization of its time, given that it had a significant rival in the form of the True Whig Party. The existence of this opposition may have contributed to the shaping of Liberia's political landscape, with both parties playing crucial roles in order to maintain Liberia's stability and growth as a fledgling nation. In conclusion, based on the context provided, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that the Republican Party, earlier named the Liberian Party, was founded soon after Liberia's establishment in 1848 and was composed primarily of Americo-Liberians with mixed African and European ancestry."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The name Phosphorus is derived from two Greek words - \\"phos\\" meaning light and \\"phoros\\" meaning bearer or bearing.  Phosphorus is a non-metal element that is a member of the nitrogen group in the periodic table. It is highly reactive and is rarely found in its elemental form in nature, usually occurring in mineral form as a phosphate. Phosphorus is an essential element for life on Earth, playing a critical role in biological processes such as energy transfer, cellular structure, and DNA synthesis. It is a key component of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is responsible for storing and transferring energy within cells, and of nucleic acids, which form the genetic code. Phosphorus exists in several allotropic forms, which are different structural arrangements or conformations of the same element. The two most common forms are white phosphorus and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a highly reactive and toxic form, while red phosphorus is more stable and less toxic. Black phosphorus, an allotrope with a layered structure, is also known but is less common. The discovery of phosphorus is credited to the German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669. Brand isolated phosphorus from human urine while attempting to discover the legendary Philosopher's Stone, which was believed to have the ability to turn common metals into gold. He observed that phosphorus would glow in the dark and emit a faint light when exposed to air, a property now known as phosphorescence. This unique characteristic inspired him to name the newly discovered element after the Greek term for \\"light bearing\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Step 2: Analyze the Difference The critical difference between the two questions is the nature of the organizations involved. The first question is a general case and could pertain to any sort of company, large or small, while the second specifically refers to startups. Step 3: Understand stock options Stock options are a privilege, sold by one party to another, that offer the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a stock at an agreed-upon price within a certain period or on a specific date.  Step 4: Understand the Context Typically, companies have different vesting periods for stock options provided to their employees. If an employee leaves before the vesting period is over, they may forfeit some or all of these options. The specifics can vary greatly from company to company. Step 5: Final Analysis Taking all these into consideration, the answer to both these questions would indeed be the same as they both depend on the specific terms set by the company in regards to their stock option agreement.  Since the user is asking to choose the answer from [1]. no. [2]. yes., I have to decide between these two choices relating to whether the answers would be the same or not.

Before you can get your car back, you need to know why it was impounded. In some cases, if someone else was driving your car at the time, you may not be aware of the reason at first, but you (as the owner) are probably still responsible.","output":"First, gather necessary documents. After determining the reason your car was impounded, you will need to gather important documents to prove your ownership and identity. These documents usually include: 1. Government-issued identification (such as a driver's license or passport) 2. Proof of vehicle registration 3. Proof of vehicle insurance 4. Relevant payment receipts or proof of a payment plan (if your car was impounded due to unpaid parking tickets or other fines) Second, find the impound lot. Next, you must locate the impound lot where your car is being held. This information is typically provided on the notice or ticket you received. If you are unsure or haven't received any notice, you can: 1. Contact your local police department or traffic authority 2. Search online for impound lots or tow yards in your area Third, verify storage and release fees. Before visiting the impound lot, it is important to find out the fees associated with the storage and release of your impounded car. Impound fees can be quite expensive, so it's important to be prepared. Keep in mind that the longer your car remains in the impound lot, the more fees you may incur. You can contact the impound lot to find out the exact costs associated with your case. In some cases, you may be able to negotiate a reduced fee or a payment plan depending on your financial situation. However, keep in mind that this will depend on the specific regulations of the impound lot and local laws. Fourth, pay outstanding fines or address legal issues Depending on why your car was impounded, you may need to pay outstanding fines or deal with legal issues before you can retrieve your car. If your car was impounded for unpaid parking tickets, traffic violations, or other legal reasons, you will need to settle the outstanding debts before your car can be released. If necessary, consider consulting with a lawyer or seeking legal counsel to help deal with any legal matters related to your impounded car. Fifth, visit the impound lot and retrieve your car. Once you have all the necessary documents, fees, and information, it's time to visit the impound lot and retrieve your car. Bring your identification, proof of ownership, and any required payment with you. Present the required documents to the impound lot staff, pay any outstanding fees, and follow their instructions to retrieve your car. Remember to take your time inspecting the car once it's released, as there may be damages or losses that occurred while it was in the impound lot. Make sure to address these concerns with the impound lot staff immediately if you notice any issues. Lastly, prevention is key after retrieval. Now that you have your car back, it's essential to ensure that a similar situation doesn't happen again. Address any underlying issues that led to your car being impounded, such as unpaid fines or legal issues. Be responsible when parking, and obey local traffic laws and regulations. Ensuring that your car remains insured and properly registered can also prevent problems in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He visited London to work with them, although the group later travelled to the US and stayed with him at his mansion in Atlanta, Georgia. Austin wrote five tracks for the album, including \\"Push the Button\\", which he composed in collaboration with the Sugababes. According to group member Heidi Range, the song was \\"the very last thing\\" completed for the album.\\"Push the Button\\" was conceptualised after group member Keisha Buchanan developed an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin.

Does the sentence \\"Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on.\\" answer the question \\"What does DC stand for?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on.\\" does not answer the question \\"What does DC stand for?\\". However, I can provide a detailed explanation for the term DC and its relation to electric motors. DC stands for Direct Current, which is a type of electric current that flows continuously in one direction. In the context of electric motors, DC refers to a type of motor that is powered by direct current, rather than by alternating current (AC), which periodically changes direction. It is important to understand the difference between these two types of current when discussing electric motors. Direct current is produced by sources like batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells, while alternating current is typically supplied by power grids, as it can be efficiently transmitted over long distances and easily transformed to different voltages. The use of direct current in electric motors has some specific advantages and disadvantages compared to alternating current. Advantages of DC motors include: 1. Simple and straightforward design: DC motors have a simpler construction compared to AC motors, which often makes them more straightforward to understand and maintain. 2. High starting torque: This type of motor provides a higher starting torque, which is crucial in applications that demand an immediate and strong force to get the system up and running. 3. Speed control: DC motors also offer easier speed control compared to many AC motors. This control can be achieved by simply changing the input voltage, making them popular in applications where variable speeds are required. 4. High efficiency: In many cases, DC motors can be more efficient than AC motors, especially at low speeds. Disadvantages of DC motors include: 1. Maintenance: The brushes and commutator in DC motors require regular maintenance and can wear out over time, potentially leading to reduced reliability. 2. Limited applications: In many industrial and commercial applications, AC motors are preferred due to their ease of use with existing power systems, lower maintenance requirements, and scalability. 3. Less suited for high-power applications: While DC motors are great for small appliances and devices, they might be less suitable for larger, high-power applications that require a more robust solution. In the provided sentence, \\"electric power source type\\" refers to the kind of power source (such as AC or DC) used by the electric motor. However, the sentence does not explicitly mention the meaning of DC or its implications. To directly answer the question \\"What does DC stand for?\\", it stands for Direct Current, which is one of the classifications of electric motors based on their power source."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bromeliads nurture frogs, lizards, and various insects. These plants collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, creating a suitable environment for these small creatures to thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy. New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 Census and then again in the 2010 Census. In what decade was there a significant decline in industrial jobs?","output":"The article indicates that there was a significant decline in industrial jobs in New York City in the 1970s.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience.  The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor.  For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.

They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

We need to list the elements from the 1st to the 24th in reverse order. To clarify index value in the list, Python uses 0-indexing, which means the first element in the list is addressed as 0. So, when we say the ith and jth element, in terms of python indexing it will be i-1 and j-1. Here, though, i and j are already 0-indexed. Before extracting, we must remember that list slicing in Python includes the start index but excludes the end index. Therefore, we need to increase the end index by 1 to include the jth element. Given that, to solve the problem: 1. We slice the list from ith index to (j+1)th index. 2. Then, we reverse the list using Python List's reverse() function. Here is the python code which can do the required task: \`\`\`python A = ['689', 'e', '2855', 'T', 'S', 'g', '6001', '9283', '5579', 'P', 'P', '9913', '8385', 'Z', '383', '3937', 'O', 'Y', '4585', 'M', '9695', 'b', 'Z', 'A', 'C', 'd', 'a'] i, j = 1, 24 selected_elements = A[i:j+1]   selected_elements.reverse()   \`\`\` The elements from the 1st to the 24th, in reverse order, in list A, are what \`selected_elements\` will hold after executing the code.

Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up. Select from the following. (I) unacceptable (II) acceptable","output":"A linguist would find the sentence \\"Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up.\\" to be acceptable (II) in terms of English grammar. First, let us break down the sentence to better understand its structure and components. The sentence consists of two main clauses: 1. Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good. 2. So tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up. Both clauses share the same structure, starting with an adverb (\\"tonight\\") followed by a noun clause acting as the subject (\\"what Bob cooked yesterday\\"), a verb, and a complement. In the first clause, \\"still tastes good\\" describes the condition of the food, while in the second clause, \\"will be eaten up\\" indicates the future action related to the food. The two clauses are connected with a coordinating conjunction, \\"so,\\" which demonstrates the cause-and-effect relationship between the two clauses. The fact that the food still tastes good (the cause) leads to the decision to eat it (the effect). Though the sentence might seem cumbersome and repetitive to some, each element fulfills a grammatical function, and there is no violation of syntax rules. Thus, a linguist would likely recognize the sentence as acceptable in terms of English grammar. Nonetheless, it is important to note that what constitutes a grammatically acceptable sentence may vary among different linguistic communities and registers. In some contexts, particularly casual or colloquial speech, speakers might prefer shorter and simplified sentences. For example: \\"The food Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so we'll eat it tonight.\\" The alternative sentence conveys the same meaning but uses more concise phrasing. However, such stylistic preferences do not negate the grammatical acceptability of the original sentence. In conclusion, the given sentence, \\"Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up,\\" is acceptable (II) from a grammatical standpoint. While it may be considered repetitive or overly complex, it follows the rules of English syntax and communicates its intended meaning effectively."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the right side of the equation, you have two terms with the variable u, which are -1038*u and 1207*u. Combine these terms by adding them together: -1038*u + 1207*u = (1207 - 1038)*u = 169*u Now the equation becomes: 1521 = 169*u Step 2: Isolate the variable u on one side of the equation. To isolate u, you need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of u, which is 169: 1521 / 169 = 169*u / 169 Step 3: Simplify and solve for u. Divide 1521 by 169: 1521 ÷ 169 = 9 So the equation becomes: 9 = u The solution to the equation 1521 = -1038*u + 1207*u is u = 9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labor, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more. And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements.

She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine. A romance develops that leads to Christabel marrying Curtis and becoming a high society lady. However, it turns out that she is still attracted to Nick, whom she begins seeing on the side. On one occasion, she slips away from a vacation resort, telling Curtis that she is going to see her aunt Clara. Her lie is exposed by Caine, her uncle, who informs Curtis that the aunt had died while Christabel claimed to be visiting her.

You generally have a right to do whatever you please in the place you call home, as long as you’re not hurting anyone else. That means there’s no better place to shed your clothes than your own backyard. If you have enough well-screened space, you might even be able to do some sunbathing or go for a pleasant stroll.  A wooded grove or field set far back from the road can make a perfect place to strut your stuff. In most countries, it’s almost always against the law to be in public places, like the park or the local convenience store, without clothing. There, you’ll be free to roam around at will without fear of judgment or legal repercussions. You’ll also have a chance to speak with other nudists and gain some insight into their way of life. They may even be able to offer you useful pointers on how to go naked in more places and situations.  Many towns have resorts that are specifically designated for practicing nudists. Run a quick internet search to see if there’s one of these sites near you.  Always be respectful of others who have chosen to live as nudists. It takes a lot of courage to be naked in front of others, and there’s no room for harassment or ridicule. Plan your next vacation for somewhere like the South of France or Australia’s Samurai Beach, where nudity is not only permitted but encouraged. You’ll save room in your suitcase by not having to pack a swimsuit, and by the time you leave you’ll have the most even tan of your life. Just don’t forget to bring sunscreen!  Nude beaches can be found on almost every major continent, and may be worth the trip if you have a desire to bear it all somewhere more interesting than your backyard.  Be certain that your destination allows public nudity before you strip down.

This is due to the fact that the word \\"best\\" is generally associated with high quality or superior performance, indicating that the reviewer is likely expressing a favorable opinion of the movie. It can be inferred that the reviewer may have found it to be an enjoyable experience, or have appreciated some aspect of the film, such as the acting, script, or cinematography. There could be varying reasons for the positive reception. The movie might have an original and captivating storyline, which is engaging to its audience. Another possibility is that the film may have well-developed characters and impressive performances from its cast, resulting in an emotional connection between viewers and the on-screen personas. Additionally, the movie could have been praised for its technical aspects, such as its direction, visual effects, or musical score, which all serve to enhance the overall experience of watching the film. However, it is also essential to note that the provided sentence is insufficient to draw a comprehensive conclusion on the movie's reception. Individual perceptions of films can be influenced by personal tastes, experiences, and expectations, and a single positive comment might not necessarily represent the general consensus regarding the movie.

Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson. Safechuck and Robson allege that Jackson sexually abused them at his home, Neverland Ranch, and at his other residences across California.Reed described his film as a \\"study of the psychology of child sexual abuse, told through two ordinary families who were groomed for 20 years by a paedophile masquerading as a trusted friend\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was holding hands with Gavin?, what is it ?

Question: George V's father liked? Context: The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.

In his lecture Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry. However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist David Starr Jordan's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the American Breeders' Association. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man. From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a \\"defective variety of the human race.\\" By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.

Continue the following story. The shirt soaked in more of the water in one round than the towel did.  It turned out the  pick from the following. 1. shirt is more absorbent.. 2. towel is more absorbent..","output":"At first, it seemed impossible, but it quickly became apparent that the shirt was indeed more absorbent than the towel. Henry, who was using the shirt to clean up the mess, couldn't believe his eyes. His logic told him that the purpose of a towel was to be absorbent; how could a simple shirt outperform it? Curiosity piqued, he started to investigate the fabric of the shirt carefully. It was made of a thick cotton material with a unique weave, allowing it to retain more water than he initially suspected. The fibers absorbed the water quickly, thus enabling the shirt to soak up more water than the terry cloth towel he had been using. The towel, on the other hand, had an entirely different story. Whether it was because of age or frequent usage, the towel's absorbency had declined significantly. The once-plush fabric had become flattened and stiff over time. Henry realized that he had been recently noticing that his towel took longer than usual to dry him off after showers. Eager to learn more, he conducted some research on textile materials and the factors that contribute to their absorbency. Henry discovered a myriad of reasons behind the differences in absorption levels. The thickness of the fabric, quality of the materials used, and the weaving patterns could all affect the absorbency rate. He also found some interesting information about hydrophilic fibers, which are fibers that attract and hold water. Cotton, as it turned out, is a hydrophilic fiber, making it highly absorbent. As he continued his research, he stumbled upon several studies evaluating the water-wicking properties and absorbency of various fabrics. He learned that manufacturers had even developed new materials, such as microfiber and highly absorbent synthetic blends, to increase the absorption capabilities of towels, clothing, and other textile products. A newfound appreciation for textiles blossomed within Henry, and he became determined to find the perfect towel. He sought a product that would bring together the greatest minds and most advanced materials to create unparalleled absorbency – a towel far superior to his current one. Throughout the following weeks, Henry explored various online stores and explored the innovations in the textile industry. He learned about the features that would ensure excellent drying experience, such as better absorbency, quick-dry technology, and even antimicrobial properties to keep his new towel fresh. Finally, feeling confident in his research, he purchased an advanced microfiber towel that had exceptional online reviews and features that he craved. Upon receiving his new towel, he was amazed at how thin and soft it was while maintaining incredible absorbency. At last, he felt satisfied, having discovered the path to the perfect towel. One day, he looked at the shirt that had sparked his journey and smiled. He never thought a soaked shirt could lead to such an educational and fulfilling adventure, but there it was. Now, equipped with his newly purchased towel, Henry felt ready to tackle any water-related challenges that life may throw his way. Meanwhile, the old towel was given a new purpose and repurposed into cleaning rags for different household chores, proving that every textile item has its own unique value and potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly before midnight Friday, Bristol police officers responded to a call about an intoxicated woman sleeping at City Sports. The woman, identified as 22-year-old Kelsey James, was taken to Bristol Hospital for treatment and evaluation, according to a Bristol police press release. More than five hours later, James was lucid and asked hospital staff about her 2-year-old daughter, police said. Police officers obtained a description of James' car, which was parked in the City Sports parking lot. Police found the toddler sleeping in a car seat. The child was taken to Bristol Hospital for evaluation and was being held for Connecticut child welfare authorities, police said. James, a Bristol resident, was arrested Saturday and charged with risk of injury to a minor and leaving an unsupervised child in a motor vehicle. She was released on a 50,000 surety bond for appearance in Bristol Superior Court on September 2, police said. Attempts to reach James for comment were unsuccessful. Should the government step in to prevent hot car deaths? On Wednesday, the Connecticut medical examiner ruled the death of a 15-month-old boy who was left in his father's car in July a homicide. The cause of Benjamin Seitz's death was hyperthermia because of environmental exposure, the state medical examiner said. On July 7, Kyle Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care in Ridgefield, Connecticut, but the dropoff never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz told CNN last month. Seitz drove to work, and at the end of the day, picked Ben up at day care, only to realize he was not there. That was when Seitz found his son in the car. He rushed the child to the hospital, but Ben had died. No criminal charges have beeen filed in the boy's death, but state prosecutors said the investigation was continuing. Benjamin Seitz's death came in the wake of the June case of 22-month-old Cooper Harris, whose death after being left in a hot car in Georgia drew international attention.","output":"A little girl was found sleeping in a car while her mommy was sleeping inside a bar because she drank too much.

Interview: Gilbert and George It is George who opens the door of their expansive, oddly church-like house on one of east London's most beautifully preserved streets, looking, as always, like an eccentric vicar on a day off. The stiff suit, posh voice and formal handshake are all straight out of another time when protocol was all, and civility the norm rather than the exception. 'Welcome, welcome,' he says, but, as soon as the door closes behind you, you wonder what kind of world you are being welcomed into. He leads me down a long, wood-lined hallway, though a door that leads into a small courtyard, and into another even more expansive house which has been converted into a studio. There Gilbert, looking, as always, like a slightly mad bank manager, is waiting. He is smaller, more effusive, and, for all his adopted English formality, still sounds definably Italian, almost comically so. \\"Allo,' he beams, and bids me sit down at a long table, where I am given an invite to their new show. It features a black cross on a white background overlaid with the show's title: 'Sonofagod Pictures', and underneath, the subtitle, 'Was Jesus Heterosexual?' It is pure Gilbert & George: slightly provocative, slightly perverse, a little bit bonkers but in an ordered and obsessive way. A bit like their studio environment, their work, themselves. 'We like the title, \\"Sonofagod\\"', says Gilbert, looking pleased as Punch, 'because, if you say it in a certain way, it sounds like son-of-fag-got.' This amuses him greatly and he dissolves into silent giggles. George smiles down on him like an indulgent headmaster. 'Always the double meaning,' he says. 'That's what life's about. Not dogmatism.' I notice they have used the word 'mufti' in one of their new works, a very Gilbert & Georgian word. 'Oh, a wonderful word, indeed,' says George, smiling. 'But we found out it has another meaning apart from the English one. It's also a person who can issue a fatwa. Terrifying, really.' We have assembled on their home turf to talk art, religion, and maybe even politics, the three topics guaranteed to ruin any drink-fuelled dinner party. Luckily, Gilbert & George don't drink like they used to back in the Seventies, which was in an ordered, obsessive and drop-down-dead-drunk way, in the cause of Art. In their day, it is said, they could have taught the YBAs a thing or two about oblivion. Now, as they approach the age when ordinary people consider retiring - Gilbert is 62, George 64 - their art and life share a more sombre hue, though they still seem determined to shake things up. 'Mufti' is only the start of it. 'We think the Pope should be dragged into the court of human rights,' says George, when I ask why he is so exercised by religion. 'All the suffering these people have invented and perpetuated. Think of the Pope's policy on condoms: how can you not be angry?' Gilbert nods: 'Saying you should make holes in the condoms! Holes! Absurd, no?' It could be a conceptual art piece, I say, a condom with a hole in it. They both laugh, then fall oddly silent. So, it's Catholicism you're against, I ask. Isn't that a bit of an easy target? Surely you should be confronting Muslim extremism? Now, that would be brave - or foolhardy. 'Oh, they're all the same,' says George. 'Same tradition. A bit more totalitarian.' He walks over to the studio door and begins reading from a poster pinned to it in his best C of E voice: 'Verily, it is time to rejoice in the coming state of Islam. There will be no negotiation with Islam. It is only a short time before the flag of Islam flies over Downing Street...?' He walks back to the table. 'Extraordinary, no?' Gilbert nods in agreement. 'It came through the letter box. Unbelievable! Every Friday they hand these leaflets out on Brick Lane.' He shakes his head in bemusement. 'The old generation of Muslims were subdued but not the young generation. Sometimes they go around at night and smash in doors. Ours!' Hadn't you better be careful, I say, in these uncertain times, what with blasphemy laws and incitement laws, not to mention roving gangs of fundamentalists, actual fatwas... 'Oh, we're always careful,' says Gilbert, ' We don't like to confront or be offensive. Ever.' I am just about to mention the 'Naked Shit Pictures' they made in the Nineties, or the 'Dirty Word Pictures' from the Seventies but George is already off on a tangent. 'We had a visit from the Bishop of Stepney recently,' he says. 'I told him we had quite a following among the clergy, which is true. He said, very sweetly, \\"I'm not surprised at all, dear boy.\\"' Gilbert giggles. 'We always seem to have at least one vicar at our openings, don't we, George?' 'Always,' says George. What is it, I ask, that attracts the odd vicar? 'I think a lot of them feel we are the nearest modern art comes to exploring their subject,' says George sincerely. 'Picasso never did it, did he?' Gilbert shakes his head. 'Never,' he says. 'Sex and religion are still the great taboos in modern art.' George nods. 'Extraordinary really. You just have to say the words \\"gay vicar\\", and it all goes mad.' George giggles some more. 'Or, \\"lesbian pope!\\"' he chortles. In his catalogue essay for the new Gilbert & George show, Michael Bracewell invokes the guiding spirits of Baudelaire and TS Eliot but makes no mention at all of Morecambe and Wise. In person, though, Gilbert & George are British art's greatest and longest-running double act, although you'd be hard-pressed to say who's the straight guy, which one is Ernie, and which one Eric. They met in 1967 when, like the girl in the Pulp song, they were studying sculpture at St Martin's college. 'Since we left that place,' says Gilbert, proudly, 'they have never wanted anything to do with us.' Back then, Gilbert was Gilbert Proesch and hailed from a small village in the Dolomites, George was George Passmore from Plymouth. In the iconoclastic spirit of the times, they rejected sculpture and surnames, and decided to turn themselves into a living work of art. They have remained one ever since, their oddness congealing into a kind of signature, as instantly identifiable as the pictures they make. Initially, though, they called themselves 'The Singing Sculpture', and specialised in a deadpan version of 'Underneath the Arches', which they delivered standing still, side by side in their suits, their hands and faces painted bronze. A friend who saw them back then says they were 'odd but ubiquitous', and they have remained so ever since. They have been together, in art and in life, for 40-odd years now, somehow staying abreast of the times by making art that, as George once put it, 'is both old and young'. They first entered the mainstream conscious fleetingly in 1977 when their show 'Dirty Words Pictures' briefly made headlines with its blend of smut and shock tactics, only to be outdone in the outrage stakes by the Sex Pistols swearing on TV. One controversial piece from that time featured their blank, vicarish faces staring out above the word 'BUGGER', and they have traded on that paradox ever since, their apparent normalness contrasting with, and heightening, the apparent obscenity of their subject matter. In the Eighties they provoked a storm of criticism for the seemingly ultra-nationalist emblems embedded in their work, and for a picture of an Asian man alongside the word 'Paki'. One man's insult is another man's art provocation. Later still they attracted a thousand people a day to the South London Gallery for their show 'Naked Shit Paintings', which featured them doing exactly what it said on the invite. 'They never knew what we would do next,' says Gilbert. 'That is why we were not invited to the Venice Biennale for so long. They thought we might embarrass them.' George takes over. 'We like to ask questions, and provoke thought through our work. So much modern art is timid, it is made for collectors, and it just sits there on the wall, almost invisible.' George then describes one of his great epiphanies concerning the condition of modern art. He was undertaking one of his daily walks through London when, as he puts it, 'I was suddenly confronted by a wall on which a person had written the words, \\"My Wife Sucks Dogs Balls\\"'. It suddenly struck me how tame and middle-class so-called confrontational art is. It's not shocking at all, is it, compared to that. It's tame and it's timid. Only the terminally middle-class could be shocked by it.' Ironically, though, the same might now be said of their own work, which has become a signature of sorts, instantly recognisable, reassuringly familiar. Despite all their shock tactics over the last three decades, they have inevitably become a fixture on the British art scene, and even a kind of national treasure: the odd couple who delight in making dirty pictures. On their daily walks from Spitalfields to Dalston, where they dine nightly in the same Turkish restaurant, old ladies often come up to them on the street and shake their hands. 'We always say, they really like us, or they are on Prozac,' giggles Gilbert. Now their self-styled outsider status is also under threat from the embrace of the art establishment that for so long held them at arm's length. Next year, after decades of what they describe as 'total neglect' in Britain, there will be a major retrospective of their work at Tate Modern. What once was shocking now seems perfectly acceptable, familiar even. Recently, too, they moved from the Antony d'Offay gallery to the altogether more trendy White Cube, owned by Brit Art maverick Jay Jopling. When I ask them why they split with D'Offay after 20 years, Gilbert narrows his eyes theatrically and says, 'We hated him. He got under our skin. Slowly. He was of the opinion that he was more important than the artist.' George nods in agreement. 'Jay is wonderful. Charismatic.' They tell me they first met Jopling when he was 'just a little teenager'. Apparently he knocked on their door in 1986, collecting money for charity. 'For the big show in the park,' says Gilbert. 'For Sir Bob,' says George, 'Can you imagine?' Frankly, no. Jopling, they tell me, was also a teenage fan, and his very first art purchase was one of their early books. These days, Gilbert & George's art is of the more emblematic kind: big, backlit assemblages, heavy on symbolism, overlaid with text, both po-mo in its playfulness and oddly medieval in style. There is a certain campness there still, but they have shed the outright smuttiness, the nudity, the profanity and innuendo, in favour of a kind of epic modern symbolism that can be both ominous and baffling. You can look at a Gilbert & George work until the cows come home, checking out the gamut of imagery, from Masonic to heraldic, Hebraic to pagan, and never really get to the bottom of what it is they are on about, save for some fusing of opposites: sacred and profane, iconoclastic and traditional, elevated and debased. I ask them to talk me through the picture inside the invite. It is a work in black, grey and gold, with four crosses in the foreground, each one bearing a bizarre Christlike figure, one of which has two heads, another of which looks like the Alien in Ridley Scott's film of the same name. Various symbols are arranged around the crosses: the three-legged insignia of the Isle of Man, the crescent moon and star of Turkey, a crown, a Judaic ornament, and two mildly phallic metal objects that look like bullets. Gilbert & George are there in the background, as always, though out-of-focus and opaque, waving out of this symbolic minefield like bemused tourists. It seems ordered and, at the same time, oddly haphazard. What though, does it all mean? 'We couldn't possibly say,' sighs Gilbert. 'It's all about life. Emotion. But I cannot explain it. That is not the job of the artist. You just cannot read an artwork in that way. It's how you connect, how you feel. When I stand in front of a small painting by Samuel Palmer, it is just mysterious. That is its power. It has no fixed meaning. It evades words.' George nods. 'Do you know what these are?\\" he says, pointing at the small phallic objects. 'Prayer containers. Everyone in Brick Lane is wearing one. And they look like bullets. Extraordinary, no?' In the past 40 years they have seen their adopted East End neighbourhood change dramatically. 'It was Jewish when we arrived,' says George, 'then it got arty, then Maltese, then Somali, then the city boys came. Now it's families, and the new art elite.' (Tracey Emin lives around the corner, Jake and Dinos Chapman have a studio just up the road, Rachel Whiteread a house just down the street.) 'We were here first, though,' says Gilbert, and, in more ways than one, this is true. The only people people Gilbert & George's art seems to offend these days are the Reverend Ian Paisley, whose followers famously picketed a recent Gilbert & George show in Belfast, and Brian Sewell, the equally puritanical art critic of the Evening Standard, whose loathing for conceptualism is limitless and obsessive. 'Oh, Belfast was very good!' says George, 'They all had megaphones...' 'And raincoats!' says Gilbert, mysteriously. 'They were chanting \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\" over and over,' continues Gilbert, beaming at the memory. 'I asked one of them, \\"Where exactly is that club? It sounds great.\\"' When I mention Sewell's name, George strides out of the room, and returns, moments later, brandishing a sheet of paper. 'Found it!' he says, excitedly. 'It's all the key words from a Brian Sewell review of one of our shows. We wrote them down for posterity.' He begins reading aloud in his best Sewell voice: '\\"Posers, trivial, clean, dirty, dick, lowlife, unkempt, lavatory, ejaculation, emptying bowels, bladder, comely adolescent boy, four-letter words, black penis springing from white loins, Gilbert's anus, youth with greasy torso, sodomolenos, tapioca de wankeur, schoolboy smut, bilge, blasphemy.\\"' He shakes his head in wonder, 'All in one review!' George is giggling again. 'Tapioca de wankeur!' he says, barely able to get the words out. 'It's so good, it's almost art.' They are both laughing now, and you feel like they could go on like this forever, bouncing ideas, jokes, words, pictures off each other, always secure in the knowledge that their vision is, at least, a shared one, and that the last laugh will somehow always be theirs. You really couldn't make them up. · Sonofagod Pictures opens at the White Cube, London N1 on 20 January Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In this interview with British contemporary artists, Gilbert and George, they discuss their career, latest exhibition, and their perspective on religion and provocative art.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, Zvuki Mu and Birdland are both rock bands, although they have distinct characteristics and come from different regions and time periods. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, let's delve into the individual profiles of each band and then explore their similarities and differences. Zvuki Mu: Zvuki Mu is a Russian rock band formed in the early 1980s in Moscow. The group was led by the eccentric and talented singer-songwriter Pyotr Mamonov, who was known for his distinctive stage presence and thought-provoking lyrics. The music of Zvuki Mu can be characterized as a blend of post-punk, new wave, and experimental rock, with a unique approach to sound and lyrics that reflect the socio-political climate of the time. The band's debut album, \\"Zvuki Mu,\\" was released in 1989 and produced by the famous British musician Brian Eno. Zvuki Mu gained critical acclaim, both locally and internationally, for their original sound and thought-provoking lyrics. With Eno's help, the band was able to tour Europe, showcasing their music to a broader audience. Zvuki Mu continued to release albums and perform live until their eventual disbandment in the early 2000s. Birdland: Birdland is a British rock band that emerged in the late 1980s, consisting of brothers Robert and Anthony Vincent, Simon Scott, and Steve Weston. Their music can be classified as a fusion of punk rock, indie, and alternative rock, with influences from bands such as The Stooges, The Velvet Underground, and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Birdland released their self-titled debut album in 1991, which featured high-energy songs, driven by catchy guitar riffs and raw vocals. The band received significant attention from the British music press and developed a dedicated fan base. However, despite their initial success, Birdland struggled to maintain momentum and disbanded in the mid-1990s. Similarities and Differences: Both Zvuki Mu and Birdland are rock bands that were active during different time periods and originated from different countries; however, they share some similarities. They both infused their music with punk elements and a raw and energetic sound, resonating with audiences looking for something fresh and distinctive. Moreover, each band gained critical acclaim and attention within their respective scenes, experiencing varying degrees of commercial success. In terms of differences, Zvuki Mu's music is more experimental and avant-garde compared to Birdland's more straightforward punk rock sound. Additionally, the lyrical content and themes of Zvuki Mu's songs often reflected the complex socio-political landscape of Russia during the 1980s, while Birdland's lyrics generally revolved around more typical themes of love, loss, and rebellion. In conclusion, Zvuki Mu and Birdland are indeed both rock bands that brought something unique and exciting to the rock scene. While their musical styles differ and they emerged from separate regions, they each contributed to the diversification of rock music during their active years, leaving a lasting impact on fans and future generations of musicians alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's examine both the premise and the hypothesis in detail. Premise: A tan colored dog leaps into the inground pool. In this premise, we are provided with the information that there is a specific dog, which is tan-colored. The key action described is that the dog is leaping into an inground pool. This action places the dog in the midst of a dynamic physical activity, most likely interacting with the water and engaging with the surroundings. Hypothesis: The dog is asleep on the patio. In the given hypothesis, we are supposed to infer whether the dog is asleep on the patio or not. The act of sleeping typically involves being stationary, passive, and resting in a specific location, which in this case is mentioned to be on the patio. The contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis can be primarily observed in terms of the activity and location of the dog. The premise mentions the action of leaping into an inground pool, while the hypothesis suggests that the dog is asleep on the patio. The two statements cannot both be true at the same time. If the premise is true, the tan-colored dog is indeed leaping happily into the pool, actively engaging with water, and not sleeping. In contrast, if the hypothesis is true, the dog is in a completely different location (on the patio) and in a state of rest or sleep, which is incompatible with the action described in the premise. In conclusion, if the premise is true, we cannot assume that the hypothesis is also true as both statements describe different actions and locations for the dog.

What is the answer for the question: What was the specific Roger Pratt philosophy whose consequence resulted in the family occupying the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre? from the following article ?  The plan of the rooms at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \\"Best bedchamber\\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service... Answer:","output":"The specific Roger Pratt philosophy mentioned in the article, which resulted in the family occupying the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings with the state rooms in the center, is Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. This design approach aimed to create a distinction between the spaces reserved for family members and those intended for guests, ensuring privacy for the family while providing suitable accommodation for visitors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Red Eye starts in Texas where hotel receptionist Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is about to catch the last 'red eye' flight back to Miami where she lives & works. While waiting for her plane Lisa meets the handsome & charming Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) & they both seem to hit it off, then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other. Once the plane takes off & they are in the air Jackson reveals who he really is & that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence, Jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia) & they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in Miami. Jackson tells Lisa to phone the hotel & make it happen or her father will be killed... Directed by Wes Craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as The Last House on the Left (1972), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1989), The People Under the Stairs (1991) & the Scream trilogy of teen slashers a short, punchy, fast paced little thriller like Red Eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film Craven usually makes. The script by Carl Ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that I must admit I really enjoyed, at only 85 odd minutes in length it's a very quick moving, economical & straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight, taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots. Some may like this approach like I did while other's may not but I think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick & fast without the film slowing down any & giving you a chance to relax. I really liked the plot for Red Eye, sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell, it's a film made to entertain & for me that's what it did. I really liked the two central character's, Lisa comes across as very likable while Jackson Rippner (an obvious play on the name of the notorious Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper) is a suitably slimy villain with a cold 'I'm only doing my job' type mentality. Another plus point is that I didn't think anyone behaved overly stupid here, everyone actually seemed like human beings & the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion. I really liked this & it's one of Craven's better more recent films. Craven turns in a good solid tense, tight, taught & fast paced thriller with an attractive cast, some good action & a gripping plot. He certainly doesn't hang about & once he starts the action & tension he never lets up, far & away the most effective part of the film is when Rippner is holding Lisa hostage on the plane & once the film switches to Miami & Lisa's fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it's still good. A special mention goes to Rachel McAdams who is absolutely gorgeous in this, I could probably watch Red Eye again just because she is in it & looks drop dead stunning. Those who see Wes Craven's name attached to Red Eye expecting a horror film should think again since there's no horror in it at all (despite the IMDb listing 'Horror' as Red Eye's genre). I am not sure about the ending, on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see Lisa kill him in some way. DreamWorks apparently gave Red Eye an initial budget of 44,000,000 but reduced it to 25,000,000 although it's still a very well made film with glossy production values. Actually shot in Los Angeles & Florida in California. The film was supposedly written with husband & wife Sean Penn & Robin Wright Penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads. As I have already said Rachel McAdams is pure eye candy & is a total babe in this & worth watching the film for on her own. Oh, & she puts in a decent performance too. Red Eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that I enjoyed immensely, I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did & I am glad I decided to watch it. This definitely gets a recommendation from me & Rachel McAdams really is hot stuff in this...

Choices:  - hall - kitchen - neighbor's house - card room - livingroom  The rationale to choose \\"livingroom\\" as the answer is that:","output":"The \\"livingroom\\" is the most logical and suitable choice for placing an extra table during Thanksgiving due to the following reasons: 1. Space: Living rooms are typically one of the more spacious areas in a home, allowing for additional tables and seating to accommodate a larger number of guests. Most living rooms have enough room to rearrange or temporarily move furniture to make space for the extra table. 2. Accessibility: The living room is generally a common area that is easily accessible to all guests. Placing the extra table in the living room ensures that everyone attending the Thanksgiving gathering can easily find and interact with one another, fostering a more social atmosphere. 3. Comfort: Living rooms are designed for relaxation and entertainment, featuring comfortable seating and a friendly environment. Having the extra table in the living room allows guests to enjoy their meal in a comfortable setting while also allowing for conversation and interaction. 4. Continuity: If the primary dining area or dining table is near the living room, placing an extra table there ensures a sense of continuity, making it feel like one large dining space. This allows all guests to feel included in the Thanksgiving celebration, rather than feeling separated or isolated in a different area of the house. In comparison to the other options: - Hall: Halls are usually narrow and not designed to accommodate large gatherings or tables. - Kitchen: Kitchens can be crowded and busy, particularly during a large meal preparation. Limited space and the need for efficiency make kitchens less suitable for a table to accommodate guests. - Neighbor's house: Asking to use a neighbor's house for a table might not be practical or comfortable for all involved. - Card room: Not all houses have a card room, and if they do, it may be too small to accommodate a large group for Thanksgiving. Considering these points, the living room is the most practical and suitable choice for placing the extra table during Thanksgiving."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns.

Context: The screening suggests that in 2000, 19 percent of all newborn babies in Metropolitan France had at least one parent originating from one of the risk regions. The figure for 2007 was 28.45 percent, for 2010 31.5 percent, for 2012 34.44 percent, for 2013 35.7 percent, and for 2015 38.9 percent.

The percentage for Île-de-France was a significant increase from 54.2% in 2005. However, a 2014 story in Le Monde suggested that the testing figures for Île-de-France were distorted by the practices of some hospitals in the region, which choose to test all babies whether or not they have parents with ancestry from an endemic sickle-cell region.

Article: The variance in prevalence rates is reflected in people's inconsistent responses to the different components of sexual orientation within a study and the instability of their responses over time. Laumann et al., (1994) found that among U.S. adults 20% of those who would be considered homosexual on one component of orientation were homosexual on the other two dimensions and 70% responded in a way that was consistent with homosexuality on only one of the three dimensions. Furthermore, sexuality is fluid such that one's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life. Diamond (2003) found that over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once, with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings. Furthermore, women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour. One woman stated \\"I'm mainly straight but I'm one of those people who, if the right circumstance came along, would change my viewpoint\\". Therefore, individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be.

Members of the Atlantis crew helped choreograph the spacewalk from inside the space station, but only Fossum and Garan ventured outside. While on the spacewalk, the engineers were expected to recover a broken pump and stow it in the shuttle's cargo bay. They also planned to retrieve an experiment from the bay and mount it outside the space station before deploying another experiment, according to NASA. On Monday, the crews learned they are not in danger from an orbiting piece of debris, the space agency said. The agency had been tracking a piece of the COSMOS 375 satellite, saying it could come close to the station.  But NASA said Mission Control verified that the debris will pass a safe distance from the station and shuttle. The scrap is one of more than 500,000 pieces of debris tracked in Earth's orbit, according to NASA. The space agency also announced Monday that Atlantis would stay in space one day more than originally planned. The shuttle, which was scheduled to land July 20, will now make what NASA called a night landing at the Kennedy Space Center at 5:56 a.m. July 21. Atlantis lifted off Friday on NASA's final space shuttle mission. The first shuttle, Columbia, blasted off in April 1981. Since then, space shuttle crews have fixed satellites, performed scientific studies, and ferried materials and people to International Space Station Alpha, a football field-sized construction project in orbit. In 134 missions, the five space shuttles have ferried 355 astronauts into space. When Atlantis lands, it will leave the United States with no way to lift humans into space for the first time in decades.  NASA will rely on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","output":"On Tuesday, NASA engineers Michael Fossum and Ronald Garan were tethered to the International Space Station (ISS), floating 245 miles above Earth. The spacewalk, which began 40 minutes behind schedule, marked the last spacewalk of the shuttle era. As the engineers took in the breathtaking view of the Yucatan Peninsula, veteran astronaut Stephen Bowen spoke to them from Houston's Johnson Space Center. The spacewalk was scheduled to last for just over six hours. Fossum and Garan had been at the ISS for several weeks prior to the arrival of Atlantis, the final shuttle flight in NASA's 30-year-old program. While at the ISS, the engineers were tasked with recovering a broken pump, stowing it in the shuttle's cargo bay, retrieving an experiment from the bay, and mounting it outside the ISS before deploying another experiment. NASA announced that the crews were not in danger from an orbiting piece of debris from the COSMOS 375 satellite. They had been tracking the debris, one of over 500,000 pieces monitored in Earth's orbit. The space shuttle Atlantis, launched on NASA's final shuttle mission, was scheduled for a night landing at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21 at 5:56 a.m., one day later than originally planned. The first shuttle, Columbia, blasted off in April 1981. Since then, space shuttle crews have fixed satellites, performed scientific studies, and ferried materials and people to the ISS. In 134 missions, the five space shuttles have transported 355 astronauts into space. When Atlantis lands, the U.S. will no longer have a way to lift humans into space, relying instead on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Routines generally last 60–90 seconds depending on age of participant and routine category.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"What does aerobic gymnastiscs involve?\\"","output":"While the statement \\"Routines generally last 60–90 seconds depending on age of participant and routine category\\" provides some information about the duration of routines in aerobic gymnastics, it does not completely answer the question of what aerobic gymnastics involves.  Aerobic gymnastics, also known as sport aerobics or competitive aerobics, is a competitive sport that combines elements of both aerobics and gymnastics. It involves performing high-energy, rhythmic routines that incorporate various movement patterns, often set to music. The routines are designed to challenge participants' strength, flexibility, coordination, and cardiovascular endurance. Here are some key aspects of aerobic gymnastics: 1. Elements: Aerobic gymnastics combines traditional aerobic movements such as jumps, kicks, and turns with traditional gymnastics elements such as balances, lifts, and tumbling. Participants must demonstrate a variety of skills, including flexibility, strength, and agility, within their routines. 2. Music: The routines in aerobic gymnastics are typically set to upbeat, energetic music, helping participants maintain an elevated heart rate. The music plays a key role in engaging both the audience and the participants, driving the overall energy of the performance. 3. Group or Solo Performances: Aerobic gymnastics routines can be performed as individual, mixed pairs, trios, or groups of six. Each type of performance has specific rules and requirements for participants, including different time limits for routines. 4. Scoring: Aerobic gymnastics competitions are scored by judges who assess each routine based on three main criteria: artistic merit (the overall presentation and choreography), technical merit (the execution and difficulty of elements), and execution (the overall quality of performance, including balance, flexibility, and strength). 5. Competitions: Aerobic gymnastics competitions are organized at various levels, including national, regional, and international competitions. The World Aerobic Gymnastics Championships, organized by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), is the premier event for elite athletes in the sport. 6. Training: Athletes who compete in aerobic gymnastics must undergo rigorous training to develop their strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, and coordination. Training typically includes traditional aerobic exercises, gymnastics elements, choreography work, and routine repetition. In conclusion, aerobic gymnastics is a dynamic and engaging sport that involves performing energetic, choreographed routines that challenge participants' physical abilities, artistic expression, and performance skills. While the statement about routine length does provide some information about aerobic gymnastics, a more comprehensive understanding requires an examination of the various elements, formats, scoring criteria, and training involved in the sport."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage  \\"Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5.8 km2 (2.2 sq mi) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea.

The reviewer can't verify about the testosterone release, which indicates that there's a claim made by the product that they were not able to confirm.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: There are many older people in the world and there will be many more.A limeknown fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries.According to the World Health Organization,by 2020 there will be 1 billion,with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value  the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are  respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination   in employment.Lifelong learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people.Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net. To achieve equality in such matters will take considerable time and effort.One thing is sure:there is no time to be lost. Question: Which of the following measures is NOT mentioned to solve the population ageing problem? Options: A: Getting rid of age discrimination in employment.

Sounds like a simple enough thing. And basically it is. But what is adventure? That is the key here and the answer can be different for different people. For those who love sports, adventure travel can have a whole different meaning than for those who like history. The physical travel types that you can find include such adventure travel as white water rafting  , kayaking or climbing and hiking to some mountains somewhere. To the hiker, backpacking across Ireland might be their adventure. For this type of person, adventure travel almost always includes something physical. Often the goal is to push their body's limits and test their individual endurance  . For those who less want to climb mountains, adventure travel might mean traveling to Nepal and taking in the local festivals. Wine tasting in Italy is also vacation adventure for the more relaxed traveler who enjoys peace and comfort. Anything that is opposite to the normal scope   of the traveler's lifestyle defines   adventure. Adventure travel is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all type of vacation. Adventure depends on the person's physical limits, how much money the person has and what the person enjoys doing. Going _ the normal is adventurous for many. If your life is quite busy, then sitting on a beach in the moonlight with your family might be adventure for you. The point is not what you do but that you have a good time and that it is an adventure for YOU -- not for the person next to you. Do not sit home this year when vacation time rolls around.

Casey is an adolescent boy whose life is constantly influenced by his intense fear of clowns. His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \\"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\\" As the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun. When the clowns target their home, Casey is forced to face his fears once and for all. Casey and his brothers are locked inside their isolated farmhouse and the power is turned off. Casey attempts to call the police, but because Casey says that the \\"clowns from the circus are trying to get him\\", the police officers assume that Casey's fear of clowns caused him to have a realistic nightmare. The officers tell Casey that everything will be fine if he goes back to sleep, and hangs up. Randy mockingly dresses up as a clown, disbelieving of Casey's claims that clowns are inside the house. His plan to jump out at Geoffrey and Casey is cut short after he is stabbed by one of the clowns.

Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Apple Pay is currently available in around 220,000 shops, and 10 banks, in the US. By comparison, LoopPay is available at more than 90 per cent - or 10 million - shops in the US. It works on Apple, Samsung, Motorola, LG, HTC and Huawei devices and can additionally be used at more than 5,000 banks and issuers.

A:","output":"To ascertain if the suggested answer is valid, let's first define what use taxes are and then evaluate the answer accordingly. Step 1: Define Use Tax Use tax is a tax applied on the purchase of tangible personal property from an out-of-state or online retailer, when sales tax hasn't been paid or collected. This tax is typically levied on items used, consumed, or stored in the buyer's state, where the seller didn't collect sales tax due to being exempt. Step 2: Compare the suggested answer with the definition of Use Tax Suggested answer: This really means that you don't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction. Step 3: Analyze and Determine if the answer is Valid  Upon analysis, it's evident that the suggested answer doesn't clearly explain what use taxes are. Although it's correct that you don't have to pay both sales tax and use tax on one transaction, this statement doesn't define or provide enough context about use tax.

Context: The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector.

Dr. Roberts, a famous lecture at the University of Chester, said such websites don't appear to help make true friendships. Based on two questionnaires , he found there was no link between Facebook use and people with larger groups of friends. Dr. Roberts, whose work will be presented at the British Psychological Society conference in Harrogate, said, \\"The bottom lime conclusion is that our relationships are not dependent on the quantity of communication. They depend on quality, and even Skype  is better at increasing the quality of our communication than time on Facebook.\\" Even talking on the phone or texting does not make people feel as good as sharing a smile, the research says. The studies suggest quality, not quantity, of communication is the most important for keeping friends for life. People find the most satisfying relationships come from a small number of close friends, with an outer \\"ring\\" of 10 significant others.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is.

My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know.

Movie title: The Company You Keep Context: (SUPPOSEDLY) OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS - no spoilersSharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) is nervous. She's driving along a lonely road, lost in thought. As she goes over a hill, her car drifts a little too close to the center-divide and she's almost crushed by a truck going in the opposite direction. Rattled further, she pulls into a gas station. She looks like any another woman until cars come screeching in all around her, FBI agents begin waving their badges and a shotgun is pointed at her head.Jim Grant (Robert Redford) has made a good life for himself as a small town lawyer in Albany New York. He has managed to juggle his job and raise his 11 year old daughter Isabel after the death of his wife a few years ago. His world is turned upside down after he's approached by his old friend Billy while dropping his daughter off at school. Billy fills Jim in on Sharon's arrest which took place not far from them. Billy asks if Jim will help Sharon in any way, but Jim wants no part of it.We learn that Sharon was a former member of a radical group called the Weather Underground. The group robbed a bank way back in the late '70s and the security guard, an off duty policeman, was shot and killed in the process. Sharon has been charged with murder. Jim is suddenly under suspicion of somehow being involved.During the ensuing investigation, evidence is unearthed and connections are being made, namely by young and clever Albany Sun-Times reporter Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf). Ben uses his local and FBI contacts and slowly begins to think that Jim was involved in the robbery and murder. But past appearances can be deceiving and as he tries to get to the bottom of it all, Jim leads Ben and the FBI on a cross-country manhunt, while trying to find the third remaining member-at-large, Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie), so that he might convince her to come forward and prove his innocence and save his daughter.SYNOPSIS with spoilersA pre-credit sequence tells the story of radical activists during the Vietnam War era whose protests led to crimes such...

The person has solved the Rubik's Cube. After spending some time analyzing the Rubik's Cube's colors and turning it in all directions, the person starts focusing on using a methodical approach to solving the puzzle. There are several well-established solving algorithms, such as the layer-by-layer method, the corners-first method, or the Fridrich Method (CFOP). The person may choose one of these methods or create their own unique solving logic. Initially, the person might work on getting the first side or layer of the cube solved. This involves matching the same colors together and creating a solid, monochromatic face. Once this is achieved, the person proceeds with a systematic pattern for solving subsequent layers. For instance, in the layer-by-layer method, the next step would be solving the middle layer by correctly positioning and orienting the edge pieces that connect the first layer to the second layer. As the person progresses through each step, they become more familiar with the cube's movements and the specific set of moves required to manipulate the positions of the various pieces. This is a gradual process that requires patience, concentration, and the ability to visualize the desired end result. Eventually, the person reaches the final layer, which may appear to be the most challenging aspect of the Rubik's Cube. However, at this stage, they have already developed a strong sense of the cube's mechanics, and they are able to manipulate the final pieces into their correct positions and orientations. Following this process, the person successfully solves the Rubik's Cube. Afterward, they might feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, as solving the cube is recognized as a challenging intellectual pursuit. This can lead to increased confidence in their problem-solving abilities and could inspire them to take on additional brain-teasing puzzles or even attempt to improve their solving speed through practice and mastering more advanced solution techniques. Furthermore, this achievement might encourage the person to share their newfound knowledge and skills with others, helping to build camaraderie and foster a broader interest in the world of logic puzzles and mental challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a beginner in the world of meditation, she was both excited and a bit nervous. Nevertheless, she knew that Mary was a wise teacher and would be the perfect guide. Mary started by explaining the importance of intention in meditation and how it could help Maria set the mood for her practice. Maria thought about her intentions and decided that she wished to learn patience and cultivate gratitude in her life. Step 1: Choose a quiet spot Together, Maria and Mary found a serene space in the garden, surrounded by lush greenery and the soothing sounds of a trickling waterfall. This space would remove any distractions and allow Maria to focus solely on her meditation practice. Step 2: Find a comfortable posture Mary guided Maria to sit down on a soft cushion with her back straight and her legs crossed comfortably. As Maria adjusted her position, she became aware of her body, making sure that her entire weight was evenly distributed. Step 3: Focus on the breath Mary then instructed Maria to gently close her eyes and pay attention to the natural rhythm of her breath. Maria could feel the sensation of the cool air entering her nostrils, filling her lungs, and the warmth of it as it left her body. Step 4: Practice mindfulness As Maria began to settle into her meditation, thoughts would inevitably arise. Mary encouraged her to notice these thoughts without judgment, and gently bring her focus back to the breath.

Write an article based on this summary: Three people have died in a water tank in Australia in a suspected case of carbon monoxide poisoning, police say.","output":"Title: Suspected Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Leads to Three Deaths in Australian Water Tank Introduction: In a tragic incident in Australia, three people lost their lives in a water tank, reportedly due to carbon monoxide poisoning. According to the police, the circumstances of their deaths point to a high likelihood of carbon monoxide exposure as the primary cause. This unfortunate event has brought to light the potential dangers of this odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas, which can be fatal in high concentrations. Incident details: The incident occurred in the rural region of Australia, where the three individuals were found unconscious inside a water tank. Preliminary investigations by the authorities have revealed that the victims had been conducting maintenance work inside the tank at the time of the accident. The water tank was part of a larger water storage system used for both agricultural and domestic purposes. It is believed that a petrol-powered water pump, which was in use during the maintenance, malfunctioned, leading to the build-up of carbon monoxide within the tank. Due to the enclosed space, inadequate ventilation, and lack of immediate response, the concentration of the gas reached lethal levels, causing the sudden deaths of the three individuals. Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: A Silent Killer Carbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly gas, which is primarily formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels such as petrol, diesel, wood, or coal. Since it is virtually impossible to detect without specialized equipment, the risks associated with carbon monoxide poisoning are far greater than those of other toxic gases. Carbon monoxide exposure inhibits the blood's ability to carry oxygen, which may lead to serious health consequences or death. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. Prolonged exposure to high levels of the gas can result in unconsciousness and ultimately, death. Each year, numerous carbon monoxide-related fatalities are reported worldwide, emphasizing the importance of taking adequate safety precautions and installing carbon monoxide detectors in homes and workplaces. Preventive Measures and Public Awareness In the wake of the tragic water tank incident, authorities are calling for increased public awareness around the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning. Preventive measures, such as installing detectors, using well-maintained equipment with proper ventilation, and conducting regular inspections, can help save lives. Key recommendations for preventing carbon monoxide exposure include: 1. Install carbon monoxide detectors in homes and workplaces, especially if they use fuel-burning appliances. 2. Ensure that all fuel-burning appliances are serviced and maintained regularly by a qualified professional. 3. Avoid using fuel-powered equipment in poorly-ventilated areas, such as closed garages or confined spaces. 4. Do not ignore the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning; seek immediate medical assistance if these symptoms are experienced. 5. Educate family members, employees, and communities about the dangers associated with carbon monoxide exposure and how to prevent it. Conclusion: The unfortunate incident of three deaths in an Australian water tank due to suspected carbon monoxide poisoning is a stark reminder of the potential dangers of this lethal gas. It highlights the importance of creating public awareness, implementing preventive measures, and promoting the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in homes and workplaces. Taking these steps can help ensure that similar tragedies are avoided in the future and that lives are saved from the silent and invisible threat of carbon monoxide poisoning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

Write a text based on this summary: ugandan banks open up to credit finance Text:","output":"Title: Ugandan Banks Embrace Credit Finance, Expanding Economic Opportunities In recent years, the Ugandan banking sector has signaled a significant shift towards the expansion of credit finance. This development is igniting economic opportunities, driving growth, and improving financial services for individuals and businesses alike. Banks in Uganda are opening up to credit as a means to promote entrepreneurship, invest in infrastructure, and support the socio-economic development of the nation. Coupled with robust regulatory frameworks, Ugandan banks are laying the groundwork for financing initiatives that will catalyze prosperity within the country. Traditionally, Ugandan banks have operated with a conservative approach to lending, opting for security over higher returns and broader economic growth. However, spurred by increased access to financial services, technological advancements, and growing demand from businesses and customers, the banking sector has begun to harness the potential of credit finance. By embracing a more liberal and diversified lending approach, Ugandan banks are successfully overcoming various challenges, such as limited credit history and insufficient collateral, that have hindered their growth in the past. Uganda's banking landscape continues to become more competitive, with both local and international financial institutions eager to capitalize on emerging credit opportunities. The increase in available credit options is generating new employment opportunities, enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to scale their operations, and ultimately contributing to Uganda's broader economic development. Moreover, credit finance enables individuals and businesses to invest in previously inaccessible assets, such as property and equipment, which can stimulate the local economy and create a more significant regional impact. The introduction of digital technologies and platforms in the banking sector means a greater number of Ugandans can access financial services, particularly in remote or underbanked areas. By leveraging digital solutions, such as mobile banking and fintech innovations, banks can offer credit products to a broader population. This not only democratizes access to credit but also allows the financial market to become increasingly inclusive and integrated. Through mobile money platforms, the underbanked segments of Uganda's population can now more easily save, borrow, and access insurance - leading to a healthier and more robust economy. In addition to opening new avenues for businesses and consumers alike, the increased focus on credit finance by Ugandan banks is expected to foster further collaboration between financial institutions and various industry sectors. These partnerships can enable banks to offer targeted credit solutions designed to cater to specific industries' unique needs, ultimately boosting growth across multiple sectors. While the expansion of credit finance in Uganda paints an optimistic picture, the authorities must ensure strict regulations to maintain financial stability and protect against potential risks, such as non-performing loans, which may arise. Simultaneously, efforts are needed to improve the country's financial infrastructure, such as credit reference bureaus, to support banks' credit assessments. Education and awareness campaigns targeting customers must also be considered, with the objective of promoting responsible borrowing and debt management practices. In conclusion, the opening of Ugandan banks to credit finance marks a turning point in the country's financial growth narrative. As access to credit encourages entrepreneurship, investment, and economic development, the Ugandan populace can more fully grasp the potential of credit finance to drive prosperity. By leveraging technology, fostering innovation, and employing stringent regulations, Uganda's banking sector is set to play a vital role in the country's progress, creating a sustainable and inclusive financial landscape for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff.

What is the best way to: To increase a person's typing speed,","output":"The best way to increase a person's typing speed involves a combination of practice, proper technique, and focus on accuracy. Here is a step-by-step guide to help improve typing speed: 1. Assess current typing speed: First, determine the individual's current typing speed and accuracy using an online typing test. This serves as the baseline for gauging improvement. 2. Learn proper typing technique: Ensure the person knows the proper finger placement on the keyboard, i.e., the home row position. Fingers should be curved and wrists slightly elevated. 3. Touch typing: Encourage the development of muscle memory by practicing touch typing, which means typing without looking at the keyboard. This will train the brain to associate the position of each key with a specific finger movement. 4. Focus on accuracy: Initially, prioritize accuracy over speed. As the person becomes more proficient in typing accurately, their speed will naturally increase. 5. Practice regularly: Set aside time for regular practice sessions. Consistency is key for improvement. Aim for at least 15-30 minutes of practice daily. 6. Use online tools and software: Utilize online tools and software like TypingClub, Typing.com, or Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing to learn and practice typing through various exercises and games. 7. Set small goals: Set achievable, short-term goals. For example, aim to increase typing speed by 5 words per minute (WPM) every two weeks. 8. Monitor progress: Periodically assess typing speed and accuracy using a typing test. Identify areas of weakness and focus on improving those specific aspects. 9. Work on problem areas: If a person is facing difficulty with specific keys or finger movements, dedicate time to practicing those problem areas more extensively. 10. Develop good posture: Maintain proper posture while typing. Sit up straight, keep feet flat on the ground, and position the keyboard and monitor at comfortable heights. 11. Minimize hand strain: Take periodic breaks to avoid hand strain and fatigue. Stretch the fingers, wrist, and arms during these breaks. By following these steps diligently, a person's typing speed will gradually increase, allowing them to type more efficiently and effortlessly over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'The lady's like, the only way we can expedite is if your son was pregnant and in labor, or if he was an illegal,' Krista said. The parents said Hunter 'has known nothing other than hospitals, doctors, sickness and pain.' Distraught: Mother Krista has been left out of her mind with worry by the loss of Hunter's insurance and the bureaucratic minefield she is having to through to fix it. Krista was incredulous when she received a letter in November from her insurance provider asking why her son - who has been covered by them his entire life - was in hospital in the first place. Krista reasoned that after seven-years of paying for his medical bills, the insurance company would have a good idea of what was wrong with him. Despite Krista's insistence that the Affordable Care Act has caused her son to be un-insured, a media spokesperson with Texas Health and Human Services Communication - who handle CHIP - said that the problem does not lie with Obamacare. However she did admit to administrative changes that could have led to mistakes moving Hunter from CHIP to an upgraded version of Medicaid. She repeated that the problem was not related to Obamacare, but there  were some 'glitches' in coverage when the changeover happened. Ron Alford with his daughter Makayla and son Hunter - he is a police officer in Gainsville and struggling to get his children the health care they have been insured for their entire lives. However, it seems that one of those glitches caused a little boy with life-threatening cancer to lose his health insurance. Over the past month Krista has been stuck in a bureaucratic hell - being passed from one agency telephone helpline to the next. Each one has brought her no closer to an answer or a resolution. Krista said she’d had Hunter's current insurance for a year-and-a-half and had never received any notice that she needed to 'requalify' her children because of Obamacare. When she phoned to complain Krista says, 'all of a sudden could not find my son case, at all. And then, she transferred me over to another gentleman who found his case. He said it was hidden, because when they switched over to HHSC (Texas Health and Human Services Commission), they lost a lot of cases files and Hunter’s was just one of those.' The more she asked, the more confusing the answers became. 'Then they told me October 17th was when he was actually canceled. But on October 25 he had chemo, and they paid for it. So, I am getting different stories.' Tough: Hunter has been ill his entire life and needs another round of chemotherapy to battle his rare form of cancer. The latest development in the shocking case is one that the wife of a small town police officer finds hard to believe. 'Now, the new story with CHIP is they called and said my husband makes too much money, 173 too much. 'So, I’m very upset. I was bawling on the phone with her and the only thing she said was, ‘Have a nice day,’ and she hung up.' To make matters worse, the Alford's have been told that their son's cancer is not only rare but behaving in an unusual manner. 'These tumors are very rare. They are not supposed to spread, but his decided they were going to spread. And it can go into his lungs, because the tumors like soft tissue, and your lungs are soft tissue.' With Hunter desperately in need of a new round of Chemotherapy, Krista has said the family have no choice but to accept the massive 50,000 bill for it with no insurance. However, they have set up a fund for people to help - 'Heroes for Hunter' and so far they have raised 11,005 - but everything will help. Write highlights for this article.","output":"Little Hunter Alford is a 7-year-old boy living in Gainesville, Texas. He has a very rare type of cancer called Plexiform Histiocytoma Neoplasm. This cancer has now spread to his brain, and Hunter needs chemotherapy to help fight it. But there's a big problem: Hunter lost his health insurance because of an administrative mistake that happened when new rules under Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, were being put into place. Hunter's family got a new insurance card, but when they tried to use it, they were told that the company had dropped their coverage. Hunter's mom, Krista, says that the people at the insurance company told her they lost Hunter's information when they were making changes because of Obamacare. Now, Hunter needs a new round of chemotherapy, which costs 50,000, but he doesn't have insurance to help pay for it. His family is very upset and worried. They are trying to fix the insurance problem, but so far, they haven't found a solution. In the meantime, Hunter's family set up a special fund called \\"Heroes for Hunter\\" to raise money for his medical bills. They've raised some money, but they still need more help to make sure Hunter can get the treatment he needs to fight his cancer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Sullivan  for the following movie plot:  In voiceover, Irish-American mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) explains that he doesn't want to be the product of his environment, he wants his environment to be a product of him. Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question. The shop owner doesn't show any emotion.A small boy, a young Colin Sullivan (Conor Donovan), is at the counter and witnesses Costello's interaction with the shop owner. Costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man Costello knows. He tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand. He tells the boy to remember he can get more money from Costello when he gets older.As Sullivan grows, Costello grooms him and steers him into a job as a police officer, where he can keep Costello informed. Sullivan completes the Police Academy and is immediately transferred to the State Police force. He is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit led by Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) which focuses on organized crime. The primary target of the unit is Costello. Sullivan (Matt Damon) is warmly welcomed onto the State Police force by Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg).Billy Costigan (DiCaprio), whose extended family has considerable ties to organized crime, also attends the police academy....

Patient A is in early adulthood, but patient B is in late adulthood. Mike needs to find the differences between the patients to come up with recommendations for them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which patient would have lower reflex time, patient A or patient B?  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63  when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to...

From some early studies, a safe dose of Garcinia appears to be up to 2800 mg per day. But, it's not known what may happen if you take these amounts, so you should stay well below that dose. Once you have found a good place to buy the supplement, you need to understand how much of the HCA you need to take. The dose of HCA should be about 1500 mg per day, though this varies from supplement to supplement. Make sure you follow the manufacturer’s instructions and you consult a knowledgeable healthcare professional before starting. Garcinia comes in two different forms. The first is a pill form, either in a tablet or capsule. If you buy the supplement as a pill, take the recommended dosage of garcinia as a tablet or capsule with water.  Take the pill about 30-60 minutes before each meal. In general, garcinia is taken three times a day. This means that each pill should be 500 mg. That way, you stay within your daily dosage suggestions. The second form that you can take of garcinia is liquid. The liquid form of garcinia usually recommends taking 1-2 drops before every meal, but the amount can vary based on the dropper or concentration. Take the drop or drops under your tongue and let them stay for a minute or so. Then, have your regular meal 30-60 minutes later. Before you take the liquid form, ask your pharmacist or a knowledgeable healthcare professional how much garcinia is in every drop for the particular kind you have. You should also ask how many drops would equal a total of about 1500 mg of garcinia every day. Once you have the total number of drops, divide that by three and take that amount before each meal. Summary:","output":"The information provided details the usage and dosage of Garcinia, a dietary supplement.  1. The safe dose of Garcinia is up to 2800 mg/day, but it's recommended to stay well below this amount. 2. The ideal dose of HCA, an active ingredient in Garcinia, should be about 1500 mg/day, which may vary depending on the supplement. 3. The supplement is available in two forms - pill (tablet/capsule) and liquid. 4. If you opt for the pill form, take the dosage as recommended by the manufacturer with water, about 30-60 minutes before each meal. The pill taken three times a day should each contain 500 mg to keep the daily dosage in check. 5. The liquid form should be taken by dropping 1-2 drops under the tongue and leaving them there for a minute before swallowing, about 30-60 minutes before each meal. 6. Additionally, consult with a pharmacist or healthcare professional to understand exactly how much Garcinia is in every drop of the liquid form and how many drops would suffice the 1500 mg/day requirement. After determining the total number of necessary drops per day, divide by three to take before each meal.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

Plot title: The 39 Steps Movie plot: At a London music hall theatre, Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) is watching a demonstration of the superlative powers of recall of \\"Mr. Memory\\" (Wylie Watson) when shots are fired.[1] In the ensuing panic, Hannay finds himself holding a seemingly frightened Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim), who talks him into taking her back to his flat. There, she tells him that she is a spy, being chased by assassins, and that she has uncovered a plot to steal vital British military information, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from one of his fingers. She mentions the \\"39 Steps\\", but does not explain its meaning. Later that night Smith, fatally stabbed, bursts into Hannay's bedroom and warns him to flee. He finds a map of the Scottish Highlands clutched in her hand, showing the area around Killin, with a house or farm named \\"Alt-na-Shellach\\" circled. He sneaks out of the watched flat disguised as a milkman and boards the Flying Scotsman express train to Scotland. He learns from a newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt for Smith's murderer. When he sees the police searching the train, he enters a compartment and kisses the sole occupant, Pamela (Madeleine Carroll), in a desperate attempt to escape detection. She frees herself from his unwanted embrace and alerts the policemen, who stop the train on the Forth Bridge. Hannay escapes, however. He walks toward Alt-na-Shellach, staying the night in the house of a poor crofter (John Laurie) and his much younger wife (Peggy Ashcroft). Early the next morning, she sees a police car approaching and warns Hannay. Hannay flees, wearing the crofter's coat. At a bridge, he finds a sign for Alt-na-Shellach. He arrives at the house of the seemingly respectable Professor Jordan (Godfrey Tearle) and is let in after saying he has been sent by Annabella Smith. The police arrive, but Jordan sends them away and listens to Hannay's story. Jordan then reveals that he is missing part of a finger; he shoots Hannay and leaves him for dead.

Write a summary based on this article: A filmmaker has gone into hiding after his movie attacking Islam's Prophet Muhammad sparked assaults on U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya, where an American State Department officer was killed.      Writer and director Sam Bacile spoke on the phone Tuesday from an unidentified location. He remained defiant, saying Islam is \\"a cancer\\" and he wanted his film to make a political statement.      The 56-year-old identifies himself as an Israeli Jew and says he believes his video will help his native land by exposing Islam's flaws to the world. Excerpts dubbed into Arabic were posted on YouTube.      Among other claims that have caused outrage, the film claims Muhammad was a philanderer who approved of child sexual abuse.      Bacile says he's sorry for the person who died, but blames lax embassy security. ||||| Read this story in Arabic.      Cairo (CNN) -- The United States said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt on Tuesday, killing an American.      In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, according to CNN producer Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who was on the scene.      In Libya, witnesses say members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi.      The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate, witnesses said.      A U.S. State Department officer was killed in the violence in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement late Tuesday.      \\"We are heartbroken by this terrible loss,\\" Clinton said. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack.\\"      Clinton said that she condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities \\"in the strongest terms\\" and that following Tuesday's events, the U.S. government was \\"working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide.\\"      Libya's General National Congress also condemned the attack, saying it \\"led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals.\\" Lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday night that they were investigating.      It was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated, CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend said Tuesday night.      \\"One such breach of an embassy or consulate's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news. ... The fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where Americans are remembering those that we lost, you have to ask yourself, what are American officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related?\\" she asked.      In Egypt, police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the U.S. Embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound.      The black flag, which hangs in full view from inside the complex, is adorned with white characters that read, \\"There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,\\" an emblem often used by Islamic radicals.      A volley of warning shots were fired, as a large crowd gathered around the compound, although it is not clear who fired the shots.      Are you there? Share your images and videos.      Egyptian groups point to U.S. websites, including YouTube, that have scenes from the film. Some anti-Muslim blogs also have flagged the movie.      In a series of disjointed scenes, the film depicts Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer.      The movie was made by Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real-estate developer, according to the Wall Street Journal.      Bacile -- who wrote, directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of Islam as a hateful religion, the Journal reported, citing a telephone interview with him.      Bacile, 52, told the newspaper that to make the film, he had raised 5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he made the two-hour movie over a three-month period last year in California, using about 60 actors and 45 crew members, the Journal reported.      Most of the Muslim world considers depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and deeply offensive.      \\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,\\" Clinton said. \\"The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\\"      But she stressed that \\"there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\\"      Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations which \\"may gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, or Egyptian government buildings such as the People's Assembly and Ministry of Interior.\\"      \\"It is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets, but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another,\\" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. \\"Large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and Garden City should be avoided this afternoon.\\"      Frenzied protesters could been seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans.      An embassy phone operator told CNN that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day ahead of the apparent threat, while Egyptian riot police and the army were called in.      \\"This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult,\\" said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. \\"But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control.\\"      The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday, pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy.      \\"There are police forces at the demonstrations,\\" El Naggary said. \\"They should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave.\\"      Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations Tuesday, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, who is president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel.      Mohamed al-Zawahiri -- the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri -- added, \\"We called for the peaceful protest joined by different Islamic factions including the Islamicc Jihad (and the) Hazem Abu Ismael movement.\\"      \\"We were surprised to see the big numbers show up, including the soccer Ultra fans,\\" he said. \\"I just want to say, how would the Americans feel if films insulting leading Christian figures like the pope or historical figures like Abraham Lincoln were produced?\\"      He added that \\"the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner, alluding to topics like sex, which is not acceptable.\\"      The U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that it had canceled visa services for Wednesday.      It also said in a statement that it \\"condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\\"      \\"Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy,\\" the statement said. \\"We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others.\\"      The embassy statement set off a political spat back in the United States after the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, criticized its message and linked it to his opponent for the White House.      \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,\\" Romney said in a statement released late Tuesday.      He said he was \\"outraged\\" by the attacks in Libya and Egypt.      The Obama campaign quickly responded to Romney's comments.      \\"We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack,\\" Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman said in an email.      Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.      This summer, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was sworn into power at Tahrir Square, the scene of the nation's revolution in 2011.      Though Tuesday's embassy protests are the first that Morsy has dealt with, Egypt recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the Israeli and Syrian embassies in unrelated episodes.      \\"These protests are a bad image for Egypt,\\" said a Cairo street vendor named Ahmed. \\"Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems.\\"      \\"All I want for Egypt is security and stability,\\" he said. \\"And as you can see this isn't it.\\"      The incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the United States in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead.      Tuesday's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an anti-Muslim Dutch lawmaker to portray Islam as a violent religion.      Geert Wilders' film \\"Fitna,\\" which he released online, featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.

In English, it translates to \\"naked sun.\\" Finnish is a Uralic language and it is one of the two official languages in Finland, the other being Swedish. It is also one of the official languages of the European Union. Finnish is spoken mainly in Finland, but there are also smaller Finnish-speaking communities in countries like Sweden, Norway, Estonia, and Russia. The language is known for its complex grammar, rich vocabulary, and unique phonetics. One of the most characteristic features of Finnish is the extensive use of vowel sounds and the absence of gendered pronouns. The language also relies heavily on cases to convey grammatical relationships between words, with 15 distinct cases in standard Finnish. Although Finnish is a Uralic language, it has also been influenced by various other languages throughout history. During the early stages of Finnish literature, the language was influenced by Finnish-Swedish bilingualism, which led to the adoption of Swedish loanwords and expressions. Later on, Finnish was also influenced by Russian during the period of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Learning Finnish may be challenging for those who don't have any prior experience with Uralic languages, but it can be a rewarding experience due to its unique sound, structure, and rich cultural background. Knowledge of Finnish enables one to explore the various literary works of famous Finnish authors like Mika Waltari and Tove Jansson, as well as to enjoy the original language of Finnish music and movies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cyprus will join the euro zone on 1 January 2008, government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides announced on Wednesday (2 November). Translate to Romanian","output":"Cipru se va alătura zonei euro la 1 ianuarie 2008, a anunțat miercuri (2 noiembrie) purtătorul de cuvânt al guvernului, Kypros Chrysostomides. Cipru, o țară insulară situată în partea estică a Mării Mediterane, este o republică prezidențială cu o economie în creștere. Admiterea în zona euro înseamnă că moneda națională, lira cipriotă, va fi înlocuită cu moneda euro și că țara va deveni membră a uniunii monetare europene, ceea ce îi va permite să beneficieze de avantajele aderării la această uniune. Aderarea Ciprului la Uniunea Europeană a avut loc în urma negocierilor care au început în 1990, iar în 2004, Cipru a devenit membru cu drepturi depline al UE. Ca parte a acestui proces, Cipru a trebuit să își restructureze economia și să îndeplinească alte criterii pe care comunitatea europeană le-a considerat necesare înainte de a deveni un membru al zonei euro. Pe măsură ce populația și economia Ciprului continuă să crească, aderarea la zona euro va avea consecințe pozitive pe termen lung pentru țară. Astfel, va fi consolidată stabilitatea financiară și se vor dezvolta relațiile comerciale cu celelalte țări membre ale Uniunii Europene. În ceea ce privește schimbul de monedă, banca centrală a Ciprului va converti stocurile de lire cipriote în euro. Acest schimb de valută va fi echivalentul ratei de schimb fixe oficiale de la intrarea în vigoare a zonei euro în toată țara. Oamenii vor putea să-și schimbe lirele cipriote în euro în băncile comerciale. Pentru a se asigura că aderarea la zona euro se desfășoară fără probleme, guvernul cipriot lucrează îndeaproape cu instituțiile europene și cu Banca Centrală Europeană. Aceste eforturi includ adoptarea unor măsuri pentru a se conforma cu legislația și reglementările europene, ajustarea politicii monetare și fiscale pentru a asigura stabilitatea economică și financiară, precum și promovarea creșterii economice, a ocupării forței de muncă și a întăririi instituțiilor financiare. În încheiere, aderarea Ciprului la zona euro reprezintă un pas important în dezvoltarea sa economică și în consolidarea poziției sale în cadrul comunității europene. Pe măsură ce se apropie data de 1 ianuarie 2008, autoritățile și cetățenii Ciprului se pregătesc să facă față noilor provocări și oportunităților care vor decurge din această schimbare semnificativă."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Article: Clothes can make phone calls, play music, dial your pal's number, keep you warm during cold weather and operate your computer? This is not a fantasy. A British company, called Electrotextiles, has created a wide range of clothes -- clothes that have minds of their own! Scientists, working for the company, have invented a kind of fabric that can be blended  with flexible electronic materials to create intelligent clothing. The result are electronic garments. If you think the wearer has to be wired to different devices, think again. These designer clothes are wire-free, soft to touch and washable!! Like any electronic device, these high-tech clothes have to be powered. Currently, a tiny nine-volt battery serves the purpose. But the researchers hope that in the near future the clothes will generate electricity by using body heat. These clothes are 100 percent shock proof, they say. The Electrotextiles team has also created the world's first cloth keyboard. This keyboard can be sewn into your trousers or skirt. To use this device, you will have to sit down and tap on your lap! These 'lap- tap' gadgets  are all set to take over laptop computers! Another useful garment is the shirt-cum-mobile phone. This handy invention enables drivers to chat comfortably with others at the wheel! Other popular electronic wear include the denim  jacket with flexible earphones sewn into the hood  and the electronic ski jacket with a built-in heater. The ski jacket is also programmed to send signals to a satellite. This technology is known as global positioning system and can be used to track lost skiers and wandering kids. Having completed the cloth keyboard, scientists have already started to work on a new project--a necktie that can be used as a computer mouse. What is the next? Do you have any idea? Question: .

Robert Owen (; 14 May 1771 - 17 November 1858) was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of utopian socialism and the cooperative movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities. In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became the New Lanark mill's manager in January 1800. Encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. David Dale and Richard Arkwright had established the substantial mill at New Lanark in 1785. With its water power provided by the falls of the River Clyde, the cotton-spinning operation became one of Britain's largest. About 2,000 individuals were associations with the mill; 500 of them were children who were brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dale, who was known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark's residents was unsatisfactory. Over the years, Dale and his son-in-law, Owen, worked to improve the factory workers' lives.  Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills.  Until a series of Truck Acts (1831-1887) required employees to be paid in common currency, many employers operated the truck system that paid workers in total or in part with tokens. The tokens had no monetary value outside the mill owner's \\"truck shop,\\" where the owners could supply shoddy goods and charge top prices. In contrast to other employers, Owen's store offered goods at prices slightly above their wholesale cost. He also passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to his workers, and placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. These principles became the basis for the cooperative shops in Britain, which continue in an altered form to trade today. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did Robert Owen feel about the residents behavior?","output":"Robert Owen felt that the behavior of the residents was unsatisfactory, as evidenced by this quote from the article: \\"Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He rose to prominence in the second half of the 1990s after making a string of major hits for artists such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. Some of his earlier hits include \\"...Baby One More Time\\" (1998) Sandberg was born in Stockholm and grew up in the suburb Stenhamra, Ekero Municipality.  As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden's public music-education program, and once said he had \\"public music education to thank for everything.\\" Other alumni of the program include Andreas Carlsson, Rami Yacoub, and Anders Bagge.  As a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a glam-style metal band called It's Alive in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It's Alive were formed by ex-LAZY members Per Aldeheim and Kim Bjorkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname \\"Martin White.\\" In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in Cyprus. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of Megarock Records offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the Metal Forces magazine.  The decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer Denniz PoP's label Cheiron Records, a BMG affiliate. After recording their second album Earthquake Visions, they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting Kingdom Come. Earthquake Visions eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new protege Max Martin and eventually became Martin's mentor.

Mrs. Aylward evidently knew it, but said nothing; Molly preferred a petition to be her waiting maid; Jumbo grinned as if over-powered with inward mirth; the old ladies in the pew looked more sour and haughty than ever to discourage \\"the artful minx,\\" and the little girls asked all manner of absurd and puzzling questions.  My Lady was still at Bath, and Aurelia supposed that the marriage would take place on her return; and that the Major and Betty would perhaps accompany her. The former was quite in his usual health again, and had himself written to give her his blessing as a good dutiful maiden, and declare that he hoped to be with her for her wedding, and to give himself to his honoured friend.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps.

Ralph Buehler teaches urban planning at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,popularly known as Virginia Tech.He has written a book about urban biking,called \\"City Cycling\\". He says there is a reason why urban bike tiding is now becoming more popular. \\"Over the last 60 to 70 years.cities in the U.S.have been adapted to the automobile.\\" \\"Most cities took advantage of the money coming for the interstate highway system,from the federal government,starting in 1956.There was a 90 percent federal match so the cities only had to put up 10%.It was very tempting.\\" In the years after World War Two,many Americans moved to suburban communities,just outside major cities,They decided to travel great distances to and from work in exchange for a home in the suburbs.Their cars became a symbol of freedom.  But today,many people believe they can save money by living in the city.  Greg Billing is with the Washington Area Bicyclist Association.\\"When a person makes a change from 04 using a car to using a bike,they are saving anywhere between 8 or9,000 a year.\\"  Ralph Buehler says governments save money when people use bicycles.\\"Building bicycling facilities is much cheaper than building and maintaining road facilities or public transport.\\" Washington,DC has also taken steps to protect bike riders.It approved a safe passing law and created areas on the road between cars and bikes.

In this sentence, \\"EMAS\\" refers to the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, which is a voluntary management and audit instrument developed by the European Commission for businesses and organizations to evaluate, report, and improve their environmental performance. The statement suggests that implementing EMAS should serve as an incentive for businesses and organizations to improve their environmental practices. The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme was introduced in 1993, and its main objective is to help organizations achieve a high level of environmental performance. This is done in a structured and methodical manner by providing a comprehensive framework that supports the integration of environmental management into the internal decision-making processes of the organization. One of the key aspects of EMAS is the commitment to continuous improvement. This means that participating organizations are expected to improve their environmental performance over time rather than just maintaining a certain level of performance. In order to do this, organizations must identify and evaluate their environmental impacts, set objectives and targets to minimize these impacts, and implement an environmental management plan. Another important element of EMAS is communication and transparency. Organizations that participate in EMAS are required to regularly report on their environmental performance and discuss the results with stakeholders, including employees, customers, and suppliers. This encourages the organization to be accountable for its environmental performance and fosters a relationship of trust with stakeholders. The incentive aspect of EMAS comes from several sources: 1. Improved environmental performance: Participating organizations demonstrate their commitment to the environment and can use this to differentiate themselves in the market. This can lead to increased competitiveness, greater attractiveness to investors, and even increased demand for their products or services. 2. Legal compliance: By adhering to EMAS, organizations can ensure that they comply with relevant environmental legislation and proactively identify potential risks or challenges. This can lead to improved relationships with regulatory authorities and reduce the likelihood of fines or penalties for non-compliance. 3. Cost savings: The implementation of an environmental management system can help organizations identify areas where they can reduce environmental impacts and costs. For example, by reducing energy consumption or waste generation, businesses can save money on utility bills and disposal fees. 4. Employee engagement: Studies show that employees who work for organizations with a demonstrated commitment to sustainability are more likely to be satisfied and engaged in their work. By striving for continuous improvement in environmental performance, organizations can create a positive work environment that attracts and retains top talent. 5. Reputation and public relations: Participation in EMAS can serve as a valuable marketing tool for organizations that want to showcase their environmental efforts and build a positive public image. By meeting the stringent requirements of the scheme, organizations can demonstrate that they are serious about their environmental responsibilities. In conclusion, the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for organizations to improve their environmental performance and communicate their efforts to interested parties. By participating in EMAS, organizations can reap both direct and indirect benefits, making it an attractive incentive for businesses to improve their environmental practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.  Two farms were testing new methods to increase production. Timber farm used AM fungi, while Pine farm used other conventional agricultural methods.  Which farm didn't provide more time for AM fungi growth into the spring?

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  Now, I have a new situation: David was studying human history. He selected two specific eras of human history, era A and era B. Era A was before humans had invented agriculture. And, era B was after the invention of agriculture. He noticed that human societies had changed dramatically after the invention of agriculture.  Answer this question please: Which era saw lower death rate, era A or era B? Answer:","output":"To answer the question on which era, A or B, saw lower death rates, we have to compare the factors that contributed to death rates in both eras.  Era A - Before the invention of agriculture: In this period, human societies were mostly nomadic, relying on hunting and gathering for sustenance. The population density was relatively low, primarily due to the need for extensive land to support their way of life. Consequently, there were fewer opportunities for infectious diseases to spread. With smaller communities and limited contact between groups, the risk of large-scale outbreaks was minimized. However, life was also challenging, as people had to constantly search for food and were more exposed to environmental dangers and predators. Additionally, individuals during this era had a shorter life expectancy due to the physically demanding nature of their daily tasks and the lack of advanced medicine. Era B - After the invention of agriculture: The development of agriculture revolutionized human societies, allowing people to settle in one place, thus fostering the establishment of villages and cities. While this resulted in a more stable food supply and increased birth rates, it also led to higher death rates. The reasons for the increase were related to the higher population densities in settlements, which created an environment where diseases could spread more easily. Additionally, the close proximity to domesticated animals facilitated the transmission of zoonotic diseases. While advancements in agriculture and technology provided more secure food sources and better living conditions, the more sedentary lifestyle and increased exposure to various diseases contributed to a higher mortality rate. In conclusion, era A, before the invention of agriculture, likely witnessed lower death rates when compared to era B, after the invention of agriculture. Although the quality of life in era A was more difficult and people lived shorter lives, the low population density and the lack of large-scale disease outbreaks contributed to a lower death rate. On the other hand, in era B, despite the advantages that agriculture brought, such as a more stable food supply and improved living conditions, higher population densities and the increased presence of diseases, especially those transmitted by domestic animals, resulted in higher death rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice.  Question: \\"How is the landscape in Southern Illinois different from that in central Illinois?\\" Answer: \\"Southern Illinois has mountains and Central Illinois is flat\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct but can be elaborated further. The landscape in Southern Illinois is characterized by rolling hills, while Central Illinois is predominantly flat with vast stretches of farmland. This difference in the topography of the two regions is mainly due to the geological events that occurred around 12,000 years ago, when a massive ice sheet, known as a glacier, covered much of the Midwest United States, including Springfield, Illinois. This glacier played a significant role in shaping the landscape features we see today in these regions. As the ice retreated over time, it left different landforms and deposits in the areas it once covered, creating the distinct landscapes found in Central and Southern Illinois."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

En procédant à l’examen des dossiers et à des entrevues, nous avons relevé plusieurs exemples de marchés réservés aux fournisseurs autochtones. Translate to English","output":"Upon reviewing documents and conducting interviews, we have identified several examples of markets designated exclusively for Indigenous suppliers. In this context, the term \\"marchés réservés\\" refers to designated opportunities or contracts specifically set aside for Indigenous suppliers. This practice aims to encourage economic development and participation of Indigenous businesses in various sectors. These markets can be found across different industries, such as construction, consulting, or services, among others. Such initiatives are often implemented by governments, organizations, or institutions that recognize the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in their procurement processes. These reserved markets facilitate the growth of Indigenous-owned businesses by providing them with unique opportunities to bid on contracts that they might not have access to otherwise. Identifying these markets begins with reviewing documents and conducting interviews, as mentioned in the French text. In order to locate these reserved markets, one must first analyze existing procurement policies and procedures within an organization or jurisdiction. This can include reviewing tender notices, procurement guidelines, and contract award criteria, as well as speaking to individuals responsible for implementing these policies. Additionally, it is essential to engage with relevant stakeholders, which may include representatives from Indigenous organizations, government officials, or procurement officers. Through these interactions, further insight can be gained on common practices, barriers, and successful initiatives that have been implemented to promote reserved markets for Indigenous suppliers. Once these markets have been identified, it is crucial for organizations and governments to continually evaluate and improve the effectiveness of these programs. One way to achieve this is by establishing performance indicators, such as the number of contracts awarded to Indigenous suppliers and an assessment of the economic impact of these initiatives on Indigenous communities. In conclusion, translating the French text, we can see that upon reviewing documents and conducting interviews, several examples of markets designated exclusively for Indigenous suppliers have been identified. These reserved markets aim to promote economic development and engagement of Indigenous businesses in various sectors, while advocating for diversity and inclusion in procurement processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death? ?  In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

This conclusion is based on several factors, such as Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and his partner Barbara Peache recalling that Heseltine had previously threatened to take his life by gas. Moreover, the outline of a new will was found among the papers in Heseltine's flat, suggesting some premeditation. Additionally, the suicide theory is arguably supported by the fact that Heseltine (also known as Warlock) had reportedly put his young cat outside the room before turning on the lethal gas. While Heseltine's son, Nigel Heseltine, introduced a theory that his father was murdered by Van Dieren, most commentators do not consider this theory to be tenable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Welcome to the world of multitasking -- a place where the measure of a person is how many jobs they can perform at the same time. In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do. And it's no coincidence that the kind of people who do think long-term don't multitask.\\" Options: A the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless B we mistakenly believe that we're doing better by switching between tasks C doing multitasking does harm to us in every area D for every task you add to your multitasking, you can finish your goal quicker Answer: B we mistakenly believe that we're doing better by switching between tasks Question: A:","output":"According to the article on multitasking, what is a common misconception people have about their performance while multitasking?

Summarize the following: A simple way to add a front panel to your shadow box is to connect a wooden picture frame that already has the glass connected to it. Choose a frame that fits the dimensions of your shadow box so it fits onto it evenly.  Remove any backing or other materials from the picture frame so that only the front wooden frame and the glass remains. You can buy new frames at craft supply stores and department stores. Look for old picture frames at thrift stores that you can upcycle for your project! Flip the picture frame over so the back is facing up. Use a power drill to attach a small hinge to the outermost edge of one of the sides of the frame near the top. Then, attach another small hinge to the outermost edge of the frame near the bottom so there are 2 hinges on the same side.  Make sure the hinges are aligned with each other and evenly spaced from the top and bottom edges of the frame. Use the small screws that come with the hinges. You can find small hinges at home improvement stores, department stores, and online. Lay the picture frame on your shadow box frame and align the hinges so they lay flat on the outer edge on the front. Use your drill to drive the screws into the shadow box frame so the hinges connect the picture frame to it.  Open and close the front panel to make sure it works and the edges are lined up evenly. You can also use a screwdriver if you don’t have access to a power drill. Use the same paint or stain that you used to paint the rest of the shadow box frame and apply a thin coat over the front panel. Allow the paint to dry completely and then add a second coat so none of the original paint or color is visible. Use as many coats as it takes to cover the panel without any of the original paint visible.","output":"To make a front panel for your shadow box, find a wooden picture frame with glass that matches the size of your shadow box.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: THE first night in Yosemite had been awful. I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \\"Things haven't worked out,\\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned  inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts   to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature. It's a good thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors. By Sasha Abramsky Question: Which of the following is TRUEaccording to the article? - The author seldom complains in the early morning. - The author walked all the way to the Lassen Peak Trail. - The view from the mountain impressed the author's daughter. - The author hiked to the top of the mountain to get a better view.

Context: That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here. You know if you took a group of fifty strangers, had them chat with your father for half an hour then with me for half an hour, then told them that one of us was an English Professor and one of us was head of distribution in the northeast for a large soft drink manufacturing concern, I'm pretty sure all fifty would peg your father as the English Professor and me as the head of distribution. He's honestly so good at what he does that I can almost allow him to claim it's magic except that it'd be nice if he took credit for some of the things he's done with his life.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How does Sam know the person who gets his head crushed by a statue? ?  Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

Once you’ve shown him that you’re interested or secured a date, give him a little bit of space. Let him get to know you slowly while sending out signals that you’e committed to allowing him in.  For example, don’t set up dates two days in a row or immediately invite him over to your place. Avoid asking him personal questions right off the bat. Let him open up to you in his own time. You’ll love how romantic and compassionate he’ll be! Plan a weekend trip to the coast, rent a kayak or try paddleboarding. Take a casual day-date to the beach during the summer. Cancer is a water sign and Cancer men love being near the sea. Although a Cancer man might be hesitant to invite you over when you’ve just started seeing each other, once he’s beginning to commit to you he’ll definitely want to show you his home. In fact, the perfect date for a Cancer man is a night spent at home together. Turn the lights down, curl up together under a blanket, and let him choose the movie.  Cancer men love and are proud of their homes. Compliment him on his place and show him that you love spending time there with him. A Cancer man will still love to go out and be social, but home is his place to recharge and relax. He’ll love that you want to spend time with him there. Cancer men are sensitive and don’t like to be in tense, fraught situations. Keep your temper under control when you’re together and avoid gossiping or critiquing others. For example, avoid snapping if a car cuts in front of you, or complaining about the service at a restaurant. Instead, take a deep breath and let it go. Your calm reaction to a small annoyance is a big plus to a Cancer man.

One day he wanted to buy a vase in a shop window that was much more expensive than he could offer. Not being able to make the shopkeeper cut down its price very much, he left without further talking. Collecting a half dozen of his friends, he explained his wish to them and they worked a plan. The first would enter the shop and make an offer, lower than the marked price. Not getting the vase at his price, he would walk out. Shortly after another would enter and ask for a price lower than the first. In this way, each of the others would offer a price lower than the one before, and the last of his friends made a great effort to attempt to get it at the lowest price. Before long Balzac himself would return, offer more than the last two or three persons made and trust to luck. The plan worked--- Balzac got the vase at his price!
