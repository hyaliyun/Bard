Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself.

James Alvin Palmer (born October 15, 1945) is a retired American right-handed pitcher who played all of his 19 years in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1965-67, 1969-84) and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990. Palmer was the winning pitcher in 186 games in the 1970s, the most wins in that decade by any MLB pitcher. He also won at least twenty games in each of eight seasons and received three Cy Young Awards and four Gold Gloves during the decade. His 268 career victories are currently an Orioles record. In 1991, Palmer attempted a comeback with the Orioles. Palmer said that he wanted to make sure that he had not retired too early. ESPN, which was trying to cut expenses, had asked him to take a pay cut and to sign a three-year contract. Palmer said he would sign a one-year contract for less pay, but ESPN refused. \\"I wouldn't be here today if the broadcasting climate had been more to my liking. That was really my prime motivation, the fact that I no longer had that obligation\\", Palmer said during spring training.  Covering Palmer's spring training workouts, Richard Hoffer of Sports Illustrated said that Palmer's comeback was not entirely about money. He wrote that \\"it is fair to suspect that a certain vanity is involved.\\" Hoffer said that Palmer \\"has failed to excite either ridicule or astonishment. He's in fabulous condition, no question. But no matter whom he lines up with on the row of practice mounds, there is more pop in the gloves of catchers other than his.\\"  While working out at the University of Miami during his comeback attempt, Palmer was approached by Miami assistant coach Lazaro Collazo. Collazo reportedly told him, \\"You'll never get into the Hall of Fame with those mechanics.\\" \\"I'm already in the Hall of Fame\\", Palmer replied. To help Palmer's pitching motion, Collazo and Palmer completed unusual drills that involved Palmer placing a knee or foot on a chair as he tossed the ball.  After giving up five hits and two runs in two innings of a spring training game, he retired permanently. Palmer said that he tore his hamstring while warming up for the game, commenting, \\"I'm not saying I wouldn't like to continue, but I can't\\", he said. \\"I heard something pop in my leg yesterday. It wasn't a nice sound. I don't know what that means, but I think it's going to play havoc with my tennis game.\\" He retired with a 268-152 win-loss record and a 2.86 ERA.

The film follows the story of Brockovich, a single mother struggling to make ends meet who stumbles upon a substantial legal case concerning a large utility company named Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). The company is accused of contaminating the water supply of the small town of Hinkley, California, with dangerous levels of chromium-6, which led to numerous health issues among the residents. Brockovich's tenacity and relentless pursuit of justice for the affected community resulted in a significant lawsuit against PG&E and ultimately, the largest direct action settlement in US history at that time – 333 million. Julia Roberts' portrayal of Erin Brockovish earned her widespread praise from critics and audiences alike. Her exceptional acting skills truly brought to life the diverse aspects of the character, from her determination and courage to her vulnerability and the challenges she faces as a single mother. This role was a milestone for Roberts' career and solidified her as a top-tier actress in Hollywood. In recognition of her stupendous performance, Julia Roberts was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the 73rd Annual Academy Awards held on March 25, 2001. This achievement was particularly significant, marking Roberts' first and only Academy Award win to date, despite having received multiple nominations in the past.

While lucrative, the implant has cost Johnny his childhood memories, and he seeks to have the implant removed to regain his memories back; his handler, Ralfi assigns him one more job that would cover the costs of the operation (which are extremely expensive), sending Johnny to Beijing to deliver the latest information. On the way to the job, in the elevator he uses a Pemex Memory Doubler to upgrade his memory capacity from 80 gigabytes to 160 gigabytes. At the designated place, he finds a group of frantic scientists watching anime who have the data he is to carry, but at 320 GB it far exceeds Johnny's storage capacity, even with the use of compression folders to decrease the size of the information, and if he tries to upload the data in, the remaining amount of data will be uploaded directly in his brain, causing severe psychological damage and potentially, death. Johnny accepts anyway, in need of the money. After uploading their data, the group is massacred by Yakuza, but Johnny manages to escape with a portion of the encryption password. After contacting Ralfi, Johnny returns to Newark and soon finds that two groups are after the data he carries. One is the international pharmacological company, Pharmakom, led by its United States executive, Takahashi, who believes the data to be critical to the company's interests. The other is the Yakuza guided by Shinji, who wishes to deny this information to Takahashi and claim it for themselves.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. When there is no oxygen to breathe in, the oxygen levels in the air decrease significantly. This directly affects the process of oxygen absorption and distribution throughout the body.  When the diaphragm contracts and the lungs expand, air is still pulled into the lungs; however, this air has a lower concentration of oxygen molecules. As a result, the membranes in the lungs collect fewer oxygen molecules to transfer to the red blood cells. Consequently, red blood cells have less oxygen to distribute throughout the body, leading to a reduced oxygen supply for various body tissues and organs. This perturbation, or disruption in the availability of oxygen, creates a \\"less effect\\" on the subsequent processes in the respiratory system.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

By 1938, experts generally expected Germany to attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks.

In Sentence 1, \\"From 1931 to the outbreak of the Second World War in Shanghai in 1939, he worked in Europe,\\" the focus is on the time frame, which is emphasized at the beginning of the sentence. It primarily highlights the duration of the person's work, starting in 1931, and lasting till the Second World War began in Shanghai in 1939.

Notice if their feet and knees are facing you.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Body Language: The Hidden Messages in Our Feet and Knees Introduction Have you ever been engaged in a conversation with someone and felt unsure of their interest level or true emotions? The key to deciphering these messages might be right at our feet--literally. Body language experts suggest that observing the movements and positions of a person's feet and knees can reveal vital information about their thoughts, feelings, and even intentions. In this article, we explore the importance of this often-overlooked aspect of nonverbal communication and how you can successfully tap into its hidden messages.  The Role of Feet and Knees in Body Language While facial expressions and arm movements tend to be the center of attention when discussing body language, our feet and knees can provide valuable insights into one's emotions and attitude as well. This is primarily because these parts of the body are typically less controlled and, therefore, can unintentionally reveal feelings that people are trying to hide consciously. In fact, the direction of one's toes, the positions of their legs, and the movement of their feet can offer clues to a person's true thoughts during a conversation. Decoding the Direction of Toes When you are interacting with someone, pay close attention to the direction their toes are pointing. If their toes are pointed towards you, this generally indicates interest and engagement in the conversation. In contrast, if their toes are pointed away from you or towards an exit, it may be a sign that they want to leave or remove themselves from the conversation. This subtle yet vital piece of information can help you gauge the level of interest in your discussion and determine if it is worth delving deeper or switching topics. The Restlessness of Feet and Legs Constantly moving or tapping feet can also convey important messages about a person's emotional state. Restless feet and legs signal discomfort, anxiety, or impatience. If you notice that the person you are talking to has restless legs or tapping feet, it might be a sign that they are looking for a way to escape the conversation or may be experiencing increased anxiety. This knowledge can help you adjust your approach accordingly, either by addressing their concerns or allowing them space to express their emotions. Reading Knees and Spatial Orientation Another crucial aspect of body language is the position of a person's knees concerning the person they are interacting with. If both their feet and knees are facing you, this often signifies openness and engagement in the conversation. However, if their knees are pointed away from you, it can indicate discomfort or an attempt to create distance. Observing these signals can provide an opportunity to assess how comfortable and receptive the other person is towards your dialogue, enabling you to adjust your approach as needed. Conclusion While facial expressions and gestures are undoubtedly vital components of body language, the movements and positions of our feet and knees can also give away subtle clues about a person's true thoughts and emotions. By paying attention to the direction of their toes, the restlessness of their legs, and the orientation of their knees, you can gain a better understanding of their mindset and adjust your approach accordingly. Remember, the language of feet and knees can speak volumes if you know how to listen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The African Space Research Programme founder has been helped by 600 volunteers. And once the African Skyhawk has had a successful test flight sometime next year, the 28-year-old plans to turn his hand to building the continent's first space shuttle. He firmly believes it will launch in the next 'four to six years'. But given the condition of his project at the moment, he might be advised to buy a gigantic rubber band to help it on its way. The former astronomy student said: 'It isn't about money, it isn't about competition or pride. 'The mission is about advancement in space technology as a continent and what we can contribute towards that growth. 'We are trying to have Africa participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind's destiny.' The cynical may question how NSamba can launch his own space programme without any money, and be entirely reliant on donations. Is he mad? Chris NSamba's mother, Sarah Lugwama, watches as the African Skyhawk is constructed in her backyard. The former astronomy student said: 'We are trying to have Africa participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind's destiny.' Chris Nsamba leans against the wing of the Skyhawk. He is confident the Skyhawk's test flight will take place next year, and he will have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in 'four to six years'. They may also ask how it can be achieved, seeing as Uganda has no history of space exploration and he is teaching the aspiring astronauts himself. But he said he was confident the Skyhawk's test flight would take place next year, and he would have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in 'four to six years'. He added: 'This is not a one-man mission. We work jointly to achieve goals. 'I have trained my crew (in) advanced astronomy. They are very good at astronomy in regards to calculations and identifications of various space objects.' And when asked how he plans to simulate zero gravity for training, he said it would be 'easy'. He added: 'I've got a jet engine on order so I'm planning to build a tunnel, put the engine at one end and when I throw a guy in he'll float in a similar way to how he would in space.' NSamba, who admits that 'one time or another every successful scientists has been called a madman' has been toiling away in his mother's backyard, in the Kampala suburb of Ntinda, for three years. But despite the challenges he faces, he said was confident his space shuttle, dubbed The Dynacraft, would be ready sooner rather than later. And he cited funding from foreigners, and the promise of cash from the Ugandan government, as markers to their ongoing success.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: YUXI, China -- Many people of this city in southwester China spent Saturday night in tents, too scared to sleep in their homes after an earthquake which killed 188 people early that morning. Countless homes were destroyed and lots of people became homeless after the earthquake which is believed to have a magnitude of 7. The quake was not as serious as the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in 2008 that left more than 70,000 people dead in the Wenchuan area. But villagers who work in Chengdu, about 100 miles away, hurried back home Sunday morning, many on foot, the lucky ones on motorbikes, to check on their homes. Song Yuanqing, 43, a worker, arrived back after a 22-hour trip and found his house was still there but had already been very unstable . \\"We would like to do something, but we can't do anything,\\" Mr. Song said as he sat with neighbors around an outdoor fire built by the village leader in his backyard. In all, the government sent about 7,000 soldiers and People's Armed Police officers to the earthquake-hit area. By Saturday evening, there were so many rescue workers in the area that the government asked volunteers to stop coming. Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, flew to the area and slept in a tent on Saturday evening in Lushan County. The earthquake shook Sichuan Province at 8 a.m., when people were getting up a little later than usual because schools and universities were closed. \\"We were just getting up and getting dressed in our dormitory when the building shook, and I looked outside from our window and saw a row of houses had collapsed,\\" Xu Yan, 22, a student at the Agricultural University in Ya'an, said in a telephone interview. \\" _ .\\" The Chinese government said early Sunday that the death toll was 174, and about 5,700 people had been injured. The earthquake was also felt in Chengdu, one of China's biggest cities and the capital of Sichuan Province. People described water getting out of home aquariums and things like balls falling to the floor. In the town of Longmen, another hard-hit area near Ya'an,... Question: When did the quake take place in Ya'an? On  _  . Options: A: Saturday morning B: Sunday morning C: Saturday night D: Sunday night The answer is:","output":"A: Saturday morning Step 1: Identify relevant information in the article. The article states that \\"an earthquake which killed 188 people early that morning\\" and that \\"the earthquake shook Sichuan Province at 8 a.m.\\" These two pieces of information are relevant to the question. Step 2: Match the information to the given options. From the information provided, \\"early that morning\\" and \\"8 a.m.\\" suggest that the earthquake happened during the morning.  Step 3: Determine the correct option. Both quotes refer to the morning, and since the only morning options are A: Saturday morning and B: Sunday morning, you can rule out C: Saturday night and D: Sunday night. The article clearly states that people spent Saturday night in tents because of the earthquake that happened earlier in the day. Therefore, the answer is A: Saturday morning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The actual dimensions of so-called Langstroth frames differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives have little in common with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920.  - Clostridium botulinum is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. The botulinum toxin can cause a severe flaccid paralytic disease in humans and other animals and is the most potent toxin known to mankind, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.32.1 ng/kg in humans.  - A honey super is a part of a commercial or other managed ( such as by a hobbyist ) beehive that is used to collect honey . The most common variety is the \`\` Illinois '' or \`\` medium '' super with a depth of 6 inches , in the length and width dimensions of a Langstroth hive . A honey super consists of a box in which 8 -- 10 frames are hung . Western honeybees collect nectar and store the processed nectar in honeycomb , which they build on the frames . When the honeycomb is full , the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 17 - 18 % moisture content before capping the comb with beeswax . Beekeepers will take the full honey supers and extract the honey . Periods when there is an abundant nectar source available and bees are quickly bringing back the nectar , are called a honey flow . During a honey flow , beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space . Honey supers are removed in the fall when the honey is extracted , and before the hive is winterized , but enough honey is left for the bees to consume during Winter .  - Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.  - A tablespoon is a large spoon used for eating or serving. In most English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving, however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating. By extension, the term is used as a measure of volume in cooking. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated \\"tbsp\\" or \\"T,\\" and occasionally referred to as a \\"tablespoonful\\" to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately 14.8 ml, a United Kingdom tablespoon is exactly 15 ml, and an Australian tablespoon is 20 ml. The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is not defined by law or custom and bears no particular relation to the measurement.  - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection....  - Beekeeping is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \\"bee yard\\".  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\". The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect many other animals. The word is from Latin, \\"botulus\\", meaning sausage. Early descriptions of botulism date from at least as far back as 1793 in Germany.  - Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. \\"Interaction\\" has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction.  - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery.  - A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an \\"open\\" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a \\"closed\\" wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin.  - Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be confused with \\"jumping plant lice\\" or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint they are a highly successful group of organisms.   - Honey is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \\"Apis\\") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism. People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs. Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Flora is the plant life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or indigenousnative plant life. The corresponding term for animal life is fauna. \\"Flora\\", \\"fauna\\" and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively referred to as biota. Sometimes bacteria and fungi are also referred to as flora, as in the terms gut flora or skin flora.  - A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee member of the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus \\"Apis\\" are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology.  - Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee.  - Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \\"fructose\\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.    What entity does 'honey super' has the relation 'field of work' with?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: This article: Muna Farah is a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at White Castle. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle. She maintains the facade through the help of an employee of the bank next door to White Castle and her blue-haired high school drop-out co-worker, Matt. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the husband of the Palestinian Christian woman's sister?, what is it ?

(Phil Bock/The Sheboygan Press via AP) (Associated Press)      NAPLES, Fla. (AP) — It takes about 22 hours to reach Florida by car for a person traveling from Wisconsin.      But if you're a cat, the 1,484-mile journey likely takes closer to two months. At least that's how long it took Nadia, the Russian blue, to trek from her home on a snowy December day to sunny Naples this week where animal officials helped find her owners.      The Naples Daily News (http://bit.ly/1TB3rJy) reports Cheri Stocker adopted the cat nine months ago in Wisconsin. On Christmas Eve, the cat escaped.      A Naples woman found the kitty in North Naples.      Workers at an animal shelter found the cat's microchip and, through a pet relocation service, got hold of Stocker's sister, who had been listed as an emergency contact.      ___      Information from: Naples (Fla.) Daily News, http://www.naplesnews.com ||||| Nadia waits in a cage at Collier County Domestic Animal Services to be reunited with her owner. The cat somehow travelled to Naples from Wisconsin where she was picked up and traced to her owners this week. (Submitted photo)      SHARE      By Kristine Gill of the Naples Daily News      It takes about 22 hours and five minutes to reach Naples, Florida by car for anyone traveling from Sheboygan, Wisconsin.      But if you're a cat, the 1,484-mile journey will probably take you closer to two months. At least that's how long it took Nadia, the Russian blue, to trek from her home on a snowy December day to sunny Naples this week where animal officials helped find her owners.      Her mode of transportation?      \\"I have no clue,\\" owner Cheri Stocker said by phone Wednesday.      Stocker and her husband adopted the cat about nine months ago and renamed her Nadia.      On Christmas Eve, she escaped from their home through a door that had been forced open with the wind.      \\"We looked and looked everywhere that we could but it was Christmas Eve and it was very windy — she could have been up in a tree hiding under a bush,\\" Stocker said.      Days passed and then weeks and the Stockers assumed Nadia had not survived the harsh winter.      \\"She doesn't have the coat for it,\\" Stocker said.      Then on Monday, Stocker's sister got a phone call.      A Naples woman found the gray cat in North Naples on Pebble Shores Drive and had a friend take her in to Collier County Domestic Animal Services.      Workers there found the cat's microchip and, through a pet relocation service, got a hold of Stocker's sister who had been listed as an emergency contact. Stocker couldn't believe it.      \\"I went to her house to listen to the message,\\" Stocker said.      Stocker isn't sure how Nadia could have wandered so far from home, but she has one idea.      \\"We do have a couple of businesses around within a few miles,\\" she said. \\"Maybe she got into a pallet and onto a semi.\\"      From there, news outlets wrote about the animal and volunteers came forward offering to transport the cat home.      \\"I cannot believe the outpouring of people that have called to help,\\" Stocker said.      Nadia was scheduled to arrive home Wednesday evening after two women volunteered to fly her back.      Until she gets to see her cat again, Stocker said she can only imagine what her pet has been through the past two months. What she does know is Nadia got to soak up some sun in Naples like she was on vacation.      \\"I didn't get to take one this year, but she did,\\" Stocker said. ||||| The journey home is almost over for Nadia the cat. She made it from Sheboygan to Naples, Florida when she went missing on Christmas Eve.      How she did it, no one knows. But her family traveled to Rockford, Illinois to anxiously wait their reunion.      Cheri Stocker, Nadia's owner, has gotten used to waiting and watching and worrying.      Nadia went missing Christmas Eve when she escaped out the back door of her Sheboygan home. The family spent weeks searching the neighborhood. Cheri had feared the worst , but still left out a bowl of food every day hoping Nadia would come back. Finally, a call she never expected: Nadia had been found, in Florida.      \\"It was unbelievable,\\" Cheri says.      But the next problem was - how to get her back?      Dozens of people offered to drive Nadia home. But an Allegiant Air worker had a better solution - a flight attendant that regularly flies in and out of the airport in Rockford, Illinois could bring Nadia home.      \\"How this was going to all fall together, amazing,\\" says Cheri, shaking her head.      Cheri and her husband left their house at 5:30 this morning ready to see Nadia again. As passenger after passenger got off the plane, Cheri got more anxious.      Finally she saw the cat carrier.      \\"Oh my god,\\" says Cheri.            With tears in her eyes she runs up and clutches it. She has Nadia again.      \\"I didn't think we would ever see her again so it's a miracle,\\" says Cheri.      After seeing Nadia, Cheri ran over to one of the many strangers, now friends, who made the reunion possible.      \\"It's just I can't, I can't say thank you enough,\\" Cheri says.            She says there were at least a half a dozen people who helped bring Nadia back home, each one asking nothing in return. She says she can never fully repay what has been done for her, so she plans to pay it forward in acts of kindness. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A Russian Blue cat named Nadia, after escaping from her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin on Christmas Eve, was found two months later and 1,484 miles away in Naples, Florida.

After weeks of searching and assuming Nadia hadn't survived the harsh winter, they received a call from an animal shelter in Naples.

Article:The 18-year-old, Harun Causevic, had been held on a preventative detention order but was released on Monday night and then re-arrested. He appeared in court on Tuesday, according to local media. He was one of five teenagers arrested over an alleged plot to carry out an attack during an Anzac memorial event. Two of the teenagers have since been released but two others were charged with conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts. Police said in a statement that one of them, Sevdet Besim, had been remanded in custody and would appear in court again on Friday. The other was an 18-year-old who was also charged on weapons offences. Meanwhile, it emerged on Monday that a 14-year-old boy from Blackburn in the UK has also been held over the alleged terror plot in Melbourne. Police said that he had been detained after officers searched some of his electronic devices and found messages to a man in Australia. The messages on devices linked to the boy led to the Melbourne raids, UK police have said. A team of UK officers have now arrived in Australia to help with the joint investigation. On Tuesday, the premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, said that a \\"sign of strength and unity\\" was needed in the wake of these incidents. He urged people to attend Anzac Day services later this week. \\"This is not about faith. This is an affront to faith. This sort of conduct has got nothing to do with religious observance at all,\\" Mr Andrews said, according to ABC News. Nearly 200 police officers took part in the Melbourne operation early on Saturday morning. Once of the five teenagers arrested has since complained of mistreatment during the raids. Some of the men's families have also accused the police of using excessive force. Acting Assistant Commissioner Tim Cartwright said that police were investigating the complaints. Police have said that the men were \\"associates\\" of Abdul Numan Haider, a teenager shot dead in September after he stabbed two officers. Anzac Day is an annual day of remembrance for servicemen and women from Australia and New Zealand. A series of events are planned this week to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli, Turkey. Australia raised its threat level to high last September and has since carried out a series of counter-terrorism raids.

The German titles of ', ' (\\"margrave\\"), and ' (\\"count palatine\\") are in the same class of ranks as ' (\\"duke\\") and above the rank of a ' (\\"count\\").  - Lotharingia from Latin \\"Lotharii regnum\\" was a medieval successor kingdom of the Carolingian Empire, comprising the present-day Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), Saarland (Germany), and Lorraine (France). It was named after King Lothair II who received this territory after the kingdom of Middle Francia of his father Lothair I was divided among his sons in 855.  - The House of Valois-Burgundy, or the Younger House of Burgundy, was a noble French family deriving from the royal House of Valois. It is distinct from the Capetian House of Burgundy, descendants of King Robert II of France, though both houses stem from the Capetian dynasty. They ruled the Duchy of Burgundy from 1363 to 1482 and later came to rule vast lands including Artois, Flanders, Luxembourg, Hainault, the county palatine of Burgundy (Franche-Comté), and other lands through marriage.  - The Duke of Brabant was formally the ruler of the Duchy of Brabant since 1183/1184. The title was created by the German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in favor of Henry I of the House of Reginar, son of Godfrey III of Leuven (who was Duke of Lower Lotharingia at that time). The Duchy of Brabant was a feudal elevation of the since 1085/1086 existing title of Landgrave of Brabant. This was an Imperial fief which was assigned to Count Henry III of Leuven shortly after the death of the preceding Count of Brabant, Count Palatine Herman II of Lotharingia (born 20 September 1085). Although the corresponding county was quite small (limited to the territory between the rivers Senne and Dender) its name was applied to the entire country under control of the Dukes from the 13th century on. In 1190, after the death of Godfrey III, Henry I also became Duke of Lotharingia. Formerly Lower Lotharingia, this title was now practically without territorial authority, but was borne by the later Dukes of Brabant as an honorific title.  - The House of Luxembourg was a late medieval European royal family, whose members between 1308 and 1437 ruled as King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperors as well as Kings of Bohemia (\\"eští králové, König von Böhmen\\") and Hungary. Their rule over the Holy Roman Empire was twice interrupted by the rival House of Wittelsbach.  - The House of Hesse is a European dynasty, directly descended from the House of Brabant, which ruled the region of Hesse, with one branch as prince electors until 1866, and another branch as grand dukes until 1918.  - The House of Reginar (later known as the House of Brabant) was a kin-group in Lotharingia during the Carolingian and Ottonian centuries. They were the first dynasty of the County of Hainault and they supplied two Dukes of Lorraine and the Landgraves and later Dukes of Brabant, Dukes of Lothier and Dukes of Limburg. The main branch extinguished in 1355, leaving its duchies to the House of Luxembourg which in turn left them to the House of Valois-Burgundy in 1383. A side branch is the House of Hesse which ruled Hesse from 1264 until 1918 and is still existing today.

News article: Holiday Sales Sag Despite Blitz of Deals Retail spending over Thanksgiving weekend dropped for the first time in at least seven years, the industry's main trade group said, as the blitz of deals and earlier opening hours apparently failed to pry more dollars out of the hands of budget-conscious shoppers. Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Macy's Inc. kicked off sales earlier on Thanksgiving Day, aggressively touted discounts all week and offered many of the same discounts online as in stores in an effort to keep ahead of rivals.

Retail spending decline: The article reports that retail spending over Thanksgiving weekend dropped for the first time in at least seven years. This decline comes as a surprise, given the various efforts made by retailers to attract consumers. 2. Efforts by retailers: The article states that several major retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Macy's Inc., initiated sales earlier on Thanksgiving Day, with heavy discounts offered throughout the week in an attempt to stay ahead in the competition. 3. Online sales and in-store discounts: To further entice customers, these retailers provide the same discounts for both online shopping and physical store visits. This approach aims to cater to a broader audience, allowing customers to choose their preferred mode of shopping while still taking advantage of the deals. 4.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million -- over three million including affiliates . Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements -- the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century -- the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher .  - Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles. According to historian Justo L. González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. But, according to documentation produced by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the sees (\\"cathedrae\\") play \\"an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\\".  - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\".  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.    What object entity has the relation of 'religion' with the subject 'international pentecostal holiness church'?

Texas home builder Dan Phillips transforms trash into artful treasures, creating beautiful floors with wood pieces, kitchen counters from ivory -colored bones and roofs out of license plates  . The fantastic houses which spring from his imagination are made almost entirely of materials which would otherwise have ended up in a garbage area. \\" People have been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years; using whatever is available to build shelter, \\" Phillips said.\\"If you think about carefully what could be used, then building materials are everywhere.

Movie plot: Cliff Spab (Stephen Dorff) and his friend Joe Dice (Jack Noseworthy) are two slackers who go out one evening to buy some beer in a Los Angeles convenience store. While there, a group of masked and heavily armed terrorists take Cliff, Joe, and three other people hostage. The terrorists, who call themselves S.P.L.T. Image, have a video camera, and they tape their hostages. During the month-long standoff with the police, S.P.L.T. Image's only demand is that their broadcasts be televised on worldwide television live and uncut, or else the hostages will be killed. After two of the hostages are killed, Cliff, Joe and another hostage, a young teenage girl named Wendy Pfister (Reese Witherspoon), are the only ones left. After 36 days, Cliff become indifferent to being killed, and he says repeatedly, \\"So fucking what?\\", in reply to his captors' threats to kill him. Because of the coverage, this makes Cliff a media icon.The movie skips forward, picking up in the hospital. Cliff, we learn, had shot his way to freedom, at the cost of a bullet in his shoulder, and more significantly, Joe's life. Despite Joe's death, Cliff is branded a hero for saving Wendy and killing all the terrorists. He's picked up from the hospital by his brother Scott (David Barry Gray) and taken home, where Cliff soon becomes uncomfortable.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.  Guess a valid title for it!

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What year was the school founded by the Bull brothers demolished? from the following article ?  Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  I am facing a new situation today: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake has warmer water the bottom? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided in the background article and the specific conditions of the two lakes, it can be concluded that Deep lake has warmer water at the bottom.  Here's a detailed explanation: In the case of Shallow lake, there is a mixing of saline water with fresh water. According to the background article, when fresh, cold water enters a warmer sea, the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, leading to a temperature rise as the diver descends. However, this situation does not guarantee that the water temperature at the bottom of Shallow lake will be warmer than at the surface, as the temperature change can be overridden by other factors, such as air temperature and sunlight warming the shallower water. At most, the fresh water mixing with saline water can create a thermocline, causing a notable temperature change while descending, but not necessarily a warmer bottom layer. On the other hand, Deep lake exhibits geothermal activity, which can significantly affect the water temperature at deeper levels. The article mentions that in lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water due to the heat coming from the Earth's interior. This geothermal heating often leads to convection currents as the heated bottom water rises and cooler surface water sinks, which can create a warmer temperature zone near the bottom of the lake. This phenomenon would also explain the higher rate of divers experiencing problems with thermoclines in Deep lake when compared to Shallow lake.  In conclusion, based on the described circumstances, it is more likely that Deep lake has warmer water at the bottom due to the presence of geothermal activity providing heat from below."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath.  I am facing a new situation today: John likes to ride on hot air balloon. Last month he rode on a balloon with his friend Keith. First they were at the ground-level. They called it camp A. Then they rose to the height of three miles. They called it camp B. Eventually, they reached six miles above ground. They called it camp C.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Where the air would be denser, camp A or camp B? Answer:","output":"The air would be denser at camp A, which is at the ground level. In the background article you read, it explained that air pressure and density decrease as altitude increases. This is because the Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), along with some other trace gases. As you go higher in altitude, there are fewer particles of these gases due to the force of gravity pulling them towards the Earth's surface. At camp A, which is at ground-level, the air pressure is higher resulting in a higher air density. When John and Keith ascended to camp B, which is three miles in altitude, the air pressure and density would have decreased due to their increased distance from the Earth's surface. This effect continues as they reach camp C, which is six miles above ground, where the pressure drops to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure. Since air density is directly related to air pressure, the decreasing pressure as altitude increases results in a less dense atmosphere. Therefore, when comparing camp A and camp B, the air would be denser at camp A due to its lower altitude and higher atmospheric pressure. This also correlates with the observation that it is harder to breathe in high-mountain areas, as there is less oxygen in a breath of air at those altitudes, which is a direct consequence of the lower air density."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"To address these questions, I will first define the concepts and then provide the requested information for each of them. Step 1: Define Surface Area Surface area is defined as the measurement of the total area that the surface of an object occupies. It is often used to understand the properties and behavior of an object that has contact with its surrounding environment, such as heat transfer or pressure. Step 2: Describe applications of surface area in real life Some real-life applications of surface area include: 1. Designing heat exchangers or radiators to maximize heat dissipation. 2. Calculating the paint or material necessary to cover a specific object or structure, like a building or a car. 3. Assessing the surface area of a cell, which can impact the cell's ability to absorb nutrients and eliminate waste products. 4. Determining the size and performance of air filters or water filters, as the surface area affects their efficiency in capturing particles or pollutants. 5. Understanding the performance of sports equipment, such as the interaction between a ball and a surface, which depends on their respective surface areas. Step 3: Define Lateral Surface Area The lateral surface area of an object refers specifically to the area of the object's sides, not including the top or bottom. Step 4: Explain how to determine the lateral surface area of a cube and a cuboid For both a cube and a cuboid, the lateral surface area can be determined as follows: Cube: A cube has six equal square faces, with four of them forming the lateral surface area. To find the lateral surface area, calculate the area of one square face and then multiply it by four. For example, if the side of the cube is 's', then the lateral surface area is 4s². Cuboid: A cuboid has six rectangular faces, with four of them forming the lateral surface area. To find the lateral surface area, you need to find the area of each of the four side faces and then add them together. For example, if the sides of the cuboid are 'l', 'w', and 'h', then the lateral surface area is 2lh + 2wh. Step 5: Assess if the two questions in the prompt have the same meaning: The two questions in the prompt do not have the same meaning.  The first question asks about the real-life applications of surface area, while the second one asks about determining the lateral surface area of cube and cuboid specifically. The first question is broader in scope than the second question because it covers the general concept of surface area, whereas the second question focuses on the lateral surface area calculation for specific geometric shapes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Die fortschreitende Vernichtung der Wälder, obwohl er ein entscheidendes Element unserer Ökosysteme ist, bringt die biologische Vielfalt weltweit ernsthaft in Gefahr. Ohne Biodiversität sind die Wälder und ihre Funktionen nicht aufrechterhaltbar, und die Folgen können unter Umständen katastrophal sein. Der Wald ist ein wichtiger Lebensraum für unzählige Tierarten sowie Pflanzen und Mikroorganismen, welche zusammen einen wesentlichen Teil der biologischen Vielfalt auf unserer Erde darstellen. Durch das Fällen von Bäumen und die Freilegung und Zerstörung der darunterliegenden Schichten des Waldbodens kommt es zu einem rapiden Verlust von Flora und Fauna, während die betroffenen Lebensgemeinschaften ihre besonderen ökologischen Merkmale und Funktionen verlieren. Diese Situation hat nicht nur schwerwiegende Auswirkungen auf die betroffenen Tier- und Pflanzenarten, sondern auch auf die menschliche Gesellschaft. Die Wälder sind von entscheidender Bedeutung für die Erhaltung von zahlreichen essenziellen Ökosystemdienstleistungen, wie zum Beispiel den Kohlenstoffkreislauf, Wasseraufbereitung und -speicherung, Bodenschutz und -erneuerung, sowie die Bereitstellung von Nahrung, Medizin und Rohstoffen. Eine nachhaltige Nutzung dieser Ressourcen ist nur möglich, wenn wir die biologische Vielfalt, die diese Funktionen untermauert, erhalten und schützen. Um die Zerstörung des Waldes und die damit verbundene Schädigung der Biodiversität effektiv bekämpfen zu können, müssen verschiedene Maßnahmen ergriffen werden. Hierzu zählen unter anderem: 1. Die Schaffung und der Schutz von widerstandsfähigen Schutzgebieten, welche über genügend Raum verfügen, um die Ökosysteme in ihrer natürlichen Dynamik und Diversität zu bewahren. 2. Die Förderung einer nachhaltigen Forstwirtschaft, die den Schutz und die Erhaltung der biologischen Vielfalt zum Ziel hat und sich dabei auf ökologisch angepasste Bewirtschaftungsmethoden stützt. 3. Die Umstellung von landwirtschaftlichen Monokulturen auf agroökologische Systeme, welche die biologische Vielfalt und die Interaktion der verschiedenen Ökosystemdienstleistungen fördern. 4. Die Sensibilisierung der Öffentlichkeit für das Thema Waldschutz und Biodiversität, um das Bewusstsein für die Problematik zu schärfen und gemeinsame Lösungsansätze zu entwickeln.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.  Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security.  \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\"  Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

Given the question: Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of E. coli bacteria   has brought new attention to food safety issues. One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick? Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways. Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants  like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines  of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick. The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers. Scientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team. MOON KIM: \\"We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample.\\" The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit. Moon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long. MOON KIM: \\"We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years.\\" The scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface. The high-tech scanner   _  .

Vaccines get stronger over time.;","output":"Doctors suggest that people get a flu vaccine each year primarily because of the reason 2). Viruses can mutate from year to year. Step-by-step justification: 1. Influenza (flu) viruses constantly evolve and undergo changes in their genetic makeup through a process called antigenic drift. This results in new strains of the virus emerging each year. 2. Due to these genetic changes, the immunity an individual acquired from previous flu infections or vaccinations may not protect them against the current year's strains. 3. Flu vaccines are developed each year by scientists, based on the anticipated circulating strains. They usually include protection against three or four different strains. 4. By getting a flu vaccine each year, individuals can help protect themselves and those around them against the predominant strains circulating during that particular flu season. This can reduce the number of cases, hospitalizations, and even deaths resulting from flu complications.

The process of announcing the election of a new Pope to the world involves several well-established steps and traditions, which are designed to create a sense of anticipation, reverence, and celebration. Firstly, the election of the new Pope takes place within the Sistine Chapel during a papal conclave, a secretive and highly-ritualized event. Only the cardinal electors (cardinals under the age of 80) are allowed to participate in the conclave. They are sequestered within the Vatican until they have chosen a new Pope by secret ballot. Throughout the conclave, all information is carefully guarded, and no form of communication with the outside world is allowed. The only visible indicator of whether a decision has been made comes from the burning of the ballots. After each vote, the ballots are burned in a special stove, creating smoke that rises out of a chimney visible to those gathered in St. Peter's Square and beyond. The color of the smoke signals the outcome of the vote; black smoke (\\"fumata nera\\" in Italian) signifies that a new Pope has not yet been elected, while white smoke (\\"fumata bianca\\") indicates a successful election. When the white smoke rises from the chimney, it is accompanied by the pealing of bells to amplify the joyful news. Following the fumata bianca, the actual announcement is carried out through a traditional proclamatory statement known as the \\"Habemus Papam,\\" or \\"We have a Pope.\\" The statement is made from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, in Vatican City. A senior cardinal, known as the cardinal protodeacon, emerges onto the balcony and presents the news to the world in Latin, beginning with the words \\"Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam,\\" which translates to \\"I announce to you a great joy; we have a Pope.\\" Next, the cardinal protodeacon reveals the name of the new Pope by sharing the birth name and the chosen Papal name of the elected cardinal. Following this announcement, the new Pope appears on the balcony, dressed in papal vestments, to greet the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square. He then imparts his first Apostolic Blessing \\"Urbi et Orbi\\" – to the city (of Rome) and to the world. In addition to these traditional methods of announcement, modern communications technology has also played a role in recent years. In 2013, when Pope Francis was elected, the Vatican used social media platforms such as Twitter to share the news almost instantaneously. Similarly, news organizations around the world now provide live broadcasts and online feeds, ensuring that the news of a new Pope reaches people all over the globe within minutes of the announcement. In summary, the election of a new Pope is announced through a combination of time-honored visual signals, such as the white smoke emanating from the Sistine Chapel; auditory cues, like the ringing of bells; traditional proclamations, including the \\"Habemus Papam\\" announcement; and modern technology, which allows for rapid global dissemination of the news."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While some theories suggest that these monumental structures were built as tombs for the ancient kings, others propose functional uses such as astronomical observatories, energy-generating power plants, or even landing pads for extraterrestrial visitors. One of the most unusual and debated theories about the purpose of the Egyptian pyramids was proposed by renowned neurosurgeon and politician, Dr. Ben Carson, who claimed that they served as grain storage facilities. In this article, we delve deeper into this surprising claim, reviewing its context and examining its credibility against historical and archaeological evidence. Background: Dr. Ben Carson gained national and international recognition as a presidential candidate in the 2016 US elections. Known for his exceptional career in the medical field as well as his fervent religious beliefs, Carson made headlines in 2015 when he reiterated a claim he had previously made in a 1998 video footage. According to him, the Egyptian pyramids were built to store grain rather than function as tombs for the pharaohs – an assertion he based on his understanding of the biblical story of Joseph. The Biblical Connection: During an address at Andrews University in 1998, Carson explained that he had derived his theory from the Bible and the story of Joseph. As stated in the Book of Genesis, Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, where he eventually gained a high position in the court of the Pharaoh. As the ruler's advisor, Joseph is said to have managed all grain production in the country, storing abundant supplies to counter a predicted famine. Carson surmised that the Egyptian pyramids were the structures built for storing these grains. He further added that the pyramids' solid construction and hermetically sealed chambers would have made them ideal storage facilities to prevent spoilage and keep the grains fresh for long periods. Criticism and Contradictory Evidence: Dr. Carson's claim was met with widespread skepticism and criticism from experts in the fields of Egyptology and archaeology. The primary source of incredulity lies in the fact that there is substantial historical and archaeological evidence to suggest that the pyramids were indeed constructed as tombs for the pharaohs. Firstly, the inscriptions found inside and around the pyramids, known as the Pyramid Texts, explicitly mention the eternal journey of the deceased pharaohs to the afterlife. These inscriptions served a crucial role in ancient Egyptian funerary tradition and rituals, which aimed to ensure the successful transition of the pharaoh's soul to the afterlife. Secondly, the elaborate funerary complexes surrounding the pyramids were built to accommodate the burial of high-ranking officials, the pharaoh's family members, and other important individuals. These complexes were far from mere storage facilities; they reflected the hierarchy and social structure of ancient Egypt. Moreover, the construction methods and materials used for building pyramids would not have been efficient for grain storage. The internal chambers of the pyramids are not numerous enough to hold significant amounts of grain, and their narrow corridors would not have been practical for transporting tons of grain in and out. Additionally, with the enormous labor force and resources required to build such monumental constructions, it is improbable that the ancient Egyptians would have opted to utilize these grand structures for the comparatively mundane purpose of grain storage. Conclusion: The claim made by Dr. Ben Carson that the Egyptian pyramids were built to store grain lacks support from historical and archaeological evidence.

When the branch sticks to the tree and is one with the tree, it can receive water and nutrients, and bears abundant fruits in its season. Say this using Spanish","output":"Cuando una rama se adhiere al árbol y es una sola entidad con él, puede recibir agua y nutrientes, y produce abundantes frutos en su temporada adecuada. Para entender con más profundidad lo que se intenta expresar con esta afirmación, es importante hablar sobre el proceso que ocurre en un árbol y la relación vital entre las ramas y su tronco principal. Un árbol es un sistema complejo, cuyas partes trabajan en conjunto para su crecimiento, supervivencia y reproducción. Las ramas son una extensión del tronco principal y actúan como los brazos de un árbol, proporcionando soporte para las hojas y llevando a cabo el proceso de la fotosíntesis. A su vez, las hojas recolectan la energía del sol y contribuyen a la producción de glucosa y oxígeno. Esto permite que el árbol genere energía para su propio crecimiento y mantenimiento de sus sistemas. La relación entre las ramas y el tronco es esencial para que se puedan suministrar de manera eficiente el agua y los nutrientes necesarios para su crecimiento. A través del tronco, el árbol bombea agua y minerales desde sus raíces y los distribuye a las ramas y las hojas. Este proceso es esencial para el aprovisionamiento de elementos vitales, como agua y nutrientes. El éxito en la producción de frutos en un árbol depende en gran medida de la conexión entre las ramas y el tronco principal. Un árbol fructificará en abundancia si las ramas están fuertemente unidas a él y reciben adecuadamente el agua y los nutrientes necesarios. Sin embargo, si las ramas están débiles o se rompen del tronco, no podrán recibir eficientemente el agua y los nutrientes, lo que provocará problemas y, en última instancia, una disminución en la producción de frutos. En conclusión, la relación entre las ramas y el tronco de un árbol es crucial para su supervivencia y producción de frutos. Cuando una rama se encuentra firmemente unida al árbol y trabaja en conjunto con él, puede recibir agua y nutrientes y llevar a cabo su función de manera óptima, lo que resulta en una producción abundante de frutos en su temporada adecuada."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: when do bank statements come in the mail?? Answer:","output":"The frequency of when bank statements come in the mail depends on the specific bank and the preferences set up by the account holder. However, most banks will typically send out statements monthly.  Steps:  1. Determine the timeframe most banks use to send statements - The majority of banks distribute statements on a monthly basis. 2. Consider the type of account - For some types of accounts like a checking or saving account, you usually get a statement every month. However, for some other types like investments, you might get a statement every quarter. 3. Keep in mind individual customer settings - Some banks allow customers to customize how often they receive statements, whether it's monthly, quarterly, etc. Some customers may also choose to go paperless and receive their statements electronically. So, in most cases, you can expect your bank statement to come in the mail every month.

(CNN)  -- From the Nintendo 3DS's ability to grab titles on demand to the increasing popularity of retail sites like Steam and Direct2Drive.com, downloadable games will be everywhere in 2011. The days when you had to visit your local store, buy a title and insert a disc into your console to play a game are long gone. Thanks to new episodic titles (\\"Back to the Future,\\" \\"Jurassic Park\\"), popular indie PC games (\\"Minecraft,\\" \\"Recettear\\") and a growing range of smartphone apps and console-exclusive downloads, digital game distribution continues to grow. Whether you're playing on your PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360 or mobile handset, here are five new and upcoming titles that exemplify the expanding breadth of what online game downloads have to offer. \\"X-Men Arcade\\" (PlayStation Network/Xbox Live Arcade) Revisit your misspent adolescence with a conversion of the popular side-scrolling 1992 arcade brawler starring Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and other comic book favorites -- before they became movie icons. High-definition multiplayer cartoon action for up to six players takes top billing, as you use fists, laser beams and super powers to bludgeon Magneto's crew of villains, including Juggernaut, Pyro and The Blob. \\"Gemini Rue\\" (Wadjet Eye Games) A sci-fi point-and-click adventure set in a dystopian future that's drawn comparison to genre classics like \\"Beneath a Steel Sky,\\" this retro-futuristic, film noir-flavored tale harkens back to PC gaming's early '90s heyday. It's available February 24, and anyone who owned an Amiga or IBM-compatible should appreciate its nostalgic pixel graphics and \\"Blade Runner\\"-style vibe. \\"Full House Poker\\" (Xbox Live Arcade)   Arriving on the heels of interactive game show \\"1 vs. 100\\" comes Microsoft's next multiplayer social gaming experiment, which makes online poker tournaments possible for up to 30 players. Texas Hold 'Em showdowns, staffed by avatars, can be played for virtual chips, with hidden surprises -- including new tables, decks and outfits to unlock -- and the ability to compete against professional players. \\"MotoHeroz\\" (WiiWare, RedLynx) Following upon the success of popular speedster \\"Trials HD,\\" developer RedLynx hopes to bridge the gap between side-scrolling platform hoppers and arcade racing with this candy-colored interactive rally for up to four players. Offbeat physics set the stage as you compete on more than 100 levels, with daily competitions, online leader boards and, oddly enough, single-player story options. These should provide a ready excuse to put pedal to the metal. \\"Bionic Commando Rearmed 2\\" (PlayStation Network/Xbox Live Arcade) This game picks up where the last downloadable mix of combat and grappling arm-powered action (and 1988 NES game) left off, adding a jump button, items to equip (love the grenade launcher!) and enhanced graphics. With puzzles to solve and bosses to battle, it should provide old-school fun for anyone who's ever dreamed of playing a disgruntled cyborg. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Amid rumors of Verizon beginning to carry Apple's iPhone4 in 2011, other analysts remained \\"comfortable\\" with the network operator's business. Verizon ( VZ - news - people ), the largest mobile network operator in the U.S. by market share, saw its outlook downgraded by Craig Moffett, analyst for Bernstein Research, who was concerned about \\"future near-term cash-flow pressure.\\" Setting the target price at 25, nearly 25% lower than the market price, Moffett expressed concern that after making cash distributions to Vodafone ( VOD - news - people ), its partner in Verizon Wireless, and paying dividends, the company would be left with \\"a razor-thin margin for error and sharply limited ability to commit to future dividend growth.\\" Moffett emphasizes that he is not predicting a dividend cut, rather they are \\"noting that the market is likely to demand a significantly higher dividend yield to reflect the intrinsic risk associated with a dividend payout ratio in the proximity of 100% of available cash flow.\\" Barclays Capital analyst James Ratcliffe had a different view. According to him, Verizon, with a 55% stake in Verizon Wireless, has access to cash when they need it. \\"I'm very comfortable with the Verizon dividend to shareholders, I would hold Verizon as its underlying business is healthy,\\" he says. And one of the biggies for Verizon is the possible inclusion of the iPhone4 to its network. Ratcliffe explains that they are sure Verizon will carry Apple ( AAPL - news - people )'s smartphone by the Q1 2011.

Jackson) promoting his two brands -- the \\"Booty Sweat\\" energy drink and \\"Bust-A-Nut\\" candy bar -- while performing his hit song, \\"I Love Tha' Pussy.\\" The first trailer shows action star Tugg Speedman's (Ben Stiller) latest film, Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, a film so much like its five predecessors that even the trailer narrator sounds shaky about it. In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2. The final trailer, for a film called Satan's Alley, features Australian \\"five-time Oscar winner\\" Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tobey Maguire (as himself) as two monks who begin an impassioned affair.We are taken, via the narration of John \\"Four Leaf\\" Tayback (Nick Nolte), into a gruesome battle of the Vietnam War. This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir. Starring as the central platoon are Speedman, Lazarus, Chino and Portnoy, as well as young character actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). To play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris, an African American, Lazarus has dyed his skin dark and refuses to break character. (\\"I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.\\") A take of Osiris crying over Tayback's (Speedman's) blown-off hands is ruined when Speedman is unable to cry and Lazarus dribbles uncontrollably into Speedman's face. The ruined take causes great frustration for the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). The chaos is exacerbated when the film's pyrotechnics expert, Cody (Danny McBride), mistakes Cockburn's conniptions for a signal to set off several expensive explosions.Faux Access Hollywood clips reveal that Speedman's career has been on a downward spiral.

Write an article based on this \\"Lick the inside of your wrist. Smell the inside of your wrist where the saliva has dried. Try swabbing the back of your tongue.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Your Body: The Wrist Lick Test and Back of Tongue Swab Introduction Our body is an amazing and complex system – containing several mechanisms that often go unnoticed. Gaining insights into these bodily functions can provide a deeper understanding of our overall health and well-being. One such lesser-known test to gauge a hidden aspect of your health is the \\"wrist lick test\\" coupled with swabbing the back of your tongue. This simple self-assessment can reveal some interesting information about your personal hygiene. The Wrist Lick Test Step-by-step, here’s how to perform this easy test: 1. Lick the inside of your wrist: Use your own saliva to moisten a small area on the inside of your wrist. This part of your arm is commonly used for self-assessment because it is easily accessible and has a uniform skin surface that prevents interference from sweat or other chemicals. 2. Allow the saliva to dry: Give the saliva a few seconds to dry and evaporate. As saliva mostly consists of water, this step is essential to provide accurate results. In the process of evaporation, volatile compounds present in the saliva are better detected since they dissipate less in air than in a liquid medium. 3. Smell the inside of your wrist: After the saliva has dried, bring your wrist close to your nose and take a whiff. By doing this, you will be able to get a clear idea of how your breath smells. Often, bad breath can go unnoticed, as our nose tends to filter out our own odors. This can result in an unawareness of potential bad breath that others around us may notice. Swabbing the Back of Your Tongue While the wrist lick test helps you understand the smell of your breath, swabbing the back of your tongue provides valuable information on the state of your oral hygiene. To perform a tongue swab: 1. Use a clean finger, spoon, or tongue scraper: Before performing this step, ensure your hands and utensils are clean to prevent introducing any external germs or bacteria into your mouth. 2. Gently swab the back of your tongue: Using your chosen tool, carefully swab the back of your tongue – where most odor-causing bacteria reside. By swabbing the back of your tongue, you can get a glimpse of the current state of your oral hygiene. If there is a white, gray, or yellow coating, this could indicate poor oral hygiene and the presence of bacteria. 3. Evaluate and maintain good oral hygiene: If you notice a strong smell from your tongue swab or wrist lick test, consider re-evaluating your oral health routine. Implementing practices such as regular brushing, flossing, and tongue scraping – coupled with frequent dentist visits – can help maintain optimal oral health. Conclusion The wrist lick test and back of the tongue swab are simple yet effective methods of self-assessing your personal hygiene. By regularly performing these tests, you can actively monitor your oral health and take measures to enhance your overall well-being. Don't be surprised by issues such as bad breath or poor oral health.

Writing out each step when solving a problem is also a way to help you understand each part of the process required. Writing out steps is a good habit to pick up and maintain. Also, when you’re doing practice problems or taking notes, write out each step. You’ll be glad you did when it comes time for applying steps on the test! Give problem sets careful attention, and do more for practice, if you need it. Even when you’ve found the solution to a math problem, you may not be finished. Take the solution and plug it back into the original problem to see if it’s the correct answer. Word problems are applied math, where you’re given a situation and have to find the right way to solve an associated problem. Since you have to both understand the situation and the necessary math concepts, this type of problem can be especially tricky.  Read through the entire problem before you begin to solve it. Make sure you understand the situation and what math techniques you’ll need to use. Some problems may have associated graphs, charts, or tables. Make sure to read those carefully, too. Select the numbers you’ll need to use to solve the problem. Keep in mind that some word problems might have unneeded details designed to make you use your understanding of what you need to solve it. After you’ve solved the problem, make sure to check your work steps and see whether your answer makes sense in its size and is in the correct units, etc. Your teacher assigns a certain number of problems for homework, but if you don’t feel like you fully understand, you might need to study more problems. Look for extra practice sets in your textbook or online, and try some of those until you feel more confident.  Often times, the answers to all the odd-numbered problems are in the back of the book.

As a result, the Alpha Chi Omega sorority has lost its status and faced expulsion from the campus until May 2020 at the earliest, according to the Morning Call. The sorority has been found responsible for hazing and other offenses associated with the December's \\"Road Rally\\" scavenger hunt. Controversial Scavenger Hunt: The scavenger hunt, which the university has termed \\"reprehensible,\\" involved the use of drugs and alcohol, sexual activity, and a range of other activities in violation of Lehigh University policy. The university has stated that although these actions were not explicitly required for affiliation with the sorority, they were still considered a rite of passage and a consistent part of the sorority membership. In a blog post, Lehigh University denounces the event and its impact on the campus and community, saying, \\"This incident was a significant, reprehensible event that the entire chapter was aware of and leadership endorsed.\\" The post goes on to accuse the sorority's leadership of creating a situation in which morally questionable quests occurred both on and off campus. Consequences of the Scandal: As a direct result of the charges, Alpha Chi Omega will be ordered to vacate its sorority house. Lehigh Valley Live reports that by the time the sorority can resume operations on campus, all the current members will have graduated. This will effectively sever the tie between the current members and the tradition of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority at Lehigh University. Appeal Options: Alpha Chi Omega has cooperated with the investigation by submitting scavenger hunt lists. The university has acknowledged the sorority's cooperation and will allow Alpha Chi Omega to appeal the decision. Conclusion: Lehigh University's decision to hold Alpha Chi Omega responsible for hazing and other offenses creates a powerful message on the importance of maintaining the integrity of campus life.

Article:The distinctive patterned blue and grey number is seen in a picture of Guzman shaking hands with US actor Sean Penn in Rolling Stone magazine. Penn interviewed fugitive Guzman in October. He was recaptured on Friday. The company behind the shirt, Barabas, quickly advertised the \\"celebrity link\\" on its website. However, it said it did not know how Guzman had got hold of one of its shirts Barabas published the now famous picture of the meeting between Sean Penn and Guzman, who at the time that the image was taken, was on the run from the Mexican authorities after escaping from a maximum-security jail. With the words \\"Most Wanted Shirt\\" emblazoned across it, Barabas posted the photograph next to an image of one of its models sporting the same shirt. On its Facebook page, the company also offered customers the chance to win \\"our Barabas 'El Chapo' shirts\\" if they liked Barabas on Facebook or Instagram. Barabas also posted a screenshot of a video showing Guzman wearing a silk paisley shirt, which the company says is one of its \\"Crazy Paisley\\" models. Both shirts sell for 128 (Â£89). The images first appeared in the Rolling Stone article last Saturday. In the article, Penn recounts how he interviewed the fugitive cartel leader in a remote undisclosed location in Mexico. Penn came in for scathing criticism over the interview both in Mexico and the US, with Republican Marco Rubio calling it \\"grotesque\\". But a Barabas representative said the shirt maker was benefitting from increased sales. \\"This is the shirt! It's the sensation of the moment, the phones haven't stopped ringing and we're making lots of sales and shipping many shirts, and we're expecting more to come,\\" Barabas's Sandra Macia told news agency Efe. Juventino Romero told Efe he had driven for 20 hours to buy the shirts at Los Angeles-based Barabas to resell them at his clothes shop in Washington state. \\"I came for the new shirt that 'El Chapo' was wearing in the interview, people are asking for it,\\" he said. Despite his reputation for being a ruthless cartel leader, whose men have killed thousands of people, \\"El Chapo\\" is seen by some as a folk hero. After his jail break in July, shirts and baseball caps emblazoned with his name became popular and \\"El Chapo\\" masks became a bestseller at Halloween in Mexico.

This happened during an interview conducted by Penn in October, while Guzman was a fugitive.  The shirt was manufactured by a company named Barabas, which seized the opportunity to advertise this unexpected celebrity association after the picture was published in Rolling Stone magazine. Barabas, however, acknowledged that they could not explain how Guzman came to possess their shirt. Caught in the media spotlight, the company also used the photo showing Guzman and Penn on their website, boldly labeled it as the \\"Most Wanted Shirt,\\" and displayed it alongside an image of a model wearing the same shirt. They also presented an offer to customers through Facebook for a chance to win their \\"El Chapo\\" shirts.  Another image revealed Guzman wearing a silk paisley shirt from Barabas' \\"Crazy Paisley\\" product collection during a video, which was also shared by the company. Both these shirts were priced at 128 (£89). The article also touched upon the controversial interview by Sean Penn, resulting in harsh criticism in Mexico and the U.S., with Republican Marco Rubio calling it \\"grotesque.\\" Regardless, the circumstances served as a promotional success story for Barabas, which reported an increase in sales and continuous demands. One customer who owns a clothing store in Washington state even traveled for 20 hours to Los Angeles to buy the shirts, intending to resell them due to high demand. Despite \\"El Chapo's\\" infamous reputation as a ruthless cartel leader, he surprisingly enjoys a folk hero status amongst some, as merchandise, including shirts and baseball caps adorned with his name, as well as Halloween masks, became popular after his jail escape in July.

What is the title of this article: LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). Also, the tape was thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.","output":"Title: \\"LaserDiscs: The Superior Lifespan and Durability Compared to Videocassettes\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose belief is shared that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his command?  In 1949, former U.S. Army Air Forces officer Harvey Stovall spots a familiar Toby Jug in the window of a London antique shop and learns that it came from Archbury, an airfield where Stovall served during World War II. Convinced that it is the same jug, he buys it and journeys to the derelict airfield.  Stovall remembers the events of 1942, when the 918th Bomb Group at Archbury had gained a reputation as the 'hard luck group'. After a particularly disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads to other senior leaders of the group, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day, at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command. Later, Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. Pritchard realizes that Savage is right: Davenport has become over-protective and is unwilling to discipline his men even for costly mistakes. Davenport is relieved of command and Savage is asked to take over.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. A reflection paper is somewhat personal in that it includes your subjective feelings and opinions. Instead of revealing everything about yourself, carefully ask yourself if something is appropriate before including it in your paper.  If you feel uncomfortable about a personal issue that affects the conclusions you reached, it is wisest not to include personal details about it. If a certain issue is unavoidable but you feel uncomfortable revealing your personal experiences or feelings regarding it, write about the issue in more general terms. Identify the issue itself and indicate concerns you have professionally or academically. A reflection paper is personal and objective, but you should still keep your thoughts organized and sensible.  Avoid dragging someone else down in your writing. If a particular person made the experience you are reflecting on difficult, unpleasant, or uncomfortable, you must still maintain a level of detachment as you describe that person's influence. Instead of stating something like, “Bob was such a rude jerk,” say something more along the lines of, “One man was abrupt and spoke harshly, making me feel as though I was not welcome there.” Describe the actions, not the person, and frame those actions within the context of how they influenced your conclusions. A reflection paper is one of the few pieces of academic writing in which you can get away with using the first person pronoun “I.” That said, you should still relate your subjective feelings and opinions using specific evidence to explain them.  Avoid slang and always use correct spelling and grammar. Internet abbreviations like “LOL” or “OMG” are fine to use personally among friends and family, but this is still an academic paper, so you need to treat it with the grammatical respect it deserves. Do not treat it as a personal journal entry. Check and double-check your spelling and grammar after you finish your paper. A clear, well-written paper must have clear, well-written sentences.  Keep your sentences focused. Avoid squeezing multiple ideas into one sentence. Avoid sentence fragments. Make sure that each sentence has a subject and a verb. Vary your sentence length. Include both simple sentences with a single subject and verb and complex sentences with multiple clauses. Doing so makes your paper sound more conversational and natural, and prevents the writing from becoming too wooden. Transitional phrases shift the argument and introduce specific details. They also allow you to illustrate how one experience or detail directly links to a conclusion or understanding. Common transitional phrases include \\"for example,\\" \\"for instance,\\" \\"as a result,\\" \\"an opposite view is,\\" and \\"a different perspective is.\\" You can incorporate information you learned in the classroom with information addressed by the reading, lecture, or experience.  For instance, if reflecting on a piece of literary criticism, you could mention how your beliefs and ideas about the literary theory addressed in the article relate to what your instructor taught you about it or how it applies to prose and poetry read in class. As another example, if reflecting on a new social experience for a sociology class, you could relate that experience to specific ideas or social patterns discussed in class.

Where might customers go to walk around? - mall - park - market - found in restaurant - bookstore  The best answer is","output":"Customers might choose various locations to walk around depending on their preferences, mood, and needs at a particular moment. A detailed look at each option and the reasons customers might prefer them is provided below: 1. Mall: The mall is a popular choice for customers who want to enjoy the comfort of a controlled indoor environment while having access to numerous shopping, dining, and entertainment options. As a one-stop destination, customers find it easy to spend hours walking around, exploring different brand outlets, catching up with friends, or enjoying a meal at the food court. Malls also usually offer a wide range of options to choose from, making them suitable for people with diverse tastes and interests. 2. Park: Customers who prefer spending time in nature or enjoying the outdoors might head out to a park for a walk. Parks generally provide a peaceful and relaxing environment, with greenery around, providing an escape from the busy city life. Walking in a park can also prove beneficial for health and fitness enthusiasts, as it offers an opportunity to exercise in a pleasant environment and get some fresh air. An added advantage is that parks usually have play areas and open spaces where families can spend time together. 3. Market: Sometimes, customers prefer to walk around a bustling marketplace to immerse themselves in the local culture and enjoy the energy of their surroundings. The market offers an excellent opportunity to shop for fresh produce, experience street food, or maybe even hunt for unique items or souvenirs. The vibrant atmosphere in markets typically allows customers to engage in casual conversations with vendors, which might lead to discovering new products or learning more about the area's history and traditions. 4. Found inRestaurant: While this might be an unusual choice, some restaurants or clusters of eateries might offer customers a pleasant area to stroll around. Dining complexes, for example, could have landscaped walkways, patios, or courtyards that allow customers to leisurely walk around before or after their meal. This option might best suit those who enjoy exploring culinary options while also getting some fresh air and taking in the ambiance of an establishment. 5. Bookstore: Bookstores are another appealing option for customers who love literature, art, and culture. They might choose a bookstore to walk around and explore their favorite authors, wander through sections that pique their curiosity or stumble upon new reads. Many bookstores nowadays also offer places to sit, read, or even have a cup of coffee, making the experience even more enjoyable. This option is particularly attractive during cold or rainy days when customers might want to stay indoors but continue to engage in a leisurely activity. In conclusion, the best answer ultimately depends on the customer's preferences and circumstances. Those who favor shopping and convenience might choose a mall, while customers who enjoy nature walks and fresh air could opt for a park or market. Moreover, individuals interested in literature, art, and culture might find bookstores most appealing, whereas food enthusiasts might want to explore dining complexes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Abstract: The prognostic value associated with the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastatic breast cancer by the CellSearch technology raise additional issues regarding the biological value of this information. We postulated that a drug-resistance profile of CTCs may predict response to chemotherapy in cancer patients and therefore could be used for patient selection. One hundred 5 patients with diagnosis of carcinoma were enrolled in a prospective trial. CTCs were isolated from peripheral blood, and positive samples were evaluated for the expression of a panel of genes involved in anticancer drugs resistance. The drug-resistance profile was correlated with disease-free survival (DFS; patients in adjuvant setting) and time to progression (TTP; metastatic patients) in a 24-months follow-up. Objective response correlation was a secondary end point. Fifty-one percent of patients were found positive for CTCs while all blood samples from healthy donors were negative. The drug-resistance profile correlates with DFS and TTP (p < 0.001 in both). Sensitivity of the test: able to predict treatment response in 98% of patients. Specificity of the test: 100%; no sample from healthy subject was positive for the presence of CTCs. Positive and negative predictive values were found to be 96.5 and 100%, respectively. We identified a drug-resistance profile of CTCs, which is predictive of response to chemotherapy, independent of tumor type and stage of disease. This approach may represent a first step toward the individualization of chemotherapy in cancer patients..

Given the following context:  By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and...  answer the following question:  Whose palace was El Greco obliged to leave?

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Home from the Civil War, where he fought for the Union army, John Willoughby now lives in the western town of Kittreck Wells with wife Nora and their 7-year-old son, Petey. An appeal for help from Marshal Russell comes when a band of former Confederate soldiers are seen pulling a robbery in a neighboring town. John, who hates all rebels, agrees to go, against his wife's wishes that all his fighting must end. Meanwhile, the Rebels, Bedloe Mason and his sons Gray, Wesley, Cain and Frank, decide to ride into Kittreck Wells to replenish their dwindling water supply. Bedloe sends Gray, Frank and Wesley into town while he and Cain await their return. Petey Willoughby, who shares his father's dislike of rebels, aims and fires a cap pistol at them. Startled by the sound, Wesley Mason shoots and kills the boy. As the brothers mount their horses and gallop out of town, Gray, not having been witnessing the shooting, hesitates, then catches up to the others.  When they reach Bedloe and Cain, Gray, angered by his brother's recklessness, appeals to his father and brothers that Wesley has to go back to face the consequences. Wesley is dead-set against this and the others take his side. Gray rides off alone to learn the fate of the boy, but Wesley ambushes his brother by throwing a knife into his back. After strapping his brother's unconscious body onto his horse, Wesley sets the animal loose. He then returns to camp and reports that Gray refused to listen to reason, but will meet the family at Oak Fork in three days.

He began working as a session pianist with singer Ethel Waters, who sang his first recorded song as a writer, \\"You Can't Do What My Last Man Did\\" in 1923. He then diversified into songwriting, working with lyricists including Henry Creamer and Andy Razaf. Waters recorded several more J.C. Johnson songs and collaborations, including the first version of \\"Trav'lin All Alone\\", subsequently recorded by dozens of artists including Billie Holiday and Billy Eckstine. By 1928 he had begun working with Fats Waller, often contributing lyrics to Waller's music. His first song with Waller was \\"I'm \\"Goin Huntin\\", written in 1927 and recorded by Louie Armstrong, and together they wrote a Broadway show, Keep Shufflin'. (The preceding information is wrong. It was James P. Johnson who co-wrote \\"Keep Shufflin\\" with Fats Waller. See: James P. and J.C. were often confused for each other, and were friends via Fats Waller. The above illustrates how James P. and J.C. continue to be confused with each other.)About this time, he also reportedly used the pseudonym Harry Burke, who was originally credited as the writer of the song \\"Me and My Gin\\", recorded in 1928 by Bessie Smith and later recorded by many artists under the title \\"Gin House Blues\\" (with the composition later often credited, apparently in error, to Fletcher Henderson). In 1929, he took part as a musician in a collaboration between Italian-American guitarist Eddie Lang and the blues guitarist Lonnie Johnson, together with King Oliver and Hoagy Carmichael, which was given the name \\"Blind Willie Dunn & His Gin Bottle Four\\" in order to disguise the inter-racial nature of the group. Among the many artists in the 20s and 30s who sang and recorded his tunes were Ella Fitzgerald, whose first three recorded songs were co-written by Johnson, Connie Boswell, Mamie Smith, Clarence Williams, and Lonnie Johnson. J.C. also had his own band, J.C. Johnson and his Five Hot Sparks and played piano on many other artists' recordings. A:","output":"a"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) objected to the language that said \\"the attacks on September 11, 2001, that led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . . .\\" Sanders wrote: \\"When President Bush and Vice President Cheney misled our nation into the war in Iraq, they certainly cited the attacks on September 11, along with the equally specious claim that Iraq possessed vast arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. The notion, however, that 9/11 and Iraq were linked, or that one 'led to' the other, has been widely and authoritatively debunked.\\" Soon after Sept. 11, the Bush administration did suggest there was a link between Iraq and the attacks. Later, the 9/11 commission reported that there was no evidence of a collaborative relationship between al-Qaeda and Iraq. That view was supported by the FBI and Bush later concurred. Martin E. Sullivan, the gallery's director, thought the request was reasonable and ordered that the caption be amended. The new text will be installed today. The new wording eliminates the \\"led to\\" phrase and instead provides a list of events that mark the Bush terms. It now reads \\". . . Bush found his two terms in office instead marked by a series of cataclysmic events: the attacks on September 11, 2001; the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina; and a financial crisis during his last months in office.\\" The president's portrait and one of Laura Bush were unveiled last month. Sanders, who was told about the caption by a staff member, said yesterday he was satisfied that the museum acted quickly. \\"On one hand, one could say this is a small issue; on the other hand, it is not,\\" Sanders said. \\"People can like George Bush or not. People can support the war in Iraq or not. But we have got to get our history right. George Bush has acknowledged 9/11 did not cause the war in Iraq. That is simply the case. I don't like the rewriting of history.\\" Sullivan, who has been director of the museum since April, explained: \\"The core issue here is not about a political point of view but a clarity of the sentence. In this instance, Senator Sanders called attention to the original label, saying it implied there was a direct causal relationship. We didn't intend to do that, but wanted to list the defining events of the Bush administration.\\" All the captions at the Portrait Gallery are limited to 140 words, whether they describe a president or an opera singer. Occasionally they are changed when sharp-eyed visitors notice a factual or grammatical mistake. The gallery changed the word \\"lynching\\" to \\"murder\\" in the case of one historic portrait. Over the years, exhibitions at the Smithsonian, of which the Portrait Gallery is a part, have drawn criticism from members of Congress. In 2003, a Senate hearing included a testy discussion of the captions in a photography exhibit on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge at the National Museum of Natural History. Smithsonian officials said they had not used the text in the photography book, the basis of the show, because they decided the language -- about the pros and cons of oil drilling -- was political, and stated that they had not caved into political interests. Summary:","output":"The National Portrait Gallery has amended the caption for a portrait of President George W. Bush at the request of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who objected to the language connecting the 9/11 attacks to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sanders highlighted that the notion linking 9/11 and Iraq has been debunked. The gallery's director agreed with the request and changed the caption accordingly. The new caption lists the events that marked Bush's terms in office, including the 9/11 attacks, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Hurricane Katrina, and the financial crisis. Senator Sanders emphasized the importance of not rewriting history and ensuring accurate representation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

That's certainly true, and we also believe that, for the reasons averted to by amicus AOL in this case and the reasons you've just suggested, the disruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases Ryder and Reynoldsville Casket Company would be sufficient to fit it within the, quote, \\"severe disruption exception\\" to the retrospectivity. Can we infer the following? the truth can't be certain","output":"Based on the statement provided, it can be inferred that the speaker is discussing a legal case or argument and referring to the opinions of both amicus AOL (likely a party providing friend-of-the-court assistance) and the judge. The speaker mentions \\"the retrospectivity cases Ryder and Reynoldsville Casket Company,\\" which the statement refers to as legal precedents or cases that deal with retrospectivity, a term that is used to describe the application of new laws or legal standards to past events or occurrences. In this specific context, the issue of disruption arises when applying new legal rules or interpretations to past situations, potentially undermining the previous understanding of the law or its consequences. The \\"severe disruption exception\\" mentioned in the statement refers to an exception in legal jurisprudence, particularly regarding retrospectivity, which acknowledges that certain situations may be so disruptive that retrospective application of new legal rules is not warranted or appropriate. This could mean that applying a new legal standard or rule to past events might create chaos and confusion, significantly destabilizing established legal structures or settlements, and consequently should be avoided. While the statement mainly focuses on the severe disruption exception and the potential implications of applying retrospectivity, it seems unrelated to the concept of absolute truth or certainty. It is important to remember that in the legal world, various parties present their arguments and perspectives to derive an outcome that is deemed just and reasonable, and the negotiation and weighing of these different arguments often acknowledge and accept that there may not be a single, universally acknowledged truth. In conclusion, the statement primarily revolves around the concept of retrospectivity and the severe disruption exception within a legal context. Although it does not explicitly say that \\"the truth can't be certain,\\" the legal world operates based on the principle that multiple opinions and perspectives are considered to reach a final decision. As such, legal discussions often accept the complexities and uncertainties associated with various interpretations, rather than seeking an absolute truth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM. Input: X: cut, Y: matter Output:","output":"To determine the relationship between the given words \\"cut\\" and \\"matter\\", I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the words' meanings - Cut: to penetrate with or as if with an edged instrument, or to remove or separate by cutting - Matter: a substance of which a physical object is composed, or a subject under consideration Step 2: Check for COORD relationship A COORD relationship holds when both words belong to the same semantic class. In this case, \\"cut\\" is a verb or action, while \\"matter\\" is a noun or physical substance. These two words don't belong to the same semantic class, so there is no COORD relationship. Step 3: Check for HYPER relationship A HYPER relationship applies when one word is a specific instance of the other. Here, \\"cut\\" and \\"matter\\" have distinct meanings, and neither is a specific instance of the other. Consequently, there's no HYPER relationship between the words. Step 4: Determine the relationship Since neither COORD nor HYPER relationships apply to \\"cut\\" and \\"matter\\", the relationship between them is RANDOM.

Answer the following question: This article: White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second. There are no other known stream gauges on the creek. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the location that had a high discharge of 111 cubic feet per second?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The location that had a high discharge of 111 cubic feet per second is Allenwood, as stated in the article.

Abstract: To determine whether there is a prognostic value in the percentage normal sperm morphologic features in a human in vitro fertilization (IVF) program, the authors conducted a prospective study in women with bilateral tubal damage. Based on the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, the patients were divided into four groups: group I, normal morphologic features between 0% and 14%; group II, 15% to 30%; group III, 31% to 45%; and group IV, 46% to 60%. One hundred ninety successful laparoscopic cycles were evaluated. In group I, 104 oocytes were obtained, of which 37% fertilized, but no pregnancy resulted; in group II, 81% of 324 oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate per embryo transfer (ET) of 22%; in group III, 82% of 309 oocytes were fertilized, with a 31% pregnancy rate; and in group IV, 91% of 69 oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate of 12%. Probability models indicated that there was a clear threshold in normal sperm morphologic features at 14%, with high fertilization and pregnancy rate in the groups with normal sperm morphologic features greater than 14%.

The only field army remaining to the King was Goring's, and though Hopton, who sorrowfully accepted the command after Goring's departure, tried at the last moment to revive the memories and the local patriotism of 1643, it was of no use to fight against the New Model with the armed rabble that Goring turned over to him. Dartmouth surrendered on 18 January 1646, Hopton was defeated at the Battle of Torrington on 16 February, and surrendered the remnant of his worthless army on 14 March. Exeter fell on 13 April.

Movie title: Dark of the Sun Context: Sometime in the mid-1960s, mercenary Bruce Curry (Rod Taylor) is hired by Congolese President Ubi (Calvin Lockhart) supposedly to rescue the European residents of an isolated town about to be attacked by rebel Simbas in the Congo. But in reality his mission is to retrieve diamonds, worth fifty million dollars, from a mine company's vault. Curry's subordinates include his friend Ruffo (Jim Brown) and alcoholic Doctor Wreid (Kenneth More). He also reluctantly recruits ex-Nazi Henlein (Peter Carsten) because he needs his military expertise and leadership skills. The Congolese president provides Curry with the use of a steam train and soldiers. On the way, the train is attacked by a United Nations peacekeeping plane. The mercenaries then pick up Claire (Yvette Mimieux) after they find her house burned down and husband murdered by Simbas. Meanwhile, Henlein, who resents Curry's leadership, begins to cause trouble because the German knows about the diamonds. Things come to a boiling point when he kills two children whom he suspects of being rebel spies. Afterward, Henlein makes romantic advances towards Claire, which Curry interrupts. Curry and Henlein then fight an inconclusive duel which involves a chainsaw. Curry is prepared to kill Henlein, but Ruffo stops him. Further complications arise when the mercenaries reach the town. First, the diamonds are in a time-locked vault delaying the train's departure. Second, Dr Wreid attends a pregnant woman at a mission hospital and refuses to abandon her. Curry reluctantly agrees to let the doctor stay behind. Back in town, Curry waits anxiously for the vault to open. The delay allows the Simbas to catch up and begin attacking the town and station. Finally, the train, loaded with the diamonds and fleeing residents, slowly leaves the station under small arms fire, but a mortar round destroys the coupling between the last two carriages.

In August last year, the air craft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning. The carrier was at first called the Varyag. It was built in the former Soviet Union. However, the Soviets failed to finish the ship. China bought the Varyag in 1998. Now after 10 trial runs, the aircraft carrier, renamed Liaoning, is in active service. Liaoning is about 300 meters long and 70 meters wide. It can take 30 planes and hold 2,000 soldiers. According to Xinhua News, Liaoning will be used for scientific research and military training. The aircraft carrier will help protect our country and promote  world peace. The BBC said that Liaoning coming into service \\" marks China as a rising power\\". ,.

A. office  B. wall  C. front door  D. wall  E. building  The best answer is A:","output":"C. front door Leaving a home typically involves exiting through a designated exit point which is safe, easy to access, and common for people to use. The best answer in this case is C. front door. A. Office - An office is generally a room or space inside a home designated for work or study. This is not a proper means of exit as it is not a designated passage to leave a house. B. Wall - A wall is a solid structure that defines the perimeter of a home and supports the roof and other parts. It is not meant to be used as an exit. Leaving through a wall would require breaking it down or creating an opening which is not a conventional or recommended way of leaving a house. D. Wall - The same explanation as for option B applies here, as it's simply not a feasible or sensible way to exit a home. E. Building - A building refers to the entire structure comprising the home, which could also include other homes or spaces such as apartments or commercial establishments. Leaving a home through the building would mean exiting through the main entrance of the entire structure rather than your specific residence. While this might be applicable in some cases, it is not the most appropriate answer when considering leaving a home in a general sense. Therefore, considering the aforementioned explanations for each choice, the best answer is C. front door. A front door is a dedicated entry and exit point for a home that is both safe and easily accessible. It is a common and conventional means through which people leave their houses daily. Utilizing the front door allows for a quick and secure departure while also maintaining the structural integrity of the home."},{"instruction":"Question: This article: In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

W.\\" and Die Groot Krokodil (Afrikaans for \\"The Big Crocodile\\"), was the leader of South Africa from 1978 to 1989, serving as the last Prime Minister from 1978 to 1984 and the first executive State President from 1984 to 1989. First elected to Parliament in 1948, Botha was an outspoken opponent of majority rule and international communism. However, his administration did make concessions towards political reform, whereas internal unrest saw widespread human rights abuses at the hands of the government. Botha resigned the leadership of the ruling National Party in February 1989 after suffering a stroke and six months later was coerced to leave the presidency as well. At age 30, Botha was elected head of the National Party Youth in 1946, and two years later won a race for the House of Assembly as representative of George in the southern Cape Province in the general election which saw the beginning of the National Party's 46-year tenure in power. In 1958 Botha was appointed Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs by Hendrik Verwoerd, and in 1961 advanced to Minister of Coloured Affairs. He was appointed Minister for Defence by Verwoerd's successor B.J. Vorster, upon Verwoerd's murder, in 1966. Under his 14 years as its leader, the South African Defence Force reached a zenith, at times consuming 20% of the national budget, compared to 1.3% in 1968, and was involved in the South African Border War. When Vorster resigned following allegations of his involvement in the Muldergate Scandal in 1978, Botha was elected as his successor by the National Party caucus, besting the electorate's favourite, 45-year-old Foreign Minister Pik Botha. In the final internal ballot, he beat Connie Mulder, the scandal's namesake, in a 78-72 vote.  Botha was keen to promote constitutional reform, and hoped to implement a form of federal system in South Africa that would allow for greater \\"self-rule\\" for black homelands (or Bantustans), while still retaining the supremacy of a white central government, and foremost expand the rights of Coloureds (South Africans of mixed ancestry) and Asians in order to widen support for the government. Upon enacting the reforms, he remarked in the House of Assembly; \\"We must adapt or die.\\"  On becoming head of the government, Botha retained the defence portfolio until October 1980, when he appointed chief of the South African Defence Force, General Magnus Malan, his successor. From his ascension to the cabinet, Botha pursued an ambitious military policy designed to increase South Africa's military capability. He sought to improve relations with the West - especially the United States - but with mixed results. He argued that the preservation of the apartheid government, though unpopular, was crucial to stemming the tide of African Communism, which had made in-roads into neighbouring Angola and Mozambique after these two former Portuguese colonies obtained independence.  As Prime Minister and later State President, his greatest parliamentary opponents were Harry Schwarz and Helen Suzman of the Progressive Federal Party until 1987, when his former cabinet colleague Andries Treurnicht's new Conservative Party became the official opposition on a strictly anti-concessionist agenda.  In 1977, as Minister of Defence he began a secret nuclear weapons program, which culminated in the production of six nuclear bombs destroyed only in the early 1990s. He remained steadfast in South Africa's administration of the neighbouring territory South-West Africa, particularly while there was a presence of Cuban troops in Angola to the north. Botha was responsible for introducing the notorious police counter-insurgency unit, Koevoet. He was also instrumental in building the South African Defence Force's strength. Adding momentum to establishing units such as 32 Battalion. South African intervention in support of the rebel UNITA (Dr. Jonas Savimbi, a personal friend) movement in the Angolan Civil War continued until the late 1980s, terminating with the Tripartite Accord. To maintain the nation's military strength, a very strict draft was implemented to enforce compulsory military service for white South African men.

Q: One time I was walking my puppy (profile pic) who was then around 5 months, with my mum and grandma. By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn’t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked. My mom would later laugh at me because I became so pale and because I tried to baby talk a dog to leave us alone.

In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.  Would bowl A fruits be preserved longer or shorter than bowl B fruits?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the hint, bowl A contains glace fruits that have been through the process of preservation using sugar syrup, while bowl B contains non-glace fruits that haven't been through this process. Step 1: Analyze the preserving process of glace fruits The process of making glace fruit involves placing the fruit in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the fruit's moisture and preserves it. Step 2: Understand the preservation duration The preservation process of glace fruits allows them to retain their quality for a year, as sugar saturation prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms by creating an unfavorable osmotic pressure. Step 3: Compare the preservation times Non-glace fruits in bowl B haven't been through the sugar preservation process, meaning they would likely spoil much faster due to the lack of protection against microorganisms. Conclusion: Bowl A fruits (glace fruits) would be preserved for a longer duration than the fruits in bowl B (non-glace fruits)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Trivia question: What make of car was Mike Hawthorn driving when he won the F1 World Drivers Championship in 1958 And the answer is?","output":"Mike Hawthorn won the 1958 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship driving a Ferrari. More specifically, he raced the Ferrari 246 F1 during that season, which was a milestone as he became the first British driver to win the championship title. The Ferrari 246 F1 was a significant car in the history of Formula 1 racing. It was powered by a 2.4-liter Dino V6 engine, which was named after Enzo Ferrari's son, Dino Ferrari. This engine was the first V6 to be used in a Formula 1 car and produced around 280 horsepower. The car featured a tubular spaceframe construction and was equipped with a transverse-5 speed gearbox. Weighing approximately 630 kg, it had a top speed of around 300 km/h (186 mph). The 1958 Formula 1 season was highly competitive and had a dramatic conclusion. Hawthorn's main rival, Stirling Moss, driving a Vanwall, was leading the championship standings for most of the season. However, Hawthorn managed to accumulate more points due to consistent podium finishes despite winning only a single race, the French Grand Prix, which was held at Reims. During the last race of the season, the Moroccan Grand Prix, Moss needed to win and set the fastest lap time to secure the championship, provided Hawthorn finished lower than second place. As fate would have it, Moss won the race and set the fastest lap, but Hawthorn finished second, securing enough points to win the championship. The season ended with Hawthorn having a total of 42 points, just one point ahead of Moss, making it one of the closest championship battles in Formula 1 history. Mike Hawthorn's triumph in 1958 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship driving the Ferrari 246 F1 was not only a testament to the competitive spirit of the British driver but also a nod to the exceptional performance and engineering prowess of the Ferrari team. Tragically, Hawthorn announced his retirement from motor racing after winning the championship and, a few months later, perished in a road accident in England."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are a few factors to consider during the baking process to achieve this goal, such as the ingredients, cookie dough consistency, baking time, and the cooling process. In this scenario, the two options provided revolve around the cooling process. Both options involve letting the cookies rest on the sheet pan for 20-30 seconds before moving them. Here, we will explore the benefits of each choice and suggest some additional tips for ensuring your cookies do not crumble. Option I: Let your cookie rest on the sheet pan for 20-30 seconds before moving them to a cooling plate. Choosing to move your cookies to a cooling plate after allowing them to rest for a short period on the sheet pan can be beneficial. By leaving them on the sheet pan for a moment, the residual heat begins to escape, allowing the cookies to solidify slightly. This makes them less prone to breaking or crumbling when they are transferred to the cooling plate. Cooling plates also have flat surfaces, which helps to reduce the risk of your cookies deforming or breaking during the cooling process. Option II: Let your cookie rest on the sheet pan for 20-30 seconds before moving them to a cooling rack. Similar to Option I, this method also involves allowing the cookies to rest on the sheet pan for a short time before transferring them to a cooling rack. Using a cooling rack enables better air circulation around the cookies, allowing them to cool more quickly and evenly. This can help prevent the cookies from becoming soggy from condensation that forms when they are left on the warm sheet pan for too long. The brief resting period helps to firm up the cookies and reduce the risk of them breaking when they are moved. In conclusion, both options can help keep your cookies from crumbling, with the primary difference being the method of cooling—using a cooling plate or a cooling rack. It mostly comes down to personal preference and availability of equipment. Here are some additional suggestions to help ensure your cookies are less likely to crumble: 1. Refrigerate or chill dough before baking: Chilling the dough will help the cookies retain their shape during baking and reduces the likelihood of them spreading too much and becoming too thin, which can make them more prone to crumbling. 2. Proper baking time: Overbaking cookies can make them too brittle and prone to breaking. Ensure you're using the correct baking time and temperature for the type of cookie you're making. 3. Use the correct ingredients: Ensure you're using the proper ratios of butter, sugar, flour, and other ingredients in your recipe. Using high-quality ingredients can also make a difference in your cookies' texture and crumbliness. 4. Allow cookies to cool completely: Regardless of your chosen cooling method (plate or rack), allow your cookies to cool completely before handling or stacking them. This helps to ensure the cookies reach their optimal texture and are less likely to crumble. Ultimately, choose the option that best suits your preferences, equipment, and baking style. By following the recommendations provided and incorporating the additional suggestions, you'll be well on your way to baking delicious, perfect cookies that won't crumble."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Ray Sager  for the following movie plot:  Boojie Baker (Dan Conway) is a ruthless and greedy talent manager who \\"discovers\\" and then exploits unknown rock bands. The film opens in a nightclub with one of Boojie Baker's protÃ©gÃ© acts, a band named Charlie, who have clearly been put through the grind already. They begin griping about the royalties they've been fleeced out of, and then walk out on him. Undaunted, Boojie and his loyal but dim-witted assistant Gordy (Ray Sager) walk into a local bar for some cheap drinks and they discover a new band performing, played by real-life Chicago garage rock band The Faded Blue. Promising them a recording contract and ensuing fame, Boojie renames the five-man group \\"The Big Blast\\", outfits them in designer suits and sets about to prime them for stardom. This is done by utilizing a bevy of attractive and loose women to seduce a recording engineer, photographing him in the heat of the moment and then blackmailing him into letting The Big Blast cut a single. The group cuts their big hit, and Boojie presumably uses similar tactics to promote the record and garner airplay. However, as the band's popularity grows, it doesn't take long before they begin to wonder why they aren't receiving any money for their labors. A little later, the Big Blast confronts Boojie in his office and accuse him of swindling them out of their hard-earned money for their record sales and demand that he pay them up front for their work from now on. Being a hard line negotiator, Boojie refuses to budge in that respect, and welcomes the boys to seek fame in fortune in other avenues. To show there are no hard feelings, he even invites them to a party at his apartment. It turns out that this party, replete with liquor, women and marijuana is a setup, and a \\"police detective\\" shows up to raid it. Coincidentally, this is before Boojie arrives, and when he does, it seems that he also has some pull in the \\"police department\\".

Scott Applewhite, File) (Associated Press) FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2012 file photo, the Supreme Court Building is seen in Washington. The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld a Texas law that counts everyone, not just eligible voters, in deciding... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court ruled Monday that states can count everyone, not just eligible voters, in deciding how to draw electoral districts.      The justices turned back a challenge from Texas voters that could have dramatically altered political district boundaries and disproportionately affected the nation's growing Latino population.      The court ruled that Texas' challenged state Senate districting map, using total population, complied with the principle of \\"one person, one vote,\\" the requirement laid out by the Supreme Court in 1964 that political districts be roughly equal in population.      The issue, though, was what population to consider: everyone or just eligible voters.      The challengers said the districts had vastly different numbers when looking at eligible voters, in violation of the Constitution.      \\"Jurisdictions, we hold, may design state and local legislative districts with equal total populations; they are not obliged to equalize voter populations,\\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, summarizing her opinion for the court.      Ginsburg said that \\"history, our decisions and settled practice in all 50 states and countless local jurisdictions point in the same direction.\\"      Two rural Texas voters challenged the use of total population data in drawing state Senate districts because they said it inflates the voting power of city dwellers at their expense.      In Texas, and other states with large immigrant populations, urban districts include many more people who are too young, not citizens or otherwise ineligible to vote. Civil rights groups said forcing states to change their method of constructing districts would have damaged Latino political influence.      The court stopped short of saying that states must use total population. And it also did not rule on whether states are free to use a different measure, as Texas asked.      Ginsburg said the court was not resolving whether states may use voter population.      Richard Hasen, an expert in election law at the University of California at Irvine law school, said, \\"A contrary ruling would have shifted power to Republican, rural districts, and away from Democratic urban areas.\\"      Edward Blum, whose Project on Fair Representation backed the lawsuit, said he was disappointed in the outcome, but predicted that \\"the issue of voter equality in the United States is not going to go away.\\"      Though the justices were unanimous in upholding Texas' use of total population, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito declined to join Ginsburg's opinion.      Thomas said the Constitution gives the states the freedom to draw political lines based on different population counts. Referring to the 1964 case of Reynolds v. Sims, he said the high court \\"has never provided a sound basis for the one-person, one-vote principle.\\"      Alito objected to Ginsburg's reliance on the Constitution's prescription for using the once-a-decade census to divvy up seats in the House of Representatives among the states. Alito said the history of congressional representation was the product of political compromise. \\"It is impossible to draw any clear constitutional command from this complex history,\\" he said. ||||| WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday that states may count all residents, whether or not they are eligible to vote, in drawing election districts. The decision was a major statement on the meaning of a fundamental principle of the American political system, that of “one person one vote.”      “We hold, based on constitutional history, this court’s decisions and longstanding practice, that a state may draw its legislative districts based on total population,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court.      As a practical matter, the ruling mostly helped Democrats and upheld the status quo.      But until this decision, the court had never resolved whether voting districts should contain roughly the same number of people or the same number of eligible voters. Counting all people amplifies the voting power of places that have large numbers of residents who cannot vote legally — including immigrants who are here legally but are not citizens, illegal immigrants and children. Those places tend to be urban and to vote Democratic.      Had the justices required that only eligible voters be counted, the ruling would have shifted political power from cities to rural areas, a move that would have benefited Republicans. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that states can count everyone, not just eligible voters, while deciding how to draw electoral districts. The court's ruling rejected a challenge from Texas voters that could have significantly altered political district boundaries and disproportionately impacted the nation's growing Latino population. Civil rights groups argued that forcing states to change their method of constructing districts would have damaged Latino political influence.

After his father broke his neck and drowned in a diving accident when Meader was only eighteen months old, his mother moved to Boston to work as a cocktail waitress, leaving Meader behind with relatives. A sometimes unruly and troubled child, Meader was sent to live with his mother in Boston at the age of five Context: In November 1963, Meader was busy recording a new comedy record, written by a different group of writers and not involving his Kennedy impersonation. On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, and Kennedy's death effectively ended Meader's career. Copies of The First Family were pulled from stores and a JFK-related Christmas single by Meader that had been released by MGM's Verve Records shortly before the assassination was quickly withdrawn. Appearances that were already booked were canceled, including one for the Grammy Awards ceremony. An episode of The Joey Bishop Show was also pulled, which Meader filmed one week before the assassination. The episode was never aired and was reportedly destroyed.  Meader reportedly first learned of President Kennedy's assassination after hailing a taxicab in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The driver, recognizing his celebrity passenger, asked \\"Did you hear about Kennedy?\\" Meader thought the driver was telling a joke and responded \\"No, how does it go?\\" The driver then informed him of the sad news, and from the taxi's radio Meader heard the breaking news bulletins for the first time.  According to several sources, standup comedian Lenny Bruce went on with his November 22 nightclub show as scheduled. Just hours after Kennedy's death, Bruce walked onstage, stood silently for several moments, then said sadly, \\"Boy, is Vaughn Meader fucked.\\" The joke proved true. Meader discovered that he was so completely typecast as a Kennedy impersonator that he could not find anyone willing to hire him for any of his other talents.  His non-Kennedy album for Verve Records, Have Some Nuts!!!, came out to minimal attention in early 1964. A similar follow-up If The Shoe Fits... was released in late 1964, and included sketches on almost everything except the Kennedys, but sales were meager at best. Meader's income evaporated, new-found friends and associates stopped calling, and by 1965 Meader was virtually broke. Sinking into depression, he became addicted to alcohol and drugs, and was forced to take whatever work he could find.  He reunited with Earle Doud in 1971 for an album called The Second Coming, a comedic look at what life would be like for Jesus if he had returned to earth around the time of Jesus Christ Superstar, but airplay and sales were virtually nonexistent. Question: What did he have to settle for?. Whats the answer?","output":"Vaughn Meader had to settle for taking whatever work he could find because his career as a Kennedy impersonator ended after President Kennedy's assassination. He struggled to find success in other areas of entertainment and became addicted to alcohol and drugs. He tried making a few more comedy albums, but they did not sell well. So, he had to accept any job available to survive and make a living."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

He was charged with one count of domestic assault, one count of assault and one count of malicious destruction of property. Just days ago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver vowed to 'take a fresh look' at its domestic violence procedures. Article:","output":"Title: NBA Player Arrested in Michigan: League to Reevaluate Domestic Violence Procedures In a recent turn of events at the East Lansing, Michigan Marriott, a 25-year-old NBA player from Sweden was arrested under charges of domestic assault, assault, and malicious destruction of property. Authorities have provided minimal details about the situation, but this incident has reignited concerns about domestic violence within professional sports leagues.  This arrest comes on the heels of NBA commissioner Adam Silver's recent promise to \\"take a fresh look\\" at the league's handling of domestic violence incidents. As domestic violence continues to rear its head in the realm of professional sports, the need for a proactive and effective system for addressing such incidents becomes increasingly apparent. The Sweden native's arrest adds fuel to the ongoing debate about the prevalence of domestic violence in professional sports, and the perceived lack of appropriate response and protocol from the leagues themselves. With this latest occurrence, many are calling for a comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the NBA's procedures for dealing with domestic violence infractions. The charges against the 25-year-old athlete, which include one count of domestic assault, one count of assault, and one count of malicious destruction of property, represent a serious violation of ethical standards. The repercussions of these charges on the player's career and reputation are yet to be seen, but the incident undeniably serves as a harsh reminder of the severity of domestic violence in today's society. In response to this most recent incident, Commissioner Silver's commitment to reassessing the league's domestic violence policies is now more important than ever. The NBA, as well as other professional sports organizations, must take proactive steps to engage with and evaluate their current policies in order to create a safer and more inclusive environment for all members of the sports community. In summary, the recent arrest of a 25-year-old NBA player from Sweden at the East Lansing Marriott has sparked renewed concern about domestic violence procedures within professional sports leagues. With the NBA Commissioner vowing to take a closer look at such procedures, the public eye eagerly awaits the results of these evaluations and the potential improvements they may bring. As social consciousness continues to progress, it is crucial that professional sports organizations also take the necessary steps to ensure a safe and responsible environment for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Air currents are slowly carrying the fallout south; the only areas still habitable are in the far reaches of the Southern Hemisphere. From Australia, survivors detect an incomprehensible Morse code signal coming from the West Coast of the United States. The last American nuclear submarine, USS Sawfish, under Royal Australian Navy command, is ordered to sail north to the United States to attempt to make contact with the sender of the Morse signal. The submarine is commanded by Captain Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck), who must leave his new friend, the alcoholic Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). The Australian government arranges for its citizens to receive suicide pills or prepared injections so they may end things quickly before there is prolonged suffering from radiation sickness. An Australian naval officer, Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) and his wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster, have a baby daughter. Assigned to travel with the American sub for several weeks, Peter tries to explain to Mary how to euthanize their baby and then kill herself in case he is not yet home when the end comes; Mary reacts very emotionally at the prospect of killing her daughter and herself. One scientist's theory is that the radiation level near the Arctic Ocean could be lower than that found at the mid-Northern Hemisphere, which might indicate the radiation could disperse before reaching the Southern Hemisphere. The theory is to be explored along with the submarine's main mission. After sailing to Point Barrow, Alaska, they determine that radiation levels are, on the contrary, intensifying. The next day, the Sawfish arrives in the San Francisco Bay Area, just off San Francisco.

For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, for a moment or two, something of a genius.  With another human being present, vision becomes double vision, unavoidably. We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact gets lost. \\"Music I heard with you was more than music.\\" Exactly. And therefore music itself can only be heard alone. Solitude  is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience. \\"Alone one is never lonely: the spirit adventures, walking in a quiet garden, in a cool house, staying single there.\\" Loneliness is very strongly felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences of taste, temperament and mood. Human intercourse  often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation. Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are, and to feel whatever we feel  ly. That is a great luxury!

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine.  and a hint : Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  Please answer this question : Whose device would have less distance for applied force, Archimedes or Ptolemy? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Archimedes' device would have less distance for the applied force. Since he constructed a great machine, it is likely designed to make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied. Following the hint given, if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Therefore, Archimedes' device would have less distance for the applied force compared to Ptolemy's device, which is not a machine and likely does not increase the force applied."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Obama Administration Could Cause the Next Big For-Profit College Collapse The Obama administration is at risk of repeating the mistakes that led to the expensive collapse of for-profit chain Corinthian Colleges Inc. In that case, the Department of Education failed to address years of allegations that the company’s schools swindled its students and warning signs that Corinthian was facing financial difficulty. When the department finally took action by delaying the delivery of federal student aid to the schools, officials were “surprised” by the cash crunch the delay caused. That set off a series of events that culminated in Corinthian filing for bankruptcy protection less than a year later. The increasing cost to taxpayers of Corinthian's collapse was at least 90 million as of March. Now the department's recent demand that cash-strapped ITT Educational Services Inc., owner of the eponymous career schools, stump up additional money to cover the cost of a potential collapse could unwittingly exacerbate ITT’s financial woes. “The Education Department hasn’t been a good analyst of corporate balance sheets. I haven’t seen any evidence that anyone at [the department] reads the papers or engages in the most minimal due diligence,” said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges & Universities. On Monday, the department sent a letter to ITT’s chief executive, Kevin M. Modany, giving the company 45 days to increase its existing guaranty with the department from 79.7 million to 123.6 million. The jump is necessary to protect taxpayers, the department said, because ITT’s schools are at risk of losing accreditation amid an avalanche of government lawsuits and investigations into its practices. Without accreditation, schools can’t get a slice of the nearly 130 billion in loans and grants the federal government annually doles out to college students. About 80 percent of ITT’s cash revenue last year came from the Education Department. Its schools collectively enroll nearly 45,000 students who annually receive more than 600 million in federal student aid. But it’s not clear whether the department’s demand took into consideration the terms governing a 100 million loan ITT received in 2014 from private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. Cerberus caps the amount of Education Department-related debt ITT can owe at 120 million. Monday’s demand risks placing the company in default on the loan, said Bradley Safalow, founder and chief executive of PAA Research. ITT disagrees, pointing to a separate clause in its agreement with Cerberus allowing the career-school chain to take on an additional 17.5 million in undefined debt. Two analysts who follow the company and a lawyer active in commercial finance matters said Cerberus could interpret that clause differently but nonetheless said they expected Cerberus and ITT to strike a deal to avert default. Peter Duda, a Cerberus spokesman at Weber Shandwick, said the private equity firm declined to comment. The Education Department made its demand after a review of the company’s finances and recent securities filings, concluding that the increase was “in the interest of students and taxpayers,” Kelly Leon, an Education Department spokeswoman, said Monday. For the past year ITT has been providing the department with projections of its 13-week cash flows every two weeks. On Wednesday, Leon said the department was “further researching” the apparent 120 million cap detailed in ITT’s loan agreement with Cerberus. She declined further comment. ITT has no shortage of woes. It’s battling a steep drop in enrollment, three separate government lawsuits alleging fraud filed by the federal consumer and securities regulators and the Massachusetts attorney general, and a dwindling cash pile. Its net income last year fell to 23.3 million, a 92 percent drop compared with 2011. The company reckons it has enough cash to finance itself and meet its obligations, but the Education Department’s recent surety demand could “negatively affect” its standing with the department, various state education and professional licensing boards, and its accreditor. The accreditor, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges & Schools, told the company in April that its schools would have to prove by August why they deserve to maintain accreditation. It also has asked the career-school chain to prepare a plan for its students in the event that it fails. ITT executives have said that they’ve done nothing wrong and that they do right by their students. “Many of ITT's critics are Washington insiders and the media and political allies who have an ideological bias against the for-profit higher education sector,” Modany said on April 29. Few schools in the U.S. saddle their students with more debt than ITT. Some 191,000 former ITT students cumulatively owed more than 4.6 billion on their federal loans as of 2014, according to a study based on federal data published last year by a Treasury Department economist and a former Treasury intern. Recent ITT students are struggling with their federal debt. About 51 percent of former ITT students whose loans came due in 2009 had defaulted in the following five years. The 2009 cohort also saw their cumulative balances rise 1 percent by 2014. By comparison, former New York University students whose federal loans came due in 2009 had paid down 34 percent of their debt after five years.

This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy  and that those who go out to work should take their turn in _ like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it's not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for older women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves \\" First come, first served\\", while a gray-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands? Yet this is too often seen. Older people, tired and easy annoyed from a day's work, aren't angels, either--far from it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend  this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse. If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems necessary, not only that communication in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. Shop assistant won't bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductors pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on. It seems to us that it's up to the young and strong to do their small part to stop such deterioration  . Question: According to the passage, communication between human beings would not be smoother unless   _  . Options: A: people become more considerate towards each other B: people are not so tired and easily annoyed C: women are treated with more courtesy D: public transport is improved Answer:","output":"A: people become more considerate towards each other In the passage, it is mentioned that there are several situations where courtesy and unselfishness are lacking, such as young men not giving up their seats for the elderly, sick, or burdened individuals on public transportation. Additionally, the passage talks about shop assistants not being helpful, taxi drivers being aggressive, and bus conductors not being considerate towards passengers. All these examples highlight a lack of courtesy and communication between people. Therefore, it is suggested that communication between human beings would be smoother if people become more considerate towards each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: who is all time premier league goal scorer?","output":"The all-time Premier League top goal scorer is Alan Shearer, a former English professional footballer who played as a striker. Born on August 13, 1970, in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, Shearer is widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers in the history of English football.  Alan Shearer started his professional football career in 1988 with Southampton, where he scored 23 league goals in 118 appearances. In 1992, he moved to Blackburn Rovers and enjoyed a successful period with the club, where he scored 112 league goals in 138 appearances. During his time at Blackburn, he helped the team win the Premier League title in the 1994-1995 season. In 1996, Shearer joined his hometown club, Newcastle United, where he played until his retirement in 2006. He scored 148 league goals in 303 appearances for Newcastle United. Over the course of his Premier League career, Alan Shearer scored a record-breaking total of 260 goals in 441 appearances, making him the league's all-time top goal scorer. In addition to his goal-scoring prowess, Shearer earned numerous accolades, including three Premier League Golden Boot awards (1994, 1995, and 1996), two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards (1995 and 1997), and one Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award (1994). Furthermore, Shearer held the record for the most Premier League hat-tricks (11) until it was broken by Sergio Agüero in 2020. Shearer's impressive achievements extend to his international career as well. He earned 63 caps for the English national team and scored 30 goals. He represented England in the 1992 UEFA European Championship, the 1996 UEFA European Championship, and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier.

How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it... According to the above context, answer the following question. What does creativity seem to be to most people?","output":"To most people, creativity seems to be a combination of a unique, original idea or concept, along with skill and hard work. The balance of these elements varies among individuals, but overall, creativity is seen as the ability to think outside the box, generate innovative solutions, and apply them inventively. It is not necessarily always about producing something completely new, but rather finding a distinctive approach or perspective, which is influenced by one's experiences, subconscious processing, and sometimes even serendipity. It's this unique idea portion that holds significant interest for many when discussing creativity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Introverted Pauline sleeps in a small furnished hut in the yard.Pauline's life changes dramatically when she befriends wealthy British transfer student Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), the daughter of a respected physicist. Pauline's quiet nature is countered by Juliet's charisma and outspokenness, and the girls quickly become inseparable. Juliet is unafraid of authority, impressing Pauline by fearlessly correcting their French teacher during class and by ignoring their art teacher's instructions altogether.They are also the only two girls in their class forbidden from taking part in gym activities, due to childhood battles with bone disease, on Pauline's part, and lung disease on Juliet's.

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.

The beasts A:","output":"Title: \\"The Beasts: The Hunt for Charlie's Killer\\" Genre: Mystery/Thriller/Fantasy Plot Summary: The quiet town of Glenbrook is steeped in old legends of mysterious, beastly creatures that are known to reside in the dense surrounding forest. For years, these tales have been perceived by the townspeople as mere folklore, until one day when the lifeless body of Charlie, a well-respected philanthropist, is discovered with bizarre markings on his body. Faced with the impossibility of these ancient creatures wreaking havoc, Detective Jamie Williams is brought in to investigate the case and discover the truth behind Charlie's killer. Act I: The movie begins with the townspeople of Glenbrook speculating and gossiping about the mysterious death of Charlie Davidson, a popular and influential local philanthropist. The grisly discovery of the murder resurfaces age-old tales about \\"The Beasts,\\" which were believed to have been banished from the town. Detective Jamie Williams, a cynical and relentless investigator specializing in cold cases, arrives from out of town to scrutinize the homicide. As Jamie begins his investigation, he crosses paths with Dr. Sara Finch, a local historian, and Professor Samuel Turner, an expert on Glenbrook's beastly legends. Act II: Sensing that the locals are holding back on what they know, Jamie, Sara, and Samuel delve deeper into the town's history and the myth of \\"The Beasts\\" – discovering that the ancient cursed creatures were rumored to return to Glenbrook every 100 years to reap vengeance upon humans who defiled their once sacred land. As the hundred-year mark approaches, more townspeople are found dead with similar unexplainable markings, causing paranoia and fear to grip the town. Alongside Sara and Samuel, Jamie hastens his efforts to find the link between Charlie's death and The Beasts. But as he digs deeper, he uncovers hidden secrets about Charlie's seemingly benevolent philanthropic activities – uncovering ties with the town's most powerful figures. Act III: As the day of the hundred-year curse approaches, the trio ultimately uncovers a secret myth: The Beasts can only be summoned when there is a betrayal amongst humans. Charlie's philanthropic empire was built on deceit and manipulation revealed to have defiled the sacred land the Beasts had once protected. A showdown between Jamie, the town's powerful elites, and the emerging beasts ensues.  Sacrificing his life, Detective Jamie Williams fights off the beasts and uncovers the final piece of the puzzle – revealing that Charlie was murdered by his own associates to trigger the curse and cover their tracks. Just as the beasts are about to take their final revenge, Jamie makes a pact with them to cleanse the town of its corrupt rulers in exchange for sparing the innocent townspeople. Epilogue: In the aftermath of the battle, Glenbrook rebuilds with a newfound respect for the legend of The Beasts. Sara and Samuel continue their research into Glenbrook's history and the cursed creatures, hoping to prevent any further violence. Jamie's sacrifice echoes throughout the town, reminding everyone of the importance of trust, loyalty, and uncovering the truth. \\"The Beasts: The Hunt for Charlie's Killer\\" is a thrilling fantasy mystery that unfolds a complex narrative on trust, treachery, and the power of unity against prevailing darkness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The IGFET is more commonly known as a metal–oxide–semiconductor FET (MOSFET), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a p–n diode with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, both devices operate in the depletion mode, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): How many layers of metal are in the gate of an IGFET?","output":"The number of layers of metal in the gate of an IGFET (Insulated Gate Field-Effect Transistor), specifically a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), varies depending on the specific fabrication process and technology used.

This metal layer serves as the gate electrode, which is separated from the semiconductor substrate by a thin insulating oxide layer. However, modern MOSFET technologies have evolved, and advanced MOSFET devices may have more complex gate structures, potentially involving multiple metal layers or incorporating additional materials like polysilicon and high-k dielectrics. These advanced structures aim to improve device performance, reduce leakage current, and enhance the scalability of the device for smaller manufacturing nodes. In such cases, the total number of metal layers would depend on the specific design and fabrication process employed for the MOSFET. In summary, the simplest basic MOSFET structure typically has one metal layer in its gate, but more advanced MOSFET designs can have multiple metal layers or other conductive materials in the gate to optimize the device's performance under various technological and operating conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). In her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France.  Vonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful.  On March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months.  In 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined. She was ninth in super-G, but failed to finish the giant slalom. She cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she has a strained relationship, for rattling her before the event. Why did she fail?","output":"Lindsey Vonn failed to finish the giant slalom at the 2005 World Championships in Bormio, Italy, for a few reasons. Firstly, she cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she had a strained relationship, as a significant factor that rattled her emotionally and mentally before the event. This sudden emotional distress likely affected her concentration, focus, and overall performance during the race. In addition to the emotional turmoil, the giant slalom is a technical event that requires precision, balance, and a strong ability to make quick, tight turns. Vonn, at that time, was mainly focused on and had achieved success in the speed events like downhill and super-G, where the turns are longer and not as tight. The transition to excel in a more technical event like the giant slalom could have been difficult for her, considering her specialization in speed events. Furthermore, the level of competition at World Championships is extremely high, with the best athletes from around the globe pushing themselves to their limits. Failure to finish a race can be attributed to various factors such as course conditions, equipment issues, or even a momentary lapse in judgment or focus during the race. In Vonn's case, the combination of the emotional strain caused by her father's appearance, her less-developed skills in the technical event, and the high level of competition may have contributed to her failure in the giant slalom at the 2005 World Championships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: A number of theories have been proposed regarding Avicenna's madhab (school of thought within Islamic jurisprudence). Medieval historian Ẓahīr al-dīn al-Bayhaqī (d. 1169) considered Avicenna to be a follower of the Brethren of Purity. On the other hand, Dimitri Gutas along with Aisha Khan and Jules J. Janssens demonstrated that Avicenna was a Sunni Hanafi. However, the 14th cenutry Shia faqih Nurullah Shushtari according to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, maintained that he was most likely a Twelver Shia. Conversely, Sharaf Khorasani, citing a rejection of an invitation of the Sunni Governor Sultan Mahmoud Ghazanavi by Avicenna to his court, believes that Avicenna was an Ismaili.

The song serves as the second promotional single and fourth track from the band's second studio album \\"Smoke + Mirrors\\". Along with the songs \\"Hopeless Opus\\" and \\"Gold\\" on \\"Smoke + Mirrors\\", the song touches upon lead-singer Dan Reynolds' depression struggles. The song has peaked at number 14 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Rock Songs chart. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"\\"I'm So Sorry\\" presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclusively state that \\"I'm So Sorry\\" presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression. There are several reasons that contribute to this conclusion: 1. Personal experiences: It is essential to note that the song \\"I'm So Sorry\\" is an artistic expression of lead-singer Dan Reynolds' personal struggles with depression. Although his experience can be relatable to many people who suffer from depression, it does not encapsulate a universally agreed upon picture. Depression affects individuals differently, and the symptoms and emotions connected with the mental health condition can vary from person to person. 2. Artistic interpretation: Music, by nature, is a form of art that allows for creative freedom and individual interpretation. When listeners hear the song, they may assign their emotions and experiences to what they perceive as the primary message of the song. This subjective interpretation makes it difficult to claim that the song presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression. 3. Study limitations: To draw such a conclusion, it would require extensive research and analysis of the song's lyrics, themes, and impact on various listeners. The paragraph provided does not offer enough information or evidence for us to determine the song's portrayal of depression accurately and if it aligns with a universally agreed upon understanding of the condition. 4. Cultural context: A universally agreed upon picture of depression would require examining the cultural context within which the song was created and its reception by listeners from diverse cultural backgrounds. Depression may manifest and be perceived differently across cultures; hence, the song's message may not resonate with every listener in a uniform way. In summary, while the song \\"I'm So Sorry\\" does touch upon Dan Reynolds' personal battles with depression, we cannot conclude that it presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression based on the given information. To make such a claim, we would need to analyze the song's lyrics and themes more thoroughly, consider listeners' interpretations, and account for cultural context and variations in individual experiences of depression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the first sentence, Mr. Levine is addressed as \\"Mr. Levine,\\" while in the second sentence, he is referred to as \\"Donald Levine\\" and identified as Ms. Cohen Alon's lawyer.  2. The confirmation of Ms. Cohen Alon attempting to sell a story is present in both sentences. The first sentence states it as \\"Mr. Levine confirmed that Ms. Cohen Alon had tried to sell the story,\\" while the second sentence conveys the same message with \\"Donald Levine, confirmed she tried to sell the story.\\" 3. A significant difference between the two sentences is the time frame. The first sentence mentions this event happening \\"during the World Cup,\\" while the second one states it occurred in \\"February.\\" This can cause confusion if the reader has to contextually link the two sentences to a specific time frame. 4. Lastly, the structure of the sentences varies. The first one uses a subject-verb-object structure and refers to the individuals with their last names. The second sentence is shorter and provides Mr. Levine's first and last name, his professional relationship to Ms. Cohen Alon, and uses a pronoun (\\"she\\") to refer to Ms. Cohen Alon. In conclusion, the two sentences are quite similar, as they primarily convey the same basic message of Ms. Cohen Alon attempting to sell a story and Mr. Levine (her lawyer) confirming her actions. The differences are mainly in the time frame and sentence structure, but they do not detract from the overall similarity in content.

On June 29, he performed at the EHZ Festival in Helette, while on June 30, he was the only Asian representative at the Main Square Festival in Arras, France. On July 11, his thirteenth major single, \\"Day 1,\\" was released in collaboration with the French electronic producer and DJ, Yuksek. In August, he performed at the Kubana Festival in Russia. On September 8, Miyavi performed at the 908 Festival, organized by Kreva, in Saitama Super Arena. In October two concerts were held in Indonesia. On November 14, Samurai Sessions vol.1, his second EP, was released, which featured collaboration with various artists, and it was followed by a short nationwide tour. It reached 21 on the Oricon charts.  On February 28, 2013, \\"Ahead of the Light\\", Miyavi's fourteenth single, was released; a promotional tour of the same name followed. On June 19, his seventh studio album, Miyavi, was released in Japan. It is his best-selling album so far, reaching number eight on the Oricon charts.  On October 12, 2013, it was announced that Miyavi would venture into professional acting with his international debut in the film Unbroken. He played the role of Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe, nicknamed \\"The Bird\\", in what was Angelina Jolie's second feature film as director. It was released in December 2014. Miyavi commented that as the movie was somewhat sensitive to the Japanese people, he had hesitated as to whether he should take this role. However, after meeting with Jolie, and given that the underlying theme of this story is forgiveness, he wholeheartedly decided to accept it. Miyavi was featured in the same month's edition of Vogue Italia.  In 2013 Miyavi was nominated for the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Japanese Act, and at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan he won the Best Collaboration category with Yuksek.

Art of Noise (also The Art of Noise) were an English avant-garde synth-pop group formed in early 1983 by engineer/producer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik, along with arranger Anne Dudley, producer Trevor Horn and music journalist Paul Morley. The group had international Top 20 hits with \\"Kiss\\" and the instrumental \\"Peter Gunn\\", which won a 1986 Grammy Award. The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. Although Dudley and Jeczalik had already dissolved the group, in 1990 they assisted in the promotion of the lightly remixed compilation The Ambient Collection, which the China label released to cash in on the burgeoning ambient house scene. Jeczalik approved the remixes that appeared on The FON Mixes the following year. The rest of the decade saw China Records releasing further Art of Noise compilations: The Drum and Bass Collection, Art Works, and reissues of Best of without the ZTT-era tracks. Some of these featured new remixes by other artists.  According to an interview with J.J. Jeczalik reported in the ZTT fanzine Outside World in 1991, Jeczalik, Dudley and Langan were inspired by the commercial success of The FON Mixes and had discussed reuniting the group as a trio again. In preparation to record a new album, Jeczalik and Langan travelled to Cuba to gather new source material. However, no new recordings were produced with the new line-up, and the Art of Noise remained defunct.  Dudley became well known for composing numerous film and television scores during the 1990s. The most famous of these is probably The Full Monty, which won an Academy Award for Original Music Score. She also collaborated with Killing Joke's Jaz Coleman on the 1990 album Songs from the Victorious City (inspired by a trip the two made to Egypt) and produced two tracks for the 1993 Deborah Harry album Debravation (\\"Strike Me Pink\\", which she also co-wrote and played keyboards on) and \\"Mood Ring\\"). She has scored orchestrations for dozens of pop releases over the years, and both scored and produced the album Voice for her neighbour Alison Moyet. Cathy Dennis added lyrics to one of Dudley's compositions and recorded it as \\"Too Many Walls\\", which became a US Top 10 hit in 1991.  In 1995-1997, Jeczalik and In No Sense? Nonsense! coengineer Bob Kraushaar produced a number of instrumentals oriented toward dance clubs under the name Art of Silence, issuing an album titled artofsilence.co.uk.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"rust of iron in rocks is a direct result of \\" is \\"high speed fall from space\\", given that  chemical weathering of iron in rock causes rust? pick from the following.  * Yes;  * No; A:","output":"No, I don't think the right answer to the question \\"rust of iron in rocks is a direct result of\\" is \\"high speed fall from space,\\" given that chemical weathering of iron in rock causes rust. It is important to understand the underlying processes that lead to rust formation in the context of rocks. Chemical weathering is the process through which rocks are broken down or altered due to chemical reactions. The presence of iron in rocks is a common occurrence, and rust (iron oxide) forms when iron reacts with oxygen and water. This process can be further facilitated by the presence of acidic conditions or certain microbes that promote this oxidation reaction.  High speed fall from space might imply that the presence of rust on a rock is due to meteorite impacts or the composition of the space object containing iron. Although meteorites contain iron and can show signs of rust due to weathering after landing on Earth, they are not the primary source of rust formation in rocks. Rust of iron in rocks is not a direct result of a high-speed fall from space but rather, a byproduct of the inherent chemical processes that occur due to various environmental and microbial factors. The primary factors leading to rust of iron in rocks include oxygen, water, and occasionally certain minerals or microorganisms that facilitate the oxidation process. These factors are widespread in Earth's environment and not solely tied to meteorite impacts or high-speed falls from space. Therefore, the correct answer to this question would be chemical weathering and not high speed fall from space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: The people are all women. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that all the people in costume gathered on the city street are women. The premise only provides us with the information that people in costume are gathered on a city street, but it does not mention any specific details about the gender, age, or any other characteristics of the individuals involved. To conclusively determine whether the hypothesis is valid, we would need additional information that specifically addresses the gender of the gathered individuals. We can consider various possibilities that may arise from the given premise, which makes room for a wider range of scenarios and interpretations. For example, these scenarios might involve: 1. A mix of people with different genders: The group of individuals dressed in costumes could be composed of men, women, and non-binary individuals. In this case, the hypothesis would be invalid as not everyone in the group is a woman. 2. Cultural or local events: The gathering could be due to a specific event, such as a festival, parade, or a themed party, that may or may not exclusively involve women. Knowing more about the occasion would be helpful in determining the accuracy of the hypothesis. 3. Performance or entertainment activity: The group could be performers of a public play, musical, or a dance act, which might involve both men and women. Analyzing the details of the performance or act would provide insight into the gender composition of the group. 4. Protests or political events: The individuals gathered might be taking part in a protest, demonstration, or political event that revolves around gender-specific issues. In this case, a thorough understanding of the event and its participants would be fundamental to validate the hypothesis. 5. Gender-exclusive events: If the event in question is specifically tailored to women, then the hypothesis might hold true. Examples of such events could be an all-women's costume contest, a women's rights march, or any occasion that aims to bring together women as the primary participants. In summary, the premise alone is not sufficient to definitively conclude the hypothesis stating that all the people in costumes gathered on a city street are women. To reach an accurate conclusion, we must obtain and analyze additional information, consider possible scenarios, and explore the context surrounding the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the information you found on Google regarding Tycho Brahe's birthplace does not directly answer the question about where he was when he discovered Mars. Tycho Brahe was a Danish astronomer born in Scania in 1546, which was part of Denmark at the time and is now a part of modern-day Sweden. He is known for his precise and accurate astronomical and planetary observations, which provided the basis for the laws of planetary motion formulated by his assistant Johannes Kepler. Regarding the discovery of Mars, it is important to note that Mars had been known since ancient times, so Tycho Brahe did not technically \\"discover\\" the planet. However, he did make important observations about Mars that significantly improved the understanding of its motion and position in the sky.  Tycho Brahe conducted most of his astronomical observations from two observatories - Uraniborg and Stjerneborg - on the island of Hven, now known as Ven, which is located in the Øresund strait between Denmark and Sweden. In 1576, King Frederick II of Denmark granted Tycho the island, where he built his observatories. It was likely at one of these observatories where Tycho Brahe made his important observations of Mars, particularly during the years 1582 to 1585. In summary, Tycho Brahe did not \\"discover\\" Mars as it was known since antiquity, but he made significant observations and collected data about the planet that improved the understanding of its motion.

At age eight, Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.

Transcription factors and RNA polymerase are like helpers that come and see this sign. They then stick to the promoter, and this sticking is called \\"binding.\\" When they are all bound together, they can start the process of making RNA from the DNA, which is called transcription.

Just follow these simple steps and you'll have a lovely frame to display your favorite drawing or picture. Ask your mom or dad to lend a helping hand and gather all the things you need. Let's start! Things You Will Need: - Short wooden boards (for the frame) - A wooden board with a flat surface (as a backing) - Wood glue - C-clamps - 1 inch nails (little pointy metal sticks) - A hammer (to tap the nails) Step-by-step Guide: 1. First things first! Let's start with the wood glue. This is like special glue to make the wood stick together. Choose one of the short boards and put some wood glue on it. This will be like adding butter but on the wood. 2. Now it is time to stick it! Take the wooden board with the flat surface (backing) and press the gluey side of the short board to the top edge of the backing. It's like giving a big hug to the backing! Be gentle, and try not to move it so it will not go out of place. 3. We want the wood to stay together nicely, so we'll use a tool called a C-clamp to hold them together. Put the C-clamp on the short glued board and the backing, squeezing them tightly. This will make sure that the gluey wood hugs the backing for a whole hour. It's like when you hug, but for much much longer! 4. After waiting for an hour, the glue will be all dried up and it's time to make it even stronger! This is where the 1 inch nails (the little pointy metal sticks) come into play. With the help of an adult, use a hammer to tap the nails into both ends of the short board. Remember to be extra careful with the hammer to avoid those tiny fingers!  5. Almost done! We need to add the rest of the short boards around to make the full frame. Just like before, apply wood glue, stick the short boards to the backing, clamp them with a C-clamp, and once the glue is dried, use the nails to secure them. Now you have all the sides like a picture frame! Wow! Look at what you've made, a beautiful wooden frame all by yourself! You should be very proud and show it off. Go ahead, put your favorite drawing or picture in it and hang it on the wall for everyone to see.

Title: Major printing problem. Review: Be cautious when buying this book. There is a printing problem that results in the loss of dots.

This is utterly inexcusable and the publisher should never have distributed a book in this condition. Basic proof reading would have caught the error when converting from old technology to new.My professor says the hardback doesn't have the same problem. (I'm in the market if you've got one.)

The reviewer clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the printing quality of the mathematics book that they purchased. The review highlights a significant issue with the loss of dots, such as periods, primes, decimals, and the dot on a semicolon, which are crucial elements in a mathematics book. The reviewer considers this issue as \\"utterly inexcusable\\" and holds the publisher responsible for not addressing this problem before distributing the book. Furthermore, the reviewer suggests that basic proofreading should have been carried out while converting the book from old technology to new, which would have caught and rectified the error. The fact that their professor mentions the hardback edition does not have the same problem implies that the reviewer's dissatisfaction is specifically with the paperback or another specific edition of the book. The reviewer's decision to return their copy to the bookstore for a refund indicates their discontent with the product. Additionally, the cautionary statement, \\"Be cautious when buying this book,\\" at the beginning of the review serves as a warning to potential buyers about the printing problem. In conclusion, the product review is unquestionably negative, as it points out significant flaws in the printing quality of the mathematics book and raises concerns about the publisher's attention to detail and quality assurance. The reviewer's recommendation for caution when purchasing the book and their choice to return the book for a refund further emphasize their dissatisfaction with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands.

The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates and glires, that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked.

He was allowed to go as soon as he paid.","output":"To determine if the word \\"pay\\" is used in the same way in these two sentences, let's analyze them step by step. Step 1: Identify the meaning of \\"pay\\" in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"Pay a debt,\\" the word \\"pay\\" means to give money or something of value to someone in order to fulfill a financial obligation. In the second sentence, \\"He was allowed to go as soon as he paid,\\" the word \\"paid\\" (the past tense of \\"pay\\") implies giving money or something of value to someone to fulfill an obligation or exchange for goods or services. Step 2: Compare the meanings. Both sentences use \\"pay\\" in a similar way: giving money or something of value to fulfill an obligation or an exchange. The main difference is the context in which they are used. In the first sentence, it specifically refers to a debt, while the second sentence may refer to a variety of obligations or exchanges (such as a bill, fine, or fee).

Hypothesis: People are walking down the street to line up for a show. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise of people walking down a street, we cannot conclusively determine whether the hypothesis that they are lining up for a show is true or not. This is because the premise is quite general and does not provide any specific information about the reasons or motivations behind the people's actions. In order to evaluate the legitimacy of the hypothesis, we would need more information and context. Numerous factors could potentially influence why people are walking down a street, and without additional details, we are unable to decisively support or refute the hypothesis. People might be walking down the street for various reasons, such as commuting, going to a store or restaurant, visiting friends or family, or even just out for a leisurely stroll. To adequately assess whether people are indeed walking down the street to line up for a show, several points of evidence or contextual factors could aid in developing a more concrete conclusion. These may include: 1. Time: Is the time of day consistent with a typical showtime, such as an evening performance, or an atypical time, like a matinee? If the time aligns with common entertainment hours, it could increase the likelihood of the hypothesis being accurate. 2. Location: Is the street near a theater, concert hall, or other venue that regularly hosts shows? The proximity to such establishments could provide evidence supporting the hypothesis, as people may be more inclined to walk down a street near a venue where shows are held. 3. Ticketing: Are people seen holding or purchasing tickets to a known or advertised show? If yes, this would significantly support the hypothesis, as the possession of tickets proves their intention to attend a show. 4. Crowding and Queue Formation: Are people gathering in an organized fashion, such as forming a queue, outside a specific location that is presumably a show venue? The presence of a structured line would lend credibility to the idea that people are lining up for a show. 5. Advertising and Promotion: Are there promotional materials, such as posters or banners, announcing a show or event in the vicinity? Visible marketing efforts might indicate that people are gathering for a show or performance. In summary, while the given premise of people walking down a street does not inherently prove the hypothesis that they are lining up for a show, further contextual information and evidence could either support or refute this proposed idea.

Next, cut the front of the card into puzzle shapes; draw the lines out first if you need to. Try to put them back together again when you are done.  Cards with full images, such as a Christmas scene, work better than cards with a single image or word. Keep your puzzle inside an envelope or empty candy tin. Cut a card in half using the crease as a guide. Cut 25 sheets of paper down to the same size as the card. Sandwich the paper between the front and back covers of the card. Staple the card along the edge: once at each end and once in the middle.  You can use printer paper, binder paper, or sketchbook paper. If you want a nicer finish, use cardstock or thin cardboard for the back of the notebook instead of the back of the card. For a nicer finish, wrap patterned washi tape over the top edge of the notebook to hide the staples. Cut the covers off of 4 vertically-oriented cards. Use an awl or a mini hole punch to poke a series of holes along each of the long edges. Thread a yarn needle with yarn or twine, then sew the long edges together with a blanket or whipstitch to make a block. Use the luminary with LED candles.  Use cards that are from the same event or holiday. Don't mix and match cards, such as birthday and Christmas. Make sure that the cards are all the same size and height, otherwise, the luminary will turn out crooked. Take cards from an event, such as a wedding, and cut the covers off. Glue the cards together to create a rectangle or square. Use a craft blade to cut a hole from the middle a little smaller than a photograph. Choose a photo from the event, then glue it to the back of the frame, so that it shows through the hole. Overlap the cards to create a collaged effect. Choose a ceramic or cork tile, then trace it onto a card. Cut your tracing out, then glue it to the front of the tile with waterproof decoupage glue. Seal the top and edges of the card with more decoupage glue. Let the glue dry, then add a second coat.

Now the mother-daughter team have collaborated for the first time on a new series called \\"Dixie O'Day\\", written by Hughes and illustrated by Vulliamy, with the first book to be published in September 2013.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use this fact to answer the question: moving an object from a cool place to a warm place causes the object 's temperature to increase When you put a cold sandwich in the microwave, it will pick from the following. (1). stay the same; (2). escalate in temperature; (3). decrease in temperature; (4). Die; The answer is:","output":"(2). escalate in temperature When you put a cold sandwich in the microwave, its temperature will escalate or increase. This is because the microwave is specifically designed to heat food, and it has a much higher temperature than your cold sandwich. The microwave generates microwave radiation that heats the water molecules in the food, causing them to rotate and generate thermal energy that evenly cooks and warms your sandwich. As you have mentioned, moving an object from a cool place (cold sandwich) to a warm place (microwave) causes the object's temperature to increase. The heat from the warmer environment is transferred to the object, causing the object to warm up, which is the core principle of heat transfer. In this case, your cold sandwich is absorbing heat from the microwave, which is causing it to escalate in temperature. This is a demonstration of the principle of thermal equilibrium, in which heat flows from areas of higher temperature to areas of lower temperature until they eventually even out. To ensure the best possible heating results for your sandwich, you can follow these tips: 1. Use microwave-safe containers or plates. Avoid using metal containers or aluminum foil, as these can cause arcing and damage the microwave. Glass, ceramic, and microwave-safe plastics are suitable. 2. Arrange your sandwich evenly on the plate and avoid piling the ingredients too high, as this may result in uneven heating. 3. Experiment with your microwave's power settings and heating times to find the most effective combination for heating your sandwich. Start with shorter intervals, checking the sandwich's temperature, and working your way up to ensure even heating without drying it out. In conclusion, when you put a cold sandwich in the microwave, its temperature will escalate, or increase, due to the transfer of heat from the warm environment of the microwave to the cooler sandwich. This process ensures that your sandwich is heated evenly and reaches the desired temperature for consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What genre of music  did Loudest Whisper debut on a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of 33 ⁄ rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification?","output":"Loudest Whisper, an Irish folk rock band predominantly active in the 1970s, made their debut on a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of 33 1⁄3 RPM, a 12 or 10-inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and the use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Their music falls under a unique blend of genres, most notably combining elements of folk, rock, and Celtic influences.  Led by the creative genius of Brian O'Reilly, Loudest Whisper began their musical journey in the early 1970s. Their first album, titled \\"The Children of Lir,\\" debuted in 1974 and was primarily rooted in Irish folk music. The album was an ambitious rock opera based on the ancient Irish myth of the four children of Lir who were turned into swans by their stepmother. It masterfully combined elements of traditional Irish folk, Celtic music, and psychedelic progressive rock. The music was characterized by lilting melodies, impressive harmonies, and poetic lyrics that capture the imagination of the listener. Throughout their career, Loudest Whisper would go on to experiment with various other styles and influences, including blues-rock, jazz, and classical music. Their eclectic and innovative approach to music-making helped them remain relevant and garnered them a dedicated cult following. As for the format of their first vinyl release, 33 1⁄3 RPM 12-inch records were the industry standard during this time and would have been the typical choice for such an album. The \\"microgroove\\" groove specification, which was developed in the late 1940s, allowed for greater fidelity and longer playing times. This technological advancement enabled artists like Loudest Whisper to create intricate, multi-layered compositions that could be enjoyed in a high-quality format. In summary, Loudest Whisper debuted with their unique blend of folk, rock, and Celtic music on a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of 33 1⁄3 RPM, a 12-inch diameter, and the use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Their innovative style and captivating storytelling through their music have cemented their status as an influential act in the folk-rock genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that revealed locations that had similar sites to the one that academics wanted to include in a joint commission? ?  During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here. Brzezinski further stated: The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents.

Article: At the invitation of the United States government, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent a team of observers to monitor the presidential elections in 2004. It was the first time the OSCE had sent observers to a U.S. presidential election, although they had been invited in the past. In September 2004 the OSCE issued a report on U.S. electoral processes and the election final report. The report reads: \\"The November 2, 2004 elections in the United States mostly met the OSCE commitments included in the 1990 Copenhagen Document. They were conducted in an environment that reflects a long-standing democratic tradition, including institutions governed by the rule of law, free and generally professional media, and a civil society intensively engaged in the election process. There was exceptional public interest in the two leading presidential candidates and the issues raised by their respective campaigns, as well as in the election process itself.\\" Now answer this question: What were the findings of the OSCE team?","output":"The findings of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) team that observed the 2004 U.S. presidential election were largely positive, as presented in their report issued in September 2004. The main conclusions drawn from their observation were as follows: 1. The elections mostly met the OSCE commitments: The 2004 U.S. presidential election was found to be mostly in accordance with the OSCE commitments outlined in the 1990 Copenhagen Document. This signifies that the election was considered to be free and fair, with processes aligned with international standards and democratic principles. 2. Long-standing democratic tradition: The OSCE team recognized that the elections took place in an environment reflecting the United States' well-established democratic tradition. This includes the existence of strong institutions governed by the rule of law, which helped ensure the credibility and legitimacy of the electoral process. 3. Free and professional media: The report highlighted the role of free and generally professional media during the election, ensuring a broader dissemination of information to the public. This contributed to maintaining transparency and openness throughout the process, allowing the electorate to make informed decisions. 4. Active civil society: The OSCE team also took note of the significant engagement of the civil society in the election process. This engagement is crucial for fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility among the citizens and for promoting an inclusive and participatory democratic process. 5. Exceptional public interest: There was remarkable public interest in the two leading presidential candidates, their campaigns, and the issues they raised. The report indicates that the election process itself was also a point of significant interest and attention among the general public, revealing a heightened level of political awareness and involvement. In summary, the OSCE team's findings on the 2004 U.S. presidential election indicate that it was conducted in a manner that adhered to the majority of the OSCE commitments and in an environment reflecting long-standing democratic traditions. The election was marked by free and professional media coverage, active civil society participation, and exceptional public interest in both the candidates and the electoral process itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason for this is that the filters, also known as nephrons, within the kidneys clean and filter the blood by removing waste products and excess substances. When there is less blood flow to the kidneys, the filters have fewer waste products and substances to process. This perturbation would have a negative effect on the kidneys' ability to remove waste products effectively. Since there is less blood passing through the filters, the overall amount of waste captured is reduced.

In both places, you are building tension throughout the story by releasing information little by little, until you reach the climax. However, in fiction, it’s all about the story, whereas in nonfiction, the story may be secondary to other essential information. Whether you are writing a short story or a novel, having a plan will help you get started.  Outline how characters meet and what happens to move the plot along. Outlining your fiction will help you make sure your work continues moving at a steady pace. What will be the crux of the story? What is its central point?

A climax could be a sudden realization, a couple coming together, a car crash, a death, etc. Make sure your climax flows naturally with the story.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Ivor Parry Evans ( February 20 , 1923 , ( Aliquippa , Pennsylvania ) -- October 24 , 2009 ( Abilene , Texas ) was a United States Air Force officer and commander .  - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'ivor parry evans' with the relationship of 'conflict'.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: To make a calzone taste better pick from the following. A). Brush it with milk before baking B). Brush it with soy sauce before baking","output":"To make a calzone taste better, you might consider brushing it with milk before baking. While soy sauce can add an interesting flavor, it might not be what you are looking for when preparing a calzone. The following is a detailed breakdown of why option A (brushing it with milk) might be a better choice for enhancing the taste of your calzone. A) Brush it with milk before baking: 1. Browning and texture: Brushing your calzone with milk prior to baking can help achieve a golden-brown color and a crispy texture on the crust. The milk reacts with the sugars in the dough through the Maillard reaction, which results in a beautiful browning effect. This visual appeal adds to the overall enjoyment of the dish, and the improved texture makes it even more delightful to bite into. 2. Flavor: Milk has a subtle sweetness that can complement the savory flavors inside your calzone. It does not overwhelm the other ingredients but rather balances their flavors. Moreover, the fats in the milk can tenderize the crust, leading to a more pleasant mouth-feel. 3. Customizability: Milk is a neutral base that you can easily customize by mixing in other ingredients like melted butter, minced garlic, or herbs to create a flavored wash that resonates with the calzone's filling. This added layer of flavor complexity makes the calzone taste even better, appealing to all your taste buds. While brushing with soy sauce before baking (option B) could add a more exotic taste to your calzone, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks: 1. Overpowering flavor: Soy sauce has a strong umami and salty taste, which could potentially overpower the flavors of the other ingredients in your calzone. In addition, it is not a traditional ingredient in Italian cuisine, so incorporating it may deviate from the original essence of a calzone. 2. Salt content: One of the main concerns with using soy sauce is its high sodium content, which could make your calzone too salty, especially if you already have salty ingredients in the filling (like cheese or cured meats). A calzone brushed with soy sauce might not cater to everyone's taste, as it significantly deviates from the traditional calzone flavor profile. In conclusion, brushing your calzone with milk before baking is a better choice to enhance its taste, as it adds a subtle sweetness, helps to achieve a golden-brown crust, and allows for easy flavor customization. Although soy sauce might seem like an interesting alternative, it could overpower the dish and deviate from the classic calzone taste."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He stopped doing all of his homework after he rejected Sally","output":"Title: \\"Late Assignments and Broken Hearts\\" Plot Summary: High school junior George suddenly stops doing his homework after his romantic life takes a dramatic turn for the worse upon rejecting the advances of Sally, a sensitive and misunderstood classmate. As George continues to struggle in school, he begins to unravel the intricate web of emotions behind his actions, leading to a heartwarming story of self-discovery, forgiveness, and finding love in unexpected places. Act One: George is an average high school student who has always managed to remain organized and diligent in his schoolwork. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when Sally, an introverted classmate with a crush on him, musters the courage to confess her feelings to him. Though she tries to be understanding, she is heartbroken when George decides not to pursue a romantic relationship with her. Embarrassed and feeling vulnerable, Sally distances herself from George. The fallout from this rejection has an unexpected impact on George. He finds himself unable to concentrate on his schoolwork, and for the first time, he begins to fall behind on his homework. As the weeks go by, his once immaculate grades start to suffer, and his teachers take notice of the sudden change. Act Two: Despite several attempts by his teachers and friends to help him get back on track, George continues to spiral downwards. He becomes lost in his thoughts, trying to understand why he rejected Sally and why he can no longer find the motivation to do his schoolwork. The once diligent student is now plagued by tardiness, incomplete assignments, and constant daydreaming. Eventually, George finds himself in the principal's office, where he is confronted with the harsh reality of his academic decline. The principal warns him that if he doesn't turn things around immediately, he risks being suspended or even expelled. This ultimatum leaves George desperate to figure out the root of his sudden lack of motivation. Still haunted by his rejection of Sally, George seeks guidance from his best friend, Maya, who helps him realize that he may have had deeper feelings for Sally than he initially thought. As they spend more time together, Maya provides her own secret feelings for George, causing him to question his emotions and actions even more. Act Three: With his newfound understanding of his emotional turmoil, George finds the courage to approach Sally and apologize for his past actions. He details how her rejection weighed heavily on his mind, causing him to lose focus on everything else in his life. Although he can't promise her an immediate romantic relationship, he admits that he now wants to get to know her better. Defensively at first, Sally questions George's intentions, but as they open up to each other, she starts to realize he is sincere. They agree to start afresh as friends and attempt to salvage any hope of a future relationship. In the meantime, George refocuses on his academics and begins to turn his grades around. With the support of Sally, Maya, and his teachers, he gradually regains the motivation and determination that had once defined him. As friendship and trust grow between George and Sally, they discover they have more in common than they initially thought. Eventually, as the school year comes to an end, George and Sally find themselves falling in love. Epilogue: Through self-discovery and the help of friends and teachers, George and Sally learn valuable lessons about vulnerability, understanding, and the importance of second chances. As they walk hand in hand toward their bright futures, they leave behind a legacy at their high school - one of love, resilience, and the power of forgiveness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  While Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy, \\"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\\"Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a 3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \\"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with ... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono ... That ain't bad picking.\\"Along with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with... Answer:","output":"McCartney. Based on the context provided, Lennon had a musical rivalry with Paul McCartney."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is not possible to tell if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Sentence 1 states: \\"and slash it with the red pen.\\" Sentence 2 states: \\"Slash it multiple times with the red pen.\\" The first sentence informs us that an action (\\"slash\\") should be performed using a specific object (\\"the red pen\\"). However, it does not indicate the number of times this action takes place. It could be a single slash or multiple slashes. On the other hand, the second sentence clearly mentions that the action should be performed multiple times using the red pen. Therefore, while both sentences share the same action and object, they differ in the number of times the action occurs.

The premise states that there's a baby girl in a light blue and pink dress, leaning on a stone platform outdoors.  Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis.

Step 4: Evaluate if the hypothesis is entirely consistent with the premise. A stone platform is not explicitly stated to be a porch in the premise. While it's possible that the stone platform could be part of a porch, there's not enough information to confidently conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise.

Celebrations: Corey Brown, 20, escaped being tagged so he can go out for his 21st birthday and over Christmas. A judge agreed not to fit a criminal with an electronic tag because of his 21st birthday plans – and that only a ‘tyrant’ would impose such a punishment. Corey Brown had been ordered to do 150 hours of community service for his role in the theft of a pensioner’s car, but when he failed to turn up for the work sessions five times  he was hauled back into court to be given a  curfew and an electronic tag. But he was spared after complaining that the punishment would ruin his plans for a night out on his 21st birthday. Recorder David Hall told a stunned courtroom: ‘It would be a tyrant who tagged someone on their 21st birthday and at Christmas.’ Turning to Brown– who had sat smirking throughout the hearing at Warwick Crown Court – Recorder Hall then said: ‘If I give you seven more hours [of community service] to do, and you keep out of trouble, is that a fair deal?’ Brown, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, simply nodded, and then walked free from court. Yesterday, victims’ groups reacted furiously to the decision, saying it would ‘undermine confidence in the criminal justice system’. In March, Brown was given a 36-week jail sentence, suspended for two years, and 150 hours’ community service after he was caught with the keys of a Lexus that had been stolen from a  70-year-old woman. The £30,000 car had been used in a series of raids on shops in the Coundon area of Coventry in November last year. When police raided Brown’s home, they discovered the keys hidden in his bedpost. Brown admitted handling stolen goods. Punishment: Corey Brown, 20, escaped with seven hours additional unpaid work after repeatedly missing probation sessions. But after failing to turn up for his. community service placements on five occasions, on Monday he was brought. back into court – which could have seen him sent straight to prison to. carry out his original 36-week sentence. The court heard that Brown, who lives. with his grandmother, had also missed three sessions of a ‘Thinking. Skills’ programme that he had been ordered to complete. Despite this,. his lawyer asked the court to be lenient, because Brown was about to. celebrate his birthday. Annabel Hamilton, defending, told the. court: ‘He is very reluctant to have a curfew because of his 21st. birthday and Christmas coming up.’ To the astonishment of court staff,. Recorder Hall agreed to go easy on Brown, and told him he would not be. fitted with a tag – which alerts police if offenders leave their homes. during curfew hours. And Brown – who has already been to prison three times – admitted that even he was surprised he had been let off. He said: ‘I was expecting to get a. tag for missing my probation dates. Technically, they should have. activated my prison sentence. But the judge told me I’d done well so. far. He said he didn’t see the point. ‘Thanks to the judge, I can enjoy a few drinks for my birthday, instead of being stuck in with my gran or in prison.’ When asked why he had not turned up. to do his community service, he replied: ‘I don’t know; just didn’t. think about it. I didn’t care. ‘I suppose I did see the whole thing as a bit of a joke.’ As he prepared to celebrate his 21st. birthday yesterday, Brown added: ‘I’ve been to jail three times and I. haven’t learned a thing. ‘I’ve already told the judge that. jail doesn’t work for me. What’s the point of sending me to prison now?’ Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim  Support, said: ‘Tough community. sentences can work in stopping  reoffending, but there need to be. consequences if offenders repeatedly break them. ‘If that means disrupting a criminal’s enjoyment of the festive season, then so be it. ‘Otherwise decisions like these could undermine victims’ confidence in the justice system.’ A court insider said: ‘It was obvious the judge was feeling warm-hearted in the run-up to Christmas. ‘But it did leave the solicitors a little surprised, considering the defendant’s record.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Inside the Bay's 60-million bid to take on Amazon Hudson's Bay Company CEO Jerry Storch is beyond excited. Even though his chief of logistics is supposed to be leading the media tour of the retailer's new high-tech e-commerce warehouse, Storch can't resist adding his two cents at every turn. \\"It takes 15 minutes from the time we get an order till it can be out the door,\\" he proudly tells the visitors at the 750,000-square-foot facility in Toronto's east end. \\"That's astounding.\\" When the group reaches columns of three-storey-high shelving, an enthusiastic Storch describes the robotic system that zooms up and down, searching out merchandise and delivering it to the workers who will box it up. \\"When the robots are going down, they're recharging their own batteries, from the friction against the walls,\\" he says. The Bay has spent 60 million on this \\"Perfect Pick\\" system. Goods purchased on its website will be packed and shipped from here. Company officials say it's the most advanced technology of its kind in Canada. The Bay's new 'fulfilment centre' is the size of 15 football fields. (CBC) It's all part of Storch's grand ambition to make North America's oldest company the champion of retail's newest frontier — e-commerce. \\"Nobody will beat us on the internet,\\" Storch declares. \\"Nobody.\\" But the reality is the Bay is getting soundly beaten on the internet. Walmart and Best Buy's Canadian sites get more monthly visits, according to web traffic analysis done by SimilarWeb. So does Canadian Tire's website, which doesn't even offer delivery. Customers can only reserve merchandise online and then have to visit a Canadian Tire store to pick it up. A worker unloads merchandise in the Bay's new e-commerce warehouse (CBC) But the king of Canadian e-commerce is American giant Amazon. Its Canadian site is No. 1, and its American site, Amazon.com, ranks higher than any other international retailer operating in Canada. \\"In a very short period of time, Amazon has been able to amass a simply astonishing level of market share,\\" says Ontario-based retail consultant Doug Stephens, author of the upcoming book Re-engineering Retail. \\"It's really leaving its competitors in its wake.\\" Stephens says Amazon is more than a retailer — it's an innovation, data and technology company all rolled into one, which spends billions on research and development. He says no retailer in Canada even comes close in terms of energy and money poured into e-commerce. \\"For a long time, Canadian retailers just sort of shrugged their shoulders about e-commerce. They didn't think it was that big of a deal. Now all of the sudden, along comes Amazon and the tables have turned,\\" Stephens says. \\"I think they've recognized that e-commerce is the future and that someone else is capitalizing on that future, and it's not them.\\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signs a robot at Amazon's new warehouse west of Toronto, which it also calls a fulfilment centre. The Bay wants to challenge Amazon's e-commerce supremacy in Canada. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press) Stephens says it would be a mistake to count out the Bay, partly because it has something Amazon doesn't: physical stores. \\"They have a distribution network that's already built, and these stores could be repurposed to become distribution hubs,\\" he says. \\"It's a huge advantage.\\" Online shoppers who want to return or exchange a product may prefer to visit a store instead of paying postage to make a return via mail, the way Amazon customers do on some purchases. Not surprisingly, the Bay's CEO also sees bricks and mortar locations as important because the retailer can offer its customers two different shopping experiences. \\"The stores are a huge competitive advantage and a lot of internet retailers are only starting to wake up to that now,\\" Storch says. \\"Our dressing rooms are our No. 1 competitive advantage in the world. The ability to go to the room and try it on and make sure you have the right size, it's huge. Returns on the internet are very high.\\" Amazon has been experimenting with pop-up stores, and is reportedly considering opening retail locations specializing in groceries, books and fashion. \\"Amazon is a great competitor,\\" Storch says. \\"But so are we.\\" The Bay is ready for e-commerce7:52 What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Hudson's Bay Company, the oldest company in North America, has invested 60m in a high-tech, 750,000 sq ft e-commerce warehouse in Toronto to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.

Soon after, relatives Ralph and Helen arrive with their children, hoping for a chance at the fortune. Thinking Walter is also after it, they threaten to take him to the Orphanage, making him run away.

A:","output":"The original character of the terrifying clown Pennywise in the 1990 miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's \\"It\\" was portrayed by British actor Tim Curry. Tim Curry, born on April 19, 1946, in Grappenhall, Cheshire, England, is a renowned actor with a career spanning several decades and encompassing theatre, film, and television. Before taking on the iconic role of Pennywise the Dancing Clown, Curry gained recognition for his performance as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the cult classic \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" (1975). Throughout the years, he has delivered memorable performances in various productions, such as \\"Annie\\" (1982), \\"Legend\\" (1985), \\"Clue\\" (1985), and \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" (1990), to name a few. In Stephen King's \\"It\\" miniseries, Curry's portrayal of Pennywise left a lasting impression on audiences, garnering him significant praise for his ability to depict the evil, supernatural being's sinister nature. The miniseries, directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, is based on King's 1986 novel and focuses on a group of friends known as the Losers Club, who reunite as adults to destroy the malevolent force that terrorized them during their childhood in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. Curry's interpretation of Pennywise is characterized by his distinctive physical appearance, unsettling laugh, and ability to take on different forms to prey on the fears of his victims. His performance marked a significant milestone in the horror genre and has been referenced in countless pop culture moments since the release of the miniseries. In the more recent adaptations of \\"It,\\" directed by Andy Muschietti and released as a two-part film series in 2017 and 2019, the role of Pennywise is played by Swedish actor Bill Skarsgård. Bill's performance also received critical acclaim, and he too succeeded in making a distinct impact on the horror genre with his interpretation of the malicious clown. Despite the differences in their respective portrayals, both Tim Curry and Bill Skarsgård managed to provide unforgettable visuals and deliver the terror that made Pennywise an iconic character in the world of horror fiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As we all know, children are our future, and it's up to us to arm them with the tools to succeed. Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \\"Will home schools really work for my children?\\" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.) Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college. One study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons. For more home schooling information, call us today toll free at (1800)542-8668.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art? Options:  A. after viewing the ocean  B. before the museum opens  C. before work from ancient Rome  D. not enough information A:","output":"C. before work from ancient Rome"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

But tens of thousands of Americans this year sought a very different kind of item on what is expected to be the biggest shopping weekend of 2015: guns.      Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman Stephen Fischer confirmed to Fortune that there were 185,345 background checks on November 27, easily beating the previous all time high of 177,170 on December 21, 2012, which was shortly after the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut.      The FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data are widely considered to be the best proxy for gun sales.      With last week’s big jump, four out of the 11 biggest days ever for background checks were on a Black Friday. On the same day last year, the FBI conducted 175,754 checks.      Big retailers such as Cabela’s and Sportsman’s Warehouse were advertising deals for guns heading into Black Friday. ||||| CLOSE More Americans had their backgrounds checked purchasing guns on Black Friday than any day on record, according to data released by the FBI this week.

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System processed 185,345 requests on Nov. 27, one of the largest retail sales days in the country.      \\"This was an approximate 5% increase over the 175,754 received on Black Friday 2014,\\" wrote Stephen Fischer, the FBI's chief of multimedia productions. \\"The previous high for receipts were the 177,170 received on 12/21/2012.\\"      Previous spikes for background checks, conducted before a gun buyer can obtain a firearm, occurred after prominent mass shootings, like in December 2012 in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.      Other Black Friday shopping days in 2014, 2013 and 2012 occupied the FBI's \\"top 10\\" list of the most background checks processed in a 24-hour period.      Since 1998, FBI data shows that the bureau has processed requests for more than 220 million firearm purchases.      Licensed sellers deny sales to failed background checks based on a variety of factors including criminal backgrounds, domestic violence convictions or restraining orders.      Friday's purchases came the same day as the mass shooting incident in Colorado Springs that killed three people and injured nine others.      On Saturday, President Obama called for tighter controls of \\"weapons of war\\" in the wake of the Planned Parenthood shooting.      \\"This is not normal,\\" Obama said. \\"We can't let it become normal.

Article: After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world. Now answer this question: What is a common Attic-based dialect?","output":"A common Attic-based dialect refers to Koine Greek, a standardized and widely spoken form of the Greek language that emerged during the Hellenistic period. The term \\"Attic-based\\" indicates that this dialect was primarily rooted in the Attic Greek, the dialect spoken in the city of Athens and its surrounding region, Attica. The formation of Koine Greek as a common dialect was a direct result of the widespread expansion and cultural influence of the Greek world under the reign of Alexander the Great and his successors. As Greek culture, ideas, and language spread throughout newly established Hellenistic kingdoms in Asia, Africa, and Southwest Asia, there was a need for a shared language to facilitate communication between people originating from different Greek regions and cities. Koine Greek evolved from Attic Greek, incorporating elements from other Greek dialects as well, and became the lingua franca of the Hellenistic world. This enabled people from various Greek territories to interact, trade, and share ideas through a common language. The use of Koine Greek also allowed for the transmission of Greek literature, philosophy, and scientific knowledge to a wider audience, significantly shaping the cultural landscape of the Hellenistic period. Major Hellenistic cities and cultural centers such as Alexandria, Antioch, Pergamon, and Seleucia played a crucial role in spreading the use of Koine Greek throughout the various Hellenistic kingdoms, further solidifying its importance as a common Attic-based dialect during this era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The heads of government were the shoguns. Each was a member of the Ashikaga clan.  - Biography. Yamana Szen was born to Yamana Tokihiro (13671435), head of the Yamana clan. Tokihiro was the \\"shugo\\" governor of Tajima, Bingo, Aki, and Iga provinces. Tokihiro, who was often in bad health, retired in 1433 and passed his numerous lands to Szen. Szen went on to defeat Akamatsu Mitsuhide (13731441) in the Kakitsu Incident, and became governor Harima Province the same year.  - The in the history of Japan was a family who controlled the hereditary title of \\"shikken\\" (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate between 1203 and 1333. Despite the title, in practice the family wielded actual governmental power during this period compared to both the Kamakura shoguns, or the Imperial Court in Kyoto, whose authority was largely symbolic. The Hj are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hj rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate.  - Moronao was an iconoclast with no intention of following tradition, particularly insofar as the Emperor was concerned. On the subject, he once said:  What is the use of a King? Why should he live in a Palace? And why should we bow to him? If for some reason a King is needed, let us have one made of wood or metal, and let all the live Kings be banished. The Taiheiki, an epic dedicated to the events of this period, describes the K brothers as avid villains. Moronao in particular is accused of violence, greed and lewdness. Because of this reputation, in the \\"bunraku\\" and \\"kabuki\\" play \\"Kanadehon Chshingura\\", which depicts the vendetta of the 47 Ronin, his name is used to represent Kira Yoshinaka.  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - On the August 16, 1443 (\\"Kakitsu 3, 21st day of the 7th month\\"), 10-year-old shogun Yoshikatsu died of injuries sustained in a fall from a horse. He had been shogun for only three years. Immediately, the \\"bakufu\\" elevated Yoshinari, the young shogun's even younger brother, to be the new shogun. Several years after becoming shogun, Yoshinari changed his name to Yoshimasa, by which name he is better known.  - A was the military dictator of Japan during the period from 1185 to 1868 (with exceptions). In most of this period, the shoguns were the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the country; although nominally they were appointed by the Emperor as a ceremonial formality. The Shogun held almost absolute power over territories through military means. Nevertheless, an unusual situation occurred in the Kamakura period (11991333) upon the death of the first shogun, whereby the Hj clan's hereditary titles of \\"shikken\\" (1199-1256) and \\"tokus\\" (12561333) monopolized the shogunate as dictatorial positions, collectively known as the . The shogun during this 134-year period met the same fate as the Emperor and was reduced to a figurehead until a coup in 1333, when the Shogun was restored to power in the name of the Emperor.  - During the Edo Period of Japanese history, the Ak Domain (fief) was part of Harima. The Forty-seven Ronin were samurai of the Ak han. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, a shipbuilder and major Boeing engine subcontractor gets its name from the province.  - Originally, from 1219 until 1333, the post was synonymous with the \\"Rokuhara Tandai\\", and was based in Kyoto. The Hj clan monopolized this post, and there were during this period two Deputies - a southern chief, and a northern chief. From 1336 to 1367, the Deputy was called . The first to hold this title was K no Moronao.  - Name. In Japanese, the city has been called Ky, Miyako, or Ky no Miyako. In the 11th century, the city was renamed Kyoto (\\"capital city\\"), after the Chinese word for capital city, '. After the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo (meaning \\"Eastern Capital\\") in 1868, and the seat of the Emperor was transferred there, Kyoto was known for a short time as Saiky (meaning \\"Western Capital\\").  - Hosokawa Katsumoto (   , 1430 -- June 6 , 1473 ) was one of the Kanrei , the Deputies to the Shogun , during Japan 's Muromachi period . He is famous for his involvement in the creation of Ryan - ji , a temple famous for its rock garden , and for his involvement in the nin War , which sparked the 130 - year Sengoku period . His conflicts with his father - in - law , Yamana Szen , who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei , were among those that ignited the nin War in 1467 . When the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464 , Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further , supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate . Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Shogun 's brother Ashikaga Yoshimi , and supported his claim to the shogunate . In 1467 , open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto , between Hosokawa and Yamana , who each commanded roughly 80,000 men . The Shogun declared that the first to make war in the capital would be branded a rebel , and so the two armies remained immobile for some time , but within a few months , the tensions had risen too far , and war simply could not be delayed any further . Hosokawa made the first obvious attack within the capital , attacking the mansion of a Yamana general by the name of Isshiki . Fighting erupted between the two camps , and over the course of the next few days , many were killed , and many buildings destroyed , either by the soldiers or by looters . Each army gradually carved out a section of the city that they held and defended against the other ; Hosokawa 's army came to be known as the Eastern Army , as Yamana 's so - called \`\` Western Army '' controlled western sections of Kyoto . But not all the fighting took place within the city ; Hosokawa sent men onto the main roads , and into Yamana 's home provinces , to prevent his reinforcements from reaching the main battles . Though Hosokawa attacked first , he convinced the Shogun to brand Yamana , not himself , with the stigma of being a rebel against the Shogunate . He even...  - Life. Yoshimi was the abbot of a Jdo monastery when he was first approached in 1464 by Hosokawa Katsumoto, who wished to support a bid for Yoshimi to become shogun. He originally sought to stick to his religious life, and had no desires to become shogun. However, by 1464, he was convinced to join his brother, the shogun, and assist him, putting himself into a position to be the next in the line of succession. The birth of the Shogun's son placed Yoshimi in an awkward situation, making his succession no longer definite, but he remained as Yoshimasa's Deputy.  - The was a Japanese samurai clan which was one of the most powerful of the Muromachi period (1336-1467); at its peak, members of the family held the position of Constable (\\"shugo\\") over eleven provinces. Originally from Kzuke Province, and later centered in Inaba province, the clan claimed descendance from the Seiwa Genji line, and from Minamoto no Yoshishige in particular. The clan took its name from the village of Yamana in present-day Gunma Prefecture. They were valued retainers under Minamoto no Yoritomo, and counted among his \\"gokenin\\".  - The was a civil war that lasted from 1467 to 1477, during the Muromachi period in Japan. \\"nin\\" refers to the Japanese era during which the war was fought. A dispute between Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Szen escalated into a nationwide war involving the Ashikaga shogunate and a number of \\"daimys\\" in many regions of Japan.  -  Events of the \\"nin\\" era. The \\"nin War\\": This conflict began as a controversy over who should follow Ashikaga Yoshimasa as shogun after his retirement  whether it would be his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa); but this succession dispute was merely a pretext for rival groups of \\"daimys\\" to fight in a struggle for military supremacy.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below . Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme is highly specific for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective. A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form.  Now, I have a new situation: A scientist is testing chemical reactions. At first he tries mixing two chemicals together at a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius and labels it Trial A. He records the time for the reaction to complete at 2 minutes. Knowing that this isn't the temperature users at home will be combining the chemicals at he tries the reaction again at a more modest 65 degrees Celsius and labels this trial B.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed?  The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity.

In this sentence, it's being asked if \\"they\\" had any clue about something. If not, the situation would be considered an undiscovered crime. Sentence 2: Did they seriously think it would remain under wraps? This sentence is asking if \\"they\\" believed the situation would remain hidden or under wraps.

From the 3rd century BC onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Sangam literature in southern India started to flourish. Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BC and was exported to foreign countries. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years, among which the Gupta Empire stands out. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or \\"Golden Age of India\\". During this period, aspects of Indian civilization, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE. Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia which led to the establishment of Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia (Greater India).

Established by Chandragupta Maurya in 321 BCE, the Maurya Empire grew to become one of the largest and most powerful empires in ancient India, stretching from the Indus River in the west to the Brahmaputra River in the east, and from the Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. The empire reached its peak under the rule of Ashoka the Great, who ruled from 268 to 232 BCE. During this time, the Maurya Empire played a crucial role in shaping political, economic, and cultural developments on the Indian subcontinent, as well as spreading aspects of Indian civilization, administration, culture, and religion to other parts of Asia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Randy thought the US should build a wall on the border but Craig disagreed.","output":"Randy thought the US should build a wall on the border, but Craig disagreed, arguing that there were more effective, compassionate, and economical solutions to address the issues of immigration and security. Craig contended that investing in technology and improving the existing infrastructure at border checkpoints would result in better control and management of the flow of people and goods across the border. By implementing smart surveillance systems, biometric technologies, and employing more border patrol agents, security measures could be significantly enhanced without relying on a physical barrier. Moreover, Craig believed that working collaboratively with neighboring countries and addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities, would create lasting change. He proposed that the US should support and invest in programs that foster economic development, education, and stability in the countries where most immigrants originate, thereby reducing their need to leave their homes in search of a better life. In addition, Craig expressed concern about the potential damage to the environment and wildlife that a wall could cause in delicate border ecosystems, which include rivers, mountains, and deserts. These areas are home to numerous native plant and animal species that rely on habitat connectivity to survive, and a continuous wall could lead to habitat fragmentation and loss of biodiversity. Finally, Craig emphasized the importance of upholding human rights and dignity in border policy decisions. He argued that a wall could symbolize exclusion and discrimination, further dividing communities and sending a negative message to the rest of the world. Instead, he said that the US should focus on promoting understanding, tolerance, and cooperation, while working on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses issues such as family separation, pathways to citizenship, and a fair, transparent visa system. Throughout their conversation, Randy and Craig shared their differing perspectives and sought to find common ground in the complex, deeply-rooted issue of immigration and border security. Although they did not come to an agreement on building the wall, their open exchange of ideas paved the way for productive discussions and possible compromises in the future."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  I am facing a new situation today: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor.

Write an article based on this summary: A partial truce brokered by the US and Russia in Syria came into effect at sunset on Monday, the beginning of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.","output":"Title: Partial Truce Arrives in Syria for Eid al-Adha Celebration: A Peek into the US and Russia's Collaborative Efforts Introduction The US and Russia, two major players in the global political arena, have been working tirelessly to establish a truce in Syria as a way to ease the crippling effects of the ongoing war. On Monday, a partial truce brokered by these two powerful nations came into effect at sunset, coinciding with the beginning of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha. In this article, we will examine the background of the Syrian conflict, analyze the efforts by the US and Russia for implementing a truce, and assess the potential outcomes of this significant development. Background of the Syrian Conflict The Syrian civil war began in 2011 as pro-democracy protests against President Bashar al-Assad's regime and has since escalated into a complex and multi-layered conflict. It has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of Syrians, leading to one of the most devastating humanitarian crises of the modern era. The war has been further complicated by the involvement of numerous external forces, including the US-led coalition, which fights against the Islamic State (ISIS) and supports rebel forces, and the Russian Federation, which backs the Assad regime. Efforts for Establishing a Truce Despite the vast differences between the US and Russia's geopolitical interests in Syria, both countries have made concerted efforts to negotiate and implement a ceasefire in recent years. Their motivation for this collaboration, in part, stems from a desire to reduce the overall level of violence and alleviate the humanitarian crisis. Additionally, these efforts allow the two countries to exert their influence and maintain control over their respective interests in the Middle East, while providing a pathway for potential cooperation against more extreme militant groups, notably ISIS. The newly brokered partial truce between Russia and the US at the eve of Eid al-Adha signifies an important development in the ongoing efforts to bring about stability in Syria. The truce is expected to prepare ground for a broader and more robust ceasefire in the region that serves as a prelude for peace talks and eventual political settlement. Impact and Potential Outcomes While the partial truce is focused on saving innocent civilian lives and easing the suffering in the conflict-ridden region, many uncertainties remain about its long-term success. One of the major challenges to maintaining the truce is the propensity for breaches and violations from all sides involved. Additionally, the exclusion of certain extremist groups from the truce could further complicate the security situation in the region. The fragmented nature of the Syrian conflict has posed significant difficulties in organizing and implementing a coherent and comprehensive truce, hence the partial approach adopted in this instance. However, the truce's commencement on the eve of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha presents a deeply symbolic moment. It provides a sense of optimism and a window of opportunity for reflecting on the importance of peace and the need for unity in pursuing an end to the devastating conflict. The peaceful celebration of Eid across the war-torn nation could potentially promote a greater sense of understanding among the warring factions and motivate them to work towards lasting peace. Conclusion The ongoing Syrian conflict and its repercussions on the global scene have weighed heavily on the conscience of the international community over the past decade. The partial truce brokered by the US and Russia in Syria, coinciding with the beginning of the religious festival of Eid al-Adha, showcases the persistent efforts by these major players in attempting to resolve the crisis. While the road to lasting peace in Syria remains fraught with challenges, this truce signifies a beacon of hope amidst an environment dominated by violence and despair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade. The vice minister’s remarks came shortly after the North abruptly canceled... Question: What did the vice minister probably think about the US wanting North Korea to disband the nuclear arsenal? Options: - he was not caring either way   - He probably completely disagreed   - not enough information   - he partly agreed === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"He probably completely disagreed. The vice minister's statement criticized the \\"unbridled remarks\\" made by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who demanded that North Korea completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, ballistic missile program, and chemical weapons stockpile before receiving any compensation or concessions. The vice foreign minister expressed \\"indignation\\" at the U.S.'s uncompromising position and suggested North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit if the Trump administration does not act with \\"sincerity\\" to improve relations through dialogue. He also found it \\"absolutely absurd\\" that Bolton would compare Libya's experience dismantling its nuclear program as a model for dealing with North Korea's more advanced capabilities. This indicates that the vice minister likely completely disagreed with the U.S. wanting North Korea to disband the nuclear arsenal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have this equation:  36 = -22*z + 13*z First, we notice there are two \\"z\\" terms, -22*z and 13*z. We can combine them like this: 36 = (-22 + 13) * z -22 + 13 is -9, so now the equation looks like this: 36 = -9 * z Next, we want to find out what \\"z\\" is. To do this, we need to get \\"z\\" all by itself. Since -9 is multiplied by \\"z,\\" we can do the opposite, which is dividing, to both sides of the equation. Let's divide both sides by -9: 36 / -9 = -9 * z / -9 The -9 on the right side cancels out, leaving us with just \\"z\\": -4 = z So, the answer to the problem is z = -4. Great job!

Billboard wrote about the song : \`\` You catch the beat , now know the groove . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences may appear similar at first glance, they differ in the order they present the ideas and imply somewhat different meanings. Let's break down each sentence to clarify their meanings: Sentence 1:  \\"About the song, Billboard wrote: 'You know the beat, now you catch the groove.'\\" In this sentence, it is implied that the listener is already familiar with the beat of the song. The focus is now shifted to the groove of the music so that the listener can connect with it on another level and fully appreciate the song. The sentence tells the reader that the song has a recognizable beat, and the groove is something to now explore and connect with. The focus is on catching the groove after knowing the beat. Sentence 2:  \\"Billboard wrote about the song: 'You catch the beat, now know the groove.'\\" In this sentence, the process starts with catching the beat of the song. It implies that the listener first connects with the beat before moving on to \\"know the groove.\\" The sentence indicates a progression - from catching the beat, which might suggest an initial attraction, to knowing the groove, more deeply understanding and appreciating the song's rhythm and feel. The focus is on knowing the groove as a result of catching the beat. So, while both sentences involve the beat and the groove, the order in which they are presented differs, leading to slightly different meanings. The first sentence starts with the assumption that the listener knows the beat and then proceeds to catch the groove, while the second sentence starts with the listener catching the beat and then moves on to knowing the groove."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"To predict the sentiment of the tweet \\"is going to watch dexter without marquita,\\" we need to analyze the context and the words used in the tweet. Dexter is a popular TV series, and the user has mentioned they are going to watch it; this can be a neutral statement. However, the inclusion of \\"without marquita\\" can indicate a different emotion. In order to make a more accurate prediction, we need to examine the possible emotions that the user could be expressing with this tweet: 1. Excitement: The user might be excited to watch Dexter and simply wants to share this information with their followers. In this case, the reference to Marquita could be incidental and might not carry a strong emotional connotation. 2. Loneliness or Disappointment: The user may want to watch Dexter with Marquita, but for whatever reason, they cannot. Thus, they could be expressing sadness, disappointment, or loneliness that they have to watch their favorite show alone. 3. Indifference: The mention of Marquita might not carry any particular emotion. The user could be stating the fact that they will be watching the series without her, without necessarily expressing any sentiment. 4. Relief or Satisfaction: The user may prefer watching Dexter without Marquita, which could indicate relief or satisfaction in being able to watch the show on their own terms. Considering these possible scenarios, the sentiment is not clearly positive or negative. It can be interpreted as neutral with a hint of potential emotional context that depends on the relationship between the user and Marquita. To provide a more accurate prediction of the sentiment, we need additional context or tweets from the user to understand the relationship with Marquita.

Susan Mary Alsop - a Two-Continent Hostess - NYTimes.com Jacqueline Kennedy and President Kennedy arriving at the home of Joseph Alsop in 1961. IN January 1961, President John F. Kennedy dropped by Joseph Alsop’s house on Dumbarton Avenue in Washington after the inaugural balls to unwind with a band of revelers over Champagne and turtle soup. Kennedy was always welcome at the Georgetown home of the outspoken, hawkish Alsop and his elegant wife, Susan Mary; but a year and a half later, the president nearly spoiled one of their dinners by talking at such length in the garden with the guest of honor, Charles E. Bohlen (whom he had just appointed ambassador to France), that the lamb got cold. The Washington Post’s Katharine and Don Graham, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin and other guests waited hungrily for the president and ambassador to come to table. “Something is going on,” Susan Mary told her husband later that night. “You think so?” he responded, skeptically. That “something” turned out to be the Cuban missile crisis. “American Lady,” a new biography of Susan Mary Alsop by Caroline de Margerie, a French judge and former diplomat, reveals the influence and insight of the American hostess, who lived so elegantly in the public eye, and so passionately when no one was watching. Unlike her husband, Mrs. Alsop was not a syndicated columnist read by hundreds of thousands. But her gatherings drew people from both sides of the political aisles, creating lasting bonds. If she were alive today, she would be giving a celebratory dinner that President and Michelle Obama — and perhaps even Mitt and Ann Romney — would be delighted to attend, and where politesse would trump politics. Until she died in 2004, the tradition of giving parties to forge social and political alliances thrived in Washington, perpetuated by savvy, charming hostesses who delighted in making introductions and in smoothing discord between powerful men and women — magnifying their own reputations in the process. Mrs. Alsop was predeceased by Katharine Graham, another partygiver of wit and panache; and before that, by Pamela Harriman (whom she loathed, according to her biographer) and long before that, Perle Mesta. But the saloniste chain has been broken lately; it awaits a new doyenne to reattach the link and keep it growing. For those not quite sure who Susan Mary Alsop was, here’s a refresher. Slender, lovely, dark-haired, ladylike and intense, she was born Susan Mary Jay in 1918, descended from John Jay, a founding father and the country’s first chief justice. As a Jay, she had enough family money to live comfortably but not enough to be rich (in her own opinion at least, according to Ms. de Margerie). In October 1939, when she was 20, she married a man named Bill Patten, and in 1945, wangled him a job at the American Embassy in Paris, where she gave frolicsome dinners for European, British and American social and diplomatic luminaries that had a serious underlying intent: to strengthen European-American ties. “She really set herself this purpose quite seriously,” Ms. de Margerie said last week by phone from Paris, on the eve of her American book tour. “She wanted to help Americans understand the French, and vice versa. She thought of herself as a go-between helping two countries she loved, France and America.” Ms. de Margerie’s mother in-law, Hélène de Margerie, who attended many of Susan Mary’s Georgetown soirees when her husband, Emmanuel de Margerie, was France’s ambassador to the United States in the ’80s, told her that “going to Susan Mary’s in some ways was like going to an exam: you had to have your French-and-American facts at your fingertips, because you would be examined closely.” Had Susan Mary been born later, Ms. de Margerie suggested, “She would have been either a journalist, a profession she would have very much liked to embrace, or a diplomat, which was in the family tradition. Yet in her own way, which was restricted by her class and her times, she managed to be both things. She exerted a kind of behind-the-scenes diplomacy, both in Paris, where she spent 15 years of her life — probably the happiest years — and in Washington.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Susan Mary Alsop was an important and elegant American hostess who lived in Washington and Paris. She was married to Joseph Alsop, an outspoken journalist, and together, they hosted many dinner parties that brought together powerful politicians, diplomats, and intellectuals. These gatherings helped create lasting friendships and smooth disagreements between important people. Susan Mary was born in 1918 and came from a distinguished family, which gave her connections to both America and France. She worked hard to strengthen ties between the two countries, and had she been born later, she may have been a journalist or diplomat instead."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is impossible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Let's analyze both statements in detail to understand why this is the case: Premise: The highly important group of sculptures gathered here represents every facet of Francisco Salzillo's work. This statement tells us that the collection of sculptures showcased presents a comprehensive representation of every aspect of Francisco Salzillo's work. It implies that these sculptures demonstrate the range of themes, styles, and techniques that Salzillo employed throughout his career. Hypothesis: The sculptures by Francisco Salzillo all depict cows. This statement suggests that all of Salzillo's sculptures solely represent cows. This is a very specific, narrow focus for an artist, and it claims that his entire body of work is restricted to this single subject. Considering the premise states that the group of sculptures on display represents every facet of Salzillo's work, it would be reasonable to assume that these sculptures present various subjects, themes, and styles. This, in turn, casts doubt on the hypothesis that all his sculptures depict cows. If we evaluate the given information, we can determine that the two statements contradict each other. While the premise suggests diversity and a comprehensive representation of Salzillo's work, the hypothesis claims that all his sculptures are limited to the subject of cows. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true.

Passage:A modulated radio wave, carrying an information signal, occupies a range of frequencies. See diagram. The information (modulation) in a radio signal is usually concentrated in narrow frequency bands called sidebands (SB) just above and below the carrier frequency. The width in hertz of the frequency range that the radio signal occupies, the highest frequency minus the lowest frequency, is called its bandwidth (BW). A given amount of bandwidth can carry the same amount of information (data rate in bits per second) regardless of where in the radio frequency spectrum it is located, so bandwidth is a measure of information-carrying capacity. The bandwidth required by a radio transmission depends on the data rate of the information (modulation signal) being sent, and the spectral efficiency of the modulation method used; how much data it can transmit in each kilohertz of bandwidth. Different types of information signals carried by radio have different data rates. For example, a television (video) signal has a greater data rate than an audio signal.

However, Gödel had already discovered this consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem and sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel's priority in his next letter. He never thought much of \\"the American system of claiming personal priority for everything.\\" What is the answer to this question: What was the consequence of the theory of incompleteness?","output":"The consequence of Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems, specifically the second one mentioned in the article, had profound implications for mathematics, logic, and our understanding of the limits of formal axiomatic systems. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any consistent formal axiomatic system that is powerful enough to encapsulate the basic arithmetic of natural numbers, there will always be statements that are true within the system but cannot be proven or disproven using the system's own rules and axioms. In other words, there will always be some undecidable propositions within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, which is the focus of the article and the consequence being discussed, establishes that a consistent formal axiomatic system can never prove its own consistency. This means that we cannot fully trust the axiomatic foundations of our mathematical systems to ensure that they are free from contradictions, as they are unable to demonstrate their own coherence. These theorems challenged the foundational aims of mathematics, particularly the work of mathematicians such as David Hilbert, who aspired to formalize all of mathematics into a complete and consistent axiomatic system. Gödel's theorems demonstrated that these aspirations were inherently unattainable, as any such system would always be incomplete or inconsistent. The consequence of the theory of incompleteness forced mathematicians and logicians to reconsider the role of formal systems and axioms in mathematics, and to recognize the inherent limits of provability and completeness within these structures. It emphasized the importance of consistency, as the undecidability and self-consistency results only apply to consistent systems. In summary, the consequence of the theory of incompleteness, particularly Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, reveals the inherent limitations of formal axiomatic systems in demonstrating their own consistency and indicates that there will always be some degree of incompleteness within these systems. This revelation had a profound impact on the foundations of mathematics and logic and continues to inspire philosophical debates and ongoing research in these fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism.\\" answer the question \\"What does an archaism explain?\\" Possible answers:  (1). yes;  (2). no;","output":"(1). Yes, the sentence \\"Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism.\\" does answer the question \\"What does an archaism explain?\\" to a certain extent. However, it is important to provide a detailed explanation to fully understand the concept. An archaism refers to the use of an older or obsolete form of language, typically found in historical texts or older works of literature. It can apply to individual words, phrases, grammatical structures, or even pronunciation. The existence of archaisms can be the result of various factors, such as historical change, geographical separation, or social distinction. In the given sentence, the context suggests that there are two linguistic groups being compared, and it intends to provide an explanation for any lexical differences between them. It states that any lexical divergence found within or between these groups can be explained as an archaism. This means that the archaic forms or structures of language found within these groups account for the differences in their lexicon. By examining the archaisms within each group, it is possible to gain insight into the historical development of the languages and understand the origin of the divergences. This can, in turn, provide valuable information about the cultural, historical, or social contexts that influenced the languages' evolution. Additionally, understanding archaisms may help in linguistic reconstruction, which aids in the study of related languages and their ancestral forms. In conclusion, the sentence does provide an answer to the question \\"What does an archaism explain?\\", yet it is important to expand on the concept for a more complete understanding. Archaism explains the lexical divergences within or between linguistic groups, which can serve as evidence of linguistic change and help in understanding the historical, social, or cultural factors influencing language evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A lady setting up multicolored balls in a contraption.\\", can we conclude \\"A lady is building a ball pit.\\"?","output":"Based on the given information, \\"A lady setting up multicolored balls in a contraption,\\" we cannot conclusively determine that \\"A lady is building a ball pit.\\" While it is certainly possible that the lady might be building a ball pit, there are other potential explanations for her actions that we should consider before coming to a definite conclusion. Before we analyze the alternatives, let's break down what we know and what we don't know: What we know: 1. A lady is setting up multicolored balls. 2. These balls are being set up in some kind of contraption. What we don't know: 1. The type and purpose of the contraption. 2. The exact number of multicolored balls involved. 3. The context or environment in which she is setting up the balls and contraption. Given this information, let's explore some alternative scenarios that could explain the lady's actions: 1. Ball Sorter: The lady could be setting up a contraption designed to sort the multicolored balls based on their color, size, or other characteristics. Such contraptions can be utilized for various purposes like organizing balls for different games, educational activities, or art installations. 2. Child's Toy: The contraption could be a toy designed for children to interact with the multicolored balls, such as a ball popper machine that shoots the balls into the air or a maze-like structure directing the balls to travel through different paths. 3. Art Installation: The contraption could be part of a larger art project, where the lady is placing the multicolored balls in a specific arrangement to create a visual effect or interactive experience for the viewers. 4. Scientific Experiment: The lady might be conducting an experiment involving the balls and contraption. She could be researching the effects of various forces or techniques on the balls' behavior, such as studying their movement patterns or interactions with one another. 5. Game or Puzzle: The lady could be setting up a game or puzzle involving the multicolored balls, where participants must navigate or interact with the contraption to achieve a specific goal or solve a problem. Given these potential scenarios, we can conclude that although the idea of a lady building a ball pit is plausible, it is not the only possible interpretation of her actions. To arrive at a more accurate conclusion, we would need additional information or context to eliminate alternative explanations and affirm the true nature and purpose of the contraption and multicolored balls."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

What is the title of this article: Continental Portugal's 89,015 km2 (34,369 sq mi) territory is serviced by four international airports located near the principal cities of Lisbon, Porto, Faro and Beja. Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country. The primary flag-carrier is TAP Portugal, although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in Alcochete, to replace Lisbon Portela Airport, though this plan has been stalled due to the austerity.

Justification: 1. An egg is laid by a mother bird: This is the starting point of the process, where the bird reproduces, and a new life begins as an egg. 2. A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized: If the egg is fertilized, it means that it has all the genetic material needed to develop into a baby bird. 3. The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg: This is the hatching process when the baby bird breaks free from the eggshell and emerges. 4. The baby bird is unable to fly to get food: At this stage, the baby bird is not yet strong enough or adequately developed to fly and gather food on its own. 5. The mother bird must feed the baby bird food: The mother bird plays a crucial role at this stage, providing nourishment and care to the baby bird, ensuring it grows and develops properly. 6. The bird grows stronger and grows wings: As a result of the mother bird's care and the nourishment it receives, the baby bird's muscles and wings grow, and it becomes stronger. 7. The bird is able to fly: Eventually, the bird has developed enough strength and skill to become capable of flying. 8. The bird is able to leave the nest and find food: This is the stage where the bird can fly, seek food independently, and begin to rely less on the mother bird for support.

The word \\"coordinate\\" has various meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In both sentences, the word \\"coordinate\\" is used as a verb, but the specific meanings are slightly different. 1. Coordinate our efforts. In this sentence, \\"coordinate\\" refers to organizing and managing different tasks, activities, or elements of a project in order to achieve a common goal. When applied to \\"efforts,\\" this means making sure that different people or teams work together efficiently and effectively by clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and timelines. This might involve arranging logistics, setting up meetings, assigning tasks, and defining performance metrics. In essence, coordinating efforts is about bringing all the parts together and making sure they function in harmony to get the desired results. 2. Coordinate his actions with that of his colleagues. In this sentence, \\"coordinate\\" refers to synchronizing or harmonizing one person's actions or behaviors with those of others to ensure smooth interaction, proper timing, and collaboration. In this case, \\"coordinate\\" points to the need for an individual to be mindful of how his actions will align with those of his colleagues and adjust accordingly. This can help to prevent misunderstandings, conflicts, or delays in completing tasks. To coordinate actions with someone else could mean making sure that your tasks are not overlapping, or simply keeping each other informed about your progress.

Eventually brandon ended up having to get glasses to correct his nearsitednes while Michael did not.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which of the brothers is nearsighted, Michael or Brandon? Answer:","output":"Brandon is the brother who is nearsighted based on the information provided in the paragraph. While both Michael and Brandon grew up in the same house together, they developed completely different hobbies. Michael preferred spending his time outdoors and engaging in physical activities like playing sports, whereas Brandon enjoyed more indoor activities such as reading and playing games on his computer. It is important to note that the development of nearsightedness, or myopia, can be influenced by factors such as genetics, environmental elements, and lifestyle habits. While it's not possible to determine from the paragraph whether Brandon's nearsightedness is due to his hobbies alone, his preference for reading and computer gaming could have potentially contributed to his nearsightedness. Prolonged time spent focusing on close-up objects, like books or computer screens, may exacerbate the risk of developing nearsightedness in some individuals. Despite growing up in the same environment, Michael and Brandon's different hobbies and interests likely influenced their visual health in distinct ways. While genetics may also play a role in the development of nearsightedness, the information provided in the paragraph does not allow us to establish a genetic predisposition with certainty. Nonetheless, it does seem that Brandon's interests and activities, coupled with possible genetic factors, led to his need for glasses to correct his nearsightedness.

Title: Courage Under Fire Movie plot: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Seventeen-year  for the following movie plot:  he movie opens with the information that during the 1960s, even though British rock was at its peak, British radio refused to play rock music. This led to the creation of pirate radio stations, which kept their ships anchored off the coast and played rock music 24/7.A boat approaches the Pirate Radio ship and drops off Young Carl (Tom Sturridge), a young man who has been expelled from school for smoking marijuana. He has been sent to spend time with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who owns the ship, allegedly to straighten him out. Quentin introduces Carl to the rest of the crew: The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an American DJ who is the star of the station; Simon, a slightly awkward guy who dreams of finding romance; John, who does news and weather; Dave, who is extremely popular with the ladies; Angus, whom no one really likes but who runs a \\"crazy\\" comedy show; and Felicity, a lesbian who cooks for the boys. Carl is to room with Thick Kevin, who is unbelievably stupid.Carl's first night on the boat is a raucous party and we see scenes of the DJs running their shows spliced with the British people who listen to them. Millions of Britons are tuning in to Pirate Radio, and this greatly disturbs Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh), who is put in charge of eliminating the problem of Pirate Radio. With the help of his new assistant, Twatt (Jack Davenport), they begin working to put Pirate Radio out of business.Twatt's first plan is to eliminate funding for Pirate Radio by making it illegal for British companies to advertise with them. Quentin breaks this news to the crew, explaining that in order to try to recoup their losses, he will be bringing in the famous DJ Gavin (Rhys Ifans). This disappoints the Count, who is used to being #1 on the station and is jealous of Gavin.During Carl's time on the boat he meets Mark, the late night DJ who never speaks and is referred to as \\"the sexiest man in the world.\\" While they are sitting on deck, they begin discussing their conjugal visits: since they never go...

The series is sanctioned by INDYCAR.  - Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. The holiday, which is observed every year on the last Monday of May, originated as Decoration Day after the American Civil War in 1868, when the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans founded in Decatur, Illinois, established it as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Union war dead with flowers. By the 20th century, competing Union and Confederate holiday traditions, celebrated on different days, had merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service. It marks the start of the unofficial summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.  - Michael \\"Mike\\" Lanigan is an entrepreneur and IndyCar Series team owner.  - Buddy Rice (born January 31, 1976) is an American racecar driver.

In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county.  - Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing is an auto racing team that currently races in the United SportsCar Championship and the IndyCar Series. Based in Hilliard, Ohio, it is co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, former television talk show host David Letterman, and businessman Mike Lanigan.  - Robert \\"Bobby\\" Woodward Rahal (born January 10, 1953 in Medina, Ohio) is an American auto racing driver and team owner. As a driver, he won three championships and 24 races in the CART open-wheel series, including the 1986 Indianapolis 500. He also won the 2004 Indianapolis 500 as a team owner for the winning driver, Buddy Rice.  - The Indianapolis 500 is an automobile race held annually at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. The event is held over Memorial Day (originally Decoration Day) weekend, which is typically the last weekend in May.

Unable to reach terms with the New York Giants, Strong signed instead with the Staten Island Stapletons. He played for the Stapletons for four years from 1929 to 1932. While statistics are not available for the 1929 NFL season, Strong was regarded as one of the best backs in the NFL. He started all 10 games at halfback for the 1929 Stapletons. In his first NFL game, he threw a long forward pass to set up the Stapleton's first touchdown and scored all of the team's 12 points on two short touchdown runs. He also had a 70-yard run in a scoreless tie with the Orange Tornadoes on November 3, 1929. Two days later, Strong had a 50-yard touchdown run against the Providence Steam Roller. At the end of the 1929 season, Strong was selected by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette as a second-team All-Pro.  In 1930, Strong appeared in all 12 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on two rushing touchdowns, five receiving touchdowns, one field goal, and eight extra points. His point total ranked third in the NFL in 1930, trailing only Jack McBride (56 points) and Verne Lewellen (54 points). On September 28, 1930, he caught two touchdown passes, threw a 40-yard pass that set up a third touchdown, and kicked three extra points in a 21-0 victory over the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In December 1930, he led the Stapletons to a 16-7 victory over the New York Giants for the pro football championship of New York City; Strong accounted for all 16 Stapleton points, running 98 yards for a touchdown, passing for a second touchdown, and kicking a field goal and an extra point. He was selected as a first-team player on the 1930 All-Pro Team by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette.  In 1931, Strong appeared in all 11 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on six rushing touchdowns, one punt return for a touchdown, two field goals, and five extra points. His 53 points ranked fourth in the NFL, trailing only Johnny Blood (84 points), Ernie Nevers (66 points), and Dutch Clark (60 points). On November 22, 1931, Strong scored all 16 points in a 16-7 victory over Cleveland; he had two rushing touchdowns, including a 50-yard run and kicked a field goal and an extra point.

No tumors were detected ; rather , empty cavities and scar tissue were found in their place .","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although they are structured differently and use somewhat different phrasing. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence to better understand their similarities. Sentence 1: \\"The researchers found only empty cavities and scar tissue where the tumors had been.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on what the researchers found in the location where tumors previously existed. The use of \\"only\\" emphasizes that instead of finding any tumors, the researchers discovered \\"empty cavities and scar tissue.\\" This implies that the tumors are no longer present, and what remains in their place is the aftermath of their removal or disappearance (i.e., the empty cavities and scar tissue). Sentence 2: \\"No tumors were detected; rather, empty cavities and scar tissue were found in their place.\\" This sentence is more explicit about the absence of tumors. The first phrase, \\"No tumors were detected,\\" clearly states that the researchers did not find any tumors. The second part of the sentence, following the semicolon, elaborates on this finding by using the word \\"rather\\" to indicate that instead of tumors, they found \\"empty cavities and scar tissue\\" in the location where tumors would be expected. This also implies that the tumors are no longer there and have been replaced by these empty cavities and scar tissue. Both sentences express the idea that the researchers were looking for tumors but discovered empty cavities and scar tissue instead.

In 2010 the Age adjustment mortality rate was 3.8 deaths per 1000 (down from 4.8 in 2000) and the infant mortality rate for the total population was 5.1 deaths per 1000 live births.

In New Zealand, if a baby girl was born between 2014 and 2016, she could expect to live about 83.4 years, while a baby boy could expect to live around 79.9 years. This is pretty good compared to other countries! By the year 2050, people in New Zealand are expected to live even longer, up to 85 years!

Quinn was surprised with a birthday cake. Quinn burnt the candle at both ends. She had an amazing night.  Given the context: How would Quinn feel afterwards?  Possible answers: happy, uncomfortable, bored The answer to this question is:","output":"happy. Quinn would most likely feel happy after the night described in the given context. There are a few reasons for this conclusion. First, Quinn was surprised with a birthday cake. Receiving a birthday cake is a celebratory and joyful event for most people, especially when it comes as a surprise. A surprise usually means that someone close to Quinn took the time and effort to plan and execute it as a way to express their love, care, and affection towards her. In this scenario, the birthday cake communicates that Quinn is cherished and valued, which would certainly promote positive emotions in her. Second, \\"burning the candle at both ends\\" is an idiom that usually implies that someone is working hard or going to great lengths to enjoy themselves. In this context, it suggests that Quinn had a very lively, energetic, and intense night, which aligns with having an amazing experience. Although this phrase can occasionally have negative connotations, such as not giving oneself enough time to rest, the overall context implies that Quinn had a fantastic time. Finally, the statement \\"She had an amazing night\\" clearly conveys that Quinn had an outstanding time. The word \\"amazing\\" is a powerful, positive adjective that denotes a highly enjoyable and exceptional experience. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that Quinn had a night full of excitement and delightful memories. Taking all of these considerations into account, Quinn would most likely feel happy after the night’s events. It is important to recognize that emotions can be multifaceted, and while there might be other feelings at play, happiness undoubtedly stands out as the prevailing sentiment in this situation."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Every day, he studied the weather and tried to predict the next day's weather. Then, he stood in front of the camera and read his report. Some days it was cloudy, some days it was sunny; sometimes rainy, while sometimes snowy. The weather changed each day, but Bob still felt that his job was always the same. His boss often told him to be happier and smile more in front of the camera, but Bob rarely smiled. He thought that most people did not watch his weather report and his job did not matter much to anyone. One day, he arrived at work and began to study the weather as usual. He noticed that something was different that day. Everything he studied told him that there was going to be a very big storm very soon, though he was not completely sure. Suddenly, Bob felt excited. He ran to his boss's office and asked to do a special weather report. The boss agreed and Bob gave a special report that afternoon, warning people of the coming storm. Because of this report, many people were safe during the storm. Bob realized  that his job was actually very important.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation 0 = -16*t + 11*t - 36*t + 410 for t, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The given equation has three terms with t: -16*t, 11*t, and -36*t. We will combine these terms to simplify the equation. -16*t + 11*t - 36*t = (-16 + 11 - 36) * t = (-5 - 36) * t = -41*t Now, the equation will be: 0 = -41*t + 410 Step 2: Isolate the variable t. To find the value of t, we need to isolate it. We'll do this by moving the -41*t term to the other side of the equation. To maintain the balance of the equation, we must perform the same operation on both sides. Thus, we will add 41*t to both sides: 0 + 41*t = -41*t + 41*t + 410 41*t = 410 Step 3: Solve for t. Now, to find the value of t, we will divide both sides of the equation by 41: 41*t / 41 = 410 / 41 t = 10 So the answer is t = 10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Instead, they will focus their energies on teaching students how to type. Is handwriting still an important skill? An online survey received some surprising responses. Handwriting is not necessary. Students only need to know how to read it, and the only time that they must write something is to make a signature. Why stress them more than they need to be stressed? We already put so much pressure on them to perform on state tests. --Rita Children don't write letters now. They send e-mails or text messages. A lot of those old ways are going away. How many bills do you pay by writing a check anymore? --Brown Although my son is not comfortable with writing, I bought a workbook for him to practice his handwriting. Can you imagine being an adult and not being able to sign a document? --Susan What a shame! I guess one day it will be a lost art, because handwriting is that personal and beautiful. It has personality --Anna The school where I worked dropped handwriting several years ago. Unless the students have computers in class, they will not be able to take notes at high speed.

These genes produce a family of closely related, but distinct polypeptide isotypes that are distinguished principally by sequences within the approximately 15 carboxy-terminal amino acid residues. By immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to these variable domain sequences, we have now prepared polyclonal antibodies specific for each of six distinct isotypes. Specificity of each antiserum has been demonstrated unambiguously by antibody binding to bacterially produced, cloned proteins representing each isotype and by the inhibition of such binding by preincubation of each antiserum only with the immunizing peptide and not with heterologous peptides. Protein blotting of known amounts of cloned, isotypically pure polypeptides has permitted accurate quantitative measurement of the amount of each beta-tubulin isotype present in the soluble and polymer forms in various cells, but has not revealed a bias for preferential assembly of any isotype. Localization of each isotype in three different cell types using indirect immunofluorescence has demonstrated that in vivo each class of microtubules distinguishable by light microscopy is assembled as copolymers of all isotypes expressed in a single cell..

Question: Process: - When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock - When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks -   Question: suppose it is warmer so there is less ice formed happens, how will it affect there is more ice.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Under the hypothetical scenario where the environment becomes warmer, the proposed perturbation will most likely result in less ice formation overall. Consequently, this change in ice formation would have a direct impact on the second effect mentioned, which is the pressure exerted on the walls of any containing medium, such as rocks, by expanding water when it freezes. As water freezes, it expands and occupies 10% more space, leading to an increase in pressure against the walls of its container or the rocks surrounding it. This pressure can be strong enough to force the rock's walls to move farther apart, causing the cracks to expand and deepen over time. This process plays a significant role in breaking apart rocks and the overall weathering and erosion process in the environment. With a warmer environment and less ice formation, the reduction in the expansion of water due to lower freezing rates would lead to a decrease in the pressure exerted on the rock walls. Consequently, there would be less force driving the walls of the cracks apart, leading to fewer instances of cracks expanding and deepening within the rocks. This would result in a reduced rate of rock breaking apart and a slower weathering and erosion process. It is important to note that while ice formation may decrease, other factors such as clay expansion when wet and the invasive action of plant roots like mosses and lichens on rocks will still contribute to rock breakage. However, these factors may not be as potent in causing rock degradation compared to the effects of ice formation and expansion. In summary, the warmer environment will lead to a decrease in the second effect mentioned, which is the pressure exerted on the walls of rocks due to water freezing, thereby resulting in a reduced rate of rock breakage and a slower weathering process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The short movie review says \\"to mediocrity\\" 2. It's necessary to compare \\"to mediocrity\\" to the available options (I) negative and (II) positive Step 1: Analyze the meaning of \\"to mediocrity\\" \\"Mediocrity\\" refers to being average or of moderate quality. In the context of a movie review, this suggests that the movie did not stand out as being particularly good or bad, but rather was somewhere in the middle. Step 2: Compare \\"to mediocrity\\" with the available options Now, we need to find out whether describing a movie as mediocre aligns more with a positive or negative perspective. Usually, if someone had a positive view of the movie, they would use words like \\"good,\\" \\"excellent,\\" or \\"entertaining\\". On the other hand, someone with a negative view might use words like \\"bad,\\" \\"disappointing,\\" or \\"boring\\". In this case, \\"mediocre\\" doesn't align with either of these extremes. However, it does suggest a lack of enthusiasm or praise for the movie. Step 3: Make a conclusion Based on the comparison, we can conclude that the critic's opinion leans more towards the negative side. While \\"to mediocrity\\" doesn't explicitly mean the movie was bad, the absence of positive qualities and the overall indifference imply a less-than-positive perspective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The three children attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. Miss Price reveals she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort, and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob, and adds only Paul can work the spell, since he's the one who handed it to her.  Later, Miss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate Professor Emelius Browne. They discover Browne is actually a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book, and is surprised to learn the spells actually work for Miss Price. He gives the book to Miss Price, who is distraught to discover the final spell, \\"Substitutiary Locomotion,\\" is missing. The group travels to Portobello Road to locate the rest of the book.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the building that an explorer found a well preserved room where \\"the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation.\\"?  In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins.

Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless   or daring, the ride can be as thrilling   as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know the riding will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement with that. The seat, of course, has become harder for the hours having passed.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options:  a). yes  b). it is not possible to tell  c). no","output":"b). it is not possible to tell Let's analyze both sentences: Sentence 1: \\"that's sad well it was nice to talk to you.\\" In this sentence, the speaker acknowledges that something is sad and proceeds to express that they enjoyed talking to the listener. The speaker does not specify the reason for sadness, and their exact emotional state is unclear. However, the conversation might be ending or continuing based on the context. Sentence 2: \\"I do not want to talk to you now that I am sad.\\" In this sentence, the speaker explicitly states that they're sad and do not wish to talk to the listener due to their emotional state. This indicates that their sadness has a direct impact on their willingness to engage in conversation. Now we can determine the relationship between these sentences, considering Sentence 1 as true: - If Sentence 1 is true, the speaker recognized something sad and enjoyed their conversation with the listener. This does not necessarily mean the speaker is sad. Rather, they might be empathizing with the listener or commenting on a sad topic they discussed. - Since Sentence 1 does not provide information about the speaker's emotional state, it isn't possible to determine whether Sentence 2, which depends on the speaker feeling sad, is true or not.

The given premise, \\"oh yeah that's there is oh there is,\\" is somewhat ambiguous, making it difficult to discern any specific meaning from it. Without any clear context or additional information, the premise appears to be a collection of exclamatory phrases without any particular argument or point being conveyed. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"Oh yeah, there is more smokers than drinkers,\\" presents an assertion concerning the comparative population of smokers and drinkers. To be considered entailed by the premise, this assertion would need to be a logical or necessary conclusion resulting from the information provided in the premise. Given the lack of clarity and specific meaning in the premise, it does not provide adequate information or grounds to support or draw conclusions about the number of smokers compared to drinkers. Consequently, the hypothesis, while an interesting point of discussion, is not entailed by the ambiguous premise provided. A clearer premise or additional supporting information would be required to substantiate the hypothesis and establish whether or not it is entailed by the premise. For instance, if the premise provided data or statistics on the number of smokers and drinkers, or described trends concerning smoking and drinking habits, then it might be possible to derive the proposed hypothesis as a logical conclusion.

Both sentences essentially communicate that except for \\"The Kids,\\" all other \\"Space Cowboy\\" tracks were recorded with Derrick after initially being recorded with Nick Van Gelder.  However, there are a few things to note: 1. In the first sentence, '...all \\"Space Cowboy\\" tracks were recorded with Derrick except \\"The Kids\\"' indicates that all tracks in the \\"Space Cowboy\\" album (with the exception of \\"The Kids\\") were recorded with Derrick. The second sentence, '...all \\"Space Cowboy\\" tracks except \\"The Kids\\" were re-recorded with Derrick,' highlights that these tracks have been re-recorded with Derrick's contribution. While both sentences can be understood as paraphrased versions of each other, the second sentence emphasizes the fact that Derrick's involvement led to the re-recording of the tracks. 2. There is a typographical error in both sentences: 'Spcae' should be corrected to 'Space.' To improve clarity, the sentences can be paraphrased as follows: 1. After \\"The Kids\\" was recorded with the drummer Nick Van Gelder, Derrick was involved in recording all tracks of \\"Space Cowboy,\\" except for \\"The Kids.\\" 2. All \\"Space Cowboy\\" tracks, excluding \\"The Kids,\\" were initially recorded with drummer Nick Van Gelder and subsequently re-recorded with Derrick."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Correction appended      To Portlanders, in a story about heroes, George Elwood Tschaggeny was a villain.      In surveillance video and photos viewed far and wide, a man is seen walking off with a backpack in the chaos of last month's horrifying MAX attack. It belonged to Ricky Best, one of three men stabbed – two fatally – while trying to protect two girls from a man shouting racial epithets at them. In addition to the pack, it was later discovered the thief had taken the wedding ring off Best's finger as he lay bleeding to death.      That man, police say, was Tschaggeny.      But those who knew him say that, before addiction destroyed his life, George Elwood Tschaggeny would have been one of the heroes who stood up on the train.      That may seem improbable to those who followed the story. The 51-year-old became, in the public's eye, the person who committed the unfeeling, \\"completely heartless\\" act, as police characterized it. He was arrested June 2 at a small homeless camp near Interstate 84. He was wearing Best's wedding band.      Known as \\"Elwood\\" by friends and family, Tschaggeny was once a hero himself, honored by police in 2010 with a civilian medal for stopping a bank robber armed with a knife.      He was the sort of guy who'd pull over on the highway to help a motorcyclist after a crash, put the motorcycle in his truck and drive the injured biker to a doctor – like he did in 1998.      He was a military veteran, like Best, who lived in North Tabor with his wife and their five dogs. He loved hiking, biking and Westerns.      That's the man his ex-wife remembers, before the painkillers prescribed for a knee injury turned into an addiction, first with pills, then heroin.      \\"Not in my wildest dreams would I ever imagine he'd be facing what he's facing,\\" she said. \\"This is just not him.\\"      The Oregonian/OregonLive is not identifying Tschaggeny's ex-wife at her request for safety reasons, as she has a protective order against him.      She first met Tschaggeny in 1997, shortly after he moved to Oregon from his hometown Salt Lake City. She worked with his mother, who introduced the pair at a Thanksgiving celebration.      Three years later, they were married, on April Fools' Day 2000.      For the next 16 years, Tschaggeny's ex-wife remembers, they built a great life together.      Tschaggeny introduced her to Australian shepherds, and soon, they had four – Chris the Dog, Darwin, Howl E. Bones and Ted-E – plus one Jack Russell terrier, Jack Jack.      They spent their days hiking, mountain biking and lifting weights. At home, their TV was always tuned to the Western movie channel. Tschaggeny tended to the rose garden in their yard and, every day, he made his wife lunch for work and then dropped her off.      Tschaggeny was honored by police in June 2010 for stopping a bank robber a few months earlier, Portland police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said. The robber led police on a car chase, then crashed into a bus at Providence Hospital. The robber ran into a nearby neighborhood.      Tschaggeny, who was in his front yard of his home with another man, Scott Morales, saw the robber with a knife in his hand running from officers. They chased him down and took him to the ground, holding him there until police could arrest him.      The awards ceremony lauded the men's \\"courageous and selfless\\" actions.      Tschaggeny worked in property management after a stint in construction. According to court documents, Tschaggeny said he was self-employed, buying and selling property. But, his ex-wife said, he dreamed of the two of them opening a breakfast restaurant, where he could make his signature omelets.      \\"It was just a happy life,\\" she said.      Then his knees got worse.      Tschaggeny started going to a clinic for knee pain he still had from injuries he'd gotten as a child. To help him deal with the pain, his ex-wife said, the clinic prescribed him pills.      \\"That's how it all began,\\" she said.      The change happened slowly. Tschaggeny's ex-wife noticed he was angry and not interested in their usual activities.      At some point, though his ex-wife isn't exactly sure when, he began to use heroin.      Four in five new heroin users reported they started out abusing prescription pills, according to a 2016 report by the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Many say they turned to heroin because it's cheaper and easier to obtain than prescription opioids, the report says.      Tschaggeny would be in and out of rehab at least four times in about five years, his ex-wife said. But each time, he would succumb to addiction.      \\"He always said, 'It calls you, it calls you, it calls you,'\\" his ex-wife remembered. \\"And every time something let him down or he let someone down, it led him back into this deep hole.\\"      In February 2015, she filed for divorce, citing \\"irreconcilable differences,\\" court documents show. She told The Oregonian/OregonLive that she filed because of his addiction.      In April 2015, Tschaggeny went to a rehab program in Palm Desert, California, according to a 2015 jail interview and his ex-wife.      After he returned, the couple tried to reconcile. For a time, Tschaggeny seemed to be better, his ex-wife said.      \\"He was so proud of himself for accomplishing that and getting over it,\\" she said.      But when he started acting angry and despondent soon after, she suspected he was using drugs again.      She filed a restraining order against him in June 2015, court records show.      His first arrest came a few weeks later for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and trespassing. In an interview with jail staff, he said he wasn't using heroin at the time but had been using daily until his recently completed rehab program. He also said he was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD.      The divorce was finalized in May 2016, according to court records. After that, his ex-wife said, he became homeless.      It was devastating, she said, but she couldn't help him.      He was arrested again in September 2016, court records show, this time for attempted burglary. He told jail staff he'd been homeless for six weeks and hadn't used drugs since April 2015. He said he had been employed by a janitorial company for a few weeks but had been unemployed for a couple months.      Earlier this year, Tschaggeny pleaded guilty to unauthorized use of a vehicle in Washington County on Feb. 17.      His jail mug shots from 2015 to 2017 show a steady physical deterioration common among people addicted to drugs.      After his arrest in the MAX theft, Tschaggeny declined to speak to jail staff during his intake interview, court records show.      Portland police said Tschaggeny took Best's belongings as people tried to help the stabbing victims: Best, Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Micah Fletcher, 21. Namkai-Meche, like Best, died from his wounds. Fletcher survived.      Detectives did not know whether Tschaggeny was on the MAX during the stabbing or came on afterward.      Tschaggeny's sister, Camille, believes her brother's gut reaction was to try to help Best, but he took Best's belongings when he realized he could not.      \\"Elwood did a desperate act that desperate people do,\\" she said.      She thinks the government failed her brother by not providing more resources for mental health and opioid addiction. She declined to comment further.      Tschaggeny's ex-wife said nothing excuses the crime police say he committed. He should have to face the consequences of his actions, she said. But, she said, before his addiction, he would have never done anything like this.      Still, she has hope that her ex-husband will get the help he needs and finally beat his addiction.      \\"He's just not that person,\\" she said, \\"and he doesn't want to be that person.\\"      Lynne Palombo of The Oregonian/OregonLive staff contributed to this report.      An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Tschaggeny was arrested June 3.      — Samantha Matsumoto      smatsumoto@oregonian.com      503-294-4001; @SMatsumoto55 |||||       PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — The man wanted for allegedly stealing a backpack and wedding ring from Ricky Best, one of the victims killed in the MAX attack on May 26, was wearing Best’s wedding ring when he was arrested.      George Tschaggeny, 51, was caught on video carrying Best’s black backpack off of the MAX train.      Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson provided details of his arrest Friday morning, saying a tip from a Domino’s Pizza worker led them to the homeless camp where Tschaggeny lives off Northeast Halsey Street under the Cesar E. Chavez overpass along I-84.      “Detectives noticed that he was wearing a ring and determined that was Mr. best’s wedding ring,” Simpson said.      Best’s family realized the items were missing while making funeral arrangements Thursday, police said. Upon reviewing surveillance video of the crime scene, police determined the bag had been stolen.      Detectives believe Tschaggeny took Best’s ring off of his finger but don’t know how he did it.      “It’s completely heartless,” Simpson said. “There’s no way to describe what happened. I have only heard of one other time that something like this happened and it was a gang related incident where people took jewelry off the deceased after a shooting. That action is just incredibly heartless and unconscionable.”      Best’s son, Eric, told KOIN 6 News the wallet is still missing. The wallet had contact information for people Best served with in the Army and his family wants that information so they can get in touch with those people.      Police are urging people to be on the lookout for the wallet.      “They’ve suffered an immense loss and this is just one more layer of tragedy to their already awful experience,” Sgt. Pete Simpson said.      Best, a 53-year-old army veteran, was stabbed to death after standing up for two girls being verbally assaulted by a man on the MAX. He was a 23-year Army veteran and father of 4.      Simpson said this news has angered detectives involved with the MAX attack investigation.      Court documents show Tschaggeny went through a divorce in 2015 and has faced several felony charges, including auto theft and burglary. Documents also show he has a history of cocaine and heroin use.      Tschaggeny’s sister Camille told KOIN 6 News that her brother suffers from an opioid addiction. She said:      First and foremost, I wish that Mr. Best’s family are able to recover the property. I understand that is no measure against their grief. I am sick inside for their loss as well as the other families and for the girls. Our concerns are with the victims in this case, all five and their families. We all love and support my brother, but my brother is a very troubled man with an opioid addiction.This is yet another failure of inhumane and gross policies and lack of healthcare infrastructure to support addicts. As much as we love and support my brother, my brother has to own the consequences of his actions.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A man named George Elwood Tschaggeny was seen in a video stealing a backpack from a person named Ricky Best, who was hurt during an attack on a train. Ricky and two other men were trying to protect two girls from someone yelling mean things at them. George is accused of also taking Ricky's special wedding ring, which is very important. George used to be considered a hero, and he once stopped a person who was trying to rob a bank. Sadly, he became addicted to pain medicine and then started using a very dangerous drug called heroin. This addiction made him do things he wouldn't have done before."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

Help as much as you can. Where did the man who died on April 27, 1992 become professor of composition in 1966?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: [ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon...

Q: Background Paragraph: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  Story: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean.

He hides from the dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved. Morrison resolves to never let that happen, and Donatti hopes so for her sake. Two weeks later, Dick is at a party where he is the only guest... Answer:","output":"The clinic counselor in the movie \\"Cat's Eye\\" is Dr. Vinnie Donatti, played by Alan King. He works for Quitters, Inc., which is a clinic that uses extreme and horrifying methods to ensure that their clients quit smoking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mark Prigg. A major security flaw in Google's Play Store that could expose user's private data has been revealed by researchers. The bug, which the team has worked with Google, Facebook and other app makers to fix before revealing it, put millions of users at risk, the researchers said. The bug would allow hackers to steal user data from Facebook, Amazon and others using 'secret' keys the team uncovered. The Columbia Engineering Team found thousands of secret keys in android apps (shown by red arrows) that could be used to steal user data. The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. They were then able to decompile the apps to see their code. They then found developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. The research was revealed in a a paper presented—and awarded the prestigious Ken Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award—at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. Jason Nieh, professor of computer science at Columbia Engineering, and PhD candidate Nicolas Viennot said they were stunned by the scale of their find. 'Google Play has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads, but no one reviews what gets put into Google Play—anyone can get a 25 account and upload whatever they want. Very little is known about what’s there at an aggregate level,' says Nieh. 'Given the huge popularity of Google Play and the potential risks to millions of users, we thought it was important to take a close look at Google Play content.' Nieh and Viennot’s paper is the first to make a large-scale measurement of the huge Google Play marketplace. The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. PlayDrone scales by simply adding more servers and is fast enough to crawl Google Play on a daily basis, downloading more than 1.1 million Android apps and decompiling over 880,000 free applications. Google Play, the Android app store, has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads. Nieh and Viennot discovered all kinds of new information about the content in Google Play, including a critical security problem: developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. These vulnerabilities can affect users even if they are not actively running the Android apps. Nieh claims that even “Top Developers,” designated by the Google Play team as the best developers on Google Play, included these vulnerabilities in their apps. 'We’ve been working closely with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other service providers to identify and notify customers at risk, and make the Google Play store a safer place,' says Viennot. 'Google is now using our techniques to proactively scan apps for these problems to prevent this from happening again in the future.' In fact, Nieh adds, developers are already receiving notifications from Google to fix their apps and remove the secret keys.","output":"A major security flaw in Google's Play Store has been discovered by researchers, potentially exposing millions of users' private data.

Context: In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.

His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle.

At some point in time, the continent of MU experienced a great drought that lasted for several years. The other continent, Lemuria, was unaffected by the drought.  Hint: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. The answer to this question is:","output":"Lemuria had more birds with bigger beaks that were better off.  The paragraph explains that while both ancient continents had a great bird population, a significant drought occurred on the continent of MU.

In contrast, birds with bigger beaks were better off, as they could eat seeds of all sizes and had more food available to them. The effect of the drought was that many small-beaked birds died, and more of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. This led to an increase in the average beak size in the finches within a short period, demonstrating evolution by natural selection.

In the absence of windows in an area, a fire extinguisher needs to be placed in a location that is accessible, easily visible, and near exits that lead to safety. A stairwell is a common space in most buildings, often used as an escape route during emergencies, such as fires. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not ideal: 1. House: A house is a broad term for a type of building and doesn't provide a specific enough location for where to find a fire extinguisher. 2. School bus: While a school bus might have a fire extinguisher, the question assumes that there are no windows in the area. School buses typically have many windows, making it an improbable choice based on the scenario. 3. Window: The question states that there are no windows in the area, so this option is automatically disqualified. 4. Garage: While a garage might contain a fire extinguisher, it is not the optimal location, as it may be difficult to access during a fire emergency. A garage also might not apply to all building types, such as commercial buildings. A stairwell, on the other hand, is a common safety feature in various types of buildings. Building codes and fire safety regulations require that fire extinguishers be placed near exits or escape routes for easy access during emergencies. Stairwells generally provide direct access to exit doors and are less likely to contain flammable materials compared to other areas, making them a strategic location for installing fire extinguishers."},{"instruction":"Suppose We've never had a core (business) thing, founder Richard Branson told Reuters at the launch this month of Virgin Vodka, which, with Virgin cola and Virgin computers, are his latest bright ideas.

Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in highlatitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, which used to be a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results.

Context: Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively genedense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function. Simple singlecelled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as junk DNA. However, more recent analyses suggest that, although proteincoding DNA makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term junk DNA may be a misnomer.

The talks mark the first major diplomatic effort to end the fighting that broke out on September 27, 2020. The Nagorno-Karabakh region has been a point of contention between Armenia and Azerbaijan for decades. The dispute dates back to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the predominantly ethnic-Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence from Azerbaijan. Since then, sporadic clashes and a full-scale war in the 1990s have resulted in a fragile ceasefire and a de facto Armenian-controlled statelet. However, tensions never fully subsided, and recent months had seen an uptick in border skirmishes before the latest outbreak of violence. The current conflict has led to hundreds of casualties, including civilians, and both sides have traded accusations of military aggression, war crimes, and atrocities. As the situation deteriorated, calls for international involvement increased. Russia, traditionally an ally of Armenia, brokered a ceasefire on October 10, but it quickly fell apart. In response, talks were called in Moscow, where Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov mediated between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers. The talks reportedly lasted for nine hours and were described as tough but constructive. Both sides agreed to a temporary ceasefire to allow for the exchange of prisoners and the recovery of corpses. They also expressed hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict but acknowledged the complex issues involved. The negotiations are ongoing, but observers remain cautiously optimistic that progress can be made. However, the conflict is deeply rooted in historical, ethnic, and geopolitical factors, making it a challenging and sensitive issue to resolve. As such, diplomatic efforts may take time and require the involvement of multiple actors. The talks on Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow are a significant step towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

It is a combination of a neorealistic film about the homeless AND a fairy tale. I'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange, but I loved it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people (not actors) and gets a great ensembletype performance. Although not nearly as sad as Umberto D, both movies have a very similar point to makethis one just does it in a very absurdist way. Ignore the cheesy special effectsafter all, it was made in the early 1950s and special effects aren't terribly important anyway (or at least they shouldn't be in films). Instead, just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride. Unless you are a total curmudgeon, you'll have a ball.<br /><br />By the way, since I first reviewed this film, I have seen another DeSica directed film that is an absolute mustsee and that is THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US.

What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic, but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />worse than Scarecrow slayer. This is definitely not","output":"The movie fails to live up to its title and lacks action between zombies and vampires. The main character's vampire status is unclear, and more than half of the movie takes place in a car. There is no clear antagonist, and the ending is confusing. However, the soundtrack is suitable for the movie's low production value. This film seems intended for a small audience, not a mass one.

The violence was nice for some scenes, but some was just totally moronic. The scene in the pit were he gives the guy the knife... dumb moron!

As it turned out, the role fit Moore so perfectly, it trapped him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel), yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are forced, parts of the film are wobbly, but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscarwinner John Gielgud a sly, dryly amusing role as Arthur's valet, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. Liza Minnelli (as a bluecollar loveinterest) is sassy in a lowkey and Moore is brash, but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur, but at least we have this document of a career highpoint to cherish. *** from **** This is definitely not","output":"short summary, but I can provide one for you: Dudley Moore shines as the titular character in \\"Arthur,\\" playing a man-child who is difficult not to like. Despite some forced moments, the film's well-written script and strong cast make it a heartwarming comedy that's hard to resist. John Gielgud's performance as Arthur's valet is particularly enjoyable.
