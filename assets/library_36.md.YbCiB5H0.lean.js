These numbers will be of the form 13m + 5, where m is a non-negative integer. The first few numbers in this sequence are: 5, 18, 31, 44, 57, 70, 83, 96... We are looking for numbers that appear in both sequences and are between 0 and 100 inclusive. From the sequences above, we can see that 57 is a common number that satisfies both conditions. To find other common numbers, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which states that if we have two coprime moduli (in this case, 9 and 13), there will be a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli (in this case, 9 * 13 = 117). Since 117 is greater than 100, we only need to find the unique solution between 0 and 100. We already found that 57 is one such number. Since the moduli are coprime, there will be no other solutions between 0 and 100 because any other solution would have to be of the form 57 + 117k, where k is a non-negative integer. Adding 117 to 57 would give us a number greater than 100, which is outside the range we are considering. Therefore, there is only one integer between 0 and 100 inclusive that has a remainder of 3 when divided by 9 and a remainder of 5 when divided by 13, and that integer is boxed{57} ."},{"instruction":"There are 4 white balls and 5 black balls in a bag, all of the same size but with different labels.

Let's consider an initial convex n-gon A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n with vertices labeled in a counter-clockwise order. Denote by B_j the center of the regular n-gon constructed externally on the side A_j A_{j+1}. We'll identify the points on the plane with complex numbers. 2. Define a complex number ( w ) such that ( w = cos left(frac{2pi}{n}right) + i sin left(frac{2pi}{n}right) ). Note that multiplication by ( w ) represents a rotation about the origin by an angle ( frac{2pi}{n} ) counterclockwise. 3. Similarly, multiplication by ( bar{w} ) (the complex conjugate of ( w )) corresponds to a rotation by ( frac{2pi}{n} ) clockwise. 4. Consider the points ( A_j ) and the centers ( B_j ). For ( j = 1, 2, ldots, n ), the following relationships hold true during the rotation transformations:    [    A_{j-1} - B_{j-1} = w left(A_j - B_{j-1}right), quad A_{j+1} - B_j = bar{w} left(A_j - B_jright)    ]    Here we assume that ( A_0 = A_n ) and ( A_{n+1} = A_1 ). 5.

Adding these two equations, and using the fact that ( w - 1 = -w(bar{w} - 1) ), we obtain:    [    left(B_j - w B_{j-1}right)(bar{w} - 1) = (w + bar{w}) A_j - A_{j-1} - A_{j+1}    ] 7.

Since ( w + bar{w} = cos left(frac{2pi}{n}right) ), the above condition is equivalent to stating that the right-hand side of our combined equation:    [    (w + bar{w}) A_j - A_{j-1} - A_{j+1}    ]    must be zero. 10.

Given the condition g(x)+g(theta -x)=2 for all xin mathbb{R}, we understand that g(x) is symmetric with respect to the point (frac{θ}{2},1). This symmetry implies that the argument inside the sine function for g(x) and g(theta-x), when added together, should equal a multiple of pi to satisfy the condition g(x)+g(theta -x)=2. For g(x)=sin(2x+frac{π}{3})+1, the argument of the sine function is 2x+frac{π}{3}. For g(theta-x), replacing x with theta-x, we get the argument as 2(theta-x)+frac{π}{3}.

Denote by ( k ) the circumcircle with radius ( R ), and by ( r ) the radius of the incircle of the triangle. Let the side ( AB = c ) and let ( varrho_c ) be the radius of the excircle opposite to ( C ). The center of this excircle, ( O_C ), is at a distance of ( varrho_c ) from ( AB ). 1. The angles at ( A ) and ( B ) that ( AO_c ) and ( BO_c ) bisect are:    [    angle A O_c B = 180^circ - angle O_c A B - angle O_c B A = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(180^circ - alpha + 180^circ - beta)    ]    [    = frac{alpha + beta}{2} = frac{180^circ - gamma}{2} = gamma_1,    ]    since ( AO_c ) and ( BO_c ) bisect the external angles at ( A ) and ( B ), respectively. 2. The angle ( gamma_1 ) is half of the angle that ( AB ) subtends from the center of the circle through the arc that does not intersect ( O_c ). Now construct the tangent line ( e ) to ( AB ) at a distance ( varrho_c ) from ( AB ) and another line ( i ) which subtends an angle ( gamma_1 ) with ( AB ) seen from one side of the circle. 3. The intersection point of ( e ) and ( i ), denoted by ( O_C ), allows us to draw the circle ( k_c ) with radius ( varrho_c ). The remaining contact points from ( A ) and ( B ) determine the second tangents, intersecting at point ( C ). 4.

The conditions for constructibility entail that ( c ) must fit within the circle ( k ), i.e., ( c leq 2R ). Furthermore, ( O_C ) must be realizable such that the height from ( i ) is at least ( varrho_c ). 6. The intricate conditions for ensuring ( O_C ) belongs between ( A ) and ( B ) tangents on circle ( k_c ) suggest:    [    left( C_1 D= right) quad frac{c}{2} cot frac{gamma_1}{2} geq varrho_c > c cot gamma_1 = c tan frac{gamma}{2}    ]    which translates to:    (sin gamma = frac{c}{2R}), giving us two solutions, corresponding complementary angles ( gamma_1 ). 7. For ( c < 2R ), the same tangents ( e ) and ( i ) on either side of ( AB ) provide up to two possible solutions due to the symmetric nature of reflection along the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ). 8. The midpoint ( K ) of the arc on ( k ) is significant, where:    [    angle A K B = 2 gamma_1 = 180^circ - gamma,    ]    aiding in the geometric construction. The intersection of ( O_c K ) with ( k ) locates ( C ).

Now, we want to find the probability that the product of a randomly selected multiple of 3 and a randomly selected prime number less than 20 is a multiple of 45. A multiple of 45 must be divisible by both 9 and 5 (since 45 = 9 * 5). Therefore, we need to select a multiple of 3 that is also a multiple of 9 (which is 9 itself) and a prime number that is a multiple of 5 (which is 5 itself). There is only one way to get a multiple of 45: by selecting 9 from the multiples of 3 and 5 from the prime numbers. The probability of selecting 9 from the multiples of 3 is 1/3 (since there are 3 options: 3, 6, and 9). The probability of selecting 5 from the prime numbers less than 20 is 1/8 (since there are 8 options: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19). To find the combined probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each event: Probability = (Probability of selecting 9) * (Probability of selecting 5) Probability = (1/3) * (1/8) Probability = 1/24 Therefore, the probability that the product will be a multiple of 45 is boxed{1/24} ."},{"instruction":"a circle with centre at  O  and diameter  AB , two chords  BD  and  AC  intersect at  E .

Since there are 100 courtiers and each dog must be indicated by at least two courtiers, if any combinations of groups are non-empty, we find a common selection of some dogs. 7. Using the Pigeonhole Principle, observe the following:    - If we have 100 courtiers and 98 other dogs, then some configurations would overlap because there are insufficient unique selections available without repeat selections. 8. Consequently, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there will be at least two courtiers whose selections of dogs match completely. Therefore, we conclude that there exist two courtiers who have chosen exactly the same set of three dogs: boxed{} \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"While at Wizards Park, Kate buys 3 magic wands, one for herself and two for her friends.

They started to fill a cistern together but tap A is turned off after 9 minutes and tap B fills the rest part of the cistern in 23 minutes. How many minutes does it take for tap B to fill the cistern alone?","output":"Let's denote the time it takes for tap B to fill the cistern alone as ( t ) minutes. Tap A fills the cistern in 45 minutes, so in one minute, it fills ( frac{1}{45} ) of the cistern. Tap B fills the cistern in ( t ) minutes, so in one minute, it fills ( frac{1}{t} ) of the cistern. When both taps are open together, they fill ( frac{1}{45} + frac{1}{t} ) of the cistern in one minute. Tap A is open for 9 minutes, so it fills ( 9 times frac{1}{45} = frac{9}{45} = frac{1}{5} ) of the cistern. After tap A is turned off, tap B continues to fill the cistern for 23 minutes. Since tap B fills ( frac{1}{t} ) of the cistern in one minute, in 23 minutes, it fills ( 23 times frac{1}{t} = frac{23}{t} ) of the cistern. The total part of the cistern filled by both taps is the sum of the parts filled by each tap, which should equal 1 (the whole cistern). So we have: [ frac{1}{5} + frac{23}{t} = 1 ] Now we solve for ( t ): [ frac{23}{t} = 1 - frac{1}{5} ] [ frac{23}{t} = frac{5}{5} - frac{1}{5} ] [ frac{23}{t} = frac{4}{5} ] Cross-multiply to solve for ( t ): [ 23 times 5 = 4t ] [ 115 = 4t ] [ t = frac{115}{4} ] [ t = 28.75 ] So, it takes tap B ( boxed{28.75}  ) minutes to fill the cistern alone."},{"instruction":"Given that z is a pure imaginary number, and (2+i)z=1+ai^{3} (where i is the imaginary unit), then |a+z|=　　.

We know that 2 cars have neither air-bag nor power windows, so there are ( 65 - 2 = 63 ) cars that have either air-bag or power windows or both. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of cars that have both features. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. In this case, the number of cars with air-bag (45) plus the number of cars with power windows (30) would include the cars with both features twice, so we subtract the number of cars with both features (x) to avoid double-counting: [ 45 + 30 - x = 63 ] Now, we solve for ( x ): [ 75 - x = 63 ] [ x = 75 - 63 ] [ x = 12 ] So, there are boxed{12}  cars on the lot that have both air-bag and power windows."},{"instruction":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(2,1) and overrightarrow{b}=(3,4), the coordinates of overrightarrow{a} overrightarrow{b} are (　　).

The area of triangle HPC compared to ABC depends on its altitude from H to AC, which is half the altitude of triangle ABC because P is the midpoint of AC.

Then:    [    4nN - 4n^2 = s^2 - 1    ]    This implies:    [    nN - n^2 = frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{4}    ]    Since (q = N^2 + 1) is prime, consider the factorization:    [    n^2 (N^2 + 1) = (n^2 + left(frac{s-1}{2}right)^2)(n^2 + left(frac{s+1}{2}right)^2)    ]    Note that (|s| > 1) and (s) must be an odd integer. 5. **Minimum Value Argument:**    Since (q) is prime, we have:    [    n^2 geq min(n^2 + left(frac{s+1}{2}right)^2, n^2 + left(frac{s-1}{2}right)^2) geq n^2 + 1    ]    This is impossible because (n^2 geq n^2 + 1) is a contradiction. 6. **Composite Condition:**    Suppose (N^2 + 1) is a composite number. We need to show the existence of a solution where (4n(N-n) + 1) is a perfect square. 7. **Proposition:**    There exist integers ((a, b, c, d) in mathbb{Z}^4) such that:    [    N^2 + 1 = (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2), quad ad - bc = 1, quad abcd neq 0    ] 8. **Proof of Proposition:**    Let (R = mathbb{Z}[i]) where (i = sqrt{-1}). It is well-known that (R) is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD). Since (N^2 + 1) is composite, (N + i) is neither an irreducible element nor a unit. Thus, there exist ((a, b, c, d) in mathbb{Z}^4) such that:    [    N + i = (a - bi)(c + di)    ]    and neither (a - bi) nor (c + di) is a unit. This implies:    [    (a - bi)(c + di) = (ac + bd) + (ad - bc)i    ]    From this, we have:    [    1 = ad - bc    ]    and since neither (a - bi) nor (c + di) is a unit, we have (abcd neq 0). Taking the complex conjugate, we get:    [    N^2 + 1 = (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2)    ] 9. **Constructing (n) and (s):**    Let (n = |ac|) and (s = 2bc + 1). Then:    [    n^2 (N^2 + 1) = (ac)^2 (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (n^2 + left(frac{s-1}{2}right)^2)(n^2 + left(frac{s+1}{2}right)^2)    ]    Since (n < N) because (N^2 - n^2 = a^2 d^2 + b^2 c^2 + b^2 d^2 - 1 > 0), there exists (n in mathbb{Z}^+) such that (n < N) and (4n(N-n) + 1) is a perfect square.

Since he has had dreams every day for a year, the total number of dreams he has had this year is 365 * D.

The total number of dreams Gavin had in the two years is the sum of the dreams he had this year and last year, which is given as 4380.

However, as the flowchart itself is not provided, we will consider a generic flowchart for a summation program, which starts by initializing variables, then goes through a loop where a condition is checked, updates the variables within the loop, and finally outputs a sum after the loop terminates. 1. Initialize the sum S = 0 and a counting variable, say i, to some starting value (usually 1 or 0). 2. Set the condition that will be used to determine whether the loop continues or not. This might involve checking whether i is less than or equal to a certain value (e.g., i leq n for some value of n). 3. Inside the loop, add some value to S. This could be i itself, or some function of i (e.g., S = S + i or S = S + f(i)). 4. Update the counting variable within the loop (e.g., increment i by 1 with i = i + 1). 5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the condition is no longer satisfied. 6. Output the final sum.

We need to show that ( frac{1}{AP} = frac{1}{AD} + frac{1}{AC} ). # 1: 2. Let a line through point ( P ) parallel to side ( BC ) intersect side ( AC ) at point ( M ). By construction, we have ( MP parallel BC ) and from the parallel line property in similar triangles, ( ME = EC ).     3. Employing the Thales' theorem (or Basic Proportionality Theorem) in ( triangle ADC ):     [     frac{AM}{AC} = frac{AP}{AD}     ]     This rearranges to:     [     AM cdot AD = AP cdot AC     ]     4.

We cut the sector along a line perpendicular to its symmetry axis such that it divides the sector into two parts with equal perimeters. Let's call the intersection point of the cutting line with the arc as A', and note that A' bisects the line segment made up of the radius OA and the arc AC. 2. The arc AC represents frac{1}{12} of the entire circumference of the circle since the central angle is 60^circ and a full circle encompasses 360^circ. Therefore, arc length AC is smaller than the radius OA, which implies that point A' lies on the segment OA. 3. If we cut through the symmetry axis, point A' must bisect OA and the arc AC. For simplicity, we denote OA = r and OA' = a.  4. The segment and arc lengths together yield:    [    OA' = frac{1}{2} left( r + frac{2 pi r}{12} right) = frac{6 + pi}{12} r approx 0.762 r    ] 5.

Since there is only one distinct root, and the root -4 or -8 must make denominator nonzero, it follows that -4 or -8 is not -d nor 10.  Given the single distinct root, x = -4 must be the single root, implying -3c = -4 (as x+3c=0), so c = frac{4}{3}.

First, let's isolate the terms with V on one side: (2/3) * V - V = -20000 To combine the terms with V, we need a common denominator, which is 3 in this case: (2/3) * V - (3/3) * V = -20000 (2V - 3V) / 3 = -20000 (-V) / 3 = -20000 Now, multiply both sides by -3 to solve for V: V = 20000 * 3 V = 60000 So the total number of votes is 60000. We know the winning candidate received 2/3 of the total votes, so: Winning candidate's votes = (2/3) * 60000 = 40000 Now we can find the number of votes the third candidate received by subtracting the votes of the other two candidates from the total: Third candidate's votes = V - (first candidate's votes + second candidate's votes) Third candidate's votes = 60000 - (5000 + 15000) Third candidate's votes = 60000 - 20000 Third candidate's votes = 40000 So the third candidate, who is the winning candidate, received boxed{40000}  votes."},{"instruction":"What is the sum of all positive integer values of k such that frac{k+24}{k} is an integer?","output":"First, simplify the expression: frac{k+24}{k} = 1 + frac{24}{k}.

Since a_{1}=4, we have a_{1}-1=3, indicating that the sequence {a_{n}-1} is a geometric sequence with the first term 3 and a common ratio of 3.

Step 2: Analyze Perpendicular Lines Since ( mathrm{AB} parallel mathrm{CD} ) and ( mathrm{AD} parallel mathrm{BC} ), the quadrilateral ( mathrm{ABCD} ) can be divided into two triangles, say triangle ( mathrm{ABD} ) and triangle ( mathrm{CBD} ), sharing the same base ( mathrm{BD} ), and having bases ( mathrm{AB} ) and ( mathrm{CD} ) respectively.  Step 3: Heights and Proportional Distances The key insight is to relate the heights from a common point within the quadrilateral to the sides of the quadrilateral while leveraging the parallel nature of opposite sides. Particularly, we'll consider heights dropped to the sides and show their proportional relationship. Consider a point (L) such that distances to the lines containing sides ( mathrm{AB} ), ( mathrm{BC} ), ( mathrm{CD} ), and ( mathrm{AD} ) are proportional to the lengths of these sides.  Step 4: Mathematical Formulation and Proof 1. **Theta Angle Consideration:**    Given parallel conditions ((mathrm{AB} parallel mathrm{CD}) and (mathrm{AD} parallel mathrm{BC})), introduce angles within the quadrilateral. For a clearer understanding, consider the angles and construction:    - Let (angle DAC = theta). Given (mathrm{AB} parallel mathrm{CD}), angles related through parallel lines and transversal properties can be investigated. 2. **Circle and Symmetry:**    Leverage properties of circles and symmetry about bisectors:    - Let ( AC ) be a diagonal; introduce a circle with diameter (AC). 3. **Relate Heights:**    Relate the heights (perpendicular distances) from point (L) to respective sides. Leverage properties of circle and angles formed to equate trigonometric relationships.    - If point ( L ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (AC) by construction and leveraging trigonometric identities (sine and cosine rules through the circle's radius properties).  Conclusion To conclude, given the symmetry and construction within the quadrilateral, as well as the bisectors and trigonometric relations derived leveraging properties of circles and parallel lines, we demonstrate there exists a point ( L ) such that the distances (heights) to the sides of the quadrilateral are proportional to the sides themselves.

For (n > 0), define a great sequence to be a sequence of integers ( left(a_{0}, ldots, a_{n} right) ) such that:    - (0 = |a_{0}| < |a_{1}| < cdots < |a_{n-1}| < |a_{n}|)    - Let ( left(b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{n} right) ) be a set of positive integers such that ( 3b_{i} leq b_{i+1} ) for all (i).

Then (b_{i} > 2 sum_{k=1}^{i-1} b_{k}).        **Proof of Lemma:**    [    frac{b_{i}}{2} = frac{b_{i}}{3} + frac{b_{i}}{9} + cdots geq sum_{k=1}^{i-1} b_{k}    ]    Equality only occurs when the sequence (b_{i}) is infinite, which is not the case, so the inequality holds. 4. **Induction Base Case:**        The base case is ( n = 1 ), verifying that permissible sequences follow the given pattern. 5. **Inductive Hypothesis:**        Assume the statement holds for ( n = j-1 ). 6. **Inductive Step:**        Consider some permutation of the set ( B = {b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, ldots, b_{j}} ). Denote it as ( C = {c_{1}, c_{2}, ldots, c_{j}} ). Find the element ( c_{k} = b_{j} ). For the first ( k-1 ) elements of (C), we apply the inductive hypothesis.    The number of great sequences such that the set of differences ({ |a_{1} - a_{0}|, ldots, |a_{k-1} - a_{k-2}| }) is ( {c_{1}, c_{2}, ldots, c_{k-1} } ) is ( k! ).    Then, ( a_{k} ) can be either ( a_{k-1} + c_{k} ) or ( a_{k-1} - c_{k} ). Using the lemma, ( c_{k} > 2 sum_{m=1}^{k-1} c_{m} geq 2 |a_{k-1}| ). It’s easy to check that ( |a_{k}| > |a_{k-1}| ). 7. **Remaining Sequence:**        For any possible value of ( a_{k} ), there is one possible way for ( a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{j} ) because only one of (a_{i} pm c_{i+1}) will satisfy ( |a_{i}| > |a_{i-1}| ). 8. **Counting Possibilities:**        There are ( binom{j-1}{k-1} ) ways to choose ( c_{1}, ldots, c_{k-1} ) from ( B ). Given these, there are ( k! ) ways to arrange ( {a_{0}, ldots, a_{k-1}} ). There are ( 2 ) possible values for ( a_{k} ).

According to the problem, B takes 30 days to complete the work W, so B's work rate is W/30 work per day. A does half as much work as B in 3/4 of the time. Since B takes 30 days, 3/4 of that time is (3/4) * 30 = 22.5 days.

Find the maximum possible sum of the placed numbers.","output":"Let's translate the given problem into more detail. The problem states that we have: - 40 red points - 30 blue points - 20 green points These points are marked along a circle. According to the problem: - On each arc between a red and a blue point, we place the number 1. - On each arc between a red and a green point, we place the number 2. - On each arc between a blue and a green point, we place the number 3. - On arcs between points of the same color, we place the number 0. Given this setup, we are to find the maximum possible sum of the numbers placed on the arcs. Let's proceed step by step. # Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Assign Valuations to Points:**     - Red points = 0     - Blue points = 1     - Green points = 2 2. **Sum on the arcs depending on endpoints:**     Each number on an arc is the sum of the values at its endpoints:     - An arc between a red (0) and a blue (1) point gets a 1 (since (0 + 1 = 1)).     - An arc between a red (0) and a green (2) point gets a 2 (since (0 + 2 = 2)).     - An arc between a blue (1) and a green (2) point gets a 3 (since (1 + 2 = 3)). 3. **Calculate Sum of Values in Points:**     Summing up the values in all the points:     [     40 times 0 + 30 times 1 + 20 times 2 = 0 + 30 + 40 = 70     ] 4. **Doubling the Sum for Maximum Combination:**     According to the problem's hint, the maximum possible sum is achieved when all arcs are between differently colored points:     [     text{Max sum} = 2 times text{sum of values in points}     ]     [     text{Max sum} = 2 times 70 = 140     ] 5. **Constructing an Example:**     To ensure that this configuration is possible, we need to construct an example where each arc connects points of different colors:     - Let's place the 40 red points first evenly around the circle.     - Next, we place 30 blue points alternately between the red points, ensuring that each red point is adjacent to different colors.     - Finally, we place the 20 green points such that each remaining gap between a red and blue point can fit a green point. In this configuration: - Each red point (0) is adjacent to blue (1) or green (2). - Each blue point (1) is adjacent to red (0) or green (2). - Each green point (2) is adjacent to red (0) or blue (1). Thus, every arc involves different colors, ensuring all arcs contribute to the maximum possible sum as calculated. # Conclusion The maximum possible sum of the numbers placed on the arcs is: [ boxed{140} ]"},{"instruction":"The graph of ( y = g(x) ) from (4 leq x leq 4) consists of line segments and points.

The structure of the game revolves around breaking the chocolate along its grooves and giving the resulting pieces to the opponent. 4. **Key Insight:**    The size of the chocolate bar's pieces influences the game significantly:    - If ( M ) and ( N ) have the same highest power of 2 in their prime factorization, the position is losing.    - Otherwise, the position is winning. 5. **Detailed Explanation:**    To formalize, let’s define the highest power of 2 that divides ( M ) and ( N ):    - Let ( v_2(M) ) be the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides ( M ).    - Let ( v_2(N) ) be the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides ( N ). 6. **Winning and Losing Positions:**    - If ( v_2(M) = v_2(N) ), the initial position is losing for the first player.    - If ( v_2(M) neq v_2(N) ), the initial position is winning for the first player. 7. **Reasoning:**    - In a losing position, no matter how the player splits the chocolate, at least one of the resulting pieces will retain the same property that makes it a losing position.         - Conversely, in a winning position, the player can always force the opponent to deal with a losing position by making an appropriate split. 8. **Proof Outline:**    We will recursively divide the chocolates and check these properties until the smallest pieces are reached:        - Initial assumption: Chocolate of size ( 1 times 1 ) is a losing position as no further moves can be made.        - Larger chocolates can be divided strategically to impose a losing position on the opponent by ensuring at least one piece lands the opponent in a subgame that conforms to the ( v_2 ) property mentioned above. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The first player can guarantee a win if the highest power of 2 that divides } M text{ is different from the highest power of 2 that divides } N.} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a polynomial x^{2 n}+a_{1} x^{2 n2}+a_{2} x^{2 n4}+ldots+a_{n1} x^{2}+a_{n}, which is divisible by x1.

What percentage of the remaining bill is for overnight stays?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of the medication, which is 50% of the total bill: Medication cost = 50% of 5000 = 0.50 * 5000 = 2500 Now, let's subtract the medication cost from the total bill to find the remaining amount: Remaining bill = Total bill - Medication cost = 5000 - 2500 = 2500 We know that 175 of the remaining bill is for food and 1700 is for the ambulance ride. Let's subtract these amounts from the remaining bill to find the cost for overnight stays: Cost for overnight stays = Remaining bill - Food cost - Ambulance ride cost Cost for overnight stays = 2500 - 175 - 1700 = 625 Now, to find the percentage of the remaining bill that is for overnight stays, we divide the cost for overnight stays by the remaining bill (after medication cost is subtracted) and multiply by 100: Percentage for overnight stays = (Cost for overnight stays / Remaining bill) * 100 Percentage for overnight stays = (625 / 2500) * 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25% Therefore, boxed{25%}  of the remaining bill is for overnight stays."},{"instruction":"A student has to obtain a certain percentage of the total marks to pass.

First, let's convert the flow rate from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per minute (m/min) since the volume is given in cubic meters per minute (m³/min). Flow rate: 3 kmph 1 km = 1000 meters 3 km = 3 * 1000 meters = 3000 meters 1 hour = 60 minutes Flow rate in m/min = 3000 meters per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 50 m/min Now we know the river flows at a rate of 50 meters per minute. The volume of water flowing into the sea per minute is given as 4500 m³/min. We can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which in this case is a section of the river): Volume = Length * Width * Depth We know the volume (4500 m³/min), the depth (2 m), and the length (which is the distance the river travels in one minute, 50 m). We need to find the width (W). 4500 m³/min = 50 m * W * 2 m Now, we solve for W: 4500 m³/min = 100 m * W W = 4500 m³/min / 100 m W = 45 m So, the width of the river is boxed{45}  meters."},{"instruction":"We are given a circle with center O located at (0,0) and radius 10 units.

The Ministry of Health is proposing to reinstate job assignments for medical school graduates and make work in state medical institutions mandatory for all young doctors. (12 points) (a) Suppose the government introduces a minimum number of years that young doctors must work in state medical organizations after graduation (with the condition of studying in a statefunded place). Describe in general terms, using economic models, relevant graphs, and arguments, how the supply of doctors' labor, the demand for them, and the equilibrium wage might change. (b) In your opinion, how might the equilibrium price for commercial healthcare services change as a result? Argue your answer.","output":"Part (a): 1. **Introduction**: We begin by understanding the potential impact of a mandatory service period for new medical graduates in state healthcare institutions. This policy targets those who studied at public expense at medical universities. 2. **Initial Assumptions**:      - **Decrease in Demand for State-Funded Slots**: With a new obligation to work for a number of years in state institutions, we can initially expect a decrease in demand for state-funded education slots. Prospective students might be deterred by the mandatory service requirement.     - **Prospective Labor Supply**: This will likely lead to a short-term decrease in the supply of new doctors into the state healthcare system as fewer students choose this path. 3. **Economic Model - Supply and Demand Framework**:     - **Supply Curve Shift**: The introduction of mandatory service shifts the supply curve of new doctors to the left. This reflects a decrease in the overall number of new medical graduates entering the labor market for state healthcare jobs.     - **Demand Curve**: The demand for doctors in the state healthcare system remains unchanged in the short term, as the need for healthcare professionals is not immediately affected by policy changes. [ text{New equilibrium:} ]     - **New Equilibrium Wage**: With a reduced supply of doctors (supply curve shifting left), the equilibrium wage rate for doctors in the state healthcare sector will increase. Thus, the scarcity of doctors drives up the rewards for those available. 4. **Possible Long-Term Counter-Effect**:     - **Increased Motivation Due to Higher Wages**: Over time, the anticipated higher wages might attract more individuals to pursue medical education despite the mandatory state service requirement. Therefore, the initial drop in supply might stabilize or even reverse as future students factor in higher expected earnings. 5. **Visual Representation**:      - **Graph Analysis**: A supply and demand graph would illustrate the leftward shift in the supply curve, leading to a higher equilibrium wage (new intersection point of supply and demand). 6. **Conclusion for Part (a)**:     - **Net Impact**: Initially, the policy would decrease the number of new doctors (lower labor supply), increasing equilibrium wages in the state sector. Long-term adjustments might occur depending on the attractiveness of the higher wages to future students.  Part (b): 1. **Effect on Commercial Healthcare Sector**:     - **Shift in Student Decisions**: If some students avoid state-funded medical education due to mandatory service, they might choose private, fee-paying medical education instead.     - **Labor Supply to Commercial Sector**: As a result, there could be an increase in the number of graduates available to work in the commercial healthcare sector. 2. **Supply Increase in Commercial Sector**:     - **EFFECT**: The supply of doctors in the commercial healthcare sector will increase. This shift must be dynamically analyzed in terms of equilibrium pricing. 3. **Economic Outcome**:     - **Price Adjustment**: An increased supply of doctors in the commercial sector will likely drive down the equilibrium price for their services, assuming the demand for commercial healthcare services remains constant.    4. **Graph Analysis**:     - We would see a rightward shift in the supply curve in the commercial sector, resulting in a new equilibrium at a lower price level. 5. **Conclusion for Part (b)**:     - **Net Impact**: Increased supply of doctors in the commercial sector would lead to a decrease in the equilibrium price of commercial medical services. # Conclusion For Part (a): [ boxed{text{Increased equilibrium wage in the state healthcare sector.}} ] For Part (b): [ boxed{text{Decreased equilibrium price for commercial medical services.}} ]"},{"instruction":"a lottery, 6 numbers are drawn from 36 each week.

The centroid ( G ) of ( triangle DEF ) remains stationary, according to the problem statement. 3. **Noting the Implications of the Fly's Complete Perimeter Travel**:    Since one of the flies has traveled along the entire perimeter of ( triangle ABC ), it means that at different times, this fly has touched all three vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). 4. **Stationary Centroid at Vertices**:    When the fly at ( A ) moves to ( B ) or ( C ), the centroid ( G ) of the triangle it forms with the other two flies must stay at a fixed position.

A point ( (a, b) ) belongs to ( U ) if and only if ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ). Otherwise, for ( d = gcd(a, b) ), the point ( left( frac{a}{d}, frac{b}{d} right) ) will lie on the line from ( (a, b) ) to ( A ). Observe that the rays returning to ( A ) after ( n ) bounces are those originating towards vertices in ( V cap U ). For each ( (a, b) in V cap U ): - The segments bound by parallels to ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ) each reflect rays in ( triangle ABC ). - A line from ( A ) to ( (a, b) ) crosses ((a-1)) lines parallel to ( AB ), ( (b-1) ) lines parallel to ( AC ), and ( (a+b-1) ) lines parallel to ( BC ).  - Therefore, the line crosses a total of ( 2(a+b) - 3 ) reflections before reaching ( (a, b) ). We need ( n = 2(a+b) - 3 ) such that: 1. ( a equiv b~(text{mod}~3) ) 2. (gcd(a, b) = 1) **Conditions on ( n ):** If ( a + b ) is a multiple of 3, it is impossible to have both conditions simultaneously. Hence ( n ) is not a multiple of 3 nor multiple of 2. Also ( n equiv 1, 5, 7, 11 mod 12 ). By selecting pairs ( (1, 3k+1) ) for ( k = 0 ): [ n = 2(3k+2) - 3 = 6k + 1 ] This accounts for numbers ( n equiv 1 mod 6 ). Similarly: - For ( n equiv 5 mod 12 ):     ( (3k-1, 3k+5) ) for ( k ) even     ( (3k-4, 3k+8) ) for ( k ) odd which yields ( 6k+5 ). - For ( n equiv 11 mod 12 ):     ( (3k-1, 3k+2) ) for ( k geq 1 ) yield ( 12k - 1 ). Thus, all valid ( n notequiv 0 ) modulo 3 and odd are possible, excluding non-gcd pairs ( (2,2), (2,8), (5,5) ).

However, since the problem asks for the count of different last digits possible (and not the count of remainders), every digit from 0-9 is valid as a final digit, but their remainder groups do not all indicate divisibility by 7.

This changes our initial approach as all last digits can occur in multiple scenarios. Final answer: All last digits from 0 to 9 can appear in numbers divisible by 7 because their divisibility depends on the entire number rather than just the last digit. Therefore, Paul might find any last digit appearing in numbers he likes, but the ability to determine divisibility truly by last digit isn't feasible, unlike numbers divisible by 5.

We want to explore the condition under which ( a_{n+1} ) could also be a perfect square.        Assume ( a_{n+1} ) is also a perfect square. Then:        [    a_{n+1} = (k^2)^3 + 103 = k^6 + 103 = m^2    ]        for some integer ( m ).

Price including tax = Actual price of food + Sales tax Price including tax = 150 + 15 Price including tax = 165 Next, we calculate the tip, which is 20% of the price including tax. Tip = 20% of 165 Tip = 0.20 * 165 Tip = 33 Finally, we add the tip to the price including tax to get the total amount spent.

Since there are 7 balls in total (5 black and 2 white), the number of ways to pick 2 balls is given by the combination formula: C(total, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21 Next, calculate the number of ways to pick one black ball and one white ball. Since there are 5 black balls, there are 5 ways to pick a black ball. And since there are 2 white balls, there are 2 ways to pick a white ball. Therefore, the number of ways to pick one black and one white ball is: C(black, 1) * C(white, 1) = 5 * 2 = 10 Now, to find the probability of picking one black and one white ball, divide the number of ways to pick one black and one white ball by the total number of ways to pick any two balls: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes Probability = 10 / 21 So, the probability of picking one black and one white ball at the same time is boxed{10/21} ."},{"instruction":"The owner of a furniture shop charges his customer 15% more than the cost price for a computer table.

To start, let's denote the seven numbers in the set as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7 ).     2. According to the problem, for each ( a_i ), there should exist ( a_j ) and ( a_k ) (with ( j neq k ) and ( j, k neq i )) such that:    [    a_i = a_j cdot a_k    ] 3. Let's consider two specific cases to analyze possible solutions:        - **Case 1: The set consists of only ones**. If all the numbers are ( 1 ), then every number can be written as the product of any two other numbers in the set. Hence, one of the possible sets is:      [      { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 }      ]    All elements in this set follow the required rule because ( 1 = 1 cdot 1 ).        - **Case 2: The set includes ones and multiple copies of another number ( a )**. For example:      [      { 1, 1, 1, a, a, a, a }      ]      In this scenario:      - ( 1 = 1 cdot 1 )      - ( a = 1 cdot a ) or ( a = a cdot 1 )        Thus, this set also satisfies the condition for all numbers within the set. 4. It can be demonstrated that more generalized cases can always be built from Case 2 by varying the value of ( a ). For any real number ( a in mathbb{R} ), the set ( { 1, 1, 1, a, a, a, a } ) still fulfills the condition since the products involving  ( 1 ) and ( a ) hold consistently. 5. From the above analysis, it follows that there are infinitely many such sets because ( a ) can take any real value, thereby creating infinitely many variations of valid sets. # Conclusion: The number of different sets where each number is the product of two other numbers in the set is infinite.

Similarly, the slope of BC, k_{BC}, using the coordinates of B(2, 1) and C(1, 0) is: k_{BC} = frac{1 - 0}{2 - 1} = 1.

First, calculate the semi-perimeter (s): s = (10 + 30 + 21) / 2 s = (61) / 2 s = 30.5 cm Now, use Heron's formula to find the area (A): A = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] A = √[30.5(30.5 - 10)(30.5 - 30)(30.5 - 21)] A = √[30.5(20.5)(0.5)(9.5)] A = √[30.5 * 20.5 * 0.5 * 9.5] Now, calculate the product inside the square root: A = √[30.5 * 20.5 * 0.5 * 9.5] A = √[299.7375] Finally, take the square root to find the area: A ≈ √299.7375 A ≈ 17.31 cm² So, the area of the triangle is approximately boxed{17.31}  square centimeters."},{"instruction":") Given lines ( a, b, c, d ) passing through a common point, and a line ( l ) that does not pass through this point.

Let O be the point where the given lines a, b, c, d intersect. 2. Let H be the projection of point O onto the line l, and denote h = OH. 3. Define A, B, C, D as the points of intersection of the line l with the lines a, b, c, d respectively. 4. Since all triangles share a common altitude from point O to line l, the area for each triangle can be expressed as follows: [ begin{aligned} & 2 S_{OAC} = OA cdot OC sin angle(a, c) = h cdot AC,  & 2 S_{OBC} = OB cdot OC sin angle(b, c) = h cdot BC,  & 2 S_{OAD} = OA cdot OD sin angle(a, d) = h cdot AD,  & 2 S_{OBD} = OB cdot OD sin angle(b, d) = h cdot BD. end{aligned} ] 5.

Dividing the obtained ratios, we get: [ frac{frac{OA cdot sin angle(a, c)}{OB cdot sin angle(b, c)}}{frac{OA cdot sin angle(a, d)}{OB cdot sin angle(b, d)}} = frac{frac{AC}{BC}}{frac{AD}{BD}} ] This simplifies to: [ frac{OA cdot sin angle(a, c) / OB cdot sin angle(b, c)}{OA cdot sin angle(a, d) / OB cdot sin angle(b, d)} = frac{AC cdot BD}{BC cdot AD} ] Since the angles are preserved by the projections, we have: [ |(ABC)D| = |(abc)d| ] Thus, the cross-ratio of the points A, B, C, D on line l matches the cross-ratio of the lines a, b, c, d. [ |(ABCD)| = |(abcd)| ] 7. For proving that the cross ratios (ABCD) and (abcd) have the same sign, one can enumerate all possible placements of the points on the line and verify that there are 24 ways, ensuring (ABCD) is positive if and only if the pair of lines a, b does not separate the pair of lines c, d.

We start by recognizing that the notebook consists of 15 sheets, each folded to form 4 pages, making up a total of 60 pages. 1. **Determine the page numbers on the middle sheet**:     - The middle of the 15 sheets is the 8th sheet.     - The middle page numbers of a 60-page notebook can be determined easily by identifying the central pages.     - If a book has 60 pages, the middle of it would naturally lie between pages 30 and 31, thus these pages are written on the 8th sheet.     - On the same sheet as 30 and 31, we also find 29 and 32 because sheets are folded such that adjacent pages add up to 61: thus, 30 is paired with 31, and 29 with 32. 2. **Identify adjacent sheets**:     - Immediately before the middle sheet (7th) and immediately after (9th) contain paired pages.     - The 7th sheet contains pages that add up to 61 — i.e., 28 and 33, followed by 27 and 34.     - The 9th sheet also contains pages paired similarly: 26 is paired with 35, and 25 is paired with 36.

We can rewrite y' as:  y' = 3(x + 1)^2 + 3  Since (x + 1)^2 geq 0 for all x, the minimum value of y' occurs when (x + 1)^2 = 0.

Thus, statement A is incorrect because it fails under certain conditions. **Statement B:** If frac{a}{c^2} > frac{b}{c^2}, then by simplifying, we multiply both sides by c^2 (assuming c neq 0 and c^2 > 0), yielding a > b. This is straightforward, and no counterexample can be found. Hence, statement B is correct. **Statement C:** Given b > a > 0 and m > 0, we have b - a > 0. By rearranging the inequality frac{a+m}{b+m} > frac{a}{b}, we get frac{a+m}{b+m} - frac{a}{b} = frac{m(b-a)}{b(b+m)}. Since m > 0 and b - a > 0, the numerator m(b-a) is positive, and the denominator b(b+m) is also positive (since both b and m are positive).

First, we need to convert half an hour into seconds because the internet speed is given in megabytes per second (MBps). We know that 1 hour has 60 minutes, so half an hour has: [ frac{1}{2} times 60 = 30 text{ minutes} ] 2. Next, we convert the 30 minutes into seconds since there are 60 seconds in a minute: [ 30 times 60 = 1800 text{ seconds} ] 3. Now, we need to calculate how long it takes to download one song.

(2) The school plans to purchase a total of 30 units of the two types of equipment, with the requirement that the number of type A equipment should not be less than frac{1}{4} of the number of type B equipment. Let a be the number of units of type A equipment purchased, and the total cost be w yuan. Find the functional relationship between w and a, and determine the minimum purchase cost.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Finding the Unit Prices Let's denote the price of each unit of type B equipment as x yuan. Given that the price of type A equipment is 20% higher per unit than that of type B, the price of each unit of type A equipment can be expressed as 1.2x yuan. From the problem, we know that the number of units of type A equipment that can be purchased with 30,000 yuan is 4 more than the number of units of type B equipment that can be purchased with 15,000 yuan. This can be formulated as: [ frac{30000}{1.2x} = frac{15000}{x} + 4 ] Solving this equation for x, we proceed as follows: [ frac{30000}{1.2x} = frac{15000}{x} + 4 implies frac{30000}{1.2x} - frac{15000}{x} = 4 ] Multiplying through by 1.2x to clear the denominators gives: [ 30000 - 1.2 times 15000 = 4 times 1.2x implies 30000 - 18000 = 4.8x ] Simplifying further: [ 12000 = 4.8x implies x = frac{12000}{4.8} = 2500 ] Thus, we find that the price of each unit of type B equipment is x = 2500 yuan. Consequently, the price of each unit of type A equipment is 1.2x = 1.2 times 2500 = 3000 yuan. Therefore, the unit prices are: - Type B: boxed{2500 text{ yuan}} - Type A: boxed{3000 text{ yuan}}  Part 2: Finding the Minimum Purchase Cost Let a represent the number of units of type A equipment purchased. According to the problem, the number of type A equipment should not be less than frac{1}{4} of the number of type B equipment. This can be expressed as: [ a geqslant frac{1}{4}(30 - a) ] Solving for a, we get: [ a geqslant frac{30 - a}{4} implies 4a geqslant 30 - a implies 5a geqslant 30 implies a geqslant 6 ] The total cost w can be calculated based on the number of units purchased and their respective prices: [ w = 3000a + 2500(30 - a) = 500a + 75000 ] Given that the coefficient of a in the expression for w is positive (500 > 0), w increases as a increases. Therefore, to minimize w, we should choose the smallest possible value for a, which is 6. Substituting a = 6 into the expression for w gives: [ w = 500 times 6 + 75000 = 78000 ] Thus, the minimum purchase cost is boxed{78000 text{ yuan}}."},{"instruction":"Older television screens have an aspect ratio of   4: 3 .

They have one coin. How can they set up the draw so that everyone has an equal chance of running? **Reference Solution:** The outcome of some combination may have the meaning \\"repeat the draw.\\" Steps: 1. One possible way to solve this is as follows. Initially, flip the coin twice.    - If both flips result in heads (HH), the first person goes.    - If the first flip is heads and the second is tails (HT), the second person goes.    - If the first flip is tails and the second is heads (TH), the third person goes.    - If both flips result in tails (TT), repeat the draw. This means start the process again by flipping the coin twice. 2. The probability of each friend going on a single round can be calculated:    - Probability of HH (first person goes) = frac{1}{4}    - Probability of HT (second person goes) = frac{1}{4}    - Probability of TH (third person goes) = frac{1}{4}    - Probability of TT (repeat the draw) = frac{1}{4} 3. Hence, in each round, there is a frac{3}{4} chance that a winner is decided, and a frac{1}{4} chance the draw needs to be repeated. 4. **Theoretical Possibility of Infinite Loop:** Theoretically, it is possible for TT (repeat draw) to occur infinitely, meaning the process might never end. However, the probability of this happening can be examined:    - The probability that the process is not finished after n rounds is (frac{1}{4})^n.

From the given equation, we can see that: - The semi-major axis a^2 = 3, so a = sqrt{3}. - The semi-minor axis b^2 = 1, so b = 1. Given these values, we can determine the foci of the ellipse. For an ellipse with a semi-major axis a and a semi-minor axis b, the distance of each focus from the center is c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. However, this particular detail, while relevant for understanding the structure of the ellipse, does not directly influence the calculation of the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2} as provided in the solution. The solution leverages an elegant property of ellipses: the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to 2a. This property is crucial for solving the problem without needing to calculate the specific positions of A and B. Given that line passes through F_1 and intersects the ellipse at points A and B, we use the constant sum property to express the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2} as follows: - The distance |AB| can be thought of as the sum of |AF_1| + |BF_1|, since A and B are points on the ellipse and F_1 is one of the foci. - Thus, the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2} is |AB| + |AF_{2}| + |BF_{2}|. - Substituting the expression for |AB| from above, we get |AF_{1}| + |AF_{2}| + |BF_{1}| + |BF_{2}|. - Since |AF_{1}| + |AF_{2}| = |BF_{1}| + |BF_{2}| = 2a (the constant sum property of the ellipse), the total perimeter becomes 2a + 2a = 4a.

Since (9(m - n)) is a perfect cube, and the maximum possible value of (|9(m - n)| < 9 times 9 = 81). Therefore, we consider the cubes less than 81: (1, 8, 27, 64). 5.

Now, Box A has 200 turned-on flashlights and 200 turned-off flashlights, while Box B is empty.     - Let ( L ) denote turned-on flashlights     - Let ( D ) denote turned-off flashlights     So, initially:     [     text{Box A: } 100L + 100D     ]     [     text{Box B: } 100L + 100D     ]          After moving all from Box B to Box A:     [     text{Box A now: } 200L + 200D     ]     [     text{Box B now: } 0L + 0D     ] 4. **Second Step**: Now we need to move 100 flashlights back from Box A to Box B.

A answers one of the first three questions incorrectly and both of the last two questions correctly. Given that the probability of answering the first three questions correctly is frac{1}{2} each, and the probability of answering the last two questions correctly is frac{1}{3} each, we calculate as follows: - For the first scenario, the probability is simply the product of the probabilities of answering the first three questions correctly:  {(frac{1}{2})}^{3} = frac{1}{8}. - For the second scenario, we calculate the probability of answering at least one of the last two questions correctly after answering the first three questions correctly. This is the complement of answering both incorrectly, so we use the combination formula to account for the different ways to choose which questions are answered correctly: {C}_{3}^{2}×{(frac{1}{2})}^{3}×[1-{(frac{2}{3})}^{2}] = 3×frac{1}{8}×left(1-frac{4}{9}right) = frac{3}{8}×frac{5}{9} = frac{15}{72}. - For the third scenario, we calculate the probability of answering one of the first three questions incorrectly and both of the last two questions correctly: {C}_{3}^{1}×{(frac{1}{2})}^{3}×{(frac{1}{3})}^{2} = 3×frac{1}{8}×frac{1}{9} = frac{3}{72}. Adding these probabilities together gives us the total probability of A advancing to the next round: P(A) = frac{1}{8} + frac{15}{72} + frac{3}{72} = frac{9+15+3}{72} = frac{27}{72} = frac{3}{8}. Therefore, the probability of A advancing to the next round is boxed{frac{3}{8}}. **Part 2:** To determine which way of participation increases the chances of the class team succeeding, we calculate the probabilities P_{1} and P_{2} for Way 1 and Way 2, respectively. - For Way 1, the probability of at least one of the two students answering correctly in a group is 1-left(1-pright)^{2}. Therefore, the probability of all groups passing is: {P}_{1}={[1-{(1-p)}^{2}]}^{n}={p}^{n}{(2-p)}^{n}. - For Way 2, the probability of one group passing the round is p^{n}, and thus the probability of at least one of the two groups passing is: {P}_{2}=1-{(1-{p}^{n})}^{2}={p}^{n}(2-{p}^{n}). To compare {P}_{1} and {P}_{2}, we look at their difference: {P}_{1}-{P}_{2}={p}^{n}[(2-p)^{n}+{p}^{n}-2]. Let fleft(nright)=left(2-pright)^{n}+p^{n}-2. We analyze the change in f(n) as n increases: fleft(n+1right)-fleft(nright)=left(1-pright)[left(2-pright)^{n}-p^{n}] > 0, since 0 < p < 1, implying f(n) is monotonically increasing. Given fleft(2right)=2left(p-1right)^{2} > 0 and for ngeqslant 10, fleft(nright) > 0, it follows that {P}_{1} > {P}_{2}.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists some triangle ( ACD ) where ( f(AC) + f(AD) = f(CD) ). 3. **Contradiction Argument:**    By the maximality of ( M ), the edge weights of triangle ( BCD ) are ( {M - f(AC), M - f(AD), f(AC) + f(AD)} ). We need to check if we can add two of these to make the third:    - If ( f(CD) = M ), then ( f(AC) + f(AD) = M ), which contradicts the distinctness of edge weights.    - If ( f(CD) = 0 ), then ( f(AC) = f(AD) = M ), which again contradicts the distinctness of edge weights.    Therefore, ( A ) must be weak. 4. **Construct Vertex Labeling:**    Set ( w(A) = 0 ) and for each other vertex ( X ), set ( w(X) = f(AX) ). By construction, this vertex labeling works on all edges incident to ( A ). 5. **Verify Vertex Labeling for Other Edges:**    Consider an arbitrary edge ( XY ) not containing ( A ). Since ( A ) is weak, we can assume without loss of generality that ( w(X) < w(Y) ). Then ( AY ) is the large edge of triangle ( AXY ), and we obtain:    [    f(XY) = f(AY) - f(AX) = w(Y) - w(X)    ]    This means that our vertex labeling works on ( XY ), so it works on all edges.

How many eyes are there in total among Nina’s pet insects?","output":"First, let's calculate the total number of eyes for the spiders. Since each spider has 8 eyes and Nina has 3 spiders, the total number of eyes for the spiders is: 3 spiders * 8 eyes/spider = 24 eyes Next, let's calculate the total number of eyes for the ants.

Hence, the next gnome should logically be taller than 61 cm, and so on.    - If any two or more gnomes were telling the truth, the order would be violated since a taller gnome would claim a lower height. 3. **Detect contradictions**:    - If the first (tallest) gnome claimed \\"My height is 60 cm\\", yet the others need to be taller but also claimed incrementally higher numbers, it results in every single gnome's claim contradicting the actual order as specified. 4. **Count the truth-telling possibilities**:    - However, if any single gnome’s claim matched their actual height, it still doesn't conflict with another claim because only one truth-telling scenario fits well with the pattern provided their height is exactly their claim. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, the only configuration where the claims could potentially be true is when any single gnome tells the truth about their height, and the others don't.

Solving this equation yields: R = 4r,   The area of the base, S_{text{base}} = pi r^2,   The lateral surface area of the cone, S_{text{lateral}} = frac{1}{2} times 2pi r times R = pi r times 4r = 4pi r^2,   Thus, the ratio of the lateral surface area to the base area is 4pi r^2 : pi r^2 = 4:1.

By setting the radius of the base circle as r and the radius of the unfolded sector as R, and knowing that the arc length of the cone's lateral surface equals the circumference of the base, we can find R=4r, and then calculate the area of the circle and the sector to solve the problem.

How much did he invest?","output":"Let's denote the amount the man invested as \\"I\\" and the number of shares he bought as \\"N\\". Since the shares are bought at a 20% premium, the price per share is Rs. 100 + 20% of Rs. 100, which is Rs. 120. The dividend per share is 5% of the face value (Rs. 100), which is Rs. 5. The total dividend the man receives is Rs. 600, which is the dividend per share (Rs. 5) multiplied by the number of shares (N). So, we have the equation: 5 * N = 600 Solving for N: N = 600 / 5 N = 120 Now, we know the number of shares he bought is 120. To find out how much he invested, we multiply the number of shares by the price per share: I = N * Price per share I = 120 * 120 I = Rs. 14,400 Therefore, the man invested Rs. boxed{14,400} ."},{"instruction":"y uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies.

This system is a pair of linear equations in (x) and (y) with rational coefficients and rational constants derived from the initial rational coordinates. 7. From linear algebra, we know that a system of linear equations with rational coefficients and rational constants has rational solutions if it has any solutions at all. 8.

There are two types of faces on the prism: triangular and quadrilateral. **Case 1: Adding the Pyramid to a Triangular Face** - The pyramid covers one triangular face of the prism, so we subtract 1 face. - It adds 1 new vertex (the apex of the pyramid). - It adds 3 new edges (from the apex to the vertices of the base triangle). - It adds 3 new faces (the sides of the pyramid).

Similarly, we can identify the white region in this one quadrant:     - The white region consists of three equal triangles. 4. Since all four quadrants are symmetrical, the same analysis applies to the other three quadrants.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Case 1: A is the last one.**    - Since A cannot win the championship, and if A is the last, then B can be in second, third, or fourth place. This leaves three positions for B.    - The remaining three students (excluding A and B, who have their positions fixed in this scenario) can be arranged in all possible ways for the first, second, and third places. The number of ways to arrange three students in three positions is {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ways.    - Therefore, the total number of possibilities in this case is 3 times {A}_{3}^{3} = 3 times 6 = 18. 2. **Case 2: A is not the last one.**    - In this scenario, A and B must be in the second, third, or fourth place. The number of ways to arrange A and B in these three positions is {A}_{3}^{2} = frac{3!}{(3-2)!} = 3 times 2 = 6 ways.    - The remaining three students (C, D, and E) can be arranged in the first, fifth, and one of the remaining positions. The number of ways to arrange these three students is {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ways.    - Therefore, the total number of possibilities in this case is {A}_{3}^{2} times {A}_{3}^{3} = 6 times 6 = 36. Combining both cases, the total number of different ranking scenarios is 36 + 18 = 54. To find the scenarios where C and D win the top two places, we consider: - C and D can be arranged in the top two places in {A}_{2}^{2} = 2! = 2 ways. - The remaining three places can be filled by A, B, and E. Since A and B cannot be last, we have two scenarios for arranging A and B (either A before B or B before A) and one fixed place for E. This gives us {A}_{2}^{2} + {A}_{2}^{2} = 2 + 2 = 4 ways. - Therefore, the total number of possibilities for C and D to win the top two places is 2 times 4 = 8.

Expanding this gives us 2+frac{b}{a}+frac{2a}{b}. According to the basic inequality, for any positive real numbers x and y, we have x+ygeq 2sqrt{xy}, with equality holding if and only if x=y. Applying this inequality to frac{b}{a} and frac{2a}{b}, we get frac{b}{a}+frac{2a}{b}geq 2sqrt{2}, with equality holding if and only if frac{b}{a}=frac{2a}{b}, which simplifies to b=sqrt{2}a.

When a geq 0, we have f'(x) > 0 for all x in the domain, which means f(x) is strictly increasing on the interval (1, +infty).   When a < 0, setting f'(x) = 0 gives x = 1 - frac{1}{a}. Therefore,   - for x in (1, 1 - frac{1}{a}), we have f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is strictly increasing, and   - for x in (1 - frac{1}{a}, +infty), we have f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is strictly decreasing.

Let   g(x) = frac{2ln x + bx}{2x},    then its derivative is   g'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}.    This implies that g(x) is strictly increasing on (1, e) and strictly decreasing on (e, +infty).

If two corner squares are cut out, we are left with 62 squares. The rectangular block that is equal to 2 squares of the chessboard can be placed in two orientations: horizontally or vertically.  Let's calculate for both orientations: 1. Horizontally:  Each block covers 2 squares horizontally. Since the chessboard is 8 squares wide, we can fit 4 such blocks in one row (because 8 divided by 2 is 4). However, since the corners are cut out, we lose one possible placement for a block in the first and last rows. So, for the first and last rows, we can only place 3 blocks each. For the remaining 6 rows (since 2 out of 8 rows are affected by the cut corners), we can place 4 blocks each.  So, horizontally, we can place: (3 blocks * 2 rows) + (4 blocks * 6 rows) = 6 + 24 = 30 blocks 2. Vertically: Each block covers 2 squares vertically. Since the chessboard is 8 squares tall, we can fit 4 such blocks in one column (because 8 divided by 2 is 4). However, since the corners are cut out, we lose one possible placement for a block in the first and last columns. So, for the first and last columns, we can only place 3 blocks each.

Cover a cube with an edge length of 1 in two layers using this strip (the strip can be bent but not cut).","output":"1. Consider the given rectangular strip of dimensions 12 times 1. We need to use this strip to cover a cube with edge length 1 in two layers. 2. First, visualize the strip as several segments of length 1. To cover the cube, we will need to fold the strip strategically.  3. Note that each face of the cube has an area of 1 times 1 = 1. Since the cube has 6 faces, the total surface area of the cube is 6 square units. To cover the cube in two layers, we need to cover an area of 2 times 6 = 12 square units.  4. Given that the strip also has an area of 12 times 1 = 12 square units, it confirms that the strip has exactly enough area to cover the cube in two layers. 5. To proceed, we fold the strip following the pattern indicated in the given diagram. The dashed lines in the top part of the diagram show where the strip should be folded, while the shaded areas in the bottom part illustrate the back side of the strip. 6. We number the views for convenience and clarity, ensuring that adjacent faces on the cube are covered without overlaps and all parts of the strip are used efficiently.  7. We can number the cube's faces from 1 to 6 such that the sum of the numbers on opposite faces equals 7. For example, if face 1 is opposite to face 6, face 2 to face 5, and face 3 to face 4. This numbering will help us keep track of the faces as we fold the strip around the cube. 8. After these preliminary steps, we review the diagrams to fold the strip correctly:     - The strip covers faces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in consecutive folds.     - Fold the strip at each unit to wrap around the cube, and ensure that with each fold, the strip aligns properly with the edge of the cube. # Conclusion: Following these steps with the given strip dimensions and folding method ensures the cube is fully and uniformly covered in two layers.

Thus, each step in our path would move from a vertex to a face center or from a face center to a vertex.    - This alternation occurs because each diagonal on a face connects either two vertices or a vertex and a center, but since centers are at face diagonals, each transition must alternate vertices and centers. 4. **Checking the alternation condition:**    - Given that there are (8) vertices and (6) face centers, this alternation must maintain the condition that the number of transitions matches the number of available vertices and centers.    - In other words, for every face center step, a vertex step is needed and vice versa. 5. **Possible contradiction:**    - Since the path alternates between vertices and centers, one type of point (either vertices or centers) must be encountered one more time for a closed path (eulerian path) to be possible.    - However, in the case of 8 vertices and 6 centers, we observe that if we start at a vertex, the alternation pattern would miss the proper matching since it will result in an imbalance:      - The number of vertices exceeds the centers by 2.     6. **Conclusion:**    - Because of this imbalance, it is not possible to create a path that traverses all points (vertices and centers) exactly once using the diagonals of the faces of the cube as specified.

For overline{PQ}: The equation of the line can be parametrized as ell(t) = P + t(Q - P) = (4,4) + t((-2,-2) - (4,4)) = (4,4) + t(-6,-6) = (4-6t, 4-6t).

Moreover, ( G' ) has strictly more triangles if ( G ) contains any fatal vertices. 3. **Proof of the Claim:**    - Any triangle in ( G ) persists in ( G' ) because the vertices of the triangle have common neighbors and hence, form a triangle in ( G' ).    - If ( v ) is a fatal vertex in ( G ), then its neighbors, which are not all mutually adjacent in ( G ), form a clique in ( G' ).

The possible connected components are:    - Cliques (including single vertices),    - Cycles,    - Paths. 5. **Assumption of Connectivity:**    - Assuming ( G ) is connected does not lose generality because ( G ) could be a disjoint union ( G = G_1 sqcup G_2 ) where ( G_1' cong G_2 ) and ( G_2' cong G_1 ). 6. **Stability Under Operations:**    We find that the following components are stable under the operation of forming ( G' ):    - Isolated vertex,    - Cycle of odd length,    - Clique with at least three vertices.    Since these components are stable, it holds that ( G cong (G'') ) for these types of graphs. 7. **Non-Stability of Other Components:**    - Cycles of even length or paths of nonzero length do not remain stable. Such components break into more connected components when we take ( G' ). 8. **Conclusion on Connected Components:**    A graph ( G ) with any of the unstable components will not satisfy ( G cong (G'') ) because ( G' ) will have more connected components than ( G ), and ( (G'') ) will have at least as many components as ( G' ). 9. **Final Conclusion:**    Therefore, ( G cong (G'') ) if and only if ( G ) is a disjoint union of isolated vertices, odd cycles, and cliques of at least three vertices.

Therefore, the values of a and b are boxed{3} and boxed{2}, respectively."},{"instruction":"f x+frac1x=3, what is x^3+frac1{x^3}?","output":"Using the identity (x + frac{1}{x})^3 = x^3 + 3x + frac{3}{x} + frac{1}{x^3} and knowing x + frac{1}{x} = -3, we start by cubing -3:  (-3)^3 = -27  Thus:  (x + frac{1}{x})^3 = -27 = x^3 + 3x + frac{3}{x} + frac{1}{x^3}  Also, we use 3(x + frac{1}{x}) = 3(-3) = -9 to find 3x + frac{3}{x}:  3x + frac{3}{x} = -9  Substituting back:  -27 = x^3 + frac{1}{x^3} - 9  So:  x^3 + frac{1}{x^3} = -27 + 9 = boxed{-18}"},{"instruction":"Find ( x ) if ( frac{x^2  11x + 24}{x3} + frac{4x^2 + 20x  32}{2x  4} = 0 ).","output":"Start by factoring the numerators: 1.

Will the Wolf notice Red Riding Hood if he can smell prey at a distance of no more than 45 meters?","output":"To solve the problem, we will analyze the distances and the dynamics of the two characters involved - Red Riding Hood (Красная Шапочка) and the Grey Wolf (Серый Волк). 1. **Initial Setup:**    - Red Riding Hood is walking along a path at a speed of (6) km/h.    - The Grey Wolf is running perpendicular to the path through the clearing at a speed of (8) km/h. 2. **Distance Calculation in a Moving Coordinate System:**    - When Red Riding Hood crosses the path intersection, the distance the Wolf has to travel to the path is (80) meters.    - We can solve this in a moving coordinate system where Red Riding Hood is stationary. 3. **Shortest Distance Calculation:**    - In the moving coordinate system, Red Riding Hood does not move, and the Wolf's path becomes a straight line.    - Using similarity considerations, the shortest distance from a point to a line is given by:    [    d = 80 cdot sin alpha    ]    where (sin alpha = frac{3}{5}). 4. **Solution Calculation:**    - Substituting the value of (sin alpha):    [    d = 80 times frac{3}{5} = 48 text{ meters}    ]    - Since (48 text{ meters} > 45 text{ meters}), the shortest distance the Wolf can sense is larger than (45) meters, hence the Wolf will not be able to notice Red Riding Hood. 5. **Alternative Solution:**    - Calculate the geometric relation of the distance between the Wolf and Red Riding Hood over time using the Pythagorean theorem.    - Let (t) be the time elapsed after Red Riding Hood crosses.    - Red Riding Hood’s position from the clearing is (6t) meters.    - The distance the Wolf has covered from the clearing is (80 - 8t) meters.

This implies that:    [    x < a, quad y < b, quad z < c    ]    Therefore, the reciprocals of the angle bisectors are greater than the reciprocals of the sides:    [    frac{1}{x} > frac{1}{a}, quad frac{1}{y} > frac{1}{b}, quad frac{1}{z} > frac{1}{c}    ] 5. **Summing the Inequalities:**    Summing these inequalities, we get:    [    frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} > frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}    ] Thus, we have shown that the sum of the reciprocals of the angle bisectors is greater than the sum of the reciprocals of the sides of the triangle.

So, in 12 years, Walt will be W + 12 years old, and the music teacher will be 3W + 12 years old. According to the information, at that time, the music teacher will be twice as old as Walt, so we can write the equation: 3W + 12 = 2(W + 12) 3. The physics teacher is currently four times as old as Walt, so the physics teacher's current age is 4W. 4. When the physics teacher retires in 15 years, he will be 4W + 15 years old, and Walt will be W + 15 years old.

According to the problem's requirement that the directrix is tangent to the circle, we can deduce that the distance from the circle's center to the directrix is equal to the radius of the circle.

However, if we ignore the actual trigonometric values and focus on the pattern of the sequence, we can try to deduce the next function and angle based on the given information. The sequence of functions is alternating between tangent, cosine, sine, cosine, and sine. If this pattern continues, the next function in the sequence would be tangent again. The sequence of angles is increasing: 45°, 60°, 90°, 180°, 270°. If we look at the pattern of the angles, there isn't a clear arithmetic progression. However, we can notice that the angles are significant in trigonometry: 45° and 60° are angles in a right triangle, 90° is a right angle, 180° is a straight angle, and 270° is an angle that corresponds to the negative y-axis on the unit circle. If we continue with significant angles in trigonometry, the next angle after 270° that is commonly referenced is 360°, which corresponds to a full circle. So, if we follow the pattern of functions and choose significant angles, the next function and angle could be tan(360°). However, tan(360°) is actually 0, not 6. Since the pattern does not follow the actual values of the trigonometric functions, we can only guess the next function and angle based on the given sequence. If we continue the pattern of alternating functions and choose the next significant angle, we would have: f(x°) = tan(360°) = 6 But this is not correct based on actual trigonometric values.

The total marks of the 7 excluded students is ( 7 times 70 = 490 ), so the total marks of the remaining students is ( T - 300 - 165 - 490 ). Therefore, we have ( (N - 15) times 100 = T - 300 - 165 - 490 ). Now we have a system of equations: [ begin{align*} N times 85 &= T  (N - 5) times 90 &= T - 300  (N - 8) times 95 &= T - 300 - 165  (N - 15) times 100 &= T - 300 - 165 - 490 end{align*} ] We can solve this system step by step. First, let's express ( T ) from the first equation: ( T = N times 85 ) Now, let's substitute ( T ) in the second equation: ( (N - 5) times 90 = N times 85 - 300 ) Expanding and simplifying: ( 90N - 450 = 85N - 300 ) ( 5N = 150 ) ( N = 30 ) So, there were originally boxed{30}  students in the class."},{"instruction":"Given f(x) = begin{cases}  1 & text{for } x in [0,1],  x3 & text{for } x notin [0,1], end{cases} find the range of values of x for which f(f(x))=1.

Since the total area of the hexagon is equal to the sum of the areas of all the parallelograms, we have:    [    N cdot s = S    ] 2. **Chain of Parallelograms**:     - Consider an arbitrary parallelogram KLMN within the hexagon.    - Construct a chain of parallelograms with sides parallel to KL.    - This chain will end on one of the sides of the hexagon, implying that the side KL of the parallelogram is parallel to one of the sides of the hexagon. 3. **Orientation**:    - Therefore, the sides of all the parallelograms are parallel to the sides of the hexagon. 4. **Vertical Parallelograms**:    - Focus on the figure formed by all parallelograms whose sides are parallel to the side AB of the hexagon (consider this side to be vertical).    - This figure can be divided into chains of parallelograms, starting from AB and ending at DE.    - Each chain includes parallelograms with a constant vertical side a. 5. **Total Height of Chains**:    - The sum of the horizontal heights h of these parallelograms equals the distance h between AB and DE. 6. **Area Calculation**:    - The total area of such a chain is a cdot h.    - The sum of the \\"initial\\" sides (starting at AB) of all these chains equals AB.    - Therefore, the total area of the entire figure (composed of such chains) is 2S / 3 (since this is one-third of the hexagon's area). 7. **Number of Parallelograms**:    - Consequently, the number of parallelograms with area s and sides parallel to AB is 2S / (3s).    - This simplifies to 2N / 3 (because each chain consists of N / 3 parallelograms considering the hexagon’s total area split among similar chains). 8. **Conclusion**:    - Since the number of parallelograms 2N / 3 must be an integer, it implies that N must be a multiple of 3.

We denote the angles at these vertices as alpha, beta, and gamma respectively. According to the problem, A Y = Y C and A B = Z C. 1. First, we'll apply the Law of Sines to triangle ABC:     [     frac{sin angle ABY}{sin angle AYB} = frac{AY}{AB} = frac{CY}{CZ} = frac{sin angle CZY}{sin angle CYZ}.     ] 2. Since A Y = Y C, we have angle AYC = angle AYB and angle CYZ = angle ABY. Next, considering the sum of the angles in a triangle, we get:     [     angle ABY + angle CYZ = 180^circ.     ]     Therefore:     [     sin angle ABY = sin angle CZY.     ] 3. Considering the orientation of these angles, we note that both are less than 180^circ, so there are two cases: 4. Case 1: angle ABY = angle CZY     - With this condition, we have:     [     angle ABY + angle X Z Y = angle ABY + (180^circ - angle CZY) = 180^circ.     ] 5. Consequently, BXYZ forms a cyclic quadrilateral, implying that B, X, Y, Z all lie on a single circle. This confirms that they are concyclic in this configuration. 6. Case 2: angle ABY = 180^circ - angle CZY     - In this case:     [     angle ABY = beta quad text{and} quad angle AZC = beta.     ]     - Given triangle AYC is isosceles with A Y = Y C, it follows that angle CAY = gamma.

Considering that X and Y are internal points, alpha = angle BAC > angle YAC = gamma. Hence 180^circ - beta as derived earlier (Case 2) does not fit.

For two-digit numbers, let's denote ( x ) as ( 10a + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are digits (0 through 9), then the product of its digits is ( ab ). 2. **Equate Product to Polynomial Expression**:    - For single-digit ( x ), we have:       [      x = x^2 - 10x - 22.      ]      Rearranging the equation:      [      x^2 - 11x - 22 = 0.      ]      Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ):      [      x = frac{11 pm sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-22)}}{2 cdot 1},      ]      [      x = frac{11 pm sqrt{121 + 88}}{2},      ]      [      x = frac{11 pm sqrt{209}}{2}.      ]      Since ( sqrt{209} ) is not an integer, there are no natural number solutions for single-digit ( x ).    - For two-digit ( x = 10a + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) need to be digits in the decimal system,      we must satisfy:      [      ab = (10a + b)^2 - 10(10a + b) - 22.      ]      This simplifies and can be checked by trial for ( 10 leq 10a + b leq 99 ). 3. **Testing Feasible Two-Digit Combinations**:    By testing for feasible ( a ) and ( b ) that maintain ( ab ), test each ( a ) and ( b ) within their valid range.     4. **Conclusion after testing valid pairs**:    Testing a few representative pairs:    - For ( x = 18 ):      [      1 cdot 8 = 8,      ]      [      18^2 - 10 times 18 - 22 = 324 - 180 - 22 = 122.      ]      Mismatch, so ( 18 ) is not a solution.

The number of natural numbers not exceeding n and not divisible by any number in D equals nprod_{p in D} left(1 - frac{1}{p} right). 3. **Proof of Lemma**:    - Unraveling this inclusion-exclusion formula, we assert that considering all numbers up to n and excluding those divisible by the primes gives us a count, effectively varphi(n). 4. **Contradiction**:    - Assume there are more red numbers than varphi(n). Consequently, some red numbers must share a common prime factor with n. Let q be the largest such prime factor, and W be a red number divisible by q.    - We will aim for a contradiction involving finding distinct red numbers b and c congruent modulo leftlfloor frac{n}{q} rightrfloor. For achieving this, show varphi(n) is at least the count of possible remainders of red numbers modulo leftlfloor frac{n}{q} rightrfloor. 5. **Sets and Remainders**:    - Let D' be the set of prime divisors of n greater than q. Red numbers are not divisible by numbers in D', meaning remainders of their divisions by leftlfloor frac{n}{q} rightrfloor also aren't divisible by any in D'.    - By the lemma, varphileft(leftlfloor frac{n}{q} rightrfloor right) = leftlfloor frac{n}{q} rightrfloor prod_{pin D', p<q}left(1 - frac{1}{p}right), which simplifies to 1 since by assumption q interrelates within bounds. 6. **Conclusion**:    - The remainder count by modulo operation matches varphi(n); if this behavior disrupts, a contradiction forms. Ensuring remainder dynamics settle, and varphi balances the equation above sustains modulo-division predictability. Thus, the proof assimilates underlining varphi(n) philosophically represents a feasible boundary for counting red numbers without contradiction.

Ihre Grenzen wurden im Wesentlichen von der Kolonialmacht Belgien geprägt., Die vorkoloniale Geschichte der Demokratischen Republik Kongo ist vor allem von mehreren Bantu-Reichen geprägt. Sie gingen nach über drei Jahrhunderten der Plünderung durch den europäischen und arabischen Sklavenhandel sämtlich in einer im Wesentlichen belgischen Kolonialherrschaft unter. Nach deren Ende 1960 und einem nachfolgenden Bürgerkrieg litt das Land ab 1965 unter einer über drei Jahrzehnte währenden Diktatur. Deren Ende 1997 war zugleich der Beginn einer Folge von Kriegen, die die ehemalige amerikanische Außenministerin Madeleine Albright den „ersten Weltkrieg in Afrika“ nannte und die – einschließlich des unmittelbar folgenden Kivu-Krieges – bis 2008 5,4 Millionen Menschen das Leben kosteten., Vor- und Frühgeschichte., Die ältesten menschlichen Überreste fanden sich am Fundplatz Ishango (s. a. Ishango-Knochen). Sie reichen bis in die Zeit vor 25.000 bis 20.000 Jahren zurück., Bereits länger bekannte Besiedlungsspuren auf dem Gebiet der heutigen Demokratischen Republik Kongo datieren bis etwa 10.000 v. Chr. zurück. Ab 2.500 v. Chr. lassen sich in den Regenwaldregionen Einwohner der Jäger- und Sammlergesellschaften der Pygmäen belegen. Um 800 v. Chr. wanderten Sudangruppen und Niloten aus Nord- und Ostafrika zu und brachten erste Viehzucht- sowie Agrartechniken mit (siehe Imbonga-Horizont)., Eisenzeit., Expansion der Bantu., Ab dem 5. Jahrhundert begannen die anfangs nur im äußersten Nordwesten Zentralafrikas siedelnden Bantuvölker allmählich nach Süden zu expandieren. Beschleunigt wurde ihre Ausbreitung durch den Übergang von steinzeitlichen hin zu eisenzeitlichen Techniken (der in Zentralafrika anders als etwa in Europa erst zu dieser Zeit begann). Während die im Süden und Südwesten lebenden Völker zumeist Fischer und Waldlandpflanzer waren, deren Technik durch die Entwicklung von Metallen nur wenig beeinflusst wurde, revolutionierten die in dieser Periode entwickelten Metallwerkzeuge Agrikultur und Viehhaltung und führten so zur Verdrängung der Gesellschaften der Jäger und Sammler im Osten und Südosten. Im 10. Jahrhundert war die Expansion der Bantu in West-Zentralafrika abgeschlossen. Ansteigende Bevölkerungszahlen ermöglichten zugleich anfangs lokale, später regionale und überregionale Handelsnetze, die vor allem Salz, Eisen und Kupfer handelten., Upemba-Kulturen., In der Upemba-Senke, einer knapp 200km langen Region entlang des Lualaba im Norden der heutigen Provinz Katanga, begann sich ab dem fünften Jahrhundert eine kulturelle Tradition zu entwickeln. Sie mündete letztlich in die Kultur des Luba-Königreiches. Diese Entwicklung verlief zwar nicht ohne Brüche, verschiedene Gesellschaften und Kulturen folgten dabei aufeinander; aber sie entstanden jeweils aus der Vorgängerkultur und nutzten diese als Fundament ihrer eigenen Gesellschaft., Im fünften Jahrhundert begann diese Tradition mit der Entstehung der Kultur um Kamilamba am Kabambasee, die mit der beginnenden Eisenzeit im achten Jahrhundert von der kisalischen Kultur um die Städte Sanga und Katongo am Kisalesee abgelöst wurde. Diese Kultur begann in der erzreichen Region mit der Bearbeitung von Kupfer und Eisen. Vor allem in der Spätphase wurden diese Rohstoffe mit großem Geschick verarbeitet, ebenso wie Elfenbein und Ton., Die Kombination aus einer starken Nachfrage nach Metallerzeugnissen und der Existenz eines frühen, aber bereits weitreichenden Handelsnetzes (die Handelsverbindungen reichten über 1500km weit bis zum Indischen Ozean) mit guten landwirtschaftlichen Bedingungen und Fisch- und Wildreichtum machte die Region so wohlhabend, dass Städte entstehen konnten und eine Zentralisierung auf ein Häuptlingssystem hin einsetzte. Diese Entwicklung setzte sich zunehmend durch und gipfelte in der gegen Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts beginnenden Ära des Luba-Königreiches., Präkoloniale Königreiche., Ab dem 13. Jahrhundert bis zum Anfang des 16. Jahrhunderts entstanden und vergingen auf dem Gebiet der heutigen Demokratischen Republik Kongo eine Reihe teils sehr mächtiger Königreiche, darunter als bedeutendste das Königreich Kongo, die Kuba-Föderation sowie die Königreiche der Luba und der Lunda., Königreich der Luba., Im 16. Jahrhundert entstand im Südosten des heutigen Katanga das Königreich der Baluba, das sich selbst auf den mythischen Gründer Kongolo zurückführte, der mit Getreuen mehrere Häuptlingsdörfer eroberte und zu einem weiterhin wachsenden Reich vereinte. Das Lubareich entstand aus der Tradition der Kulturen in der Upemba-Senke und war, anders als die umliegenden Häuptlingsgesellschaften, zentralistisch organisiert. Das Königtum der Luba war als Amt zwar mächtig, aber nicht dynastisch verankert. So kam es immer wieder zu Kämpfen um den Thron, die das Reich schwächten und für seinen späteren Zerfall mit ursächlich waren., Bereits der Gründervater Kongolo wurde Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts von Ilunga Mbidi getötet. Das Reich wurde unruhig und instabil. In den kommenden rund hundert Jahren herrschten drei Dynastien, was ein Zeichen der Schwäche der Monarchie war. Trotzdem erreichte das Lubareich Ende des 17. Jahrhunderts unter Kumwimbu Ngombé seine größte Ausdehnung bis an die Ufer des Tanganjikasees., Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts beherrschte das Königreich den Süden Katangas bis in das heutige Simbabwe hinein, danach begann es allmählich durch die ständigen Bürgerkriege um den Herrschersitz zu zerfallen. 1889 spaltete sich die königliche Linie und das Königreich löste sich im Kampf gegen die Chokwe auf., Einer der Söhne Kongolos verließ Anfang des 17. Jahrhunderts das Königreich und wurde zum Begründer des Lunda-Reichs., Kuba-Föderation., Die Kuba-Föderation mit ihrer Hauptstadt Nsheng, dem heutigen Mushenge, war ein Verbund von rund 20 Ethnien, sämtlich Bantu. Ihren Namen erhielten die Kuba von ihren südlichen Nachbarn, den Luba., Das Staatswesen der Kuba entwickelte sich ab dem 16. Jahrhundert aus einer dezentral organisierten Stammesgesellschaft verschiedener Völker u.a. der Luba, Leele und Wongo. Aufgrund der relativ unzugänglichen Lage im Süden des heutigen Kongo, abseits des Kongo-Flusses, blieb es von den Sklavenjagden der Europäer und Afroaraber im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert weitgehend verschont. Bis zur zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts erlangte die Föderation, ungestört von der Kolonialisierung im Westen, eine Ausdehnung von etwas über 100.000km² mit ca. 150.000 Einwohnern., Seit den 1880er Jahren hatten die Belgier versucht, Zutritt zum Reich der Kuba zu finden, aber ihre Geschenke wurden stets abgelehnt und König Kot aMbweeky aMileng drohte mit der Enthauptung jedes Eindringlings. 1892 gelang es dem afro-amerikanischen presbyterianischen Missionar William Henry Sheppard in die Hauptstadt vorzudringen; wegen seiner schwarzen Hautfarbe blieb er am Leben und konnte vier Monate unter den Kuba leben., Gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts wurde das Reich instabil. Es zerfiel unter der folgenden Kolonialherrschaft Leopolds II., 1908 kaufte Belgien ihm das Land ab; es wurde zu Belgisch-Kongo., Königreich Kongo., Das Königreich Kongo entstand vermutlich um 1370. Gründungsvater war Ntinu Wene (auch Lukeni genannt). Er eroberte als erstes die Reiche Mbundu und Mpemba, wo er die Hauptstadt Mbanza Kongo gründete. Weitere Königreiche band er später vertraglich in sein Reich ein, das dann eine Föderation aus vier Teilstaaten darstellte., Das Reich erstreckte sich zur Zeit der Kontaktaufnahme durch die Portugiesen mit rund 300.000km² über Teile der heutigen Staaten Angola (drei Viertel), Demokratische Republik Kongo (ein Viertel) sowie Republik Kongo (etwa 1 %)., Eine nach dem ersten Erreichen der Kongo-Mündung 1482 durch Diogo Cão entsandte portugiesische Expedition führte 1489 zum ersten europäischen Kontakt mit dem König. Der amtierende König Nkuwu entsandte im Gegenzug einen Emissär nach Portugal, ließ sich 1491 als João I. taufen und erhielt im Gegenzug militärische Hilfe der Portugiesen., Nach dem Tod Nkuwus / João I. gab es einen Machtkampf. In der Schlacht von Mbanza Kongo konnte sich der christliche Mwemba, geboren um 1456, gegen seinen traditionell-religiösen Bruder Mpanzu durchsetzen, als Dom Afonso I. übernahm er 1506 die Herrschaft über den Kongo. Mwemba / Afonso herrschte 37 Jahre lang über den Kongo und betrieb als ein frommer christlicher Herrscher eine Politik in enger Anlehnung an Portugal und die christlichen Bruderstaaten Europas. Seine Hoffnung war, durch Kooperation von den Portugiesen dauerhaft als gleichwertig anerkannt zu werden., 1512 erging das so genannte \\"Regimento\\" des portugiesischen Königs Manuels I., eine Anweisung an dessen Botschafter. Es sah vor, dass die Portugiesen dem König des Kongo bei der Organisation seines Reiches beiseite stehen sollten, inklusive des Aufbaus eines Rechtssystems und eines Heeres, missionarischen Engagements sowie der Unterrichtung des Hofes in portugiesischer Etikette. Im Gegenzug sollte der Kongo die portugiesischen Schiffe mit wertvoller Fracht füllen, vor allem Sklaven, Kupfer und Elfenbein., Immer wieder aber sah sich Afonso ungleich behandelt. Vor allem des „schamlosen“ Verhaltens der Missionare und der Sklavenjagd der Portugiesen versuchte er anfangs noch mit diplomatischen Mitteln Herr zu werden. Er fand aber in Portugal kein Gehör und verwies so 1526 die Portugiesen des Landes. Dem kamen zwar Missionare und Offizielle nach, nicht aber die gefürchteten Sklavenjäger. Während Portugal seine Interessen als Reaktion auf das südlich gelegene Königreich der Luanda verlagerte, verlor der längst von Portugal abhängig gewordene Kongo an Macht und Stabilität., Nach Afonsos Tod 1543 folgte Diogo I. Ursprünglich eher portugalfeindlich eingestellt, lud er 1546 doch wieder Missionare ins Land. Ein Angriff durch das Volk der \\"Jaga\\" 1569 führte zu einem Hilferuf von Diogos Nachfolger, Alvaro I., an Portugal. Doch die Befreiung von den Jaga war ein Pyrrhussieg, Alvaro I. musste sich in den Vasallendienst Portugals begeben, und der Kongo wurde tributpflichtig. Mit diesem Schritt endete auch formal die ursprünglich postulierte Gleichwertigkeit der beiden Königreiche zueinander. Der nun frei expandierende Sklavenhandel entvölkerte ganze Landstriche und ließ den Kongo allmählich zerfallen., Als Antonio I.

Jahrhunderts zurück. In dieser Zeit entstanden zunächst frühsozialistisch orientierte Exilorganisationen – vor allem in Frankreich, England und der Schweiz; und im Gefolge der bürgerlichen Märzrevolution 1848 mit der Allgemeinen Deutschen Arbeiterverbrüderung auch eine erste überregionale Organisation der Arbeiterbewegung in den Staaten des damaligen Deutschen Bundes, die sowohl die Entwicklung der Gewerkschaften als auch der sozialistischen Parteien im deutschen Sprachraum einleitete., Überblick., Nach dem Ende der Reaktionsära, die der Revolution von 1848/49 folgte, begannen sich in den 1860er Jahren sozialdemokratische Parteien zu bilden, die die Tradition der gegenwärtigen SPD begründeten. Am 23.Mai 1863 wurde in Leipzig der Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein (ADAV) gegründet, zunächst angeführt von Ferdinand Lassalle. Daneben entstand ab Mitte/Ende der 1860er Jahre die \\"Eisenacher Richtung\\", vor allem geprägt von August Bebel und Wilhelm Liebknecht (1866 Sächsische Volkspartei, 1869 Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei SDAP). Beide Richtungen hatten Konflikte in Bezug auf die Gewerkschaftsfrage und die Form des entstehenden deutschen Nationalstaates, schlossen sich jedoch 1875, vier Jahre nach der 1871 erfolgten Gründung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs, zur Sozialistischen Arbeiterpartei (SAP) zusammen., Das 1878 von Reichskanzler Otto von Bismarck initiierte „Gesetz gegen die gemeingefährlichen Bestrebungen der Sozialdemokratie“ (Sozialistengesetz) kam einem Parteiverbot gleich, in dessen Folge die Arbeiterbewegung bis zum Ende der 1880er Jahre massiv behindert wurde. Nach der Aufhebung des Gesetzes wurde die SAP 1890 in Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) umbenannt. Unter diesem Namen entwickelte sie sich in den folgenden Jahren hinsichtlich ihrer Mitgliederzahlen und Wahlergebnisse zu einer Massenpartei. Nach der Reichstagswahl 1912 stellte die SPD vor der Zentrumspartei erstmals die stärkste Fraktion im Reichstag. Sie verblieb jedoch bis zur Oktoberreform von 1918 – also bis fast zum Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs – in der Opposition, da im Deutschen Kaiserreich die vom Monarchen (ab 1888 Wilhelm II.) ernannte Regierung keine Mehrheit im Parlament benötigte, weil sie nur dem Deutschen Kaiser gegenüber verantwortlich war., In der Sozialdemokratie gab es im Laufe der Jahre verschiedene Strömungen und Flügel, die auch zu Abspaltungen führten. Außer der Kommunistischen Partei (KPD) lösten sich alle durch Abspaltungen entstandenen Parteien nach einiger Zeit wieder auf, schlossen sich der KPD an oder kehrten in die SPD zurück., Zu Beginn der Parteigeschichte herrschten radikaldemokratische Strömungen unter dem Einfluss der Ideen von Ferdinand Lassalle vor. Vor allem wirkte dessen genossenschaftliche Orientierung, die später einer stärker gewerkschaftsnahen Ausrichtung untergeordnet wurde. Auf längere Sicht setzte sich der Marxismus durch. Die Wandlung begann spätestens Ende der 1890er Jahre mit der innerparteilichen Revisionismusxaddebatte, in der an Reformen orientierte Umsetzungsversuche der marxistischen Inhalte Bedeutung bekamen. Der in den ersten Jahrzehnten dominierende revolutionär ausgerichtete Parteiflügel geriet nach dem Tod August Bebels 1913 in eine Minderheitsposition., Marx’ Analyse der sozialen und ökonomischen Gesellschaftsbedingungen sowie ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung, und die daraus gefolgerten revolutionären Handlungskonzepte haben die Sozialdemokratie bis in die zweite Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts ideologisch geprägt., Während des Ersten Weltkrieges bildeten die Gegner der kriegsbilligenden Burgfriedenspolitik um Hugo Haase und Georg Ledebour ab Ende 1915 in der SPD-Reichstagsfraktion die Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft (SAG). Drei Monate später wurden sie im März 1916 aus der SPD ausgeschlossen und gründeten 1917 die Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (USPD). Nach dieser Abspaltung firmierte die verbliebene SPD in den folgenden vier bis fünf Jahren auch unter dem Namen Mehrheitssozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (MSPD). Aus dem linksrevolutionären Flügel der USPD, dem Spartakusbund, ging nach der Novemberrevolution auf Initiative von Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg u.a. im Januar 1919 die KPD hervor, der sich 1920 auch die linke Mehrheit der USPD anschloss (vgl. VKPD). Der größte Teil der verbliebenen USPD wandte sich 1922 wieder der SPD zu. Als kleine Splitterpartei gab es die USPD bis 1931., Die SPD war während der Weimarer Republik eine der Parteien, die die neue Staatsform einer pluralistischen Demokratie trugen. Sie stellte zwischen 1919 und 1925 mit Friedrich Ebert den ersten demokratisch gewählten Reichspräsidenten. In den ersten zwei Jahren der Republik und dann wieder von 1928 bis 1930 war sie in wechselnden Koalitionen mit den Reichskanzlern Friedrich Ebert, Philipp Scheidemann, Gustav Bauer und Hermann Müller die führende Regierungspartei im Reich. Zwischen 1921 und 1923 war sie in anderen Konstellationen mit Kabinettsangehörigen (Ministern) an vier weiteren Reichsregierungen beteiligt. In der Endphase der Republik befand sich die Partei weitgehend in der Defensive; nicht zuletzt, weil sie kein umsetzungsfähiges Konzept gegenüber den Präsidialkabinetten seit Heinrich Brüning entwickeln konnte, und auch innerparteilich im Umgang mit den erstarkten politischen Extremen zerstritten war. In dieser Phase wurde sie auch verstärkt von der KPD angegriffen, die sie als „sozialfaschistisch“ und „Verräter der Arbeiterklasse“ bezeichneten. 1931 kam es mit der Gründung der Sozialistischen Arbeiterpartei erneut zu einer Abspaltung am linken Rand. Mit zunehmender Dauer der Weltwirtschaftskrise hatte die SPD den radikal linken und rechten Flügelparteien und ihren populistisch orientierten Lösungsversprechen keine mehrheitsfähigen Konzepte entgegenzusetzen., Nach dem Beginn der nationalsozialistischen Diktatur war die SPD die einzige Partei im Reichstag, die das Ermächtigungsgesetz ablehnte, nachdem die KPD durch die Reichstagsbrandverordnung bereits verboten war. In der Folge wurde auch die SPD verboten und die Gewerkschaften zerschlagen. Zahlreiche Mitglieder gingen ins Exil; andere, die im Land geblieben waren, sahen sich zu weiten Teilen der Verfolgung ausgesetzt, wurden zeitweilig inhaftiert oder langjährig in Konzentrationslagern festgehalten, wo nicht wenige Sozialdemokraten auch ermordet wurden., Führende ins Ausland geflohene Sozialdemokraten bildeten 1933 mit der SOPADE in Prag vor allem aufgrund der Veröffentlichung ihrer \\"Deutschland-Berichte\\" die bis zum Zweiten Weltkrieg wichtigste Exilorganisation der SPD. Sie wich infolge der „Zerschlagung der Rest-Tschechei“ 1939 zunächst nach Paris und 1940 nach Lissabon aus, wo sie sich faktisch auflöste. In der Nachfolge der SOPADE etablierten sich im weiteren Verlauf des Zweiten Weltkriegs die German Labour Delegation in den USA sowie die Union deutscher sozialistischer Organisationen in Großbritannien als bedeutende Exilorganisationen der deutschen Sozialdemokratie während der NS-Diktatur., Unmittelbar nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurde die SPD ideologisch und organisatorisch weitgehend nach dem Vorbild der Weimarer Zeit in den vier Besatzungszonen reorganisiert. Während es im Büro der Westzonen zu einer Neuorganisation unter Kurt Schumacher kam, wurde 1946 in der sowjetisch besetzten Zone auf teils repressiven Druck der KPdSU-Führung und einflussreicher KPD-Funktionäre die Vereinigung von SPD und KPD in der neu gegründeten SED betrieben. Die Stalinisierung der folgenden Jahre beseitigte die Reste sozialdemokratischer Organisationen und Politik, die in der nachfolgenden DDR nahezu bedeutungslos wurden. Seit der Gründung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland 1949 lehnte die SPD unter der Führung von Kurt Schumacher einen Zusammenschluss mit der KPD strikt ab., Innenpolitisch war die als „progressiv“ bzw. tendenziell „links“ geltende SPD in der westdeutschen Bundesrepublik von 1949 bis 1966 hinter dem eher „konservativ“ bzw. gemäßigt „rechts“ ausgerichteten Parteienbündnis von CDU und CSU als zweitstärkste parteipolitische Kraft die einflussreichste Oppositionsfraktion im Bundestag, dem höchsten bundesrepublikanischen Parlament., Mit dem Godesberger Programm von 1959 wandte sich die SPD weitgehend vom Marxismus ab. Sie definierte sich damit nicht mehr als Klassenpartei, sondern als Volkspartei. Dieser Wandel, der eine inhaltliche Zäsur implizierte, ermöglichte 1966 zunächst den Eintritt in die CDU-geführte erste große Koalition unter Bundeskanzler Kurt Georg Kiesinger, und ab 1969 die erste auf Bundesebene vereinbarte sozial-liberale Koalition in der deutschen Nachkriegsgeschichte – nun unter SPD-Führung – mit Willy Brandt als Regierungschef. In der Folgezeit haben vor allem dessen Ostpolitik, jedoch teilweise auch in der eigenen Partei innenpolitisch umstrittene Maßnahmen wie beispielsweise der Radikalenerlass nachwirkende politische Veränderungen eingeleitet. Unter Helmut Schmidt, Brandts Nachfolger im Kanzleramt, wurde der politische Spielraum schmaler. Die Partei geriet aufgrund innen- und außenpolitischer Krisen zunehmend unter Druck. Von konservativer Seite wurde angesichts des Linksterrorismus der RAF (vgl. Deutscher Herbst) ein rigoroseres Vorgehen im Bereich der Inneren Sicherheit gefordert. Vom linken Flügel der Partei wurden –verstärkt durch im Gefolge der Studentenbewegung am Ende der 1960er Jahre aufgekommene Neue Soziale Bewegungen– die Energiepolitik und vor allem die Zustimmung zum NATO-Doppelbeschluss heftig kritisiert. Nach dem Bruch der sozialliberalen Koalition 1982 begann eine von innerparteilichen Krisen geprägte Oppositionszeit., Nach der deutschen Wiedervereinigung von 1989/90 erfüllten sich die Hoffnungen der SPD, an alte Wahlerfolge zu Zeiten der Weimarer Republik in den \\"neuen Bundesländern\\" anzuknüpfen, vorerst nicht. Dort konnte sich die aus der vormaligen DDR-Staatspartei SED hervorgegangene PDS als bedeutende konkurrierende Kraft gegenüber der SPD –wenn auch geschwächt– behaupten, trotz starker Einbrüche kurz nach der \\"Wende\\", nachdem sich die PDS von der Linie der SED distanziert und deren vormalige Führungsspitze aus der erneuerten Partei ausgeschlossen hatte., Im Jahr 1998 endete mit dem Beginn einer rot-grünen Koalition unter Gerhard Schröder als Bundeskanzler nach 16 Jahren die zweite Oppositionsperiode der SPD in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik. Schröders Hinwendung zu einer tendenziell wirtschaftsliberalen Politik im Verbund mit der britischen Labour-Regierung unter Tony Blair (vgl.: Schröder-Blair-Papier), insbesondere die \\"Agenda 2010\\", stieß bei den Wählern und eigenen Anhängern auf immer weniger Zustimmung – eine Tendenz, die im Januar: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Arbeiterbewegung - Sozialdemokratie - SPD - Parteiengeschichte - Gewerkschaften - Revolution von 1848 - Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein - Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei - Sozialistengesetz - Novemberrevolution"},{"instruction":"проверь ошибки в этом коде: from threading import Thread from time import sleep from PIL import Image, ImageGrab def screen_push(): last_clipboard_image = ImageGrab.grabclipboard() while True: clipboard_image = ImageGrab.grabclipboard() sleep(1) if clipboard_image != last_clipboard_image and (not clipboard_image is None): try: if clipboard_image is None: print('Это не изображение') else: clipboard_image.save('image.png', 'png') im = Image.open('image.png') subs = im.crop((250, 770, 1600, 1000)) subs.save('subs.png', 'png') print('сохранил') except Exception: print(\\"Ошибка при сохранении изображения\\") finally: sleep(1) last_clipboard_image = clipboard_image thread = Thread(target=screen_push) thread.start() thread.join() print('thread finished…exiting')","output":"Код не содержит синтаксических ошибок, однако есть несколько некорректных мест: 1.

Der Begriff First Nations ist relativ jung und bezeichnet die kanadischen Ureinwohner, jedoch ohne die Métis und die Inuit. Die offizielle Bezeichnung von staatlicher Seite ist \\"Indians\\", die Selbstbezeichnung der weit über 600 als Stämme bezeichneten Gruppen ist ganz überwiegend \\"First Nation\\", seltener \\"Nation\\" oder \\"Indian Band\\"., Ihre Geschichte ist vor allem in den früheren Phasen durch starke Anpassung an die natürliche Umgebung gekennzeichnet. Dementsprechend werden (nach Alfred Kroeber) in Nordamerika zehn Kulturareale unterschieden, von denen sich fünf zumindest partiell auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Kanada finden: Die Subarktis, die Zentral-Kanada bis zur Nordwestküste und zur Küste von Labrador umfasst, die (Nord-)Westküste am Pazifik, dann das Plateau, also vor allem das Fraser-Plateau, schließlich Prärien und Plains, also die trockenen Graslandschaften östlich der Rocky Mountains, sowie das nordöstliche Waldland um die Großen Seen bis nach Neufundland., Die Geschichte der indianisch-europäischen Kontakte setzt im Norden Amerikas mit der Jagd auf Fische und Wale sowie dem Handel mit Pelzen ein. Die sich aus der Ausbeutung der Naturschätze ergebenden Konflikte dauern bis heute an. Anfangs dienten Forts und Ansiedlungen nur der Sicherung des Handels, daher blieb die Zahl der Siedler gering. Dazu kamen erste Missionsversuche. Auch wenn die französische und britische Kolonialpolitik vergleichsweise weniger gewalttätig als die der USA war, so hat sie doch die Kulturen radikal verändert. Das gilt umso mehr für das seit 1867 zunehmend souveräne Kanada, das seit den 1970er Jahren seine Politik der erzwungenen Assimilation und kulturellen Auslöschung aufgibt, um einer Haltung der Multikulturalität den Vorrang einzuräumen., Abgrenzung., Die Geschichte der First Nations ist für die Phase der europäischen Vorherrschaft und derjenigen Kanadas sinnvoll von derjenigen der USA abzutrennen, weil die beiden Staaten und ihre Gesellschaften ein sehr unterschiedliches Verhältnis zu ihren Ureinwohnern entwickelt haben. Problematisch ist diese Vorgehensweise allerdings für die davor liegenden Epochen, denen man in einem räumlich und zeitlich weiter gefassten Überblick zumindest über die Geschichte der nordamerikanischen „Indianer“ – für diese riesige Gruppe von heute weit über 1200 indigenen Völkern gibt es ansonsten keine übergreifende Bezeichnung – besser gerecht wird. Dabei wird sich eine gewisse räumliche und zeitliche Unschärfe der Abgrenzung nicht vermeiden lassen., Einleitender Überblick., Grundzüge bis etwa 1500., Archäologisch fassbare und häufig bis in die Gegenwart reichende, kulturell zusammenhängende Gruppen wurden häufig als „Völker“ oder „Stämme“ identifiziert, die sich oftmals auf einen gemeinsamen Ahnen zurückführten, einen gemeinsamen Dialekt sprachen, und vor allem als genetisch zusammenhängend verstanden wurden. Sie verband aber vor allem eine gemeinsame Lebensweise, die weniger genetisch bedingt, als durch Handelsnetzwerke, verbindende kosmologische Ansichten, durch Heiratskontakte und damit Austausch kultureller Elemente, aber auch durch Beziehungen der führenden Gruppen aufrechterhalten wurde., Auf dem nordamerikanischen Halbkontinent herrschte von Beginn menschlicher Besiedlung an bis in das 19. Jahrhundert hinein ein ausgeprägter Nomadismus vor, der nur im Süden der USA und am Mississippi von Sesshaftigkeit abgelöst wurde. Dazu kam entlang der Küsten und einiger Binnengewässer eine jährliche Abfolge saisonaler Wanderungen, die Vegetationsphasen und Tierwanderungen folgten. Daher gab es unter den First Nations nie eine Form der, offenbar an Sesshaftigkeit gebundenen, Priesterherrschaft, wie sie für die Hochkulturen Südamerikas und mancher Gegenden der USA nachweisbar ist. Auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Kanada herrschte bei allen Völkern der Schamanismus vor, der vor allem durch die Kontaktaufnahme mit Ahnen oder sonstigen Mächten in psychischen Ausnahmesituationen gekennzeichnet ist., Mythen bestimmten die Weltordnung. So beruhten die indigenen Religionen nicht auf einer Heilsgeschichte, sondern auf der Heiligkeit von Orten, Ritualen oder dazugehörigen Gegenständen, von Wesen, Mächten, Wissen und Geschichten, Tänzen und Musik, die sich im Besitz von Verwandtschaftsgruppen befanden. Religionen waren daher orts- und verwandtschaftsspezifisch und besaßen keinerlei universellen Geltungsanspruch. Außerdem gab es nur eine unscharfe Vorstellung von der Zugehörigkeit eines bestimmten Gebietes zu einem bestimmten Stamm, zumal selbst die Vorstellung von festgefügten Stämmen eher von Europäern herangetragen wurde. Stattdessen stand die Verwandtschaft bei weitem im Vordergrund, die bis heute für weiträumige, übergreifende Beziehungen sorgt, so dass ein Individuum Vorfahren aus mehreren „Stämmen“ hatte. Daher dominiert bis heute die Vorstellung kollektiver Rechte (allerdings durch inzwischen lange Übung zunehmend auf den Stamm bezogen) über Individualrechte., Die typischen Hervorbringungen dauerhafter Sesshaftigkeit, auch die Viehzucht, fehlten also weitgehend. Männer waren wohl schon früh mit der Jagd assoziiert, Frauen mit dem Sammeln und Pflücken, dem Schneiden und Ausgraben von nahrhaften Pflanzenteilen. Damit entfiel auch die Notwendigkeit der Bewässerung und der Regulierung von Flussläufen, was größere organisatorische Zusammenballungen unnötig machte. Diese wurden eher von gemeinsamen Ritualen oder Kriegszügen auf begrenzte Dauer ausgelöst. Doch kam es, beispielsweise an den Großen Seen, zu weiträumigen und dauerhaften Bündnissystemen und Siedlungen., Rudimentäre Anfänge eines Schriftsystems lassen sich zwar zeigen, doch spielten eher symbolbeladene (Kunst-)Werke eine herausragende Rolle. Übergreifende Sprachen entstanden nur in Form von Händlersprachen, wie dem Chinook, die jedoch nur regional Bedeutung erlangten. In den Plains diente eine Gebärdensprache der Überbrückung der Verständigungsgrenzen zwischen den zahlreichen Sprachen und Dialekten. Das für andere Kulturgebiete so wichtige Rad spielte, wie in ganz Amerika, keine erkennbare Rolle. Auch Metallbearbeitung lässt sich nur für Kupfer nachweisen (allerdings schon sehr früh), daher war die seltene Substanz von hohem Wert und als Tauschgut sehr begehrt., Der Wigwam aus einem Gerüst gebogener Äste, das mit Rinde oder geflochtenen Matten bedeckt wird, stellt eine an die Lebensweise angepasste, mobile Behausung der Jäger dar, die leicht zu zerlegen und wieder aufzubauen ist. Ähnliches gilt für das Tipi, das ledergedeckte Stangenzelt der Bisonjäger der Prärie. Im Winter dauerhaft bewohnte Häuser errichteten die Völker der Nordwestküste aus Holzplanken, im östlichen Waldland vor allem aus Holz und Lehm, gedeckt mit Grasdächern., Europäischer Einfluss (16. bis 19. Jahrhundert)., Die koloniale Phase ab Ende des 15. Jahrhunderts begann zunächst an der Ostküste mit zunehmendem Handel, der bald in gewaltsame Konflikte umschlug, vor allem, wenn Siedler das Land beanspruchten oder wenn Konflikte zwischen den Stämmen auf solche zwischen den europäischen Staaten trafen. Die Folge waren regelrechte Koalitionskriege, mehrfach als Nebenschauplätze europäischer Kriege. Dazu kamen Versuche der Indigenen, den Handelskontakt zu monopolisieren, wobei sich um die Forts immer wieder neue Stämme bildeten, von denen manche den Namen des Forts noch heute tragen. Während der gesamten Epoche kam es immer wieder zu schweren Epidemien (Pocken, Masern, Grippe, Tuberkulose usw.), gegen die die Indigenen praktisch keine Immunabwehr besaßen. Waren die Indianer erst in eine Abhängigkeit geraten, versuchten die Eroberer, sie in für Siedler ungünstige Gebiete abzudrängen oder – wie in Kanada meistens – sie in Reservate (reserves) zusammenzudrängen und an die eigenen Vorstellungen einer gesitteten Lebensweise anzupassen., In der Hauptsache waren es sieben europäische Mächte, die in dieser Weise auftraten: Spanien (1769 bis 1810 an der Westküste), Frankreich (etwa 1604–1763), England bzw. Großbritannien (1607–1867 bzw. 1931) und Russland (1741–1867, v. a. Alaska), in geringerem Ausmaß die Niederlande (1624–1664 um New York bzw. Nieuw Amsterdam), Schweden (1638–1655 am Delaware) und – in Grönland – Dänemark (ab 1721). Letztlich entlud sich der Konflikt zwischen Franzosen und Briten im Rahmen des Siebenjährigen Krieges, während mögliche Konflikte der Kolonialmächte an der Westküste untereinander mit dem Verkauf von Fort Ross 1841 und Alaska 1867 auf dem Verhandlungswege entschärft wurden, ebenso wie der „Beinahe-Krieg“ Großbritanniens mit Spanien (1789–1794)., Eine Sonderrolle spielten die USA, die 1803 Louisiana erwarben (Louisiana Purchase), und sich 1812 bis 1814 einen Krieg mit den Briten und Franzosen sowie ihren indianischen Verbündeten in Kanada lieferten (Britisch-Amerikanischer Krieg). Dabei etablierte sich eine erste Grenzziehung, die jenseits der Großen Seen ab 1846 entlang des 49. Breitengrads den Kontinent zerschnitt (Oregon-Kompromiss). Schon im spanisch-britischen Konflikt an der Pazifikküste hatten die USA eine gewisse Rolle gespielt. Im Norden trennte zudem der Erwerb des russischen Alaska durch die USA im Jahr 1867 die Zonen sehr unterschiedlicher Indianerpolitik voneinander ab., Während die französische Kolonialpolitik vor allem von Handelsinteressen dominiert war und die Siedlung eher der Ausbildung von Handelsdrehscheiben diente, war die der Briten anfangs eher von Siedlungsinteressen und religiösen Auseinandersetzungen zwischen protestantischen Machtgruppen gekennzeichnet., In Kanada spielte im Gegensatz zu den USA die Landnahme durch Siedler eine geringe Rolle, sieht man einmal von den wenigen Ballungsräumen ab. So übernahm im Norden und Westen die Krone die administrative Kontrolle der indigenen Völker durch die monopolistische Hudson’s Bay Company, deren Geschäftsinteressen ein friedlicheres Einvernehmen mit und zwischen den Indianern nahelegten. Erst die Zuwanderung zahlreicher Goldsucher (vor allem aus den USA) veranlasste Großbritannien, als Gegengewicht eine eigene Zuwanderung zu fördern. Einheirat in indigene Gemeinschaften schuf dabei bei matrilokalen Ethnien, also bei Gruppen, bei denen das Paar am Wohnort der Frau le: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"First Nations, Kanada, Indianer, Geschichte, Politik, Ureinwohner, Métis, Inuit, Kulturareale, Assimilation"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geschichte der Homosexualität, Sozialgeschichte (Vereinigte Staaten)], Die Geschichte der Homosexualität in den Vereinigten Staaten war bis ins 20. Jahrhundert eine Geschichte von Menschen, die ihre sexuelle Orientierung angesichts drohender Strafverfolgung, gesellschaftlicher Ächtung und Diskriminierung oft nur im Verborgenen ausleben konnten. Aufgrund dieser Verborgenheit, für die sich in der englischen Sprache der Ausdruck „in the closet“ (Deutsch: \\"im Wandschrank\\") eingebürgert hat, ist die Geschichtsforschung heute mit einer meist unbefriedigenden Quellenlage konfrontiert. Besonders unzureichend dokumentiert ist bis in die zweite Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts das Leben homosexueller Frauen. Dabei bestanden subkulturelle Nischen, in denen Homosexuelle durchaus ihren eigenen Lebensstil entfalten konnten, nachgewiesenermaßen schon im frühen 20. Jahrhundert., Wie in vielen anderen Ländern hat sich auch in den USA das kulturelle Verständnis der Homosexualität im Laufe der Geschichte von „Sünde“ über „Verbrechen“ und „Krankheit“ bis hin zu „natürliche Gegebenheit“ gewandelt. Da die amerikanischen Bundesstaaten jeweils eigene Strafgesetze haben, vollzog sich die Entkriminalisierung homosexueller Handlungen in den USA in vielen Einzelschritten. Illinois war 1962 der erste Bundesstaat, der sein Gesetz gegen sexuelle Perversionen (engl. \\"sodomy\\") abschaffte, zu denen auch die Homosexualität gezählt wurde. In anderen Bundesstaaten konnten homosexuelle Handlungen bis ins Jahr 2003 bestraft werden., Die Anpassung der Gesetzeslage hinkte der sozio-kulturellen Entwicklung weit hinterher. Die Gleichstellung der Homosexuellen war Teil und Folge einer allgemeinen Befreiung der Sexualität aus kulturellen Traditionen, die im 20. Jahrhundert immer mehr an Bedeutung verloren und dem Konzept der sexuellen Selbstbestimmung wichen. In den USA begann die Emanzipation der Homosexuellen in der Zeit des Zweiten Weltkrieges. Wichtige Stationen waren Alfred Kinseys Studie \\"Das sexuelle Verhalten des Mannes\\" (1948), die Gründung der \\"Mattachine Society\\" (1950), die Mitwirkung späterer homosexueller Aktivisten im Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968), der Stonewall-Aufstand (1969), die Gründung von Kampforganisationen wie der \\"Gay Liberation Front\\" (1969), die Streichung der Homosexualität aus dem Krankheitskatalog der \\"American Psychiatric Association\\" (1973), die Neuorientierung der Schwulenbewegung während der Aids-Krise (seit 1981), die Einbeziehung von weiteren Personengruppen wie z.B. Bisexuellen und Transgender (seit den 1990er Jahren) und im 21. Jahrhundert der politische Kampf um die gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe., Homosexualität in den indigenen Kulturen., Mehr als 130 verschiedene indigene Völker Nordamerikas besaßen eine spezielle Kategorie für Männer, die Frauenkleidung trugen, „Frauenarbeit“ wie Korbflechterei und Töpferei verrichteten, sexuellen Umgang mit Männern hatten und innerhalb der Gemeinschaft eine besondere spirituelle Funktion übernahmen. Diese sogenannten Two-Spirits wurden nicht als homosexuell eingestuft, sondern einem dritten oder vierten Geschlecht zugeordnet, dessen Besonderheit darin bestand, dass ein und demselben Körper zwei Seelen innewohnten. Unter den ersten Weißen, die auf dem Gebiet der späteren USA \\"Two-Spirits\\" beobachteten und beschrieben, waren christliche Missionare und Entdecker wie Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Jacques Marquette, Pierre Liette und Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix. Selbst ethnologisch interessierte Weiße wie der Künstler George Catlin, der \\"Two-Spirits\\" noch in den 1830er Jahren beobachtete, beschrieb und malte, befürworteten deren Ausrottung. Obwohl im Rahmen der Wiederbelebung indigener Kulturgüter sich auch heute vereinzelt Angehörige indigene Völker als \\"Two-Spirits\\" bezeichnen, ist dieser Bestandteil der indigenen Kultur mit ihrer Unterwerfung durch die Europäer jedoch weitgehend verloren gegangen., Kolonialzeit., Vom Beginn der weißen Kolonialisierung Nordamerikas bis weit ins 20. Jahrhundert war die Wahrnehmung von Homosexualität von der biblischen Tradition geprägt, die das Phänomen untrennbar mit der Sündhaftigkeit von Sodom und Gomorra in Verbindung brachte. Besonders die Puritaner, die von 1620 an in großer Zahl nach Neuengland auswanderten, verabscheuten sexuelle Unzucht (engl. \\"sodomy\\") und empfanden sie neben \\"bestiality\\" (deutsch: Zoophilie) als die schlimmste der Sünden überhaupt., Außer in Georgia, wo eine gesetzliche Regelung für homosexuelle Handlungen fehlte, war „Sodomie“ in allen britischen Kolonien, die 1776 ihre Unabhängigkeit erklärten, strafbar. In New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland und North Carolina wurde sie über lange Zeit hinweg nach dem britischen Common Law behandelt, das ohne Ansehen des Tätergeschlechtes jede sexuelle Handlung kriminalisierte, die nicht der Fortpflanzung diente. In New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Virginia und South Carolina galten eigene Gesetze, deren Wortlaut meist an das Sodomieverbot des 3. Buch Mose angelehnt war. In Pennsylvania änderte sich die Rechtslage wiederholt; solange die Quäker in dieser Kolonie den Ton angaben (1681–1693), war Pennsylvania auch die einzige Kolonie, in der männliche homosexuelle Handlungen nicht mit dem Tode bestraft wurde. Außer in Massachusetts unterlagen Frauen den Sodomiegesetzen grundsätzlich ebenso wie Männer; Strafverfolgungen wegen lesbischer Handlungen waren in der Kolonialzeit jedoch äußerst selten., Der erste überlieferte Fall eines Weißen, der auf dem späteren Staatsgebiet der USA wegen „Sodomie“ hingerichtet wurde, ist der des französischen Übersetzers Guillermo, der sein Leben 1566 in der neuspanischen Kolonie Florida verlor. Der erste bekannte Sodomiefall in einer der britischen Kolonien war der von Richard Cornish, der 1625 in Virginia gehängt wurde, nachdem er angeblich einen anderen Mann vergewaltigt hatte. 1629 wurden fünf junge Männer, die an Bord der \\"Talbot\\" in die Massachusetts Bay Colony einreisten, homosexueller Handlungen beschuldigt; die lokalen Autoritäten fühlten sich der Aburteilung eines so schrecklichen Verbrechens nicht gewachsen und schickten die Jungen zur Bestrafung nach England zurück. Die erste Frau auf dem Boden der britischen Kolonien, die sich wegen einer lesbischen Beziehung zu verantworten hatte, war 1648 eine Einwohnerin der \\"Massachusetts Bay Colony\\", Elizabeth Johnson. Bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts wurden nur wenige Sodomiefälle bekannt, sodass sie als Ausnahmeereignisse mit hohem Seltenheitscharakter galten., 18. und 19. Jahrhundert., Liberalisierung des Strafrechts., Nach der Unabhängigkeitserklärung der Vereinigten Staaten im Jahre 1776 behielten die Gründungsstaaten ihre Sodomieregelungen aus der Kolonialzeit bei, die für homosexuelle Handlungen zwischen Männern im Regelfall die Todesstrafe vorsahen. Gleichgeschlechtliche Handlungen zwischen Frauen waren in den meisten Bundesstaaten grundsätzlich ebenso strafbar, wurden bis zum Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts jedoch nur sehr selten verfolgt und meist milder bestraft als entsprechende Handlungen zwischen Männern. Im Zuge einer allgemeinen Liberalisierung, die ihre Anregungen aus der Aufklärung und der Französischen Revolution empfangen hatte, war Pennsylvania 1786 der erste der damals 13 US-Bundesstaaten, der die Todesstrafe für „Sodomie“ abschaffte. An die Stelle der Todesstrafe trat dort eine 10-jährige Gefängnisstrafe und die Einziehung des gesamten Vermögens. Andere amerikanische Bundesstaaten zogen nach; in South Carolina konnten überführte „Sodomiten“ jedoch noch bis ins Jahr 1873 zum Tode verurteilt werden., Beginnende Psychiatrisierung der Homosexualität., Die Psychiatrisierung der Homosexualität, d.h. die Auffassung, Homosexualität sei eine Geistesstörung, fand ihren Höhepunkt erst mit der Begründung der Psychoanalyse (1896). Ihre Wurzeln liegen jedoch bereits im frühen 19. Jahrhundert. In sexualpädagogischen Publikationen wie \\"The Young Man’s Guide\\" (William Andrus Alcott, 1833) und \\"Lecture to Young Men on Chastity\\" (Sylvester Graham, 1834) wurden unerwünschtem Sexualverhalten wie Masturbation oder Homosexualität erstmals dramatische gesundheitliche Folgen wie Wahnsinn, Veitstanz, Epilepsie, Idiotie, Lähmung, Schlaganfall, Erblindung, Hypochondrie und Schwindsucht zugeschrieben., Geduldete Grenzformen., Im 18. und frühen 19. Jahrhundert wurde die Verfolgung von Homosexuellen durch das Entstehen des auch in den USA verbreiteten Freundschaftskultes erschwert. In den gebildeten Bevölkerungsschichten gewannen gleichgeschlechtliche Freundschaften damals häufig einen exklusiven und emotional stark aufgeladenen, bisweilen erotischen Charakter. Dennoch fanden sie gesellschaftliche Billigung, da man – nach Meinung vieler neuerer Literaturhistoriker \\"zu Unrecht\\" – annahm, dass es dabei nicht zu wirklichen sexuellen Kontakten kam. Aufschlussreiche Dokumente finden sich etwa in den Arbeiten und Nachlässen der Schriftsteller Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), Bayard Taylor (1825–1878) und Walt Whitman (1819–1892)., Eine sozio-kulturelle Besonderheit des 19. Jahrhunderts war die sogenannte Boston Marriage (deutsch: „Bostoner Ehe“), eine emotional intensive und exklusive Langzeit-Freundschaft zwischen zwei – oft dem Feminismus zugewandten – Frauen, die in einem gemeinsamen Haushalt zusammenlebten und dieser Lebensform größere Freiheit für ein soziales oder politisches Engagement verdankten, als wenn ihnen die Beschränkungen auferlegt gewesen wären, die für Ehefrauen damals normal waren. Anwenden lässt sich der Begriff zum Beispiel auf die Schriftstellerinnen Sarah Orne Jewett und Annie Adams Fields sowie auf die Frauenrechtsaktivistinnen Susan B. Anthony und Anna Howard Shaw. Dass eine Frau das Zusammenleben mit einer anderen Frau der Ehe mit einem Mann vorzog, wurde in der viktorianischen Zeit deshalb akzeptiert, weil man annahm, dass diese Frauen nicht durch erotische Interessen verbunden waren. Ob diese Frauen als frühe Lesben reklamiert werden dürfen, ist in der feministischen Forschung heute umstritten., 1900–1940., Strafverfolgung., Wie John Loughery beschrieben hat, führte nach dem Eintritt der USA in den Ersten Weltkrieg (1917) die Massenrekrutierung amerikanischer Soldaten zu einer Häufung von Fällen homosexueller Handlungen. Zu einer ausgedehnten Verfolgung homosexueller Männer kam es zum Beispiel während des \\"Newport Sex Scandal\\", der sich 1919 in der Navy-Basis in Newport, Rhode Island ereignete. Im Verlaufe der Untersuchungen wurden dort mehrere Dutzend Zivilisten und Militärangehörige verhaftet, darunter auch ein Militärgeistlicher der Episkopalkirche., Die erste Organisation., Ende 1924 gründete Henry Gerber in Chicago die Society for Human Rights.

Jahrhundert. Während des späten Mittelalters und der frühen Neuzeit war Ostfriesland das einzige Gebiet in Nordwestdeutschland, in dem Juden geduldet wurden. Nach dem Aussterben des Fürstenhauses Cirksena 1744 und dem damit einhergehenden Ende der Grafschaft Ostfriesland als souveräner Staat wurden die ostfriesischen Juden Staatsbürger Preußens, dessen restriktive Gesetzgebung auch gegenüber Juden in Ostfriesland zur Anwendung kam. Im 19. Jahrhundert wechselte die Souveränität über Ostfriesland mehrfach, was für die Juden wechselnde rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen mit sich brachte., Bis 1870 brachten neue Gesetze schließlich die Bürgerrechte für Juden in Ostfriesland. Die letzten rechtlichen Diskriminierungen wurden bis zum Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges beseitigt. Ab Mitte der 1920er Jahre gab es eine Häufung antisemitischer Vorfälle in Ostfriesland. In der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus wurden die Juden schrittweise entrechtet und verfolgt. Endgültig erstarb das jüdische Leben in Ostfriesland im Jahr 1940. Ungefähr 50 Prozent der Juden der bei der Volkszählung im Deutschen Reich vom 16. Juni 1925 in Ostfriesland erfassten Juden (und damit etwa 1000 von 2146) wurden während des Holocaust von den Nationalsozialisten ermordet. Die wenigen heute in Ostfriesland lebenden Juden sind Teil der jüdischen Gemeinde in Oldenburg., Mögliche Zuwanderung im Mittelalter., Wann genau sich die ersten Juden in Ostfriesland niederließen, ist unbekannt. Der Legende nach sollen die ersten Juden von Ocko I. tom Brok in Ostfriesland angesiedelt worden sein. Dieser hielt sich in den 1370er Jahren in Italien auf und wurde dort nach Ableistung von Kriegs- und Hofdiensten durch Königin Johanna I. von Neapel zum Ritter geschlagen. Dort soll er mit Juden in Kontakt getreten sein, damit diese sich in Ostfriesland niederließen, um die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung der Region voranzutreiben., Tatsächlich bestanden Verbindungen zwischen Friesen und Juden außerhalb Frieslands schon spätestens seit dem 11. und 12. Jahrhundert. So stellten Juden (seit 1084) und Friesen in Speyer im hohen Mittelalter des 11. und 12. Jahrhunderts die Mehrzahl der Fernkaufleute (negotiatores manentes), wobei beide ihre Sitze in der Kaufleute-Siedlung vor der Dom-Immunität hatten., Obwohl dies bis dato nicht belegbar ist, gibt es Hinweise auf eine Verbindung der ostfriesischen Juden nach Italien. So nutzte die jüdische Gemeinde Aurich lange Zeit ein jüdisches Gebetbuch \\"(Machsor)\\", das um 1600 in Venedig erschien. Die gesicherte Ansiedlung von Juden begann Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts in den Hafenstädten Ostfrieslands. Möglicherweise haben die Vertreibungen der jüdischen Gemeinden aus dem Rheinland die Ansiedlung in Ostfriesland begünstigt., Der Archivar Herbert Reyer schreibt, dass diese Hinweise auf eine bereits im ausgehenden, Mittelalter vorhandene jüdische Ansiedlung in Aurich dem Bereich der Legende zuzuweisen seien. Ebenso wenig dürfe eine im Volksmund »Joedenkarkhof« genannte Wiese an der Sandhorster Straße im Osten der Stadt als Beleg für eine frühere Judenansiedlung in Aurich genom-, men werden., 16. Jahrhundert bis 1618., Seit dem Mittelalter lebten Juden im Weser-Ems-Gebiet und bereits um 1530 ließen sich die ersten Juden in Emden nieder. In der Grafschaft Ostfriesland besaß zunächst die Stadt Emden das Recht, Judenschutzbriefe auszustellen. Anschließend wurden in allen ostfriesischen Städten und einigen Flecken Synagogengemeinden gegründet, so in Norden (1577), Jemgum (1604), Leer (1611), Aurich (1636), Esens (1637), Wittmund (1637), Neustadtgödens (1639), Weener (1645), Bunde (1670) und Dornum (1717). Ab 1878 gab es eine Außenstelle der Synagogengemeinde Norden auf Norderney (\\"siehe hierzu:\\" Geschichte der Juden auf Norderney). Während des späten Mittelalters und der frühen Neuzeit war Ostfriesland das einzige Gebiet in Nordwestdeutschland, in dem Juden geduldet wurden. Oldenburg mussten sie infolge der Pestepidemie von 1349/50 verlassen und Wildeshausen 1350, nachdem sie der Brunnenvergiftung beschuldigt wurden. Erst Ende des 17. Jahrhunderts durften sie sich dort wieder niederlassen., Die rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen für Juden in Ostfriesland wurden durch „Schutzbriefe“ oder „Generalprivilegien“ geregelt, welche die ostfriesischen Herrscher für die verschiedenen Bezirke (Ämter) des Landes ausstellten. Sie hatten eine Laufzeit von 10, 15 oder 20 Jahren und wurden danach verlängert. In den Schutzbriefen sind die in Ostfriesland lebenden Juden namentlich aufgeführt. Nachweisbar sind solche Schutzbriefe für die Jahre 1635 (Verlängerung 1647), 1651, 1660, 1671, 1690, 1708 bis zum Generalprivileg des letzten Cirksena-Fürsten Carl Edzard aus dem Jahre 1734. Im Wesentlichen regelten die Generalprivilegien:, Geleitet wurden die jüdischen Gemeinden in Ostfriesland zunächst vom Hofjuden, später durch das Landesrabbinat in Emden, welches auch für Osnabrück zuständig war. Geistliches Oberhaupt war der Landesrabbiner. In den einzelnen Gemeinden verwalteten gewählte Vorsteher alle Angelegenheiten des Synagogen-, Schul- und Armenwesens. Das religiöse Leben wurde in den kleineren Gemeinden vom jüdischen Lehrer geprägt. Er war beim Gottesdienst in der Synagoge auch als Vorbeter tätig und sorgte als Schächter für koscheres Fleisch. Den Juden in Ostfriesland war es verboten, als Handwerker oder Bauern zu arbeiten, weshalb sie meist als Händler oder Schlachter tätig waren. Dies führte dazu, dass Märkte ohne jüdische Händler, Schlachter und Viehhändler undenkbar waren, obwohl der Anteil der Juden an der ostfriesischen Bevölkerung nur 1 % betrug. Die meisten Juden in Ostfriesland lebten in einfachen oder durchschnittlichen Verhältnissen., Dreißigjähriger Krieg., Der Dreißigjährige Krieg sicherte kapitalkräftigen Juden durch den ständig wachsenden Geldbedarf der Kriegsparteien zwar einerseits ein Bleiberecht, belastete sie andererseits in einem bis dahin unbekannten Ausmaß. Die Liste ihrer finanziellen Verpflichtungen war lang. 1629 zahlten die Emder Juden (als Vertreter der jüdischen Gemeinden Ostfrieslands) 180 Gulden Schutzgeld im Jahr, 200 Gulden Torfgeld (Abgabe für eine Feuerstelle) sowie etwa 2.000 Gulden an diversen Verbrauchssteuern, insgesamt also etwa 2.380 Gulden. Hinzu kamen noch Mietzins, Heiratsgelder, außerordentliche Abgaben an den Landesherrn: 4 Gulden Schutzgeld pro Haushalt plus 150 Reichstaler Antrittsgeld. Dieses musste der Sohn eines verstorbenen Mitgliedes zahlen, um in die Rechte des Vaters einzutreten., Als im Ausgang des Dreißigjährigen Krieges der Graf Ulrich II. viel Geld für den Abzug der hessischen Truppen aus Ostfriesland aufbringen musste, verpfändete die Gräfin Juliane Juwelen im Wert von 54.650 Gulden durch Vermittlung des Hofjuden in Amsterdam und erhielt dafür in mehreren Raten größere Darlehen., 1645 bis 1744., Insgesamt war die Lage der Juden in Ostfriesland bis 1744 im Vergleich zu anderen Gebieten relativ gut. So wurde der jüdischen Gemeinde in Emden erlaubt, ihren Friedhof innerhalb der Stadtmauern anzulegen (1700). Dieses war ein außergewöhnliches Zugeständnis, aber noch bis ins 19. Jahrhundert mussten die Juden ohne Bürgerrechte bleiben und unter Sondergesetzen leben., Der von Graf Ulrich II. 1645 ausgestellte Generalgeleitsbrief gestattete den Juden Ostfrieslands, nach eigener „jüdischer Ordnung“ leben zu dürfen. 1670 ließ die Fürstin Christine Charlotte einen Generalgeleitsbrief verfassen, der den Juden die Abhaltung von Gottesdiensten in ihren Wohnungen oder in eigenen Synagogen erlaubte. Weiterhin legte er fest, dass sie ihre Toten nach jüdischer Gewohnheit bestatten durften. Beschwerden der Krämergilden über die jüdischen Händler fanden beim jeweiligen Landesherren kein Gehör. Georg Albrecht entgegnet auf eine Beschwerde aus dem Jahr 1710: \\"„daß in Ostfriesland die mit Geleit versehenen Juden und in specie der Stadt Aurich in unvordenklicher Posession des freien Handels und Wandels sich jederzeit befunden haben.“\\", 1744 bis 1806., Die liberale Haltung gegenüber den Juden änderte sich mit der Machtübernahme durch Preußen im Jahre 1744. Dies führte zu einer deutlichen Verschlechterung auch der Lage der Juden; denn die restriktive preußische Gesetzgebung gegenüber Juden galt nun auch in Ostfriesland. Erklärtes Ziel der preußischen Regierung war die Senkung des jüdischen Bevölkerungsanteils in Ostfriesland. Die von Juden zu leistenden Abgaben wurden deutlich erhöht, Immobilienbesitz wurde ihnen verboten und den jüdischen Gewerbetreibenden wurden zahlreiche Einschränkungen und Verbote auferlegt. Zu dieser Zeit zahlten die Juden Ostfrieslands die jährliche Summe von 776 Talern. Nun war der Schutzbrief nur an den ältesten Sohn vererbbar, zwei weitere Söhne konnten ihn gegen die vergleichsweise hohe Summe von 80 Talern erlangen. Die übrigen Söhne mussten unverheiratet und damit kinderlos bleiben oder auswandern. Außerdem war an den Zollschranken der erniedrigende, sonst nur für Vieh übliche Leibzoll, zu entrichten. Die gewünschte Senkung des jüdischen Bevölkerungsanteils wurde damit zwar nicht erreicht, viele Juden verarmten jedoch, so dass schon im Jahre 1765 zwei Drittel der jüdischen Bevölkerung unter erbärmlichsten Bedingungen lebte. Dem stand eine kleine Oberschicht gegenüber, welche hauptsächlich aus Großkaufleuten und Bankiers bestand. Insgesamt gehörten die jüdischen Gemeinden Ostfrieslands zu den ärmeren Deutschlands., Antisemitische Äußerungen und Handlungen waren bis Anfang der 1930er Jahre selten. Nur die Calvinistische Kirche in Emden protestierte gegen die Duldung der Juden, was jedoch beim Magistrat der Stadt kein Gehör fand. 1761 und 1762 kam es in Zusammenhang mit den Wirren des Siebenjährigen Krieges erstmals zu größeren Ausschreitungen gegen Juden. Mehrere Häuser wurden geplündert, weil die Bevölkerung Juden für die schlechte Versorgungslage verantwortlich machte., 1806 bis 1815., Nach der Schlacht bei Jena und Auerstedt wurde Ostfriesland in das Königreich Holland und damit in den französischen Machtbereich eingegliedert. 1810 kam es als Département \\"Ems-Oriental\\" („Osterems“) unmittelbar zum französischen Kaiserreich. Für die Juden bedeutete dies eine deutliche Verbesserung ihrer Lage.

Nach einer Reihe von theoretischen und experimentellen Vorarbeiten verschiedener Autoren im 19. Jahrhundert wurde diese Entwicklung in den Jahren um 1900 insbesondere von Hendrik Antoon Lorentz und Henri Poincaré eingeleitet und gipfelte 1905 in der Ausarbeitung der speziellen Relativitätstheorie durch Albert Einstein. In der Folge wurde die Theorie weiter ausgebaut, vor allem durch Hermann Minkowski., Überblick., Isaac Newton war in seinen 1687 publizierten Principia von einem absoluten Raum und einer absoluten Zeit ausgegangen. Gleichwohl galt auch in seiner Theorie das Relativitätsprinzip von Galileo Galilei, wonach alle relativ zueinander gleichförmig bewegten Beobachter ihren absoluten Bewegungszustand nicht bestimmen können. Ihre Perspektiven sind demnach gleichberechtigt und der Galilei-Transformation unterworfen; es gibt kein privilegiertes Bezugssystem. Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts betonten verschiedene Physiker, genau genommen führe dies zu einer Vervielfältigung „absoluter Räume“ – so etwa Ludwig Lange, der 1885 den operational begründeten Begriff Inertialsystem einführte. Ernst Mach sah die Absolutheit von Raum und Zeit nicht hinreichend phänomenologisch-empirisch fundiert., Das Gegenstück zum „absoluten Raum“ der Mechanik war der Äther in der Elektrodynamik. Dieses Konzept beruht auf der bis Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts nicht hinterfragten Annahme, dass Wellen zu ihrer Ausbreitung ein Medium benötigen. In Analogie zum Schall, der zu seiner Ausbreitung die Luft benötigt, wurde für das Licht der „Äther“ postuliert, der überdies als stofflich vorgestellt wurde. James Clerk Maxwell hatte diese Voraussetzung so formuliert, dass sich \\"alle\\" optischen und elektrischen Phänomene \\"in einem\\" Medium ausbreiten. Unter diesen Vorannahmen hat die Lichtgeschwindigkeit den durch die maxwellschen Gleichungen angegebenen Wert nur relativ zum Äther. Infolge der damals weit verbreiteten Annahme, dass der Äther ruht und nicht von der Erde mitgeführt wird, wäre es möglich, den Bewegungszustand der Erde relativ zum Äther zu bestimmen und diesen somit als ein ausgezeichnetes Bezugssystem zu verwenden. Allerdings scheiterten alle Versuche, die Relativbewegung der Erde zu ihm zu bestimmen., Dies führte ab 1892 zur Entwicklung der maxwell-lorentzschen Elektrodynamik durch Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, welche auf einem absolut ruhenden Äther beruhte. Dessen Unauffindbarkeit wurde durch die Annahmen erklärt, dass im Äther bewegte Körper verkürzt sind (Längenkontraktion), und Prozesse bei im Äther bewegten Körpern verlangsamt ablaufen (Zeitdilatation). Grundlage dafür war jedoch, dass die Galilei-Transformation durch die Lorentz-Transformation ersetzt wurde. Lorentz konnte in seiner nachfolgenden Arbeit von 1904 das Relativitätsprinzip jedoch nur unvollkommen erfüllen. Henri Poincaré erkannte 1904, dass die Unüberschreitbarkeit der Lichtgeschwindigkeit für alle Beobachter das Hauptmerkmal der „neuen Mechanik“ (also der lorentzschen Theorie) war. 1905 gelang ihm eine vollständige physikalische Verallgemeinerung und mathematisch elegante Formalisierung der lorentzschen Elektrodynamik, wobei er das Relativitätsprinzip als universell gültiges Naturgesetz einschließlich der Elektrodynamik und Gravitation festlegte – jedoch hielt er weiterhin an der Existenz eines Äthers und der Unterscheidung zwischen „wahren“ und „scheinbaren“ Längen und Zeiten fest., Albert Einstein gelang 1905 mit der speziellen Relativitätstheorie (SRT) schließlich durch Wandlung der Begriffe von Raum und Zeit und durch Abschaffung des Äthers eine völlige Neuinterpretation der lorentzschen Elektrodynamik. Diese Ergebnisse leitete Einstein ausschließlich aus dem Relativitätsprinzip und dem Prinzip der Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindigkeit, die er als Postulate seiner Theorie zugrunde legte, ab. Durch die Abschaffung der Konzeption eines Äthers gab es nun keinen Grund mehr für eine Unterscheidung zwischen „wahren“ und „scheinbaren“ Koordinaten, wie noch bei Poincaré und Lorentz. Dies alles machte den Weg zu relativistischen Feldtheorien und zur Entwicklung der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie (ART) frei. Die Untersuchungen zur SRT wurden nach Einstein unter anderem durch Hermann Minkowski fortgesetzt, der 1907 die formalen Grundlagen für das heute übliche Konzept der vierdimensionalen Raumzeit entwickelte., Äther und Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper., Äthermodelle und maxwellsche Gleichungen., Im 19. Jahrhundert war man vor allem durch die Arbeiten von Thomas Young (1804) und Augustin Jean Fresnel (1816) zur Überzeugung gelangt, dass Licht sich als eine Transversalwelle in einem Medium („Lichtäther“) ausbreitet, welches von vielen als ein elastischer Festkörper aufgefasst wurde. Es wurde jedoch weiterhin zwischen optischen Phänomenen einerseits, elektrodynamischen andererseits unterschieden. Das heißt, es mussten für diese Phänomene jeweils eigene Äthervarianten konstruiert werden. Versuche, diese Äthervarianten zu vereinigen und eine vollständig gültige mechanische Beschreibung des Äthers vorzulegen, scheiterten jedoch., Nach Vorarbeiten von Physikern wie Michael Faraday, Lord Kelvin und anderen entwickelte James Clerk Maxwell (1864) nun grundlegende Gleichungen für Elektrizität und Magnetismus, die so genannten maxwellschen Gleichungen. Dabei entwarf er ein Modell, in dem die Phänomene der Optik als auch der Elektrodynamik zusammen auf einen einzigen, elektromagnetischen Äther zurückzuführen sind, und definierte Licht als eine elektromagnetische Welle, welche sich konstant mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit in Bezug zum Äther ausbreitete. Als weitere wichtige Konsequenz der Theorie wurde von Maxwell (1873) die Existenz von elektrostatischen und magnetischen „Spannungen“ abgeleitet, die einen Druck auf Körper ausüben können – eine unmittelbare Folge davon ist der vom Licht ausgeübte Strahlungsdruck. Adolfo Bartoli (1876) leitete die Existenz desselben Drucks aus thermodynamischen Überlegungen ab., Nachdem Heinrich Hertz (1887) die Existenz von elektromagnetischen Wellen nachgewiesen hatte, wurde die maxwellsche Theorie schließlich weithin akzeptiert. Oliver Heaviside (1889) und Hertz (1890 a,b) führten dabei modernisierte Versionen der maxwellschen Gleichungen ein, die eine wichtige Grundlage für die weitere Entwicklung der Elektrodynamik bildeten („maxwell-hertzsche“ bzw. „heaviside-hertzsche“ Gleichungen). Dabei war es schließlich die von Heaviside gegebene Form, welche sich allgemein durchsetzte. Anfang 1900 wurde die hertzsche Theorie jedoch experimentell widerlegt und musste aufgegeben werden. Hertz selbst war dabei einer der letzten Anhänger des „mechanistischen Weltbildes“, wonach alle elektromagnetischen Prozesse auf mechanische Stoß- und Kontaktwirkungen im Äther zurückgeführt werden sollten., Unauffindbarkeit des Äthers., Was nun den Bewegungszustand des Äthers relativ zur Materie betraf, wurden prinzipiell zwei Möglichkeiten in Betracht gezogen, welche bereits vor den Arbeiten Maxwells diskutiert wurden:, Fresnels Theorie wurde bevorzugt, weil mit seiner Theorie die Aberration des Lichtes und viele optische Phänomene erklärt werden konnten und weil sein Mitführungskoeffizient von Hippolyte Fizeau (1851) mit dem Fizeau-Experiment sehr genau gemessen wurde. Hingegen konnte sich die Theorie von Stokes nicht durchsetzen, da sie sowohl der Aberration als auch dem Ergebnis des Fizeau-Experiments widersprach – die deswegen eingeführten Hilfshypothesen waren nicht überzeugend oder überhaupt widersprüchlich., Albert A. Michelson (1881) versuchte die Relativbewegung von Erde und Äther („Ätherwind“), welche nach Fresnels Theorie hätte auftreten müssen, direkt zu messen. Er konnte jedoch mit seiner Interferometeranordnung das von ihm erwartete Ergebnis nicht feststellen und interpretierte das Ergebnis als Beleg für die These von Stokes (vollständige Äthermitführung durch die Erde) und damit gegen die Theorie Fresnels. Lorentz (1886) wies jedoch nach, dass Michelson bei den Berechnungen ein Rechenfehler unterlaufen war, woraus sich ergab, dass das Experiment zu ungenau war, um im Rahmen der Messgenauigkeit überhaupt ein positives Messresultat zu erbringen, was von Michelson selbst zugegeben wurde. Da die fresnelsche Theorie nun doch nicht widerlegt schien, führten Michelson und Edward W. Morley (1886) ein Experiment durch, bei dem die Messungen Fizeaus zum fresnelschen Mitführungskoeffizienten überprüft werden sollten. Tatsächlich gelang die Bestätigung und entgegen seiner Aussage von 1881 war Michelson diesmal der Meinung, dass damit der ruhende Äther Fresnels bestätigt sei. Dies erforderte allerdings eine Wiederholung des Michelson-Experiments von 1881, wobei zur großen Überraschung von Michelson und Morley dieses heute berühmte Michelson-Morley-Experiment das erwartete positive Resultat abermals nicht lieferte. Wieder schien das Experiment den eigentlich bereits widerlegten stokesschen Äther zu bestätigen und stand im krassen Gegensatz zu dem Versuch von 1886, welcher für den fresnelschen Äther sprach., Woldemar Voigt entwickelte (1887) auf Basis eines elastischen Äthermodells (also nicht des elektromagnetischen Modells Maxwells) und im Zuge von Untersuchungen zum Dopplereffekt eine Koordinatentransformation zwischen einem im Äther ruhenden und einem bewegten System. Die Gleichungen der Voigt-Transformation ließen die Wellengleichung unverändert, waren bis auf einen unterschiedlichen Skalenfaktor identisch mit der späteren Lorentz-Transformation und konnten den Michelson-Morley-Versuch erklären. Dabei beinhalteten sie den später als „Lorentz-Faktor“ bekannten Ausdruck formula_1 für die \\"y\\"- und \\"z\\"-Koordinaten und eine später als Ortszeit benannte neue Zeitvariable formula_2. Sie waren allerdings nicht symmetrisch und verletzten folglich das Relativitätsprinzip., Es zeigte sich jedoch noch eine andere Möglichkeit einer Erklärung ab: Heaviside (1889) und George Frederick Charles Searle (1897) stellten fest, dass elektrostatische Felder in Bewegungsrichtung kontrahiert waren (Heaviside-Ellipsoid). Den Arbeiten Heavisides folgend führte George Francis FitzGerald (1889) die Ad-hoc-Hypothese ein, dass auch materielle Körper in Bewegungsrichtung kontrahieren, was zur Längenkontraktion führt und den Michelson-Morley-Versuch erklären könnte – im Gegensatz zu Voigts Gleichungen wird hier also die x-Koordinate verändert.

Als römisches Legionslager gegründet, war die Stadt später Hauptstadt der Provinz Germania superior und von 780/82 bis 1803 Erzbischofssitz. Ihre Blüte erlebte die Stadt in der Zeit von 1244 bis 1462, als sie Freie Stadt war. Danach wurde ihre Geschichte bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts durch die Kurfürsten und Erzbischöfe von Mainz bestimmt, die in der Stadt residierten. Nach dem Ende dieser Ära verlor die Stadt Mainz in der Zeit als Bundesfestung weitgehend ihre Bedeutung, während die Bedeutung als Festung stieg. 1946 wurde Mainz Landeshauptstadt von Rheinland-Pfalz., Vorgeschichte., Schon für die Zeit vor 20.000 bis 25.000 Jahren ist menschliches Leben in der Gegend des heutigen Mainz bezeugt. 1921 wurde auf dem Mainzer Linsenberg eine Raststelle für Jäger freigelegt, die aus der letzten Eiszeit stammt und als bedeutendes Relikt Eingang in die Fachliteratur gefunden hat. Sie ist die älteste Spur menschlichen Lebens auf dem Mainzer Stadtgebiet., Bedingt durch den Rhein, der von Anfang an die Lebensader der Stadt war, fand nach Ende der Steinzeit vor allem gegen 1800 v. Chr. ein reiches Kultur- und Völkerleben im heutigen Mainzer Raum statt, das sich über die Bronzezeit durch alle Epochen zieht., In der zweiten Hälfte des 1. Jahrtausends v. Chr. waren die Kelten die bestimmende Macht am Oberrhein. Sie besiedelten auch den Mainzer Raum und nannten diese Siedlung, die mit dem Stadtbegriff jedoch nicht vergleichbar ist, nach einem ihrer Götter namens \\"Mogon\\". Aus dieser Bezeichnung leiteten die später eintreffenden Römer den Stadtnamen \\" ab, den erstmals Tacitus erwähnte., 75 v. Chr. kamen schließlich die Germanen unter der Führung von Ariovist in die Nähe von Mainz, wo sie den Rhein in Richtung Gallien überschritten. Die bis dahin am Mittelrhein lebenden Kelten wurden zurückgedrängt, wobei in der Mainzer Gegend, die zum äußersten Einflussbereich des Stammes der keltischen Treverer gehörte, der Anteil der keltischen Bevölkerung bis zur Ankunft der Römer nachweislich relativ intakt blieb., Nach dem Gallischen Krieg, der mit der Schlacht um Alesia 52 v. Chr. endete, orientierte sich das Imperium Romanum unter Julius Caesar und später Augustus Richtung Rhein und Germanien. Die Römer eroberten zunächst die linksrheinischen Gebiete, um von dort aus das rechtsrheinische Germanien () zu unterwerfen. Eines der Lager, das im Zuge dieses Planes am Rhein errichtet wurde, war das 13/12 v. Chr. von Nero Claudius Drusus angelegte spätere. Die Stadt gehört somit zu den ältesten Städten in Deutschland., Römische Zeit., gehörte fast 500 Jahre zum Römischen Reich. Ein früher angegebenes Gründungsdatum des Legionslagers 38 v. Chr. ist archäologisch nicht nachweisbar und heute nicht mehr haltbar. Dennoch wurde es noch 1962 offiziell zum Anlass der Zweitausendjahrfeier genommen. Der sicher datierte Beginn der römischen Geschichte von Mainz wird auf das Jahr 13/12 v. Chr. gelegt. Im Zuge der Expansionspolitik des römischen Reiches Richtung Germanien kam es (spätestens) zu diesem Zeitpunkt zur Gründung eines Legionslagers an der Mainmündung bei Mainz sowie einer ständigen Etablierung der römischen Herrschaft bis zum Rhein. Dafür verantwortlich war –bis zu seinem Tode im Jahre 9 v. Chr.– Nero Claudius Drusus., Im Lager waren bis zum Jahr 90 n. Chr. ständig erst zwei (beginnend mit der 14. Legion Gemina und der 16. Legion Gallica), später eine Legion (22. Legion Primigenia Pia Fidelis, die Mainzer „Hauslegion“ bis zur Mitte des 4. Jahrhunderts n. Chr.) stationiert. In Vorbereitungen zu diversen Feldzügen nach Germanien waren zeitweilig sogar bis zu vier Legionen sowie Auxiliartruppen in Mainz stationiert. Ein Teil dieser zusätzlichen Truppen wurde in einem zweiten großen Militärlager, das bis zum Ende des 1. Jahrhunderts n. Chr. bestand, untergebracht. Es lag bei Weisenau auf dem Gelände des heutigen Steinbruchs und ist archäologisch nicht mehr nachweisbar. Dadurch zog der Militärstützpunkt auch Händler, Handwerker und Wirtsleute an. Die um das Lager lebenden Menschen hatten jedoch keine Bürgerrechte und waren vom Standortkommandanten abhängig. Das Hauptlager, an das noch der heutige Stadtteilname Kästrich () erinnert, war wie die übrigen Römerlager aufgebaut: Zwei sich kreuzende Straßen (, , ) mit vier Toren (, , , \\")., Nach dem Desaster in der Varusschlacht 9 n. Chr. wurde der Rhein zwischenzeitlich zum Grenzfluss zwischen Germanien und dem Imperium. 89 n. Chr., nach der Niederschlagung des Saturninus-Aufstands, wurde die Stadt zusätzlich zu ihrer militärischen Funktion als wichtigstes Heerlager an der Rheingrenze auch zum zivilen Verwaltungszentrum und zur Hauptstadt der neugebildeten Provinz (Obergermanien). Die Provinz reichte vom Oberrhein bis nach Koblenz, das damals hieß. Nördlich davon lag die Provinz mit (Köln) als Provinzhauptstadt. Ein umfassendes Bauprogramm speziell des flavischen Kaiserhauses (Ausbau des Legionslagers in Stein, Aquäduktbau, dauerhafte Pfahlrostbrücke mit massiven Steinpfeilern) sowie die Eroberung der Wetterau und der Beginn des Limesbaues dort kennzeichneten die Entwicklung von im 1. Jahrhundert n. Chr., In der Folgezeit blühte Mainz auf, erreichte aber als Zivilsiedlung nie den Status von Köln oder Trier. Händlerstraßen, zum Beispiel nach (Metz), machten die Stadt wohlhabend. Stadt und Umland wurden jedoch ab dem Ende des 2. Jahrhunderts n. Chr. immer häufiger von einfallenden Stämmen wie den Chatten, Alamannen und den Vandalen bedroht, vor allem nach dem Fall des Limes 258 n. Chr., Dies führte 259/260 n. Chr. zum Verlust des rechtsrheinischen Limesgebietes, wurde wieder Grenzstadt. Im dritten und spätestens im vierten Jahrhundert hielt auch das Christentum in der Stadt Einzug. Spätestens 368 ist von der Präsenz eines Bischofs in der Stadt auszugehen (siehe auch: Geschichte des Bistums Mainz)., Im gleichen Jahrhundert trat jedoch der Verfall des Imperium Romanum immer deutlicher zutage. Vor allem die Alamannen bedrohten Mainz und besetzten 352/355 die Stadt. Weitere Einfälle sind aus den Jahren 357, 368 und 370 belegt. Julian eroberte die Stadt 357 n. Chr. nochmals von den Alamannen zurück und verstärkte die Rheinflotte in Mainz (Römerschiffe). Auch die bereits im 3. Jahrhundert n. Chr. erbaute Stadtmauer wurde nochmals in der zweiten Hälfte des 4. Jahrhunderts umgebaut und erneuert. In der Neujahrsnacht 407 eroberten die Vandalen die Stadt und zerstörten sie (\\"siehe\\" → Rheinübergang von 406). 451 fielen schließlich die Hunnen ein, richteten aber nach neuester Forschung keine großen Schäden in Mainz an. Die Zeit des römischen Mainz war damit aber vorbei. Die Franken übernahmen die Herrschaft und gliederten Mainz zum Ende des 5. Jahrhunderts in ihr Reich ein., Merowinger, Karolinger und Ottonen., Zwischen den Franken und den Alamannen, dem zweiten großen Volksstamm dieser Gegend, entbrannte gegen Ende des 5. Jh. ein Kampf um die Vorherrschaft über die ehemals römischen Gebiete. 496/97 ließ sich der Frankenkönig Chlodwig I. aus dem Hause der Merowinger nach einem Gelübde taufen. Chlodwig vertrieb in der Folge die Alamannen aus dem Gebiet. Er wurde König Westfrankens und Galliens, später auch des Kölner Frankenreiches, zu dem vermutlich auch Mainz gehörte. Mainz wurde so Teil eines fränkischen Großreiches und von der Grenz- zur Binnenstadt. Ab dieser Zeit, vor allem aber zur Zeit des Bischofs Sidonius (6. Jahrhundert) blühte das Christentum in der Stadt auf und es kam erstmals wieder zu Bautätigkeiten. Im 7. und 8. Jh. begann die Zeit der Mission durch Benediktinermönche aus dem angelsächsischen Gebiet. Der bedeutendste dieser Missionare war der aus Wessex stammende Missionserzbischof Bonifatius. Dieser betrieb 744 die Absetzung des wegen der Ausübung von Blutrache für unwürdig befundenen Gewiliobus und wurde selbst Bischof von Mainz, von wo aus er die Christianisierung von Hessen und dem Friesland einleitete. Unter seinem Nachfolger Lullus (Lul) wurde das Bistum um 780/782 zum Erzbistum erhoben. Die Kirche von Mainz entwickelte sich zur größten Kirchenprovinz nördlich der Alpen (\\"siehe:\\" Bistum Mainz), was auch die Bedeutung der Stadt an sich hervorhob., Mit Karl dem Großen begann die große Zeit der Karolinger. Karl gründete nah bei Mainz in Ingelheim eine seiner Kaiserpfalzen. Der Fund eines karolingischen Thronfragments aus der zweiten Hälfte des 8. Jahrhunderts legt nahe, dass auch in Mainz eine Kaiserpfalz gestanden hat. Karl hielt in Mainz mehrere Versammlungen ab, eine Tradition, die noch Jahrhunderte weitergeführt wurde und 1184 unter Kaiser Friedrich I. Barbarossa ihren Höhepunkt fand. Mainz bot sich als Tagungsort an, da es mit dem Stift St. Alban vor Mainz schon früh über einen großen Kirchenbau (75m Länge) verfügte, in dem die Versammlungen stattfinden konnten und der sich dadurch in den folgenden 200 Jahren zum geistlichen Zentrum der Diözese entwickelte. Da von Mainz seit der Zeit des Bonifatius aktiv die Christianisierung der Slawen und anderer Ostvölker betrieben wurde, entwickelte sich Mainz weiter zu einem wichtigen Knotenpunkt des Reiches. Dies galt nicht nur für politische und religiöse, sondern auch für wirtschaftliche Belange. Vor allem Kaufleute machten Mainz wohlhabend. Der Akzent blieb in der Stadtentwicklung jedoch stets auf der religiösen Bedeutung, die sich vor allem von den jeweiligen Erzbischöfen ableitete. Unter den frühen Nachfolgern des Lullus ist dabei vor allem noch der aus Mainz stammende Rabanus Maurus zu nennen, der 847 Erzbischof wurde. Sein Pontifikat war der erste Höhepunkt dieser Entwicklung zu einem bedeutenden geistlichen Zentrum., Nach den überwundenen Einfällen der Normannen im 9. Jh. begann im 10. Jh. die Epoche, der Mainz seinen Ehrennamen \\"\\" („Goldenes Mainz“) verdankt. Der Erzbischof trug von da an den Titel „Erzbischof des Heiligen Stuhles von Mainz“, ein besonderer Ehrentitel, den heute neben Mainz nur noch der Stuhl von Rom innehat.

In der ersten Hälfte des 16. Jahrhunderts, während der Herrschaft der Täufer, wurde das gesamte Archiv der Stadt vernichtet, so dass die älteren geschichtlichen Daten teilweise nicht bestimmbar oder nur über Urkunden und Dokumente, die nicht innerhalb der Stadt archiviert waren, erschließbar sind., Vor- und Frühgeschichte., Das münstersche Stadtgebiet gehörte nicht zu den herausragenden vorgeschichtlichen Siedlungsplätzen der Münsterländischen Bucht. Spuren der Jäger und Sammler der Steinzeit wie Feuersteinwerkzeuge und gestielte Pfeilspitzen sind zwar vorhanden, größere Fundplätze wurden jedoch nicht entdeckt. Aus der Bronzezeit wurden Flintdolche, bronzener Gräberschmuck und Bronzefibeln auf dem heutigen Stadtgebiet gefunden. Siedlungskontinuität in der Bronzezeit bis in die vorrömische Eisenzeit lässt sich hier nachweisen, nicht jedoch im Innenstadtbereich. Auf intensives Schmiedehandwerk weist ein Depotfund schwertförmiger Eisenbarren im Stadtteil Geist hin. Er stammt aus der Hallstatt- oder Latènezeit., Römerzeit und altsächsische Siedlung Mimigernaford., Auf dem Horsteberg, dem Hügel an der Aa, auf dem später der Dom errichtet wurde, sind germanische Siedlungsspuren aus der frühen römischen Kaiserzeit als auch aus dem 2. und 3.Jahrhundert entdeckt worden. Importe belegen enge Kontakte mit den linksrheinischen römischen Provinzen. Die Siedlungen wurden jedoch spätestens um 300n.Chr. verlassen., Die Archäologen schreiben diese Spuren der \\"Rhein-Weser-germanischen Fundgruppe\\" zu. Nach den Berichten antiker Historiker wie Tacitus und Strabon müsste es sich bei den frühen Bewohnern um Brukterer gehandelt haben. Brukterer gehörten wohl auch zu den germanischen Verbänden, die sich erfolgreich gegen die römische Expansion gewehrt haben. Einer der im Jahre 9n.Chr. in der Varusschlacht erbeuteten Legionsadler wurde jedenfalls 15n.Chr. beim Rachefeldzug des Germanicus gegen die Brukterer zurückerobert., Die jüngere Siedlung wird aber nicht den Brukterern zuzuordnen sein, da diese –wie Tacitus schadenfroh berichtet– bei kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen mit germanischen Nachbarstämmen vernichtend geschlagen und fast ausgerottet wurden. Vermutlich besiedelten die siegreichen Chamaven den Hügel an der Aa, die sich mit den Resten der Brukterer und weitere westgermanische Völker im 3.Jahrhundert zum Stammesverband der Franken zusammenschlossen., Schätzungsweise seit dem 6.Jahrhundert lag im Bereich des Domplatzes die kleine sächsische Siedlung \\"Mimigernaford\\". Die Sachsen, ursprünglich beheimatet im Raum Holstein, breiteten sich im 3. und 4. Jahrhundert über das Elbe-Weser-Dreieck in Richtung England und nach Süden aus. Die Herkunft des Stammesnamens \\"westfalai\\", wie die westlichen Sachsen in den fränkischen Annalen bezeichnet werden, und sie sich auch wohl selbst bezeichnet haben, ist nicht genau geklärt. Eine Deutung verbindet den Wortstamm \\"fal\\" mit \\"fahl, flachsfarben\\" und bezieht ihn auf die Haarfarbe. Für die Namen der Siedlung Mimigernaford gibt es auch verschiedene Deutungen. Nach neueren Untersuchungen ist die Siedlung an der Furt über die Aa nach den Mimigernen benannt, den Sippenangehörigen eines Stammvaters namens Mimigern. Der Name wurde bis ins 10.Jahrhundert benutzt, allerdings häufig in der abgewandelten Form \\"Mimigardeford\\". In einigen Karten wurde auch die Schreibweise \\"Mimigerneford\\" benutzt., Mittelalter – Vom Domkloster zur Hansestadt., Begründung der Klostersiedlung durch Liudger., Das Jahr 793 gilt als offizielles Gründungsjahr Münsters: Im Auftrag Karls des Großen gründete der Friese Liudger auf dem Horsteberg in der kleinen Bauernsiedlung Mimigernaford oder in ihrem unmittelbaren Umfeld ein Kloster \\"(monasterium)\\". Am 30. März 805 wurde in Münster ein Bistum eingerichtet und Liudger vom Kölner Erzbischof Hildebold als erster Bischof von Münster beziehungsweise Mimigernaford, wie es immer noch hieß, berufen. Zudem erhielt die Siedlung den Stand einer \\"civitas\\" (Stadt), da ein Bischof nur in einer Stadt residieren durfte, und die Bauarbeiten zum Bau des münsterschen Doms auf Landbesitz des Adelsgeschlechts Münster (westfälisches Adelsgeschlecht) wurden aufgenommen. Die Verleihung der Stadtrechte erfolgte jedoch erst einige Jahrhunderte später. Schätzungsweise um das Jahr 900 herum entstand um die inzwischen deutlich angewachsene Stadt ohne eigentliche Stadtrechte eine Wallanlage um den Dom herum. Innerhalb dieser Domburg begann die Ansiedlung der Ministerialen und Handwerker. Durch den anhaltenden wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung kam es zu ersten Bildungen von Marktsiedlungen vor den Toren der Domburg wie dem Roggenmarkt oder dem \\"Alten Fischmarkt\\". Neben der Landwirtschaft wandelte sich die Stadt zu einem wichtigen Handelspunkt., Ummauerung der Stadt und des Dombezirks., Aufgrund der immer größer werdenden Gemeinde wurde um 1040 westlich der Domburg die Überwasserkirche gegründet. Ebenfalls zu Beginn des 11. Jahrhunderts wurde der erste Kirchenbau der Lambertikirche als erste Marktkirche der Stadt gegründet, die von den Kaufleuten gestiftet wurde. Im Jahr 1068 erscheint dann erstmals mit „Monasterium“ ein neuer Name für die Stadt. Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung hielt an bis zur Vertreibung des Bischofs aus der Stadt durch die Bürger, die sich nach dem Investiturstreit zwischen Kaiser und Papst um das Recht der Bischofseinsetzung entzweiten. Als Folge wurde die Stadt durch Lothar von Süpplingenburg belagert und brannte am 2. Februar 1121 komplett nieder. Nach dem Wiederaufbau und der Erweiterung der bislang existierenden Märkte, zum Beispiel durch den Prinzipalmarkt, erhielt Münster –oder „Munstre“, wie es zu jener Zeit auch umgangssprachlich genannt wurde– um 1170 das Stadtrecht und am 4. Mai 1173 mit Bischof Hermann II. von Katzenelnbogen den ersten fürstbischöflichen Landesherren, nachdem an diesem Tag Kaiser Friedrich I. die Erwerbung der Vogteigewalt über das Stift Münster von Simon I. von Tecklenburg durch seinen Vorgänger Ludwig I. von Wippra genehmigte. Als 1197 die Stadt durch einen weiteren großen Stadtbrand komplett niederbrannte, wurde es den Handwerkern und Händlern verboten, sich wieder innerhalb der Domburg anzusiedeln. Sie siedelten sich daher auf den östlich gelegenen Märkten an und legten damit den Grundstein für den Aufstieg Münsters, wie der Name der Stadt aus Quellen des Jahres 1206 erstmals belegt wird, zu einem wichtigen Handelsplatz in Westfalen. Zeitgleich mit dem Wiederaufbau der Stadt wurde auch der Bau einer äußeren Stadtmauer um die Marktsiedlungen beschlossen, um auch die Händler vor möglichen Angreifern verteidigen zu können. Sie wurde 1278 fertiggestellt., Diese Stadtmauer war acht bis zehn Meter hoch, über 4km lang und mit einem vorgelagerten Graben versehen. Zur Sicherung der Mauer und der zehn Stadttore existierten in deren Verlauf sechs Türme. Im 14. Jahrhundert wurde sie durch einen Außenwall und zweiten Graben zusätzlich verstärkt. Der Verlauf der Stadtmauer ist in etwa durch die Promenade gekennzeichnet. Mit 104ha war Münster zu dieser Zeit die flächenmäßig größte Stadt Westfalens, gefolgt von den damals bedeutendsten Städten Soest (102ha), Dortmund (81ha), Paderborn (66ha), Herford (58 ha) und Minden (50ha). Osnabrück reichte erst in der zweiten Hälfte des 13. Jahrhunderts mit der Neustadtgründung in der Größenordnung von 102ha an Münster heran. Gemeinsam mit den genannten Städten gehörte Münster jedenfalls zu den wichtigsten Städten der Hanse in Westfalen., Mitglied in Städtebünden und der Hanse., Gegen Mitte des 13. Jahrhunderts schlossen sich die mächtigen Städte zu Städtebünden zusammen, um der Ohnmacht des Kaisers und der herrschenden Anarchie im Heiligen Römischen Reich entgegenzuwirken. Ziel war es, den freien Zugang zu den Märkten zu sichern und eine Schutzgemeinschaft gegenüber Angreifern einzurichten. So schloss sich Münster am 22. Mai 1246 mit den Städten Osnabrück, Minden, Herford und Coesfeld zum Ladbergener Städtebund sowie im Jahre 1253 mit Dortmund, Soest und Lippe zum Werner Bund zusammen. Diese Bündnisse stellten die ersten Vorläufer der Hanse in Westfalen dar und führten zu einem andauernden wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung. Münster stieg zu einer bedeutenden Handelsstadt in Westfalen auf und der Einfluss der Händler und Kaufleute auf die Stadt wuchs. Nachdem die Bürgerschaft, an deren Spitze die adeligen Erbmänner standen, sich bereits während des frühen 13. Jahrhunderts die Aufsicht über Handel und Gewerbe sowie die Akzise sicherte, stellte sie im Jahre 1270 bereits ein erstes militärisches Aufgebot der Stadt. Durch einen Vertrag mit Fürstbischof Everhard von Diest aus dem Jahre 1278 gelangte Münster in den Besitz weiterer Privilegien und erschien auf dem Landtag erstmals als Stand. Die ersten landesrechtlichen Privilegien sicherte sich die Stadt im Jahre 1309, als der damalige Fürstbischof und Landesherr Konrad I. von Berg auf sein Recht am Nachlass minderfreier Bürger verzichtete., Zeugen von diesem wirtschaftlichen und politischen Aufschwung sind der größere Neubau der bürgerlichen Marktkirche St. Lamberti ab 1375 und das gegen Ende des 13. und Anfang des 14. Jahrhunderts erbaute gotische Rathaus in direkter Sichtlinie zum Dom, das die politische und rechtliche Eigenständigkeit der Stadt gegenüber dem Bischof demonstrieren sollte. Ebenfalls in diesem Jahrhundert entstand eine weitere wichtige Kirche in Münster, die 1340 erbaute Liebfrauenkirche westlich der Domburg, nachdem ihre beiden Vorgänger jeweils komplett zerstört worden waren. Da sie auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite der Aa liegt („Über den Wassern“), ist sie auch unter dem Namen \\"Überwasserkirche\\" bekannt., Im Jahre 1368 wurde Münster erstmals als Mitglied der Hanse in einem Privileg von Albrecht von Mecklenburg, König von Schweden, genannt. Wahrscheinlich ist jedoch, dass die Stadt bereits lange Zeit vorher in die Hanse hineingewachsen war. Als Folge der sogenannten \\"Stiftsfehde\\" von 1450 bis 1458 schied Münster jedoch 1454 aus der Han: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Deutsche Ortsgeschichte Geschichte Münster vorgeschichtliche Siedlungsplätze Bronzezeit Römerzeit münstersche Siedlung Germanische Siedlung sächsische Siedlung Mittelalter Hansestadt"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geschichte (Zürich), Schweizerische Ortsgeschichte], Die Stadt Zürich bestand als \\"Turicum\\" schon zu römischer Zeit, stieg aber erst im Mittelalter in die Reihe der grösseren Schweizer Städte auf. Die Herrscher des Heiligen Römischen Reiches erwählten die Stadt an der Limmat als Standort für zwei bedeutende geistliche Stiftungen um die Kultstätten der Stadtpatrone Felix und Regula, die Zürich prägten: Das Grossmünster- und das Fraumünsterstift., 1262 sicherte das Privileg der Reichsunmittelbarkeit die nicht fühlbare Herrschaft eines fernen deutschen Königs. Zürichs Beitritt in verschiedenste Bünde – unter anderem in die entstehende Eidgenossenschaft 1351 und den Konstanzer Bund 1385 – schützte die Stadt längerfristig vor den Expansionsgelüsten lokaler Adelsgeschlechter, allen voran der Habsburger. Zusammen mit Bern bestimmte Zürich zeitweise als Vorort die Politik des aufstrebenden Staatenbundes der Eidgenossenschaft., Seit der Reformation Ulrich Zwinglis gehört Zürich zu den geistigen Zentren des reformierten Bekenntnisses. Dem Status des «Rom an der Limmat» kam es zu, dass sich Zürich seit 1648 im gleichen Rang wie Venedig als souveräne Stadtrepublik betrachtete. Im 18. Jahrhundert galt Zürich hingegen eher als «Athen an der Limmat», dank vieler Gelehrter wie etwa Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, Johann Kaspar Lavater und Johann Jakob Bodmer sowie seiner wichtigen Position als Handelsstadt., Erst nach massivem äusseren Druck erlangte die beherrschte Landschaft mit der Gründung des Kantons Zürich schrittweise Gleichberechtigung. Seit dem 19. Jahrhundert ist Zürich das Wirtschafts- und Finanzzentrum der Schweiz., Name, Wappen, Siegel., \\"Hauptartikel:\\" Wappen des Kantons und der Stadt Zürich, Das älteste Indiz für den Namen Zürich in seiner lateinischen Form stammt aus dem 2. Jahrhundert n. Chr. und ist auf einem Grabstein zu lesen, der 1747 auf dem Lindenhof in Zürich gefunden wurde. Auf diesem Stein wird mit der Bezeichnung \\"STA{TIONIS} TURICEN{SIS}\\" auf eine römische Zollstation \\"Turicum\\" hingewiesen. Die Herkunft des Namens ist nicht endgültig geklärt, er ist aber auf alle Fälle vorlateinisch. Am wahrscheinlichsten ist eine Ableitung \\"*Turīcon\\" zum keltischen Personennamen \\"Tūros\\"., Die bekannten frühmittelalterlichen lateinischen Namensformen für Zürich sind \\"Turigum\\" (807), \\"T(h)uregum\\" und \\"Thuricum\\" (898). Der erste Beleg für eine deutsche Namensform, nämlich \\"Ziurichi,\\" erscheint im 7.Jahrhundert beim Geographen von Ravenna; später finden sich Schreibungen wie \\"Zurih\\" (857) und \\"Zurich\\" (924). Im zürichdeutschen Dialekt heisst die Stadt \\"Züri\\". Der vor allem im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert verwendete Name \\"Tigurum\\" war eine zeitgenössische Neuschöpfung und sollte auf die Tiguriner verweisen, einen Teilstamm der Helvetier., Die ersten bekannten Siegel des Stadtrates von Zürich hängen an zwei Urkunden von 1225 und 1230. Sie tragen die Umschrift \\"sigillum consilii thuricensium\\" und führen die beiden Stadtheiligen Felix und Regula aus der Thebäischen Legion. In den Händen tragen sie ihre Köpfe, die von einem Nimbus umgeben sind. Sicher ab 1348 tritt noch Exuperantius, der Diener von Felix und Regula, zum Stadtsiegel hinzu. Die definitive Umschrift dieses Siegels lautet \\"sigillum civium thuricensium\\". Die Stadtgemeinde Zürich führt seit 1798 in ihrem Siegel den schräg geteilten Schild, überhöht von einer Mauerkrone, mit einem oder zwei Löwen als Schildhalter., Das Stadtwappen, der von Silber und Blau schräg geteilte Schild, ist zum ersten Mal auf einem Siegel des Hofgerichts Zürich von 1389 nachgewiesen. Sicher belegt ist die bis heute gebräuchliche Fahne erst seit 1434. Auf den Münzen und Stadtansichten von Zürich war der Wappenschild der Stadt ursprünglich vom Reichswappen und der Reichskrone bekrönt. Der Wappenschild wird seit dem 15.Jahrhundert von zwei Löwen gehalten. Zuweilen halten die Löwen je ein blau-weisses Banner, wobei eines die drei Stadtheiligen zeigt. Gegen 1700 fallen Reichswappen- und krone weg, während die Löwen als Schildhalter bleiben. Der Löwe wurde als «Zürileu» zum Zürcher Wappentier. Das aktuelle Wappen der Stadt zeigt den schräg geteilten Schild, überhöht von einer Mauerkrone, mit zwei Löwen als Schildhalter., Die Stadt Zürich war sowohl königliche wie herzogliche Münzstätte. Die älteste urkundliche Erwähnung der Münzstätte stammt aus dem Jahr 972, die älteste Münze ist ein karolingischer Denar mit der Aufschrift LUDOVICUS REX, RS. HADTUREGUM. König HeinrichIII. verlieh im 11.Jahrhundert auch der Fraumünsterabtei das Münzrecht. Ihr Münzbann umfasste den Zürichgau und das Gebiet um den Walensee bis Sargans, die Innerschweiz bis zum Gotthard, den Aargau bis Huttwil und den Thurgau bis zur Mur. Die Münzen, die in Zürich geprägt wurden, weisen verschiedene Symbole und Beschriftungen auf. Die Fraumünsterabtei prägte nur Pfennige, die zuerst viereckig, dann nach 1400 rund waren. 1524 ging das Münzrecht der Abtei an die Stadt über. Dieser hatte König Sigmund 1425 bereits das Münzrecht bestätigt. Ab dem 16.Jahrhundert erschien das Wappen der Stadt mit dem Reichswappen auf den Münzen, etwa auf dem Zürcher Taler und dem Dukat, teilweise bereits mit den beiden Löwen als Schildhalter. Die Umschrift lautete MONETA TURICENSIS CIVITATIS IMPERIALIS. Später verschwand das Reichswappen und die Umschrift änderte in MONETA REIPUBLICÆ TIGURINÆ. Der Zürcher Schild wurde nun von einem oder zwei Löwen gehalten, der einzelne Löwe hielt entweder ein Schwert oder eine Reichsapfel. Auf der Kopfseite wurden meist entweder Ansichten von Zürich oder Sprüche aufgeprägt, etwa DOMINE CONSERVA NOS IN PACE, IUSTITIA ET CONCORDIA oder PRO DEO ET PATRIA. Die selbständige Münzprägung der Stadt Zürich endete 1798., Altertum., Die frühesten Spuren menschlicher Siedlungstätigkeit im Bereich der heutigen Stadt Zürich sind Reste von Feuchtbodensiedlungen der Egolzwiler Kultur (4430–4230v.Chr.), die sich im Gebiet des westlichen Seebeckens nachweisen lassen. Die Fundplätze, die auch während der späteren Jungsteinzeit, während der Bronzezeit und der frühen Eisenzeit bis 700 v. Chr. besiedelt waren, erstrecken sich vom Uferbereich teilweise bis 500m in den heutigen See hinaus. Siedlungsstellen konnten archäologisch nachgewiesen werden am linken Seeufer beim Alpenquai, Bauschänzli, der Breitingerstrasse und in Wollishofen (Haumesser, Bad) sowie am rechten Seeufer beim Kleinen und Grossen Hafner, am Utoquai und an der Seehofstrasse. Zwischen Rentenanstalt und Mythenschloss am linken Seeende wurden 1994 gut erhaltene neolithische Kulturschichten von drei ehemaligen Seeufersiedlungen archäologisch untersucht. Sie konnten der Pfyner Kultur (3800–3600 v. Chr.), der Horgener Kultur (3150 v. Chr.) und der Schnurkeramischen Epoche (2680–2548 v. Chr.) zugeordnet werden. Von 250 Holzproben für die dendrochronologische Datierung sind deren 128 so genau, dass sie Schlagdaten der Eichenpfähle zwischen 2972 und 2681 v. Chr. sichern. Viele angekohlte, liegende Hölzer und fundreiche Holzkohleschichten belegten eine Brandkatastrophe auf dem ganzen Siedlungsareal, das sich über 240 m erstreckte. Die «Pfahlbaudörfer» bestanden aus zweischiffigen, 5 × 3 m messenden Hütten, wie sie noch 100 Jahre später am gegenüber liegenden Ufer an der Mozartstrasse nach dem gleichen Bauschema gebaut wurden. Der grösste Teil dieser Ufersiedlungen versank in der Spätbronzezeit im See, als der Pegel von ca. 404 auf ca. 407mü.M. anstieg, wahrscheinlich weil der Schuttkegel der Sihl im Bereich des Hauptbahnhofs den See aufstaute., In der Eisenzeit verlagerte sich im Raum Zürich die Siedlungstätigkeit auf Terrassen entlang der Flüsse und des Sees. Aus der Hallstattzeit (8. bis 5.Jh.) sind Funde und Grabhügel in Riesbach (Burghölzli), und Witikon (Egglen), Höngg (Heiziholz), Altstetten (Hard), Affoltern-Seebach (Jungholz) dokumentiert. Aus der Latènezeit (5. bis 1.Jh.) sind Funde und Gräber in Aussersihl (Bäckerstrasse), Enge (Gablerschulhaus), Altstetten (Hard) und Witikon nachgewiesen. Aus dem 1.Jh. stammen Einzel- und Münzfunde aus dem Bereich der Altstadt. Im Kanton Zürich ist bis heute nur eine Zentralsiedlung aus der Eisenzeit sicher belegt, die sich auf dem Plateau des Uto-Kulm auf dem Üetliberg befand und mit Wallanlagen geschützt war., Die keltischen Helvetier siedelten in und um Zürich, wie Funde beim Rennweg zeigen. Auf dem Lindenhof und auf dem Uetliberg bestanden wahrscheinlich keltische Oppida. Die strategisch und handelstechnisch günstige Lage sowie Münzfunde lassen auf die Existenz eines Handelsplatzes schliessen. Die keltische Siedlung von ca. sieben Hektaren lag um den Lindenhofhügel., Aus der Zeit der römischen Eroberung des östlichen Helvetiens 15 v. Chr. stammt ein frühaugusteischer Militärstützpunkt auf dem Lindenhof, an den sich später eine Zivilsiedlung mit Militärstation anschloss. Der offene Marktflecken (\\"vicus\\") \\"Turicum\\" gehörte nach der Sicherung der römischen Herrschaft zunächst zur Provinz \\"Gallia Belgica\\" dann nach ihrer Gründung um 85v.Chr. zur Provinz \\"Germania superior\\". \\"Turicum\\" war als \\"vicus\\" nicht befestigt, hatte aber eine Zollstation des gallischen Zolls (\\"Quadragesima Galliarum\\"). Waren und Reisende wurden dort vor dem Übertritt in die Provinz \\"Raetia\\" abgefertigt, wenn sie auf der Römerstrasse zwischen \\"Vindonissa\\" und \\"Curia\\" bzw. auf der schiffbaren Route zwischen Walensee und Rhein verkehrten, und ein Zoll von 2,5Prozent erhoben. Die Bedeutung von Turicum liegt jedoch fast ausschliesslich in seiner Lage am Ausfluss des Zürichsees begründet, da hier die Güter von See- auf Flussschiffe umgeladen werden mussten. Auch lag Turicum an keiner wichtigen römischen Hauptstrasse. Der antike Name \\"Turicum\\" und die Tatsache, dass dort eine Zollstation vorhanden war, ist nur dank der Grabinschrift für Urbicus, Sohn des lokalen Zollvorstehers, überliefert, die 1747 auf dem Lindenhof gefunden wurde. Bedeutend war wahrscheinlich auch der Hafen, da damals Waren auf Kähnen wahrscheinlich bis nach Walenstadt geführt werden konnten. Der römische Ort lag am Fuss des Lindenhofs, eines zentralen Hügels, auf einer Insel zwischen den Flüssen Sihl, und Limmat bzw. dem Zürichsee., Bis heute konnten n: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Geschichte (Zürich), Zürich, römische Zeit, Schweizerische Ortsgeschichte, Mittelalter, Größere Schweizer Städte, Heiliges Römisches Reich, Kultstätten, Stadtpatrone, Privileg der Reichsunmittelbarkeit"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: First Nations, Geschichte Kanadas], Die Geschichte der Tr’ondek Hwech’in First Nation, einer der kanadischen First Nations der Athabasken im Territorium Yukon, reicht ihrer eigenen Anschauung nach mehr als zehn Jahrtausende zurück.

Zusammen mit einer allerdings kleinen Gruppe im Alaska Native Village namens \\"Native Eagle Village\\" nahe der Stadt Eagle (Tthee T’äwdlenn) im Osten Alaskas sprechen sie gemeinsam die Sprache \\"Häɬ goɬan\\" bzw. \\"Han\\"., 1995 wählte die First Nation den heutigen Namen als offizielle Bezeichnung; er leitet sich vom Autonym \\"Tr’ondek Hwech’in\\" bzw. \\"Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in\\" („Volk entlang des Klondike River“) her, das sich von der Bezeichnung für den Klondike River als \\"Trʼondëk\\" (abgl. von \\"Tro\\" – „Schlagsteine, zur Befestigung der Stecken der Lachswehre“ und \\"Ndëk\\" – „Fluss“) sowie von \\"Hwech’in /\\" Hwëch’in („Volk“; wörtlich: „Bewohner einer Gegend“) ableiten lässt. Heute identifizieren sie sich jedoch nach ihrem einst bedeutenden Hauptort Tr’ochëk („Mündung des Klondike River“, an der gegenüberliegenden nördlichen Flussseite befindet sich Dawson) als „Volk an der Mündung des Klondike River“., Dem rauen Klima des kanadischen Nordwestens passten sich die Indianer im Rahmen einer halb-nomadischen Lebensweise an, die auf festen Winterdörfern mit Vorratswirtschaft und Wanderzyklen entsprechend den Jagd- und Sammelressourcen basierte. Der Fischfang, vor allem auf Lachse, und die Jagd auf Karibus lieferten den überwiegenden Teil der Lebensmittel, aber auch der Kleidung und einiger Werkzeuge. Teile dieser Werkzeuge, wie Obsidian, aber auch des Schmucks, wie bestimmte Muschelarten, wurden schon früh über ein Netz von weitläufigen Tausch-, Geschenk- und Handelskontakten aus Alaska, dem Norden British Columbias, von Vancouver Island und aus den Nordwest-Territorien beschafft, ebenso wie Kupfer. Pfeil und Bogen lösten den Atlatl wohl erst ab etwa 600 ab., Europäische Händler, die nach 1800 mit dem ausgedehnten Netz von Pfaden, Kontakten und Gütern in Berührung kamen, wurden mehrere Jahrzehnte lang in dieses Netz integriert, wenn auch zunehmend der über die Weltmächte, allen voran Russland und Großbritannien, später die USA, vermittelte Welthandel mit seinen weiträumigen Interessen dominierte. Spätestens 1847 traten die Han erstmals in direkten Kontakt mit Briten. 1874 forderten sie eine amerikanische Handelsgesellschaft auf, einen Posten in ihrer Nähe zu errichten. Dabei konkurrierte die britische Hudson’s Bay Company zunächst mit russischen Pelzhändlern und ab 1867, nachdem die USA Alaska erworben hatten, mit amerikanischen Gesellschaften, vor allem der Alaska Commercial Company., Als besonders folgenreich erwies sich jedoch weniger der Handel als die mangelnde Abwehrkraft der Han gegen die von Europäern eingeschleppten Krankheiten, wie Pocken, Masern und Tuberkulose– ein Phänomen, das die meisten Indianer betraf. Neben Pelzhändlern sickerten zunehmend Goldsucher in die Region ein, was die Lebensbedingungen in dem abgelegenen Gebiet weiter veränderte., Der Klondike-Goldrausch brachte ab 1896 eine so massive Zuwanderung, dass die Han zur kleinen Minderheit von wenigen hundert Menschen wurden, denen bis zu 100.000 Zuwanderer gegenüberstanden. Dazu kam die Entwicklung einer städtischen Gesellschaft und die Umsiedlung nach Moosehide, einige Kilometer von Dawson entfernt, wo der Stamm zwischen 1897 und etwa 1960 lebte. Herausragender Führer in dieser Phase war Chief Isaac, der 1932 starb. Er wehrte sich gegen die Zerstörung der für die traditionelle Lebensweise unverzichtbaren natürlichen Ressourcen, vor allem gegen das Abschlachten der Karibuherden und die Abholzung der Wälder., In Moosehide entstand ein Stammesrat und das traditionelle Häuptlingstum wurde durch gewählte Häuptlinge abgelöst. Die Rohstoff-Ökonomie des Yukon bot den Han nur wenige Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten, zumal diese mit der Weltwirtschaftskrise einbrach. So herrschte lange der traditionelle Lebensstil vor, der erst mit dem starken Rückgang des Pelzmarkts um 1950 zunehmend aufgegeben werden musste. Zudem war der Anteil der nichtindianischen Bevölkerung nach dem Goldrausch stark rückläufig. Verstärkt wurde die Isolierung der indianischen Gruppen im Territorium durch eine ausgeprägte Politik der Segregation, aber auch durch Vernachlässigung bis weit in die 1960er Jahre., Seitdem gelang es den First Nations nicht nur, politische Rechte, wie das Wahlrecht auf Bundesebene (1960) zu erhalten, sondern im Yukon gelang es den Tr’ondek Hwech’in wie anderen Stämmen auch, die Rückgabe ihrer traditionellen Gebiete, mit stark abgestuften Rechten, durchzusetzen (1998). Zudem hat sich die First Nation 1998 eine Verfassung gegeben und tritt seither nach innen mit gesetzgeberischen Rechten auf. Sprache und Kultur werden extensiv gepflegt und der externen Öffentlichkeit bekannt gemacht, nachdem die kanadische Regierung mehrere Jahrzehnte lang versucht hatte, sie auszulöschen. Sie sind inzwischen bedeutende Elemente des regionalen Tourismus geworden., Frühgeschichte., Wichtigster archäologischer Fundplatz ist Tr’ochëk, eine Insel, die heute zu den nationalen historischen Stätten Kanadas gehört, und die direkt gegenüber von Dawson liegt. Früheste Lebensgrundlage waren die Karibuherden, vor allem die Porcupine- und die Forty-Mile-Herde, die zweimal pro Jahr durch das Gebiet um Dawson zogen. Erstere umfasst heute über 100.000 Tiere, letztere wird für die Zeit um 1900 auf 600.000 Tiere geschätzt. 2007 wurde die Herde auf 110.000 bis 112.000 Tiere geschätzt, bis 2010 stieg ihre Zahl auf 169.000. Dazu kamen Elche, Schafe, Murmeltiere und Alaska-Pfeifhasen sowie Vögel und Fische, vor allem Lachse aus den großen Flüssen des Gebiets, dem Yukon und dem Klondike – letzterer Name leitet sich vom Han-Wort für Schlagstein, im Englischen \\"Hammerstone\\" ab. Die Lachse, vor allem Chinook (Königslachs) und später im Jahr Chum (Ketalachs), zogen zum Laichen den Yukon und seine Nebenflüsse aufwärts und boten ab Ende Juni Gelegenheit zum gemeinschaftlichen Fang. Schon früh wurden die Fische auf Holzgestellen getrocknet und so für den überaus kalten Winter konserviert., Die frühesten gesicherten Funde im Bereich des Yukon stellen die drei Bluefish-Höhlen dar, deren Fundbestand mindestens 12.000 Jahre zurückreicht. In Moosehide und im Bereich des späteren Dawson lassen sich rund 8.000 Jahre alte menschliche Spuren nachweisen. Dabei handelt es sich um Steinabschläge, die sich in rund 50cm Tiefe fanden. Die älteste Spur ist jedoch ein Stück eines Karibugeweihs, das etwa 11.000 Jahre alt ist, und das an einem Nebenfluss des Klondike gefunden wurde, dem Hunker Creek. In dieser frühen Phase war die Region noch weitgehend unbewaldet., Um 5000 v. Chr. wurden die bis dahin verbreiteten massiven Werkzeuge durch Kompositwerkzeuge ersetzt, bei denen Knochen, Geweih und sehr kleine Klingen, sogenannte Microblades, zu Werkzeugen verbunden wurden. Die ältesten Spuren in Moosehide konnten auf 3600 v. Chr. datiert werden, möglicherweise auch auf 4500 v. Chr. Zudem wurde dort Obsidian gefunden, eine Art vulkanischen Glases, das bereits auf einen weiträumigen Handel hindeutet, denn es kommt in der Region nicht vor, sondern nur im Südwesten des Yukon und im Norden British Columbias, am Mount Edziza. Darüber hinaus wurden lanzettartige Speerspitzen gefunden, Bruchstücke von Säugetierknochen, dazu ein Stein, der wahrscheinlich als Netzsenker beim Fischfang diente., Um 3000 bis 2500 v. Chr. wurden die \\"Microblades\\" von seitwärts eingekerbten Speerspitzen, sowie einer breiten Palette von Kratzern ersetzt. Als Jagdwaffe wurde der Atlatl von Eskimos übernommen. Die jährlichen Laichzüge der Lachse förderten saisonale Wanderungen zwischen den entsprechenden Fangplätzen. Diese Phase wird als \\"Northern Archaic tradition\\" bezeichnet., Funde aus der Zeit um 600 n. Chr. weisen erstmals auf den Gebrauch von Pfeil und Bogen hin. Die partiell steinernen Waffen und Werkzeuge waren nicht die einzige erkennbare technologische Neuerung, sondern es kamen metallurgische Techniken hinzu. Diese basierten auf dem einsetzenden Handel mit Kupfer, einem Metall, das aus dem Südwesten, genauer vom Copper und vom White River kam., Im Gebiet des White River, nahe der Grenze zwischen Alaska und Yukon, ereigneten sich um 100 und erneut um 800 n. Chr. zwei der größten Vulkaneruptionen Nordamerikas. Sie löschten wohl das Leben auf einer Fläche von rund 340.000km² im Südosten Alaskas und im südlichen Yukon weitgehend aus. Das unbewohnbare Gebiet dürfte den äußersten Norden, und damit auch die Vorfahren der Han, von Kontakten nach Süden abgeschnitten haben. Diesen Katastrophen folgte die als \\"Late Prehistoric\\" (späte Vorgeschichte) bezeichnete Phase, in der eine langsame Neubesiedlung zu verzeichnen ist., Kupfer wurde zu verschiedenen Werkzeugen, wie Ahlen und Projektilspitzen verarbeitet, aber auch zu Schmuck. Dentalia-Muscheln (Gehäuse von Kahnfüßern) und Obsidian, aus dem Werkzeuge und Projektilspitzen gefertigt wurden, kamen zu den Tr’ondek Hwech’in. Sie boten dafür Birkenrinde, aus der Körbe und wasserdichte Gefäße hergestellt wurden, roten Ocker zum Färben und getrockneten Lachs. Dieser Handel dürfte jedoch nur partiell auf Tauschhandel basiert haben, sondern vielfach auf Gabentausch, der der Respektsbezeugung und der Sicherung des Status diente. Dazu boten Zusammenkünfte und Feierlichkeiten, wie der Potlatch, Gelegenheit. Dem Austausch diente ein ausgedehntes Netz von Pfaden und Flussstrecken. Obwohl zahlreiche Fundstellen in den Bächen bekannt waren, war Gold ohne Bedeutung., Vor den ersten Europäern., Um 1800 lebten sechs Sprachgruppen im Yukon, von denen fünf zu den Athabasken zählten, eine zu den Tlingit.

Sie ist ein Teil der Medizingeschichte und reicht bis in die Urgeschichte zurück. Die konservierende Behandlung von Zähnen wurde bei einem 14.000Jahre alten männlichen Individuum aus der Felshöhle von Riparo Villabruna bei Sovramonte in Norditalien festgestellt, ferner für die Zeit um 5500 bis 7000 v.Chr. bei Bauern in Pakistan. Kariöse Zähne wurden präzise aufgebohrt, möglicherweise verbunden mit einer anschließenden Füllung des Hohlraums. Ebenfalls aus der Jungsteinzeit stammt ein Backenzahn aus Dänemark, an dem eine Trepanation vorgenommen wurde. Die ersten zahntechnischen Arbeiten wurden Mitte des 1.Jahrtausends v.Chr. von Etruskern und Phöniziern angefertigt. Der Einfluss römischer und griechischer Gelehrter war im Mittelalter im christlichen wie im arabischen Raum bestimmend. Die arabischen Erkenntnisse gelangten zusammen mit vielen antiken durch die Übersetzerschule von Toledo und über Salerno in den abendländischen Raum, in dem die Zahnheilkunde durch die Barbiere ausgeübt wurde., Seit den Sumerern hielt sich bis in die Neuzeit der Glaube, dass ein Zahnwurm für die Karies ursächlich sei. Die Wissenschaft legte Anfang des 18. Jahrhunderts, vor allem durch den Franzosen Pierre Fauchard, die Grundlage für die Zahnheilkunde der Neuzeit. Die zahnärztliche Behandlung unter Betäubung wurde ab dem 19.Jahrhundert mit Lachgas durchgeführt, das schon 1776 synthetisiert wurde. Äther- und Chloroformnarkosen folgten dem Lachgas. Der US-amerikanische Zahnarzt William Thomas Green Morton konnte damit erstmals einen Patienten schmerzfrei von seinem Leiden befreien., Im November 1895 entdeckte Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen die später nach ihm benannten Röntgenstrahlen, die die Untersuchung des Kiefers vereinfachten. Als Mittel zur örtlichen Betäubung von Zahnschmerzen wurde im Jahre 1905 das Lokalanästhetikum Procain von den deutschen Chemikern Alfred Einhorn und Emil Uhlfelder entwickelt, die dem Wirkstoff den Namen \\"Novocain\\" (lateinische Wortschöpfung für „Neues Cocain“) zuordneten. Damit waren die Grundlagen für eine moderne Diagnostik und Therapie gelegt. Die Zahnheilkunde erlebte daraufhin einen rasanten Fortschritt: von der Entwicklung zahlreicher oralchirurgischer Verfahren bis zur Anfertigung von Zahnersatz mittels CAD/CAM-Verfahren. Parallel zum Fortschritt der wissenschaftlichen Zahnheilkunde entwickelte sich das Berufsbild, was in der Geschichte des Zahnarztberufs dargestellt wird. Daneben entwickelte sich die Tierzahnheilkunde, die sich entsprechend modifizierter Verfahren der allgemeinen Zahnheilkunde bedient., Zu den bedeutenden Forschern zur Geschichte der Zahnmedizin gehören die schwedisch-dänische Zahnärztin Hedvig Lidforss Strömgren (1877–1967) und der Deutsche Walter Hoffmann-Axthelm., Vorbemerkung., Die Medizingeschichte (auch die der Zahnmedizin, genannt auch \\"Zahnheilkunde\\" und veraltet \\"Zahnarzneikunst\\") wird mit historischen und teilweise mit ethnologischen Methoden erforscht. Als Quellen dienen vorrangig medizinische Texte, Krankenakten, Geschichtsschreibung oder Tagebücher, Briefe, literarische Texte und ethnographische Aufzeichnungen und Interviews. Die Untersuchung von menschlichen Überresten und alten Krankheitserregern fällt zwar nicht in die Methodik der Medizingeschichte, sondern der Paläopathologie, dennoch wird sie der Vollständigkeit halber berücksichtigt., Urgeschichte., Lange glaubte man, dass aufgrund der Ernährung Jäger und Sammler nicht von Karies betroffen gewesen seien. Aus dem Mittelpaläolithikum Europas und Westasiens, also der Zeit der Neandertaler, sind kaum Fälle von Karies bekannt, wenn, dann als Folge einer ernährungsbedingten Schmelzfraktur. Doch im September 2013 wurden Ergebnisse von Untersuchungen an 52 Skeletten in der Grotte des Pigeons im Osten Marokkos von vor 15.000 bis 13.700 Jahren veröffentlicht, wonach belegt ist, dass diese Jäger und Sammler bereits unter Karies litten. Dies steht im Gegensatz zur bisherigen Annahme, dass diese Zahnkrankheit erst durch den Genuss von Kohlenhydraten aus der Getreideproduktion aufkam, also erst in der Jungsteinzeit (Neolithikum). Anscheinend geht dies auf Eicheln der Steineiche, Pinienkerne der See-Kiefer und Pistazien der Terpentin-Pistazie zurück. Angesichts der verbreiteten, wohl rituellen Entfernung der Frontzähne ist es umso überraschender, dass sich keinerlei Hinweise auf die Entfernung von kariösen Zähnen fanden, selbst dann, wenn schmerzhafte Abszesse entstanden waren.&lt;ref name=\\"DOI10.1073/pnas.1318176111\\"&gt;Louise T. Humphrey, Isabelle De Groote, Jacob Morales, Nick Barton, Simon Collcutt, Christopher Bronk Ramsey, Abdeljalil Bouzouggar: \\"Earliest evidence for caries and exploitation of starchy plant foods in Pleistocene hunter-gatherers from Morocco.\\" In: \\"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\" 111, 2014, S.954–959,.&lt;/ref&gt;, 2015 wurde ein kariöser Backenzahn eines 14.000Jahre alten männlichen Individuums untersucht, dessen Überreste 1988 in der Felshöhle von Riparo Villabruna bei Sovramonte in Norditalien gefunden wurden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das Loch im Zahn mit einer sehr kleinen spitzen Steinklinge bearbeitet wurde, um infiziertes Gewebe zu entfernen. Bis dahin kannte man zahnärztliche Behandlungen vor etwa 7500 bis 9000 Jahren im heutigen Pakistan, nachgewiesen anhand von Funden in Mehrgarh (Belutschistan), einer der wichtigsten Fundstellen der Archäologie für eine vorgeschichtliche Siedlungsgruppe in Südasien. Die Bewohner scheinen geschickte Schmuckhersteller gewesen zu sein und wandten ihre Fähigkeiten auch an, um kleine kariöse Kavitäten mit Steinwerkzeugen zu bohren, wie sie zur Herstellung von Perlenketten verwendet wurden. Die Rekonstruktion der Ursprünge der Zahnheilkunde zeigt, dass die damaligen Behandlungsmethoden anscheinend sehr effektiv waren. Die früheste Zahnfüllung, die aus Bienenwachs gefertigt worden ist, wurde in Slowenien entdeckt und ist etwa 6500Jahre alt. Ein frakturierter Eckzahn wurde damit wiederhergestellt., Auch für die Trepanation liegt ein sehr früher Nachweis vor: Bei Ausgrabungen in Dänemark wurde ein etwa 5000Jahre alter trepanierter Molar (Backenzahn) gefunden., Funde aus Italien und Tunesien belegen Zahnentfernungen im frühbäuerlichen Mittelmeerraum. Anscheinend wurden häufig – mindestens bei jeder dritten erwachsenen Frau – die Zähne entfernt. Da es jedoch keine sonstigen Gewaltspuren im Gesichtsbereich gibt, hatte dies vermutlich kosmetische, rituelle oder gesellschaftliche Gründe, etwa Statusgründe. Die Entfernung hing möglicherweise mit dem Erwachsenwerden zusammen. Die Vermutung einer rituellen Funktion wird durch ethnologische Vergleiche nahegelegt. Rituelle Zahnentfernungen waren etwa bei vielen Stämmen der australischen Aborigines üblich. Die in Namibia lebenden Himba und die Surma aus Äthiopien pflegten den Brauch, den Kindern im Alter von sieben bis neun Jahren die unteren vier Schneidezähne herauszubrechen. Ursprünglich sollte diese „Lücke“ als Gegenlager zur Aufnahme eines Lippenpflocks oder einer Scheibe dienen. Beiden afrikanischen Stämmen ist ein Kulturelement gemeinsam, das durch die gemeinsame Abstammung von den Herero, einem ostafrikanischen, halbnomadisch lebenden Volk, zu erklären ist., Die Entwicklung der Vorstellungen über die Entstehung von Karies., Heilkundlicher Glauben an den Zahnwurm., Ein sumerischer Text aus der Zeit um 5000 v.Chr., so behaupteten Suddick und Harris 1990, beschreibt erstmals den Zahnwurm als Ursache für die Karies. Dabei missdeuten die Autoren eine Publikation von Hermann Prinz aus dem Jahr 1945. Folgt man der Dissertation von Astrid Hubmann, zeigt sich, dass vier Quellen, deren älteste aus der Zeit um 1800 v.Chr. stammt, den Glauben an den Zahnwurm belegen. Es handelt sich um eine Tafel aus Nippur., Eine Tafel, die bei Assur entdeckt wurde, deutet darauf hin, dass Zahnwurm und Zahnschmerz verschieden behandelt wurden, was auf ein Verständnis als verschiedene Krankheiten schließen lassen könnte. Aus der Bibliothek des Assyrerkönigs Assurbanipal (669–631/627 v.Chr.) stammt das Werk eines Nabunadinirbu, das den Titel \\"Wenn ein Mensch Zahnschmerzen hat\\" trägt. Möglicherweise handelt es sich um eine Abschrift eines erheblich älteren babylonischen Textes, in dem neben der Beschreibung einer Behandlung vor allem eine rituelle Beschwörung von Bedeutung ist. Darin lehnt der Wurm, wohl ein Dämon oder böser Geist, vor dem höchsten Gott Anu dessen Gaben ab, nämlich reife Feigen, Aprikosen- und Apfelsaft, und bevorzugt das Blut der Zähne., In der Schrift heißt es: „Als Anu den Himmel erschaffen, der Himmel die Erde erschaffen, … der Sumpf den Wurm erschaffen, da ging der Wurm weinend zu Schamasch (dem Sonnengott) … Hebe mich auf und laß mich zwischen Zähnen und Zahnfleisch wohnen! Der Zähne Blut will ich trinken, des Zahnfleisches Wurzeln will ich fressen!“ Dann folgt eine Beschwörungsformel, die den „Dämon Zahnwurm“ bannen soll: „Weil du dieses sagtest, Wurm, möge dich (der Gott) Ea schlagen mit seiner starken Hand!“ Dieser Text muss dreimal gesprochen werden. Anschließend wird eine schmerzlindernde Mischung aus verschiedenen Arzneien auf beziehungsweise in den Zahn gelegt. Der Leibarzt des römischen Kaisers Claudius, Scribonius Largus empfiehlt im 1.Jahrhundert n.Chr. den Zahnwurm durch Räucherungen mit dem narkotisch wirkenden Schwarzen Bilsenkraut (\\"Hyoscyamus niger\\") abzutöten. Er beschreibt hier seine Erfahrungen: „Manchmal wird dabei etwas, was wie kleine Würmer aussieht, herausbefördert.“, Andere Empfehlungen lauteten, zur Behandlung Emmer-Mischbier, gebrochenes Malz und Sesamöl zu vermengen und auf den betroffenen Zahn aufzutragen. Grundsätzlich wurde angenommen, dass überall im Körper aus verdorbenen Säften Würmer hervorgehen konnten. Seit dem Altertum glaubte man, dass ein Ungleichgewicht der vier Körpersäfte – Blut (sanguis), Schleim (phlegma), gelbe Galle (cholera bzw. chole, griech.: χολή), schwarze Galle (melancholia, von griech. melanos und chole: μέλαν: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Geschichte der Tiermedizin, Geschichte der Zahnmedizin, Medizingeschichte, Zahnheilkunde, konservative Behandlung, Zahntechnische Arbeiten, Römische Gelehrte, Zahnwurm, Zahnärztliche Behandlung, Lokalanästhetikum"},{"instruction":"Продолжи рассказ.

Etwas mehr als 400 Jahre, bis zu Beginn des 4. Jahrhunderts, herrschten die Römer, wobei vor allem die Stadt Augusta Raurica und das Legionslager Vindonissa von grosser Bedeutung waren. Die verbleibende gallorömische Bevölkerung wurde durch einwandernde Alemannen allmählich assimiliert. In der zweiten Hälfte des 8. Jahrhunderts entstand die Gebietsbezeichnung Aargau, als Gau im Fränkischen Reich. Teile des heutigen Kantonsgebiets gehörten zum Frickgau, zum Sisgau und zum Zürichgau.\\", Im Mittelalter übten verschiedene Adelsgeschlechter die Herrschaft über Gebiete im Aargau aus. Dazu gehörten die Lenzburger, die Kyburger und die Zähringer. Die grösste Bedeutung erlangten die Habsburger, die durch Erbfolge zu einer der mächtigsten Herrscherdynastien im Heiligen Römischen Reich aufstiegen. Ihre Machtbasis verlagerte sich gegen Ende des 13. Jahrhunderts nach Österreich. Ihr Stammland Aargau ging jedoch 1415 verloren, als es von den Eidgenossen erobert wurde., Die Eidgenossen teilten das Territorium unter sich auf. Der grösste Teil im Westen, der Berner Aargau, war Untertanengebiet der Stadt Bern, kleinere Gebiete gelangten an die Städte Luzern und Zürich. Zwei Gebiete wurden zu Gemeinen Herrschaften, die unter gemeinsamer Verwaltung der an der Eroberung beteiligten Orte standen: die Grafschaft Baden und die Freien Ämter. Nur das Fricktal blieb österreichischer Besitz. Aufgrund der Herrschaftsstrukturen entwickelten sich die einzelnen Gebiete nun unterschiedlich. Eine weitere Trennung ergab sich durch die Reformation, die sich im Berner Aargau und in Teilen der Grafschaft Baden durchsetzen konnte., Als Folge des Franzoseneinfalls und der Gründung der Helvetischen Republik entstanden 1798 der Kanton Aargau (der nur den westlichen Teil umfasste) und der Kanton Baden, vier Jahre später auch der Kanton Fricktal. 1803 verfügte Napoleon Bonaparte die Verschmelzung der drei Kantone zum Kanton Aargau. Das neue Staatswesen entwickelte sich trotz seiner inneren Zerrissenheit zu einem liberalen Vorreiter und löste mehrere Entwicklungen aus, die 1848 zur Gründung des modernen Bundesstaates beitrugen. Obwohl der Aargau heute von der Einwohnerzahl her der viertgrösste Kanton der Schweiz ist, wird er vor allem als Energie- und Durchfahrtskanton wahrgenommen und bekundet Mühe, sich zwischen den Zentren Basel, Bern und Zürich als eigenständige Region zu behaupten., Prähistorische Zeit., Entstehung der Naturlandschaft., \\"Der Kanton Aargau weist eine starke naturräumliche Gliederung auf. Der nördliche Kantonsteil wurde durch die Gebirgsbildung des Juras geprägt, der im Mittelland gelegene südliche Teil durch die Gletscherbewegungen der Eiszeiten geformt. Die Riss-Eiszeit, die vor rund 140000 Jahren ihren Höhepunkt erreichte, bedeckte fast das gesamte Gebiet des heutigen Kantons, mit Ausnahme des westlichen Fricktals um Rheinfelden sowie einiger Juragipfel, die aus dem Eismeer ragten.\\", \\"Während der Würm-Eiszeit war die Vergletscherung zwar weitaus geringer (nur der südöstliche Teil des Kantonsgebiets war von Eis bedeckt), doch sie prägte die Landschaft nachhaltig. Der Reussgletscher und der Linthgletscher, die vor rund 20000 Jahren ihre grösste Mächtigkeit erreichten, hinterliessen zahlreiche Findlinge, die aus dem Alpenraum in die Ebene verschoben wurden. Die einstige Ausdehnung dieser Gletscher ist heute noch gut erkennbar an den Endmoränen bei Killwangen, Mellingen, Othmarsingen, Seon, Staffelbach, Würenlos und Zetzwil. Die bei der Moräne von Seon zurückgelassenen Gesteinsmassen stauten den Hallwilersee, der am Ende der Eiszeit etwa doppelt so gross war wie heute und innerhalb von einigen tausend Jahren durch Auffüllung des ehemaligen Seebeckens mit Sedimenten auf die heutige Grösse zurückschrumpfte. Die Flüsse lagerten in den Tälern im Vorfeld der Gletscher ausgedehnte Schotterfelder ab, die wichtige Grundwasserleiter bilden.\\", Steinzeit., \\"Die ältesten archäologischen Funde im Kanton Aargau wurden allesamt im westlichen Teil des Fricktals gemacht, das stets eisfrei geblieben war. Bei Zeiningen wurde ein 150000 Jahre alter Faustkeil gefunden, bei Stein ein 50000 Jahre altes Steinbeil eines Neandertalers. Gegen Ende der Würm-Eiszeit (vor rund 10000 Jahren) jagten die Menschen Rentiere und Wildpferde. Bei Magden befand sich ein mehrmals genutzter Rastplatz. Als die Vegetation nach dem Rückzug der Gletscher allmählich die Moränen- und Schottergebiete zurückeroberte, entstand zunächst eine Moorlandschaft, die später durch flächendeckende Wälder verdrängt wurde. Jäger, Fischer und Sammler siedelten an den Flüssen und Seen sowie auf den Hochterrassen der grossen Täler.\\", Die ältesten Spuren sesshafter Bauern im Aargau stammen aus der Zeit von 4500 bis 4200 v. Chr., aus der Gegend um Wettingen und Würenlos. Aus der Zeit um 3500 v. Chr. stammt ein Gräberfeld mit 16 Steinkistengräbern auf dem Goffersberg bei Lenzburg. Am Hallwilersee entstanden zur selben Zeit mehrere Seeufersiedlungen. Weitere Siedlungen befanden sich bei Untersiggenthal, Mönthal und Suhr. Bei Sarmenstorf und Spreitenbach wurden archäologisch bedeutende Gräber aus der Zeit um 2400 v. Chr. entdeckt., Bronzezeit., Aus der Übergangszeit zwischen Jungsteinzeit und Bronzezeit (2400 bis 1800 v. Chr.) gibt es im Aargau nur wenige Funde, darunter ein 1986 entdecktes Doppelgrab bei Zurzach. Zwischen 1600 und 1200 v. Chr. nahm die Bevölkerung zu; die Menschen wohnten nicht mehr nur in den Flusstälern und am Ufer des Hallwilersees, sondern zogen vermehrt in höhere Lagen, wo sie besser geschützt waren. Die bekannteste Fundstelle dieser Zeit ist eine befestigte Hügelsiedlung am Wittnauer Horn bei Wittnau, die während mehreren Jahrhunderten bis zur Latènezeit bewohnt war. Eine weitere solche Siedlung befand sich auf dem Chestenberg., Eisenzeit., Die Eisenzeit beginnt mit der Hallstatt-Periode um 750 v. Chr. Aus dieser Zeit stammen zahlreiche grössere und kleinere Grabhügel, schwerpunktmässig im Freiamt. Das Reusstal war damals ein bedeutender Nord-Süd-Handelsweg. Bei Unterlunkhofen befindet sich die grösste Grabanlage jener Epoche, die in der Schweiz bis jetzt entdeckt worden ist; sie besteht aus nicht weniger als 63 Grabhügeln. Weitere wichtige Grabfunde stammen aus Reinach, Schupfart, Seon und Wohlen., Römische Quellen berichten, dass sich zu Beginn des 1.Jahrhunderts v. Chr. die Helvetier im Mittelland niedergelassen hatten. Dieser Keltenstamm war vermutlich aus dem süddeutschen Raum eingewandert. Grössere helvetische Siedlungen befanden sich in Mellingen und Baden. In seinem Werk \\"De bello Gallico\\" erwähnte Julius Cäsar zwölf befestigte Städte \\"(oppida)\\". Ob dazu auch die Siedlung auf dem Hochplateau von Windisch gehörte, ist nicht gesichert. Ein weiterer Keltenstamm, die Rauriker, lebte in der Region Basel und im Fricktal., Die von Orgetorix angeführten Helvetier wurden immer wieder von Germanenstämmen im Norden bedroht. Deshalb beschlossen sie, ihre Siedlungen aufzugeben und südwestwärts an den Unterlauf der Garonne zu ziehen. Römische Truppen unter dem Kommando von Julius Caesar stoppten jedoch im Jahr 58 v. Chr. bei Bibracte den Vormarsch. Die Helvetier mussten zurückkehren, ihre Dörfer und Städte wieder aufbauen und die Vorherrschaft der Römer anerkennen., Herrschaft der Römer., Wenige Jahre später begannen die Römer von sich aus Gebiete zu besiedeln. Die Stadt Augusta Raurica (heute Kaiseraugst) im äussersten Nordwesten des heutigen Kantons Aargau entstand um das Jahr 45 v. Chr. Mit dieser Siedlung sollte ein wichtiger Verkehrsweg nach Gallien gesichert werden. Die Bebauung konzentrierte sich zunächst westlich des Violenbachs auf das Gebiet des Kantons Basel-Landschaft und expandierte rund hundert Jahre später auf Aargauer Boden., Aufgrund der Ermordung Caesars im Jahr 44 v. Chr. und des darauf folgenden Bürgerkriegs geriet die weitere Besiedlung für rund drei Jahrzehnte ins Stocken. Zur Absicherung der Augusteischen Alpenfeldzüge errichteten die Römer um 15 v. Chr. auf einem Plateau nahe dem Zusammenfluss von Aare, Reuss und Limmat eine kleine Militärstation. Diese wurde im Jahr 14 n. Chr. zum Legionslager Vindonissa (heute Windisch) ausgebaut. Hier kreuzten sich ausserdem zwei bedeutende Römerstrassen. Zur Versorgung des Lagers entstanden über den gesamten Aargau verstreut \\"villae\\" (Gutshöfe); die grössten bekannten lagen bei Möhlin, Oberentfelden und Zofingen (siehe Villa rustica (Zofingen))., Hinzu kamen drei \\"vici\\" (dörfliche Siedlungen): Das wenige Kilometer östlich von Vindonissa an der Limmat gelegene \\"Aquae Helveticae\\" (heute Baden) geht ungefähr auf die Zeit der Lagergründung zurück. Es war weit herum für die heissen Wasserquellen und Thermen bekannt, aber auch als bedeutende Handwerkersiedlung. \\"Tenedo\\" (heute Bad Zurzach) war ein Strassendorf am Rhein, das vom zweiten Viertel des 1.Jahrhunderts an besiedelt war und als Brückenkopf für einen bedeutenden Flussübergang diente. Der Vicus Lindfeld bei Lenzburg (damaliger Name nicht überliefert, vermutet wird \\"Lentia\\") existierte ab dem zweiten Viertel des 1.Jahrhunderts. Ein Theater mit 4000 Plätzen bildete den Mittelpunkt eines religiösen Zentrums., Bis zum Jahr 44 war im Lager Vindonissa die Legio XIII Gemina stationiert, die dann von der Legio XXI Rapax abgelöst wurde. Im Vierkaiserjahr 69 unterstützte die in Tenedo stationierte helvetische Miliz Kaiser Galba und überfiel eine Kurierabteilung. Daraufhin führten die mit Vitellius verbündeten Legionäre unter Caecinas Kommando eine Strafaktion durch. In einem weiten Umkreis um Vindonissa verwüsteten und plünderten sie Gutshöfe und Siedlungen. Nach seiner Machtübernahme verfügte Vespasian die Verlegung der 21.Legion nach Niedergermanien und die Stationierung der Legio XI Claudia in Vindonissa., \\"Das Militär verliess das Lager im Jahr 101, zurück blieb ein Bewachungsposten der Legio VIII Augusta.

In den Landkreisen Aurich, Leer und Wittmund sowie in der kreisfreien Stadt Emden sind etwa 250 Kirchen unterschiedlicher architektonischer Stile erhalten. Neben 125romanischen und gotischen Kirchen gibt es auch Gotteshäuser aus der Zeit des Barock und des Historismus. Die romanischen Kirchen lassen sich aufgrund des unterschiedlichen Baumaterials und der unterschiedlichen Bauformen engeren Zeiträumen zuordnen. Eine Besonderheit sind die Kirchen der Romano-Gotik, eines über die Grenzen von Teilen der Niederlande und Ostfrieslands hinaus kaum verbreiteten Übergangsstils. Über alle Stilepochen hinweg dominieren auf Warften errichtete Saalkirchen aus Backstein und getrennt stehende Glockentürme., Geschichtlicher Überblick., Auf dem Gebiet Ostfrieslands ist erstmals mit dem Auftreten von Liudger und Willehad im 8.Jahrhundert eine, wenngleich nur wenig erfolgreiche, christliche Missionarstätigkeit nachgewiesen. Auf Liudger soll die vermutlich 791 in Leer geweihte, erste und noch hölzerne Kapelle Ostfrieslands zurückgehen, die jedoch archäologisch nicht nachgewiesen ist. Infolge der von den Franken verstärkt vorangetriebenen Christianisierung großer Gebiete entlang der niederländischen und deutschen Nordseeküste wurde Ostfriesland schließlich den Bistümern Bremen und Münster zugeschlagen. Die sich daraufhin entwickelnde prosperierende Klosterlandschaft erreichte ihre Blütezeit im 12. und 13.Jahrhundert. Für Ostfriesland ist die Existenz von insgesamt etwa 30Ordensniederlassungen nachgewiesen. Stark vertreten waren die Prämonstratenser und Johanniter., Der Großteil der mittelalterlichen Klosterkirchen ist infolge von Sturmfluten bereits in vorreformatorischer Zeit aufgegeben oder im Zuge der Reformation aufgehoben worden. Die restlichen fielen kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen wie beispielsweise vonseiten Balthasars von Esens zum Opfer., Im 12. und 13.Jahrhundert setzte auch außerhalb der Klöster eine rege Bautätigkeit insbesondere im Bereich der Steinkirchen ein, die mehr als 100 romanische und frühgotische Sakralbauten hervorbrachte. Hungersnöte und Pestepidemien im 14.Jahrhundert und zu Beginn des 15.Jahrhunderts führten zu einer nachlassenden Bautätigkeit und zum teilweisen Niedergang der vormals hoch entwickelten Baukunst. Im 15.Jahrhundert erfolgte wiederum ein architektonischer Aufschwung, infolgedessen selbst kleine Dörfer mit einigen Dutzend Einwohnern eigene Kirchengebäude im Stil der Gotik erhielten oder ältere Kirchen tiefgreifend umgebaut wurden. Die katastrophalen Sturmfluten 1509/1510/1511 und die dramatischen Umwälzungen, die die Reformation mit sich brachte, führten dazu, dass im 16.Jahrhundert keine Kirchenneubauten entstanden., Da der Dreißigjährige Krieg und die Weihnachtsflut 1717 verheerende Auswirkungen auf Ostfriesland hatten, entstanden im 17. und in der ersten Hälfte des 18.Jahrhunderts insbesondere im Norden wenig Neubauten. Hingegen wurden im Süden und Osten Ostfrieslands 20 von insgesamt 25 barocken Kirchen errichtet, da durch Landgewinnung und Moorkolonisierung neue Dörfer entstanden. Ab der Mitte des 18.Jahrhunderts erfuhr der ostfriesische Kirchenbau eine weitere Blütezeit, in der viele Kirchengemeinden barocke oder klassizistische Gebäude erhielten. Im 19.Jahrhundert ersetzten Kirchenneubauten im Stil des Klassizismus oder Historismus (insbesondere der Neugotik) ältere Vorgängergebäude oder versorgten die neu gegründeten Dörfer., Baumaterialien und Verbreitung., Die Verwendung der Baumaterialien spiegelt eine chronologische Entwicklung innerhalb der Epoche der Romanik wider. Die ersten vorromanischen Holzkirchen aus dem 10. und 11.Jahrhundert wurden ab der Mitte des 12.Jahrhunderts durch romanische Steinkirchen ersetzt, im Westen vorzugsweise aus Tuffstein, im Osten aus Granit. Mit der Einführung des Backsteinbaus im 13.Jahrhundert entstanden dann zahlreiche spätromanische Sakralbauten und verdrängten die vormals verwendeten Materialien. Bis in die Gegenwart blieb der Backstein das charakteristische Baumaterial der Kirchen in Ostfriesland., Fundamente., Bereits in vorchristlicher Zeit ermöglichte die Aufschüttung von wenige Meter hohen künstlichen Bodenerhebungen, den Warften, die Besiedelung der regelmäßig überschwemmten Marschgebiete der Nordsee. In einer Gemeinschaftsleistung der lokalen Landgemeinde wurde dafür vorfindlicher Boden ausgehoben, angehäuft und schwach verdichtet. Insbesondere in der Krummhörn entstanden auf diese Weise große Ansammlungen von Behausungen, die so genannten Warftendörfer. In der christlichen Zeit griff man auf diese alten Techniken der Baugründung auch zum Errichten von wesentlich schwereren Kirchen zurück., Durch die damaligen technischen Möglichkeiten konnte der aufgeschüttete Untergrund nur unzureichend verdichtet werden und er eignete sich damit häufig nicht als Fundament für das gesamte Kirchengebäude. Aus diesem Grund ging man dazu über, Kirchenschiff und Glockenturm in größerem Abstand voneinander getrennt zu errichten. Beim Absinken der einen Gebäudesektion konnte so eine Destabilisierung der anderen weitestgehend vermieden werden. Diese Trennung verhinderte jedoch nicht die durch Bodenabsenkungen nach Sturmfluten hervorgerufenen statischen Beeinträchtigungen in den einzelnen Gebäudeteilen selbst, die bei aus Stein errichteten Kirchen in vielen Fällen Rissbildungen im Mauerwerk und einstürzende Deckengewölbe zur Folge hatten. Neben der geringen Verdichtung der Bodenaufschüttungen waren die zunächst oft fehlenden Horizontalanker in Traufenhöhe ein weiterer Faktor. Unter der Dachlast wirkten nach außen gerichtete Kräfte auf die Mauerwerkskronen, was zu erheblichen Außenneigungen der Außenwände führen konnte., Holz., Ab dem 10.Jahrhundert wurden die ersten Kirchen aus Holz gebaut, da im friesischen Raum nur wenig Natursteine vorhanden waren. Im 10. und 11.Jahrhundert entstanden sie in großer Zahl und wurden bis ins 13.Jahrhundert in gleicher Bauweise erneuert. Archäologische Untersuchungen haben an vielen Stellen Holzreste aus vorromanischer Zeit nachweisen können oder zumindest deren früheres Vorhandensein wahrscheinlich gemacht. Allein für den ostfriesischen Bereich im Bistum Bremen konnte für das 11.Jahrhundert die Existenz von 50 Holzkirchen bestätigt werden, die in der Regel 4–8Meter breit und 17–20Meter lang waren. Die vermutlich reetgedeckten ersten Holzkirchen waren reine Pfostenbauten mit Eck- und Mittelpfosten und einem grundschwellenbasierten Bohlenfußboden, spätere schwellenbasierte Fachwerk- bzw. Ständerbauten oder deren Mischformen. Ständerbauten wiesen eingegrabene oder auf Felssteinreihen aufgesetzte Schwellen auf. Im manchmal geringfügig eingezogenen, ansonsten aber gerade abschließenden Chorraum stand ein steinerner Altar., Tuffstein., Beginnend in der Mitte des 12.Jahrhunderts wurden die Holzkirchen durch Steinkirchen ersetzt. Während im östlichen Ostfriesland, das zur Diözese Bremen gehörte, in romanischer Zeit Granitquaderkirchen vorherrschend waren, baute man im Westen, das Teil des Bistums Münster war, die ersten Steinkirchen aus Tuffstein. Das dafür verwendete Tuffgestein, Laacher-See-Pyroklastika der Nette-Trass-Schichten, wurde bereits am Abbauort in der Eifel zugeschnitten und anschließend auf Lastkähnen rheinabwärts und entlang der niederländischen Küste nach Ostfriesland und teilweise bis nach Dänemark verschifft. Küstennah gelegene Gebiete wie die Krummhörn eigneten sich besonders zum Import des mittelrheinischen Tuffs, da weitere Überlandtransporte entfielen. Auch die im 12.Jahrhundert leichte Zugänglichkeit für Transportkähne in der damals noch offenen Harlebucht erklärt die Häufung von Tuffsteinkirchen., Der leichten Bearbeitbarkeit des porösen Tuffgesteins stand seine im rauen Nordseeklima nur schlechte Haltbarkeit gegenüber. Infolgedessen wurden Tuffsteinkirchen, wie die vormalige Larrelter, die Groothuser und die Rysumer Kirche, später eingreifend umgebaut oder durch Backsteinbauten ersetzt. Weitere Kirchen mit Tuffstein befinden sich in Arle, Nesse und Stedesdorf und in der angrenzenden Wesermarsch (beispielsweise Langwarden, Blexen und Wremen)., Granit und Feldstein., Im äußersten Osten Ostfrieslands und vor allem im benachbarten Jeverland griffen die Baumeister ab dem 12. und 13.Jahrhundert auf vor Ort befindliche bunte granitene Feldsteine und Findlinge als Baumaterial zurück. Diese waren im Zuge der Eiszeit als Leitgeschiebe aus Skandinavien mitgeführt worden und standen vereinzelt in der Geest zur Verfügung. Die Steine wurden zunächst mit schweren Werkzeugen gespalten und anschließend mit der nach außen weisenden, flachen Spaltfläche verbaut. Nur die Schauseite wies eine rechteckige Form auf, während die weitgehend unbearbeitete runde Seite zwischen Außen- und Innenmauer in einer Gussmasse aus Muschelkalkmörtel verblieb. Dieser Mörtel bestand größtenteils aus zuvor gelöschtem Kalk, gebranntem Muschelschill, der zusätzlich mit Abschlägen aus der Granitbearbeitung und Feldsteinen versehen wurde. Durch die schlechte Haftung des Mörtels auf dem glatten Granit der runden Hälfte der Spaltsteine drängten diese im Laufe der Zeit aus der Mauer, sodass man sie später mit eisernen Ankern fixieren musste., Die Ende des 12.Jahrhunderts als einschiffiger Apsissaal in Marx aus unterschiedlich großen bunten Graniten errichtete St.-Marcus-Kirche ist eine der ältesten und am besten erhaltenen Granitquaderkirchen Ostfrieslands. Weitere Kirchen dieser Bauart befinden sich in Asel, Middels und Buttforde (mit Gewölbe). Feldsteinkirchen wurden im Landkreis Ammerland in Rastede, Westerstede, Wiefelstede und Bad Zwischenahn errichtet. Außerhalb Ostfrieslands finden sich gut erhaltene Feldsteinkirchen in Midlum und Dorum., Neben den Mörtelproblemen erwies sich die Bearbeitung von Granit aufgrund der extremen Härte mit den damaligen Werkzeugen als sehr schwierig, sodass in vielen Fällen lediglich der Unterbau oder Sockel der Kirche aus diesem Material erstellt wurde. Zur Errichtung statisch weniger anspruchsvoller Gebäudeteile griff man dann auf den Import von anderen, meist günstigeren Baumaterialien wie beispielsweise Tuff oder Backsteinen zurück.

Sie ist damit auch die Geschichte der Strahlenschädigungen., Nachdem in der Anfangszeit der Umgang mit radioaktiven Substanzen beziehungsweise Röntgenstrahlung leichtfertig erfolgte, mündete das zunehmende Bewusstsein über die Gefahren von Strahlung im Laufe des 20.Jahrhunderts weltweit in verschiedene Präventivmaßnahmen, die zu entsprechenden Bestimmungen des Strahlenschutzes führten. Die ersten Opfer waren die Radiologen, die als „Märtyrer“ des radiologischen Fortschritts in die Medizingeschichte eingingen. Viele von ihnen mussten wegen Strahlenschäden Amputationen erleiden oder verstarben an Krebserkrankungen. Die Anwendungen von radioaktiven Substanzen im Alltag galten als „chic“. Nach und nach wurden die gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen bekannt, ihre Ursachen ergründet und das Bewusstsein für Schutzmaßnahmen geschärft. Eine einschneidende Veränderung erfolgte nach den Atombombenabwürfen im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Zunehmend erkannte man auch die Folgen der natürlichen „kosmischen Strahlung“, die Auswirkungen von in der Umwelt vorkommenden radioaktiven Substanzen wie Radon und Radium sowie die möglichen Gesundheitsschädigungen durch nicht ionisierende Strahlung. Weltweit wurden Schutzmaßnahmen erarbeitet und eingeführt, Geräte zur Überwachung entwickelt sowie Gesetze und Strahlenschutzbestimmungen erlassen., Im 21. Jahrhundert unterliegen die Bestimmungen einer zunehmenden Verschärfung. Insbesondere die zulässigen Grenzwerte für die Stärke ionisierender Strahlung erfahren weitere Korrekturen hin zu kleineren Werten. Auch der Begriff des Strahlenschutzes wird weiter gefasst, er enthält nunmehr auch Vorschriften zum Umgang mit nichtionisierender Strahlung., In der Bundesrepublik Deutschland werden Strahlenschutzbestimmungen durch das Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit (BMU) erarbeitet und erlassen. Das Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz arbeitet fachlich mit. In der Schweiz ist die Abteilung Strahlenschutz des Bundesamts für Gesundheit und in Österreich das Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie zuständig., Röntgenstrahlen., Erste Strahlenfolgen., Die Entdeckung von Röntgenstrahlen durch Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845–1923) im Jahr 1895 führte zu ausgedehnten Experimenten von Wissenschaftlern, Ärzten und Erfindern. Die ersten Röntgenapparate erzeugten für die Bildgebung höchst ungünstige Strahlungsspektren mit extrem hoher Hautdosis. Im Februar 1896 führten John Daniel und William Lofland Dudley (1859–1914) von der Vanderbilt University ein Experiment durch, bei dem Dudleys Kopf durchleuchtet wurde, was zum Haarausfall führte. Herbert D. Hawks, ein Absolvent der Columbia University, erlitt schwere Hand- und Brustverbrennungen bei Röntgen-Demonstrationsexperimenten. Es wurde in Fachzeitschriften über Verbrennungen und Haarausfall berichtet. So warnte Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) als einer der ersten Forscher im \\"Electrical Review\\" am 5. Mai 1897 ganz ausdrücklich vor dem Gefahrenpotenzial der Röntgenstrahlen – nachdem er ihnen anfangs noch absolute Unbedenklichkeit zugeschrieben hatte. Er musste selbst massive Strahlenschäden nach seinen Testversuchen am eigenen Leib erfahren. Trotzdem behaupteten zu dieser Zeit noch manche Ärzte, dass Röntgenstrahlung gar keine Wirkungen auf den Menschen habe. Es wurden noch bis in die 1940er Jahre Röntgen-Einrichtungen ohne jede Schutzvorkehrung betrieben., Röntgen selbst wurde das Schicksal der anderen Röntgenstrahlenanwender durch eine Angewohnheit erspart. Er trug die unbelichteten Photoplatten ständig in seinen Taschen mit sich herum und stellte fest, dass diese belichtet wurden, wenn er während der Strahlenexposition im selben Raum blieb. So verließ er regelmäßig das Zimmer bei der Anfertigung von Röntgenaufnahmen., Die Anwendung der Röntgenstrahlen bei der Diagnose in der Zahnheilkunde wurde durch die Pionierarbeit von C. Edmund Kells (1856–1928), einem Zahnarzt aus New Orleans, ermöglicht, der diese bereits im Juli 1896 vor Zahnärzten in Asheville (North Carolina) vorführte. Kells verübte Suizid nach einer langen Leidensgeschichte durch strahlenverursachten Krebs. Ihm war ein Finger nach dem anderen amputiert worden, später die ganze Hand, gefolgt vom Unterarm und dann dem ganzen Arm., Otto Walkhoff (1860–1934), einer der bedeutendsten deutschen Zahnärzte der Geschichte, führte ebenfalls im Jahr 1896 Röntgenaufnahmen im Selbstversuch durch und gilt als Pionier der zahnärztlichen Röntgenologie. Er bezeichnete die notwendige Expositionszeit von 25Minuten „als eine Tortur“. Die Braunschweiger Ärzteschaft beauftragte ihn später mit der Einrichtung und Betreuung einer zentralen Röntgenstation. Er erprobte ebenso im Selbstversuch 1898 – demnach im Jahr der Entdeckung des Radiums – den Radiumeinsatz in der Medizin unter Anwendung einer heute unvorstellbaren Menge von 0,2g Radiumbromid. Walkhoff beobachtete, dass krebskranke Mäuse, die einer Radiumstrahlung ausgesetzt wurden, signifikant später starben als eine Vergleichsgruppe unbehandelter Mäuse. Er leitete damit die Entwicklung der Strahlenforschung zur Behandlung von Tumoren ein., Der armenisch-amerikanische Radiologe Mihran Krikor Kassabian (1870–1910), Vizepräsident der American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS), befasste sich mit den Reizwirkungen von Röntgenstrahlen. In einer Veröffentlichung erwähnte er die zunehmenden Probleme mit seinen Händen. Obwohl Kassabian die Röntgenstrahlen als Ursache erkannte, vermied er es, diesen Bezug herzustellen, um den Fortschritt in der Radiologie nicht zu behindern. 1902 erlitt er eine schwere Strahlenverbrennung an der Hand. Sechs Jahre später wurde die Hand nekrotisch und zwei Finger seiner linken Hand wurden amputiert. Kassabian führte ein Tagebuch und fotografierte seine Hände, als die Gewebeschäden voranschritten. Er starb 1910 an den Krebsfolgen., Viele der frühen Röntgen- und Radioaktivitätsforscher gingen als „Märtyrer für die Wissenschaft“ in die Geschichte ein. Sarah Zobel von der University of Vermont verweist in ihrem Artikel \\"The Miracle and the Martyrs\\" () auf ein Bankett, das zu Ehren vieler Pioniere des Röntgens im Jahre 1920 abgehalten wurde. Es gab Huhn zum Abendessen: „Kurz nachdem das Essen serviert war, konnte man sehen, dass einige der Teilnehmer nicht in der Lage waren, die Mahlzeit zu genießen. Nach Jahren der Arbeit mit Röntgenstrahlen hatten viele Teilnehmer Finger oder Hände wegen der Strahlenexposition verloren und konnten das Fleisch nicht selbst schneiden.“ Der erste Amerikaner, der wegen der Strahlenexposition starb, war Clarence Madison Dally (1845–1904), Assistent von Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931). Edison begann Röntgenstrahlen fast unmittelbar nach Röntgens Entdeckung zu untersuchen und delegierte diese Aufgabe an Dally. Im Laufe der Zeit musste Dally sich auf Grund der Strahlenschäden über 100 Hautoperationen unterziehen. Schließlich mussten ihm beide Arme amputiert werden. Sein Tod veranlasste Edison im Jahr 1904 jegliche weitere Röntgenforschung aufzugeben., Zu den Pionieren zählte auch der Österreicher Gustav Kaiser (1871–1954), dem 1896 die Aufnahme einer Doppelzehe mit 1½–2Stunden Belichtungszeit gelang. Auch er hatte aufgrund des noch geringen Wissens ausgeprägte Strahlenschäden an den Händen und verlor mehrere Finger und die rechte Mittelhand. Seine Arbeiten waren unter anderem Grundlage für die Konstruktion von Bleigummischürzen. Heinrich Albers-Schönberg (1865–1921), der erste Lehrstuhlinhaber für Röntgenkunde weltweit, empfahl 1903 den Gonadenschutz für Hoden und Ovarien. Er war damit einer der ersten, der die Keimzellen nicht nur vor akuten Strahlenschäden schützte, sondern auch vor kleinen Strahlendosen, die mit der Zeit kumulieren und Spätschäden auslösen können. Albers-Schönberg starb 56-jährig an den Folgen von Röntgenschädigungen, ebenso wie auch Guido Holzknecht und Elizabeth Fleischman., Ein Ehrenmal der Radiologie im Garten des Krankenhauses St.Georg in Hamburg-St.Georg erinnert seit dem 4.April 1936 an 359 Opfer aus 23 Ländern unter den ersten medizinischen Anwendern der Röntgenstrahlung., Erste Warnungen., Im Jahr 1896 empfahl der Ingenieur Wolfram Fuchs aufgrund seiner Erfahrungen mit zahlreichen Röntgenuntersuchungen, die Strahlzeit möglichst kurz zu halten, von der Röhre Abstand zu halten und die Haut mit Vaseline abzudecken – dies war weltweit die erste derartige Veröffentlichung. Die Chicagoer Ärzte William Fuchs und Otto Schmidt waren 1897 die ersten Anwender, die einem Patienten wegen Strahlenschäden Schadensersatz leisten mussten., Der Zahnarzt William Herbert Rollins (1852–1929) forderte im Jahr 1901, dass bei der Arbeit mit Röntgenstrahlen Schutzbrillen mit Bleiglas getragen werden sollten, die Röntgenröhre mit Blei zu umschließen sei und alle Bereiche des Körpers mit Bleischürzen bedeckt sein müssten. Er veröffentlichte über 200 Artikel über die möglichen Gefahren der Röntgenstrahlen, jedoch wurden seine Vorschläge lange Zeit ignoriert. Ein Jahr später schrieb Rollins voller Verzweiflung, dass seine Warnungen über die mit Röntgenstrahlen verbundenen Gefahren sowohl von der Industrie als auch von seinen Kollegen nicht beachtet würden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatte Rollins bereits nachgewiesen, dass Röntgenstrahlen Versuchstiere töten können und Fehlgeburten bei Meerschweinchen verursachen. Rollins Verdienste wurden erst spät anerkannt. Seitdem ging er als „Vater des Strahlenschutzes“ in die Geschichte der Radiologie ein. Er wurde Mitglied der \\"Radiological Society of North America\\" und ihr erster Schatzmeister., Der Strahlenschutz entwickelte sich weiter durch die Erfindung neuer Messgeräte wie des Chromoradiometers von Guido Holzknecht (1872–1931) im Jahr 1902, des Radiometers von Raymond Sabouraud (1864–1938) und Henri Noiré (1878–1937) in den Jahren 1904/05 sowie des Quantimeters von Robert Kienböck (1873–1951) im Jahr 1905. Damit konnten Maximaldosen angegeben werden, bei denen mit größter Wahrscheinlichkeit noch keine Hautveränderungen auftraten. Auch Radium wurde durch die British Roentgen Society einbezogen, die 1921 ein erstes Memorandum veröffentlichte, das speziell auf Radiumschutz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Geschichte der Physik Geschichte der Zahnmedizin Medizingeschichte Nukleare Sicherheit Radiologie Strahlenbedingte Erkrankung Strahlenbiologie Strahlenschutz Röntgenstrahlen Erste Strahlenfolgen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Tennisgeschichte], Die Geschichte des Tennis umfasst die Entwicklung der Sportart Tennis vom Hochmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart. Sie lässt sich bis zu französischen Klöstern des Mittelalters zurückverfolgen. Aus einem frühen, unter Mönchen verbreiteten Rückschlagspiel entwickelte sich das Jeu de Paume, das in den Ballhäusern des 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts vor allem in Frankreich und England eine Blütezeit erlebte und bei Adel und Bürgertum beliebt war. Von der einfachen Bevölkerung wurde es im Freien gespielt, woraus im Laufe der Zeit weitere Spiele wie das Pelota entstanden sind., In den 1870er Jahren wurde in Großbritannien das moderne Rasentennis erfunden, das sich zunächst in Europa, den Vereinigten Staaten und den Kolonien des Britischen Weltreichs verbreitete. Bereits um die Jahrhundertwende wurden in Europa Tennisturniere mit internationaler Beteiligung veranstaltet. 1900 fand mit dem Davis Cup der erste Länderwettkampf im Tennis statt. 1923 einigte sich der zehn Jahre zuvor gegründete Internationale Tennisverband auf die vier bis heute wichtigsten Grand-Slam-Turniere. Die Beschränkung auf Amateure im Vereins- und Turnierbetrieb, die in den Jahrzehnten nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg zunehmend in die Kritik geraten war, wurde 1968 weitgehend abgeschafft. Der Beginn der „Open Era“ und die damit einhergehende Kommerzialisierung revolutionierte das Tennis in vielen Bereichen und verhalf dem bis dahin exklusiven Sport zum Durchbruch in weite Teile der Gesellschaft. Heute zählt Tennis zu den bedeutendsten Sportarten weltweit., Begriffsgeschichte., Eine der frühesten Erwähnungen des Begriffs \\"Tennis\\" findet sich in einem Dokument der Stadt Canterbury aus dem Jahr 1396. Darin wird ein gewisser William Terrey angeklagt, weil er zugelassen hatte, dass auf seinem Grundstück „le Closhe and le Tenesse“ gespielt wurde. Zudem taucht der Begriff in einer zwischen 1367 und 1370 erstellten Chronik des florentinischen Autors Donato Velluti auf. Dieser erwähnte 500 französische Ritter, die in der Schlacht bei Altospacio am 23. September 1325 ihr Leben ließen und fügte hinzu, dass man in jener Zeit mit dem Tennisspiel begonnen habe („in quello tempo si cominciò di qua a giucare a tenes“)., Im Laufe der Zeit wurden verschiedene Herleitungen des Begriffs vorgeschlagen; so unter anderem von einer untergegangenen Stadt namens Tennis im Nildelta, den französischen Städten Tennois oder Sennois, vom deutschen Begriff Tenne oder von lateinisch \\"taenia\\" („Band“). Heute wird allgemein angenommen, dass sich Tennis vom französischen \\"Tenez!\\" im Sinne von „Nehmt/Haltet den Ball!“ ableitet. Dies war vermutlich in früherer Zeit ein Warnruf, um seinem Gegner den Aufschlag anzukündigen, ähnlich dem \\"Fore!\\" im Golf. Belegt wird diese Variante unter anderem in dem 1617 veröffentlichten Wörterbuch \\"Guide into Tones\\" des englischen Sprachlehrers John Minsheu. Tennis, schreibt dieser, sei vom französischen \\"Tenez\\" abgeleitet, „which word the Frenchmen, the onely tennis players, use to speake when they strike the ball, at tennis.“ Daneben wird die These durch die mittelalterliche Ballade eines unbekannten Autors über die Schlacht von Azincourt (1415) gestützt, die in mehreren Versionen erhalten ist. In der Handschrift, die die Schlacht mit einem Tennisspiel vergleicht, wurde der Begriff „Holde“ (Haltet!) in einer anderen Version durch „Tenys“ ersetzt. Auch der englische Dichter John Audelay († 1426) schrieb in einer Ballade zur Lobpreisung der Taten Heinrichs V.: „And taht Franchemen to plai at the balle, with \\"tenes\\" hold he ferd ham halle“ („und lehrte den Franzosen das Ballspiel, mit \\"Tenez!\\" Haltet! erschreckte er sie alle“)., Tennis in Mittelalter und Früher Neuzeit., Anfänge., Der Ursprung des Tennissports liegt vermutlich in nordfranzösischen Klöstern des Hochmittelalters. Eine erste Erwähnung findet sich in dem zwischen 1219 und 1223 vom Zisterziensermönch Caesarius von Heisterbach verfassten \\"Dialogus miraculorum\\". Darin beschreibt er eine sich in der Hölle abspielende Szene, in der zwei Mannschaften von Dämonen sich den Ball, eine Menschenseele, mit der Handfläche zuprellen. Caesarius will diese Geschichte 24 Jahre zuvor von Hermann von Marienstatt, dem Gründerabt der Klöster Heisterbach und Marienstatt, erfahren haben, der sich wiederum auf einen angeblichen Augenzeugen der Szene, Pierre, den Abt des Klosters Morimond, berufen habe. Wenn die Geschichte auch offensichtlich der Phantasie eines Beteiligten entsprungen ist, so sind doch Hermann und Pierre historisch verbürgte Persönlichkeiten. Zuvor hatte bereits der Theologe Johannes Beleth in der vor 1165 entstandenen \\"Summa de ecclesiasticis officiis\\" eine um sich greifende „Unsitte“ in französischen Klöstern wie Reims beklagt – das Ballspiel, dem sich nun auch Bischöfe und Erzbischöfe hingeben würden. Um was für eine Art von Ballspiel es sich dabei handelte, beschreibt Beleth allerdings nicht., Im weiteren 13. und 14. Jahrhundert ist ein solches Ballspiel (lat. \\"ludus pilae\\", auch \\"stophus\\") an Klöstern belegt. Es wurde ohne Schläger, ausschließlich mit der flachen Hand oder einem übergestreiften Handschuh, im Hof des Kreuzgangs gespielt. Punkte konnten vermutlich erzielt werden, indem man den Ball durch einen Torbogen der Galerie oder auch gegen andere Stellen der Klostermauern spielte. Hierzu bildete eine Mannschaft die Verteidiger des Torbogens, während die zweite Mannschaft, die Angreifer, versuchen mussten, den Ball ins „Tor“ zu spielen. Zur Angabe spielten die Verteidiger den Ball auf ein abgeschrägtes Dach der Galerie. Ein Netz war zum damaligen Zeitpunkt noch unbekannt., Der Sporthistoriker Heiner Gillmeister vertritt die Ansicht, Tennis sei aus einer Frühform des Fußballs entstanden, welches damals vom einfachen Volk gespielt wurde und mit brutalen Schlägereien einherging. Ursprung des Fußballs wiederum sei eine Disziplin der ritterlichen Turniere gewesen, das sogenannte \\"Pas d’armes\\", bei dem eine Gruppe von Rittern ein Burgtor oder einen ähnlichen Engpass gegen eine angreifende Gruppe verteidigen musste. Solche Turniere fanden häufig im Rahmen von Hochzeiten statt. Beim Volk, dem die Teilnahme an Ritterturnieren verwehrt war, sei bei Feierlichkeiten an die Stelle des Turniers ein Spiel getreten, bei dem ein Lederball unter reichlich Tritten und Schlägen durch das gegnerische Stadttor befördert werden musste. Davon inspiriert hätten nun Mönche einen friedlicheren Zeitvertreib erfunden, bei dem man den Ball durch einen Torbogen in ihrem Klosterhof spielen musste., Weiter in die Geschichte zurückreichende Vermutungen sind zweifelhaft. Aus der Römerzeit sind Ballspiele wie das Trigon überliefert, das jedoch keine Verwandtschaft mit dem Tennis aufweist. Robert Henderson zufolge soll das Tennis, wie viele andere Ballsportarten, auf einen altägyptischen Fruchtbarkeitsritus zurückgehen. Die Existenz eines solchen ritualisierten Ballspiels lässt sich jedoch nicht belegen., Jeu de Paume., Das Spiel verbreitete sich in Frankreich unter dem Namen Jeu de Paume („Spiel mit der Handinnenfläche“; kurz auch \\"À la paume\\") und erreichte über Friesland und Flandern schließlich die Britischen Inseln, wo es als \\"Tenesse\\", \\"Tenetz\\", \\"Tennise\\" oder \\"Tenys\\" bezeichnet wurde. In den frühesten Erwähnungen aus Nordfrankreich wird es auch \\"cache\\" (von frz. \\"chasse\\", dt. Schasse) genannt, in Flandern wurde daraus das \\"caetsspel\\". Davon abgeleitet hielt sich in England und Schottland bis um 1600 auch die Bezeichnung \\"caiche\\" oder \\"caitche\\". In Deutschland wurde es zum ersten Mal um 1450 in der Gegend um Köln von Mönchen als „kaetschen“ beschrieben. Die Bezeichnungen „Katsspel“ oder „Katzenspiel“ wurden in Norddeutschland bis zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts verwendet, während man es im Süden schlicht als „Ball(en)spiel“ oder „Ballschlagen“ bezeichnete., Im Laufe der Zeit beteiligte sich auch die Bevölkerung aus dem Umland am Spiel auf dem Klosterhof und verlagerte es schließlich in die Städte. Zentraler Bestandteil des Tennis wurden nun Wetten um hohe Geldbeträge. Über Klosterschulen, die Ausbildungsstätten des Adels, gelangte das Spiel in adelige Kreise, in denen man dazu überging, das \\"Jeu de Paume\\" in eigens dafür angelegte Säle zu verlegen. Neben der angestrebten Abgeschiedenheit vom einfachen Volk hatte dies auch die Vorteile, dass der Ball nicht mehr wegspringen konnte und man darüber hinaus vom Wetter unabhängig war. Durch die Einbeziehung der Wände entwickelte sich hier eine neue Variante, wodurch die Entwicklung des Spiels im Folgenden in zwei getrennte Richtungen verlief., Im Ballhaus., Geschichte., Der Adel legte Tennisplätze zunächst in den nicht mehr zur Verteidigung benötigten Burggräben an. Später richtete man eigene Ballsäle in Schlössern ein. Die ersten Ballsäle \\"(Sale della balla)\\" wurden in norditalienischen Schlössern wie der Gonzaga bei Mantua oder der Este bei Ferrara eingebaut. Die Säle stattete man mit der Zeit mit verschiedenen, den Spielspaß steigernden Finessen aus. So fälschte ein senkrechter Wandvorsprung, das \\"tambour\\", den Ball unvorhersehbar ab. Man ließ kleinere Fenster wie die \\"grille\\" (zugleich französische Bezeichnung der Craticula, des Gitterfensters eines Klosters), die \\"lune\\" (frz. „Mond“) oder das \\"ais\\" in die Wände ein, für deren Treffen man zusätzliche Punkte erhielt. Die Wände der Tennisplätze strich man schwarz, so dass der Ball besser zu sehen war. Hierfür verwendete man eine Mischung aus Rinderblut, Rindergalle und Asche. Die Maße waren von Platz zu Platz unterschiedlich. Im Durchschnitt hatten sie eine Länge von etwa 29m und eine Breite von 9m. Bei Schlossneubauten waren solche Ballsäle ab der zweiten Hälfte des 15. Jahrhunderts in der Planung bereits fest vorgesehen., Im Zusammenhang mit dem Jeu de Paume am Königshof sind eine Reihe von Anekdoten überliefert. Der französische König Ludwig X. soll 1316 gestorben sein, als er nach einem anstrengenden Spiel eine große Menge eiskalten Weines getrunken hat. Als der burgundische Herzog Philipp III. 1427 nach Paris reiste, befand sich in seinem Gefolge eine gewisse \\"Margot aus Hennegau\\", die besser als alle Pariser Tennisspieler gespielt haben soll. Von Karl VIII. (1470–98) ist überliefert, dass er sich auf dem Weg zu einem Spiel den Kopf so heftig an einem Türsturz gestoßen hat, dass er kurz darauf verstarb. Dem schottischen König Jakob I. wurde ebenfalls das Tennisspiel zum Verhängnis; drei Tage vor seiner Ermordung am 21. Februar 1437 ließ er ein kleines Fenster an seinem Tennisplatz, das zur Reinigung des Aborts diente: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Tennisgeschichte, Hochmittelalter, Jeu de Paume, Pelota, Rasentennis, Davis Cup, Grand-Slam-Turniere, Open Era, Kommerzialisierung, Tennisregen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geschichte (Ghana)], Die Geschichte Ghanas ist die Geschichte des modernen Staates Ghana, der vorangegangenen europäischen Kolonisation dieses Gebietes sowie die vorkoloniale Geschichte der Völker und Reiche auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Staates. Das ursprüngliche Königreich Ghana lag wesentlich weiter nördlich als das heutige Ghana im Gebiet der Sahelzone. Obwohl dieses Reich der Namensgeber des modernen Staates Ghana ist, hat das heutige Ghana keine historischen Bezüge zu ihm. Mit dem Namen „Ghana“ wollten die Staatsgründer an die Größe dieses mächtigen schwarzafrikanischen Reiches anknüpfen., Frühgeschichte des heutigen Ghana., Das Gebiet Ghanas wurde erstmals etwa vor 150.000 bis 200.000Jahren von Menschen besiedelt. Vor 135.000 Jahren begann eine lange Trockenphase, die bis vor etwa 75.000 Jahren andauerte, wie Grabungen am Bosumtwi-See im Süden des Landes belegen konnten. Kulturhistorisch gehörten diese ersten Bewohner Ghanas zur Sangoan-Kultur, einer Kultur, die den Übergang von der älteren zur jüngeren Altsteinzeit charakterisiert. Wichtige Fundstätten sind Asokrochona und Tema II, wo die Sangoan-Schicht auf 13.000 bis 20.000 bzw. 20.000 bis 25.000 Jahre datiert wurde. Beide Schichten wurden dem Askrochan zugeschrieben., Der Beginn einer extremen Trockenperiode, die vor etwa 25.000Jahren einsetzte und bis vor 13.000Jahren andauerte, veranlasste diese Sangoan-Leute jedoch zum Verlassen der immer unwirtlicher werdenden Ebenen., Der Beginn der Wiederbesiedelung des Landes ist nicht bekannt. Die ältesten Keramikfunde auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Ghana wurden auf ein Alter von etwa 5800Jahren datiert. Im Allgemeinen wird der Zeitpunkt des Auftretens von Keramik mit dem Beginn der Nahrungsmittelerzeugung durch Feldbau gleichgesetzt., Etwa vor 4000 bis etwa 3500Jahren erfuhr das Klima in Westafrika und dem westlichen Zentralafrika wiederum eine kurze, aber intensive Trockenphase mit starken Winden. Die Vegetation der Ebenen nahm dabei savannenartige Züge an und der bislang dichte Regenwald ging leicht zurück mit einer verstärkten Lichtung seiner Randzonen. Etwa vor 3800 bis 3700Jahren war ein phänomenales Ansteigen des Auftretens der Ölpalme (\\"Eleas guineensis\\") zu verzeichnen. In dieser Zeit existierte mit der Kintampo-Kultur eine weitere vorgeschichtliche Kulturstufe am Nordrand des Regenwaldgürtels. An 30 verschiedenen Stellen in Nordghana wurden etwa 3400Jahre alte steinerne Gebäude, Äxte und Topfwaren gefunden. Diese Kultur war bereits durch eine sehr komplexe Wirtschaftsform mit einer Vermischung von feldbaulicher Waldlandbewirtschaftung und nahrungsproduzierender Viehhaltung in der Savanne gekennzeichnet. Mit Sicherheit kann das Halten von Schafen und Ziegen für die Zeit vor 3550 bis 3750Jahren nachgewiesen werden, wahrscheinlich wurden in der Spätzeit auch Rinder gehalten. Der durch die Trockenheit immer lichter werdende Regenwald und das plötzliche verstärkte Auftreten der Ölpalme, die Nahrung, Faser- und Baumaterial lieferte, förderte wahrscheinlich den Entwicklungsprozess einer feldbaulichen Waldlandbewirtschaftung. Dennoch scheinen auf dem Höhepunkt der Trockenphase die Menschen erneut die immer ungastlicher werdenden Gegenden wieder verlassen zu haben., Während die Sangoan-Leute in Nordghana und an der Küste lebten, war die Kintampo-Kultur auf Nordghana beschränkt. Das zentrale Waldland Ghanas, so nahm man bis 2010 an, war dagegen bis vor 800Jahren kaum besiedelt. Inzwischen ließ sich jedoch zeigen, dass bereits in den ersten Jahrhunderten n. Chr. Siedlungen bestanden., Vorkoloniale Reiche und Völker auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Ghana., Die großen Reiche im Norden., Die frühesten Reichsgründungen auf ghanaischem Gebiet fanden im Norden des Landes statt. Anfang des 15. Jahrhunderts gründeten die Dagomba ein mächtiges Königreich (siehe Königtum Dagomba), später die Mamprusi und im 16. Jahrhundert die Gonja. Alle diese Reiche waren von den Mossi des heutigen Burkina Faso kulturell beeinflusst und stützten ihre Macht auf Reiterheere, die in Bewaffnung und leichter Rüstung an europäische Ritter erinnerten. Diese Reiterheere fanden ihre Grenzen an den tropischen Bedingungen des Waldlandes in Zentralghana, wo beispielsweise die Verbreitung der Tse-Tse-Fliege Großvieh- und damit Pferdehaltung unmöglich machte. Die Reiche des Nordens wurden früh islamisiert, behielten aber weite Teile ihres traditionellen Glaubens bei., Die Akanstaaten des Waldlandes von Zentralghana., Das Waldland Zentralghanas war bis etwa 1200 kaum besiedelt. Vermutlich ab dem 13. Jahrhundert setzte eine gewisse Wanderungsbewegung von Norden kommend in dieses Gebiet ein. Die Akanvölker wanderten in ihr heutiges Siedlungsgebiet in Zentralghana. Diese Wanderungsbewegung verstärkte sich erst Ende des 15./Anfang des 16. Jahrhunderts, als die Einfuhr von (Feld-)Früchten wie Bananen, Hirse oder Kassawa (Maniok) aus Südostasien beziehungsweise Amerika eine intensivere Besiedelung dieses Regenwaldgebietes ermöglichte. Die Akanvölker begannen sich nun in kleineren politischen Einheiten zu organisieren. Eines der ersten historisch belegten Königreiche der noch zersplitterten Akanvölker war das Königreich Bono. Später, im 17. Jahrhundert, beherrschten die Denkyra weite Teile Zentralghanas. Ihre Macht wurde durch das 1695 gegründete Königreich der Aschanti gebrochen, dessen zügiger Aufstieg die Zersplitterung der Akanstaaten beendete und zur Entstehung einer regionalen Großmacht führte, die bald in Konflikt mit den an Einfluss gewinnenden Europäern geriet., Die Völker des Südens., Im Süden Ghanas lebten im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert bereits die Völkerschaften, die auch heute dort siedeln: die Fanti, Nzema, Ga, Ewe und andere. Keines dieser Völker hatte sich zu diesem Zeitpunkt jedoch in größeren, zentralisierten Staaten organisiert. Die Ewe etwa lieferten in ihren Herkunftsmythen sogar eine Art ideologische Begründung für ihre Abneigung gegen größere politische Einheiten. Nach ihren mündlichen Traditionen waren ihre Vorfahren aus dem Osten vor einem tyrannischen Herrscher geflohen., Als die ersten Europäer die ghanaische Küste erreichten, trafen sie daher auf eine Vielzahl kleiner Häuptlingstümer., Erste Kontakte mit Europäern: 1471 bis 1800., Die Bewohner der Küste des heutigen Ghana hatten bereits sehr früh und intensiv Kontakt mit europäischen Händlern und Soldaten. Die Portugiesen waren die ersten Europäer, die 1471 die so genannte Goldküste erreichten. Bereits 1482 erhielten sie die Erlaubnis einheimischer Herrscher, einen befestigten Stützpunkt, das Fort São Jorge da Mina im heutigen Elmina zu errichten. Den Portugiesen folgten bald andere Europäer: Schweden, Dänen, Niederländer, Briten, Brandenburger und Franzosen trieben Handel mit den Bewohnern der Küste, errichteten Festungen und bekriegten sich häufig untereinander. An keinem Küstenabschnitt Afrikas findet sich eine derartige Dichte europäischer Forts wie an der Küste Ghanas. Oftmals wurden diese Festungen europäischer Mächte in Sichtweite voneinander errichtet. Die Festungen waren in erster Linie Handelsstützpunkte und nicht Ausgangspunkte kolonialer Eroberungen. Üblicherweise waren sie auch nicht Eigentum europäischer Mächte, sondern über einen Pachtvertrag von afrikanischen Mächten erworbene Plätze. Die Europäer interessierten sich für Gold und Gewürze des Landes, ab dem 17. Jahrhundert zunehmend für Sklaven, die im atlantischen Dreieckshandel nach Amerika verkauft wurden. Die Afrikaner erhielten im Austausch Gewehre, Munition und Stoffe. Die europäischen Seefahrer und Händler waren auf die Kooperation der Einheimischen angewiesen, und der Handel zwischen Europäern und Afrikanern lief auf einer gleichberechtigten Basis ab. Auch die Sklaven wurden von Afrikanern (häufig von mächtigen afrikanischen Kaufleuten oder „Handelsprinzen“ wie etwa dem so genannten Jan Conny) an die Europäer verkauft und waren nicht das Ergebnis europäischer Überfälle auf die Küste. Diese frühe Phase des Kontaktes mit den Europäern muss deutlich von der späteren kolonialen Unterwerfung unterschieden werden. Als Ergebnis dieser Kontakte finden sich übrigens heute an der Küste Ghanas viele hellhäutige Menschen und englische, holländische, portugiesische, dänische oder französische Nachnamen wie da Costa, Hayford, Lemaire, Vroom oder Simpson sind keine Seltenheit., Um 1800 hatten sich die Briten und die Niederländer gegen die übrige europäische Konkurrenz durchgesetzt, das Kräfteverhältnis zwischen Afrikanern und Europäern und damit der Charakter des europäisch-afrikanischen Austausches begann sich zu wandeln., Zeit des Aschantireiches., 1695 waren die zersplitterten Aschanti-Fürstentümer unter dem ersten Asantehene Osei Tutu erstmals vereinigt. 1699 begann der Aufstieg des Reiches zur regionalen Großmacht, als es den Aschanti gelang, sich in einem zweijährigen Krieg von der Tributpflicht für das Reich der Denkyra zu befreien und verschiedene bisher unter der Herrschaft der Denkyra stehende Gebiete zu erobern. Als wichtigste Kriegsbeute gelangte dabei der Pachtvertrag für die Forts von Elmina in die Hände der Aschanti, die damit die Möglichkeit des direkten Handels mit Europäern, nämlich mit den Niederländern, hatten. 1744 eroberten die Aschanti das mächtige Königreich der Dagomba in Nordghana und dehnten ihre Macht über nahezu das gesamte Staatsgebiet des heutigen Ghana mit Ausnahme eines schmalen Küstenstreifens aus. Grundlage der Macht der Aschanti-Föderation waren sicherlich der Goldreichtum des Aschantilandes und ihre hervorragende militärische Organisation, die durch von den Europäern erworbene Schusswaffen verstärkt wurde. Hinzu kam aber auch die innere Stärke des Reiches, deren Basis eine Staatsideologie war, die unter Osei Tutu und dem Priester Okomfo Anokie bereits Ende des 17. Jahrhunderts geschaffen wurde: Der Glaube an die Macht des so genannten Goldenen Stuhls, der den Geist aller Aschanti verkörperte. In verschiedenen Schritten hatte das Reich zudem eine geradezu modern anmutende innere Organisation erhalten, mit einer Art Berufsbeamtentum und einer Verwaltung, die sich unter anderem auf schriftkundige Muslime aus dem Norden stützte. 1814–16 besiegte der Asantehene Osei Bonsu im Aschanti-Akim-Akwapim-Krieg die vereinigten Akim und Akwapim, und die Briten mussten die Oberhoheit Aschanti über die gesamte Südküste des heutigen Ghanas außerhalb des direkten Gebietes ihrer Forts anerkennen. Ein Versuch des britischen Gouverneurs McCarthy, die Macht der Aschanti zu brechen, endete 1824 in einer verheerenden Niederlage.

Im 13. Jahrhundert entstand das Schloss, die Stadt wurde planmäßig angelegt und zur Residenz der Pfalzgrafen bei Rhein. Damit begann die rund fünfhundertjährige Blütezeit der Stadt am Neckar als Hauptstadt der Kurpfalz. Die Universität Heidelberg wurde 1386 als erste Hochschule im heutigen deutschen Staatsgebiet gegründet. Im Pfälzischen Erbfolgekrieg zerstörten französische Truppen 1693 die Stadt, die auf mittelalterlichem Grundriss im Stil des Barock wiederaufgebaut wurde. 1720 wurde die kurfürstliche Residenz nach Mannheim verlegt. 1803 kam Heidelberg an Baden. Im 19. Jahrhundert wirkten Dichter und Denker in der Stadt, die Heidelberg den Beinamen „Stadt der Romantik“ einbrachten. Heidelberg wurde zu einem Wissenschaftsstandort und Reiseziel. Im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert wurde die Stadt durch Eingemeindungen und Bauprojekte vergrößert und blieb im Zweiten Weltkrieg weitestgehend unzerstört. Nach Kriegsende war Heidelberg bis 2013 Standort des Hauptquartiers der amerikanischen Landstreitkräfte in Europa., Vor Gründung der Stadt., Urgeschichte., Der Vorfahre der Neandertaler, die fossile Art \\"Homo heidelbergensis\\", erhielt ihren Namen, nachdem sie in Heidelberg erstmals wissenschaftlich beschrieben wurde. Zuvor war das erste bekannte Fossil dieser Art, der rund 600.000 Jahre alten Unterkiefer von Mauer, 1907 durch den Arbeiter Daniel Hartmann in einer Sandgrube im Ort Mauer südöstlich von Heidelberg entdeckt worden. Dieser Unterkiefer, das Typusexemplar von \\"Homo heidelbergensis\\", ist das älteste bislang in Deutschland entdeckte Fossil der Gattung \\"Homo\\"., Die erste dauerhafte Besiedlung des Raumes Heidelberg lässt sich für die Jungsteinzeit durch archäologische Funde aus dem 5. vorchristlichen Jahrtausend nachweisen, die der Linearbandkeramik-, Rössener und Michelsberger Kultur zuzurechnen sind. Zu den bedeutenden Befunden aus dieser Zeit gehört eine große Grube von etwa 12 × 14Metern Durchmesser und 3,80Metern Tiefe, die einem Dorf der Rössener Kultur (um 4500 v. Chr.) als Abfalldeponie diente. Aus der Zeit der Michelsberger Kultur, etwa 3800 v. Chr., stammt eine im Stadtteil Handschuhsheim entdeckte Mehrfachbestattung mit sechs Personen (drei Erwachsene und drei Kinder), die bei einem Überfall umgebracht und anschließend gemeinsam bestattet wurden. Diese steinzeitlichen Siedlungsspuren konzentrieren sich auf die Stadtteile (nord-)westlich der Innenstadt, wo der Neckar aus dem Odenwald austritt und daher in prähistorischer Zeit der Schwemmkegel des Flusses befand. Dieser sorgte für fruchtbare Böden, was zusammen mit der klimatisch günstigen Lage und dem natürlichen Schutz gegen Osten durch den Odenwald für sehr günstige Siedlungsbedingungen sorgte., Während der Bronzezeit bewohnten Angehörige der Hügelgräber- und Urnenfelderkultur den Heidelberger Raum und scheinen in Teilen des Stadtgebietes eine für vorgeschichtliche Verhältnisse sehr dichte Besiedlung errichtet zu haben., Keltische Zeit., Im 5. und 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. entwickelte sich der oberhalb Heidelbergs gelegene Heiligenberg zu einem wichtigen Siedlungszentrum der Kelten, die dort eine größere befestigte Siedlung errichteten. Ihr doppelter Ringwall ist immer noch zu erkennen. Die Funde zeigen, dass die Anlage das kulturelle und religiöse Zentrum der Region darstellte und dort in größerem Stil Eisenabbau und -verarbeitung stattfanden. Im 3. Jahrhundert wurde die Hügelsiedlung jedoch aus nicht gänzlich geklärten Gründen wieder aufgegeben. Möglicherweise verlor sie ihre Funktion als Zentralort an einen weiter in der Rheinebene gelegenen und damit verkehrstechnisch besser zu erreichenden Platz. Allerdings wurde der Heiligenberg dem archäologischen Fundspektrum zufolge auch in den folgenden Jahrhunderten von der Bevölkerung der Gegend wiederholt aufgesucht. Parallel zu den Siedlungsaktivitäten auf dem Berg entstanden in der keltischen Zeit auch diverse Baustrukturen im sonstigen Stadtgebiet Heidelbergs. Ihre Spuren verteilen sich relativ gleichmäßig beiderseits des Neckars über verschiedene Stadtteile, aus den sehr ausschnitthaften Befundbeobachtungen lässt sich die Struktur und Bedeutung dieser vermutlich bäuerlichen Kleinsiedlungen jedoch nicht genauer rekonstruieren. Ebenfalls aus Flussnähe stammt das Bruchstück des Kopfes einer überlebensgroßen Steinskulptur, das in einem römischen Gräberfeld im Stadtteil Bergheim gefunden wurde und zu dem Grabdenkmal eines mächtigen Bewohners des Heidelbergs (einem sogenannten „Fürstengrab“) gehört haben dürfte., Im 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr. kam es dann jedoch zu einem vollständigen Abbruch der keltischen Besiedlung, genauso wie an vielen Orten in der weiteren Umgebung. Dieses Phänomen wird häufig mit den Berichten späterer antiker Quellen in Verbindung gebracht, nach denen der keltische Stamm der Helvetier unter dem Druck der vordringenden germanischen Sueben seine angestammten Siedlungsplätze zwischen Rhein, Main und Schwarzwald verlassen habe und nach Gallien ausgewichen sei. Nachdem die Helvetier 58 v.Chr. in der Schlacht bei Bibracte von den Römern unter Gaius Iulius Caesar geschlagen worden waren, blieb die Oberrheinebene weitgehend siedlungsleer., Römische Herrschaft., Während der Regierungszeit Kaiser Tiberius’ (14–37 n.Chr.) siedelten die Römer verbündete Germanen vom Stamm der Neckarsueben im Gebiet östlich der Neckarmündung an, um eine Pufferzone zwischen dem Rhein, der Außengrenze des Römischen Reiches, und Germanien zu schaffen. Unter Kaiser Vespasian (69–79) schoben die Römer ihre Grenze in das rechtsrheinische Gebiet vor und gründeten auch im Bereich des heutigen Heidelberger Stadtgebiets ein Militärlager. Im Jahr 90 entstand ein steinernes Kastell anstelle der vorangegangenen Holzbauten. Über den Neckar errichteten die Römer zunächst eine hölzerne Brücke, um das Jahr 200 dann schließlich eine 260m lange Steinpfeilerbrücke. Auf dem Gipfel des Heiligenbergs entstand ein Mercurius-Tempel, auch der Mithras-Kult war in Heidelberg verbreitet. Der Hauptort der Region war in römischer Zeit das benachbarte Lopodunum (heute Ladenburg), aber auch um das Militärlager in Heidelberg (dessen lateinischer Name unbekannt ist) entwickelte sich ein florierendes Töpfereizentrum., Im 3. Jahrhundert wurden die Römer von den Alamannen verdrängt. Der Germanenstamm durchbrach ab 233 den Limes und fiel in römisches Territorium ein. Auch im Heidelberger Raum häuften sich Überfälle und Brandschatzungen. Nach 260 mussten sich die Römer an den Rhein zurückziehen, und die Alamannen ließen sich schließlich im römischen Grenzland im Gebiet des heutigen Südwestdeutschlands nieder., Frankenreich und Christianisierung., Über die Geschichte der folgenden Jahrhunderte in Heidelberg ist wenig bekannt. Durch den Sieg des Merowingerkönigs Chlodwig I. über die Alamannen im Jahr 506 wurde Heidelberg aber schließlich zu einem Teil des Frankenreichs und gehörte dem Lobdengau an. Sichtbarste Folge der neuen Herrschaft war die Christianisierung des Gebiets. Im 8. Jahrhundert entwickelte sich das nahegelegene Kloster Lorsch zu einem wichtigen politischen Zentrum, welches mit dem Bistum Worms um die Vorherrschaft der Region rang. Um seinen Einfluss im Heidelberger Raum zu festigen, ließ der Lorscher Abt Thiotroch im Jahr 870 auf dem Heiligenberg an der Stelle des alten Mercuriustempels das Michaelskloster als Filialkloster gründen. Zwei Jahrhunderte später folgte auf dem Michelsberg, dem Vorberg des Heiligenbergs, eine weitere Filiale, das Stephanskloster. Im Jahr 1130 entstand das Stift Neuburg am Fuße des Berges., Viele der Dörfer Heidelbergs entstanden schon zur Frankenzeit im 6. Jahrhundert. Erstmals urkundlich erwähnt werden sie im 8. Jahrhundert im Lorscher Codex – Neuenheim und Handschuhsheim im Jahr 765, Rohrbach 766, Wieblingen und Kirchheim 767 sowie Bergheim im Jahr 769. Damit sind die Stadtteile Heidelbergs, die auf diese Dörfer zurückgehen, um mehrere Jahrhunderte älter als die Stadt selbst., Heidelberg im Mittelalter., Anfänge Heidelbergs., Der Name \\"Heidelberch\\" wird erstmals in einer Urkunde des Klosters Schönau aus dem Jahr 1196 erwähnt. Zu jener Zeit befand sich der Ort noch im Besitz des Bistums Worms. Eine Burg am Nordhang des Königstuhls war aber wohl schon Ende des 11. oder Anfang des 12. Jahrhunderts erbaut worden. Unklar ist, ob diese erste Burg ein Vorgängerbau des heutigen Heidelberger Schlosses auf dem Jettenbühl war, oder ob sie sich auf der Molkenkur an einer höheren Stelle des Berghangs befand und der Vorgängerbau des Schlosses erst im 13. Jahrhundert entstand. Sicher ist jedenfalls, dass das heutige Schloss durch zahlreiche Umbauten und Erweiterungen nichts mehr mit der ersten Bauphase gemein hat. Unterhalb der Burg lag ein kleiner Burgweiler im Bereich um die Peterskirche, das älteste Gotteshaus der Heidelberger Altstadt., Der Name Heidelberg (auch Heydelberg) bezeichnete ursprünglich die Burg und wurde später auf die Stadt übertragen, die Etymologie ist indes nicht gänzlich geklärt. Der „Berg“ im Namen dürfte sich auf den Königstuhl beziehen. Der erste Bestandteil könnte sich vom Landschaftsbegriff „Heide“ herleiten, welches soviel wie \\"freies Land\\" im Sinne von unbewohnte Gemeindefläche bedeutet. Auch die neuzeitliche Verwendung von Heide im Sinne einer unbewaldeten Fläche lässt sich begründen, da die frühesten Abbildungen des Königstuhls dessen Spitze unbewaldet darstellen. Weniger wahrscheinlich ist hingegen, dass der Heidelberg von „Heidenberg“ abgeleitet ist und sich auf die keltische und römische Götterverehrung auf dem Heiligenberg bezieht. Auch die Herleitung vom althochdeutschen Personennamen Heidilo ist mittlerweile verworfen worden. Eine Ableitung des Stadtnamens von der Frucht Heidelbeere ist Legende und auch deshalb kaum wahrscheinlich, weil die entsprechende Bezeichnung im dortigen Dialekt nicht bekannt ist und dort Blaubeere heißt., Die eigentliche Stadt Heidelberg wurde erst später planmäßig im Bereich zwischen Königstuhl und Neckar angelegt. Ging man lange davon aus, dass Heidelberg zwischen 1170 und 1180 gegründet wurde, legen jüngere Befunde nahe, dass die Stadtgründung erst um 1220 stattfand.

Sie reicht mehr als zwölf Jahrtausende zurück. Um diese Zeit boten sich den frühen menschlichen Bewohnern des heutigen Kanadas durch das Ende der letzten Eiszeit günstigere Lebensmöglichkeiten. Dabei entwickelten sich in einem langen Prozess unter Einwanderung weiterer Gruppen aus Asien sehr stark voneinander abweichende Kulturareale, die von den Inuit, die sich den arktischen Bedingungen angepasst hatten, über Wildbeuter- und halbnomadische bis zu bäuerlichen Kulturen der First Nations reichten, wie die Indianer des Landes genannt werden., Starke kulturelle Veränderungen, weitläufige Verdrängungsprozesse und Nomadisierung wurden durch das von Spaniern mitgebrachte Pferd, durch die Kriege der Irokesen und durch Europäer bereits zwischen 1500 und 1700 ausgelöst. Dabei brach eine Vielzahl indigener Völker, wie in ganz Amerika, durch eingeschleppte Krankheiten zusammen, vor allem durch Pocken., Im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert wurden die Indianer \\"(First Nations)\\" durch Zwangsmittel und Verträge in Reservate abgedrängt, um europäischen Einwanderern Platz zu machen. Dabei kam es zu Konflikten zwischen Briten und Franzosen im Osten, zu denen im Westen Konflikte zwischen Spaniern, Briten und Russen kamen. 1763 verloren die Franzosen ihre Kolonie Neufrankreich an die Briten. Zwei Jahrzehnte später wurden die britischen Kolonien weiter im Süden unabhängig, womit die USA entstanden. Den frankophonen Bewohnern des britisch gebliebenen Teils Nordamerikas, die vor allem in der Provinz Québec lebten, machte London eine Reihe von Konzessionen. Die Frankokanadier unterstützten daraufhin die britische Kolonialmacht in zwei Kriegen erfolgreich gegen die USA. Den Westen und Norden verwaltete die private Handelsgesellschaft der Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) von 1821 bis 1869/71 als Monopolist., Der Expansionsdrang der USA veranlasste London, dem verbliebenen Gebiet 1867 weitgehende Selbstständigkeit einzuräumen. Bis 1873 schlossen sich die britischen Kolonien zwischen Atlantik und Pazifik dieser Kanadischen Konföderation an, die zudem 1869 begann, das riesige Gebiet der HBC aufzukaufen und Verträge mit den Indianern zu schließen., Britisches Kapital und eine enge Bindung an das Britische Empire sorgten für einen massiven Ausbau der Infrastruktur Kanadas in Form von Kanälen, Straßen und vor allem Eisenbahnen. Damit sollte das dünn besiedelte, riesige Land stärker integriert und gegen immer wieder aufkeimenden Separatismus sowie Strömungen, die den Anschluss an die USA forderten, abgesichert werden. Zudem förderte dies den Warenaustausch innerhalb des Landes und mit dem Empire, und es erleichterte die Besiedlung., Seit der Weltwirtschaftskrise und dem Zweiten Weltkrieg verlor Großbritannien den Status als Weltmacht an die USA. Kanada lehnte sich immer stärker an seinen südlichen Nachbarn an und trat 1994 einer Freihandelszone mit den USA und Mexiko bei (NAFTA). Dennoch sind sowohl britische Traditionen als auch die der Ureinwohner weiterhin allgegenwärtig. Dies drückt sich sowohl in den politischen Strukturen als auch in der Kultur aus, oder etwa darin, dass Nunavut 1999 eine ausgeprägte Autonomie für die dort überwiegend lebenden Inuit erlangte. Auch haben viele First Nations, wie in Kanada die \\"Indianerstämme\\" genannt werden, eigene Territorien. Doch halten die Auseinandersetzungen um die Nutzungsrechte an. Insgesamt bewirkte das französische Vorbild, dass auch anderen Regionalkulturen das „Recht auf Andersartigkeit“ zusteht., Besiedlung und Kulturareale (vor 10.000 v. Chr. bis zum 16. Jahrhundert)., Früheste Spuren bis zur archaischen Phase., Genetische und klimageschichtliche Untersuchungen legen nahe, dass sich die frühen indianischen Einwanderer entlang der Küste relativ schnell ausbreiteten und von dort ins Binnenland wanderten. Möglicherweise folgte eine Gruppe der Westküste, die andere dem eisfreien Korridor zwischen Rocky Mountains und Hudson Bay., An der Little John Site im westlichen Yukon fand man die ältesten menschlichen Spuren in Kanada; sie reichen bis 12000 v. Chr. zurück. Im nördlichen Yukon sind die Funde in den Bluefish-Höhlen die ältesten. Diese frühe arktische Kultur breitete sich an der Küste entlang südwärts aus, möglicherweise auch entlang des Yukon. In der Charlie-Lake-Höhle nahe Fort St. John fanden sich Werkzeuge aus der Zeit ab etwa 10.500 v. Chr. Dort fanden sich zudem zwei Raben – einer mit Grabbeigaben –, die vor 9.000 bzw. 10.000 Jahren beigesetzt wurden. Ebenfalls aus der Zeit ab etwa 9.000 v. Chr. stammen Funde bei Banff und in Saskatchewan, aber auch bereits in Québec. Die ältesten menschlichen Überreste wurden auf ca. 7800 v. Chr. datiert (\\"On Your Knees Cave\\" auf der Prince-of-Wales-Insel). An der Westküste fanden sich Artefakte aus der Zeit um 8000 bis 9000 v. Chr. (Far West Point)., Dieser frühen Phase folgte die \\"archaische Phase\\", genauer die \\"frühe\\" (ca. 8000 bis 6000 v. Chr.) und die \\"mittlere archaische Phase\\" (ca. 6000 bis 4000 v. Chr.). Vermutlich folgten die Plano-Gruppen, die als Nachfolger der Clovis- und Folsom-Kulturen gelten, im Osten Karibu-Herden der Vereisungsgrenze entlang, Gruppen aus dem Westen erreichten um 7500 v. Chr. das südliche Ontario. Dort fanden sich Speerschleudern (Atlatl), eine technologische Neuerung, die um 8000 v. Chr. entstanden war., Projektilspitzen, Bohrer und vor allem Hausspuren tauchen bereits um 6000 v. Chr. in Vermont auf (John’s Bridge Site in Swanton). Schwerpunkte dieser Kulturen waren der untere Sankt-Lorenz-Strom und die Großen Seen. Die ersten größeren Monumente stellen Grabhügel dar, die \\"Burial Mounds\\". Erstmals ist eine gesellschaftliche Hierarchie entlang des Eriesees, am südlichen Huronsee, am Ontariosee sowie am Sankt-Lorenz-Strom oberhalb der heutigen Stadt Québec greifbar (etwa 5500 v. Chr. bis 1000 v. Chr.)., Die Plano-Kulturen auf den Great Plains umfassen den riesigen Raum zwischen den küstenfernen Gebieten British Columbias und den Nordwest-Territorien sowie dem Golf von Mexiko. Neue Waffentechnologien und weitläufiger Handel sind kennzeichnend. Das Rohmaterial einiger Steinwerkzeuge und -waffen stammte aus weit im Süden gelegenen Gebieten, wie Chalzedon aus Oregon und Obsidian aus Wyoming., Manitoba lag immer noch unter einem Eispanzer, doch entwickelten sich erste Siedlungskammern \\"(Refugia)\\" und bewohnbare Erhebungen, die über die Eisgrenze hinausragten (Nunatuks bzw. Nunataker), wie etwa in Süd-Alberta (Agate Basin culture). Hier wurden noch um 8000 v. Chr. Pferde gejagt; sie verschwanden ebenso wie die Megafauna., Erst später teilte sich der riesige Kulturraum erkennbar in zwei Großräume auf, die \\"Frühe Shield-\\" und die \\"Frühe Plains-Kultur\\". Am South Fowl Lake an der Grenze zwischen Ontario und Minnesota wurden Funde gemacht, die auf eine Bearbeitung elementaren Kupfers bereits um 4800 v. Chr. hindeuten., Im Westen wurde die wohl mindestens bis 9000 v. Chr. zurückreichende Besiedlung durch die \\"Frühe Plateaukultur\\" überlagert. Die zunehmenden Lachswanderungen an der Küste waren aber wahrscheinlich, entgegen früheren Annahmen, nicht die Ursache. Die dortigen Kulturen reichen mindestens bis 8000 v. Chr. zurück. Der älteste Fund auf Vancouver Island \\"(Bear Cove)\\" belegt die Jagd auf Meeressäuger. Abgesehen von Haida Gwaii, das um 7500 v. Chr. besiedelt wurde und mit den Haida eine der ältesten ortskonstanten Bevölkerungen der Welt tragen, wurden viele küstennahe Artefakte durch den stark steigenden Meeresspiegel zerstört. Dieser wurde wiederum von den schmelzenden Eismassen am Ende der letzten Eiszeit ausgelöst., Der älteste nachweisbare Handel mit Obsidian, einem für die Waffen- und Werkzeugherstellung wichtigen vulkanischen Glas, reicht über 10.000 Jahre zurück und basierte auf einer Lagerstätte am Mount Edziza (2.787m) in Nord-British-Columbia. Der äußerste Norden ist erst um 2.500 v. Chr. punktuell besiedelt worden, der Norden Ontarios erst um 2000 v. Chr., Von etwa 4000 bis 1000 v. Chr.., Ab 2500 v. Chr. lassen sich im Westen Siedlungen nachweisen, dazu erste Anzeichen sozialer Differenzierung. Hausverbände bestanden, die sich saisonal zur Jagd in großen Gruppen zusammenfanden. Auch in den Plains lassen sich Dörfer nachweisen. Pfeil und Bogen kamen wohl vor 3000 v. Chr. aus Asien in den Nordwesten, wo die Erfindung lange verharrte, dann an die Ostküste gelangte, um erst rund drei Jahrtausende später den Westen zu erreichen., Begräbnisstätten finden sich im Osten, Grabhügel stellen die frühesten Monumentalbauwerke Kanadas dar. Sie gehen auf die \\"Maritime Archaic People\\" bzw. \\"Red Paint People\\" (wegen des Gebrauchs roten Ockers) zurück. Die vor 4000 v. Chr. in Zentral-Labrador ansässigen Gruppen wichen einer Kälteperiode nach Süden aus, um 2250 v. Chr. zogen Inuit, die um 3000 v. Chr. aus Sibirien kommend Nordamerika erreicht hatten, bis in diese Gegenden südwärts., An den Großen Seen lassen sich nun Hunde nachweisen (in Utah bereits um 8000 v. Chr.), die beerdigt wurden. Das \\"Laurentian Archaic\\" hatte sein Zentrum um Québec und in Ontario und reichte vielleicht bis etwa 5500 v. Chr. zurück. Das Ottawa-Tal gilt als Zentrum der Kupferproduktion., Die Cree, Ojibwa, Algonkin, Innu und Beothuk, die in den frühen europäischen Quellen fassbar sind, gehen wohl auf Gruppen der \\"Shield-Kultur\\" zurück. Um 2000 v. Chr. bestanden komplexe Begräbnisrituale mit kupfernen Beigaben, Werkzeugen und Ocker. Die Handelsbeziehungen reichten bis nach Dakota. Jahreszeitliche Wanderzyklen von großer Kontinuität werden fassbar., Bei den Plainskulturen lassen sich zwischen etwa 6000 v. Chr. und der Zeitenwende gravierende Veränderungen feststellen. Die Trockenphasen wurden milder, die noch heute existierende Bisonart setzte sich durch, Hunde wurden als Trage- und Zugtiere eingesetzt und erhöhten damit die Mobilität, das Tipi setzte sich durch, und eine Kochtechnik mit heißen Steinen gestattete die Herstellung von Pemmikan, was wiederum das Überdauern von Mangelphasen erleichterte., Die \\"Mittlere Plateau-Kultur\\" zwischen Rocky Mountains und pazifischem Küstengebirge entwickelte um 2500 v. Chr. einen Haustyp, der teilweise in die Erde eingetieft wurde. Die Ernährung basierte zunehmend auf Lachs. Die heutigen Binnen-Salish lassen sich mit dieser Kultur eng in Verbindung bringen. Als wichtigste kulturelle Veränderung gilt der Übergang von der Nichtsesshaftigkeit zu einer Halbsesshaftigkeit mit festen Winterdörfern und sommerlichen Wanderzyklen um 2000 v. Chr., Eine ähnliche Entwickl: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Geschichte Kanadas, Urgeschichte, Gegenwart, Eiszeit, Kulturareale, First Nations, britische Kolonialmacht, Autonomie, Besiedlung, Handel"},{"instruction":"can you describe the relations between the following gods and goddesses of this pantheon based on the following: 1.

The new gods may perceive Bob as a threat to their growing power and devotees. They might view his isolationist stance as a sign of weakness or irrelevance, further adding fuel to the conflict. Additionally, the other gods may covet Bob's realm, seeing it as a potential resource or strategic advantage that they could utilize. The invasion force from the other world, composed of mechanical beings that reject diplomacy, adds another layer of tension and conflict. As the invading force threatens the pantheon as a whole, the gods would need to put aside their personal disagreements and unite to defend their realms and followers. This external threat could act as a catalyst for the gods to find common ground and collaborate against a mutual foe. However, Bob's isolationist nature may complicate this unity. If he is unwilling to align himself with the other gods or share his resources and knowledge, it could hinder the collective efforts to repel the invasion. The other gods may view Bob's unwillingness to cooperate as a betrayal or abandonment of his fellow deities and their followers, further escalating tensions within the pantheon. Furthermore, competition for followers becomes even more intense as the invasion force threatens the very existence of the gods and their worshippers. The new gods, who are relatively new compared to Bob, may see this crisis as an opportunity to prove their worth and attract more devotees. They may engage in fierce propaganda and recruiting efforts to win over Bob's followers, exacerbating the existing conflicts between the older and newer deities. Ultimately, the conflicts within the pantheon, fueled by Bob's isolationism, the new gods' ambition, and the external threat from the mechanical invasion force, would create a complex and volatile environment.

The gods, unified by the common threat, stand together to defend their realms and followers from the mechanical invasion force. The battle line would likely be a combination of physical and mystical defenses, strategically positioned to halt the advance of the invaders and prevent them from breaching their territories. The gods would harness their unique powers and abilities to create a formidable defense, utilizing their knowledge, strength, and divine magic to ward off the mechanical intruders. Each god would have a specific role to play in the defense. Bob, as the God of Death and New Experiences, may provide guidance and insight into the invaders' weaknesses, helping the other gods exploit those vulnerabilities to maximize their effectiveness in battle. His experience in dealing with the balance of life and death may prove invaluable in understanding the nature of these mechanical beings. The newer gods, driven by their ambition to expand their influence and protect their followers, would fight zealously on the battle line. They would utilize their respective domains and powers to counter the relentless onslaught of the invaders. Aria, the Goddess of Light and Being Potential, may unleash blinding rays of light to disorient the enemies. Wron, the God of War and Violent Acts, would channel his ferocity and battle prowess to lead the charge against the invaders, coordinating strategies with his fellow gods. Dena, the Goddess of Feeling and New Emotions, would provide emotional support and resilience to the defenders, boosting their morale and bolstering their spirits. Len, the God of Knowledge and New Ideas, would share his wisdom with the other gods, suggesting innovative tactics and strategies to outmaneuver the mechanical invaders. Zip, the God of Change and Growth, would adapt the battle line strategy by continuously shifting the defenses and introducing unpredictable elements, exploiting the invaders' rigid and unyielding nature. Zip's followers would also play a crucial role in facilitating the changes necessary for the defense, constantly adapting and evolving to counter the invaders' relentless assault. Together, the gods and their followers would fiercely protect their realms, knowing that the survival of their pantheon and the faith of their devotees are at stake. The battle line would become a symbol of their unity, determination, and resilience as they stand against the otherworldly menace. However, the situation would remain tense and challenging. The mechanical invaders' rejection of diplomacy means that negotiations or peaceful resolutions would be out of the question.

Archäologische Funde belegen jedoch die Anwesenheit von Menschen bereits in der Altsteinzeit. Das Marktrecht erlangte Lörrach im Jahr 1403. Erst 1682 erhielt der Ort das Stadtrecht durch Friedrich Magnus von Durlach und hat damit, verglichen mit seinen Teilorten und anderen Ortschaften der Region, eine verhältnismäßig junge Stadtgeschichte. Der Ort entwickelte sich wegen der Nachbarschaft des dominierenden Basel kaum und behielt bis zur zweiten Stadterhebung weitgehend seinen dörflichen Charakter. Auch die Geschichtsschreibung erwähnte Lörrach bis zum Spätmittelalter selten, so dass sich die Entwicklung Lörrachs oftmals von der Basels ableitet. 1756 wurde das Stadtrecht erneuert, nachdem es durch diverse kriegerische Ereignisse in Vergessenheit geraten war., Im 19. Jahrhundert war Lörrach Schauplatz der Märzrevolution in Deutschland, wo im September 1848 infolge der zweiten Badischen Revolution die Deutsche Republik ausgerufen wurde. Die Stadt verdankt den Aufschwung zur Zeit der Industrialisierung der Lage am Fluss Wiese und der günstigen Verkehrslage an einer der wichtigsten Nord-Süd-Verbindungen über die Alpen. Vor allem durch die textilverarbeitende Industrie erlangte Lörrach weit über die Region hinaus Bekanntheit. Zur wechselvollen Geschichte Lörrachs gehört auch die wechselnde Zugehörigkeit zu verschiedenen Adelsgeschlechtern und Territorien. Teile des heutigen Lörrach gehörten zu Vorderösterreich, später zum Land Baden; seit 1952 gehört es zu Baden-Württemberg., Frühere Besiedlung des Lörracher Raums und Römerzeit., Urgeschichte., Steinwerkzeuge als älteste Spuren menschlicher Besiedlung im Raum Lörrach wurden in Wyhlen am Hochrhein gefunden und wegen der Lössablagerungen, die sich oberhalb der entdeckten Werkzeuge befanden, in die Altsteinzeit datiert. Funde in den Höhlen des Isteiner Klotzes aus der mittleren Steinzeit (endete etwa 4500 v. Chr.) weisen auf Bergbauaktivitäten und Rentierjäger hin. Die Funde auf Lörracher Gemarkung beginnen mit der Jungsteinzeit, einer Periode, in der sich beim Übergang zur Sesshaftigkeit dorfähnliche Siedlungen gebildet haben. Damit einhergehend entwickelten sich Ackerbau, Viehzucht, Steinschleiferei und Keramikherstellung. Archäologische Funde von Steingeräten im \\"Homburger Wald\\", in der \\"Moosmatte\\" im heutigen Stetten und im \\"Dalcher Boden\\" in Tüllingen deuten auf Wohnplätze hin. Aus der Eisenzeit (die Hallstattzeit dauerte etwa von 800 bis 400 v. Chr.) sind eine große Zahl von befestigten Höhensiedlungen und Hügelgräbern am \\"Grenzacher Horn\\", am \\"Schädelberg\\", \\"Hünerberg\\" und im \\"Homburger Wald\\" erhalten geblieben., Im 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr. siedelten sich in den Tälern der Nebenflüsse des Rheins die Kelten vom Stamm der Helvetier an. Viele geografische Bezeichnungen von Bergen, Flüssen und Orten entstammen der keltischen Sprache, wie beispielsweise der Rhein, der aus dem keltischen \\"Rhennos\\" = \\"der Strömende\\" entstand. Spuren keltischer Siedler lassen sich auch in Herten, Wyhlen und Inzlingen nachweisen. Bei der \\"Kreuzeiche\\" östlich von Lörrach gibt es eine keltische Viereckschanze aus der La-Tène-Zeit, die mutmaßlich kultischen Zwecken diente., Römerzeit., Mehrere Jahrhunderte lang gehörte die Region zwischen Rhein und Limes zum Römischen Reich. Unter Kaiser Augustus begann die Expansion mit der Besetzung des linken Rheinufers. Um etwa 50 n. Chr. unter Kaiser Claudius setzte sich die Romanisierung über das rechtsrheinische Hoch- und Oberrheinland bis zum Limes fort. Dies leitete das Ende der keltischen Selbstständigkeit und der Latènekultur ein. Das südwestdeutsche römische Gebiet wurde als \\"Zehntland\\" (lateinisch: Agri decumates) bezeichnet. Auffällig ist, dass im Gegensatz zum Raum Basel, zum südlichen Oberrheingebiet und zum Hochrheintal auf der Gemarkung Lörrach nur geringe Zeugnisse der römischen Zeit zu finden sind. Das vordere Wiesental sowie der Dinkelberg gehörten nicht zum Interessensbereich der römischen Eroberer. Spuren der Römerzeit sind lediglich im heutigen Stetten und in Brombach erhalten. Das römische Reich beschränkte sich zunächst auf den Ausbau und die strategische Sicherung der Frontlinie (Donau–Kaiserstuhl) mit Kastellen im Hinterland. Mittelpunkte römischer Kultur südlich des Rheins waren \\"Vindonissa \\"(Windisch) bei Brugg, \\"Basilea\\" (Basel) und \\"Colonia Augusta Rauracorum\\" (Augst). Im 40 v. Chr. gegründeten Augusta Rauracorum führten zwei Brücken über den Rhein. Kaiser Trajan ließ um 100 n. Chr. eine Straße von Augst über Haltingen und Efringen bis nach Heidelberg und Mogontiacum (Mainz) bauen. Die wichtigeren Straßen der Römer verliefen jedoch linksrheinisch. Rhein und Bodensee bildeten 300 n. Chr. zwischen Römern und Alamannen eine Grenze, an der es immer wieder zu wechselvollen Kämpfen beider Völker kam., In Lörrach, wo der Romanisierungsprozess erst später einsetzte, findet man in landschaftlich bevorzugter Lage die Reste eines römischen Landguts, einer sogenannten Villa Rustica. Die ausgegrabenen und restaurierten Grundmauern der Villa Rustica in Brombach sind das einzige entdeckte Zeugnis römischer Bauten. Erst mit dem Durchbruch der römischen Verteidigungslinien im Jahr 260 n. Chr. durch die Alemannen wurden die Römer zurückgedrängt. In den folgenden Jahrhunderten besiedelten die Alemannen den südwestdeutschen Raum. Aus dieser Zeit stammen zahlreiche Siedlungen (z.B. Grenzach, Wyhlen, Basel, Weil, Haltingen, Brombach, Lörrach, Stetten), die noch bestehen. Auf vielen Gebieten wirkte der römische Einfluss jedoch weiter, unter anderem in der Landwirtschaft und im Weinbau. Spätestens mit dem Tod des römischen Statthalters Aëtius im Jahr 454 kann die römische Herrschaft nördlich der Alpen als beendet angesehen werden., Von der ersten Erwähnung bis zum Spätmittelalter., Frühmittelalter., Die meisten Dörfer im südwestdeutschen Raum mit den Endungen -ingen, -heim, -ach, -bach, -weil und -stetten entstanden im 6. und 7. Jahrhundert. Eine zweite Besiedlungswelle erfasste auch das obere Wiesental bis Todtnau. Um 500 n. Chr. gerieten die Alemannen unter die Herrschaft der Franken. Im Jahr 746 wurden sämtliche Führer der Alemannen auf Befehl von Pippin dem Jüngeren und Karlmann im sogenannten Blutgericht zu Cannstatt erschlagen. Auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Lörrach gibt es zahlreiche Anhaltspunkte für die Besiedlung in der Merowingerzeit. Die Ortsteile Tumringen, Tüllingen und Hauingen zeugen durch die Namensgebung von der frühen Gründung. Stetten, früher als \\"Stetiheim\\" bezeichnet, spricht für eine Ausbauzeit im 7. Jahrhundert. Um 600 verkündete der heilige Fridolin das Christentum. Die Ortschaft Zell war damals eine \\"Cella\\" der Fridolinsmönche. Das vom Kloster Säckingen gegründete Stetten fand im Jahr 763 zum ersten Mal urkundliche Erwähnung und dessen Kirche wurde zu Ehren der Fridolinsmönche dem Heiligen Fridolin geweiht. Als Stiftslehen unter habsburgischer Schutzherrschaft wurde Stetten Vorderösterreich zugesprochen und blieb nach der Reformation katholisch. Eine Urkunde vom 7. September 751 dokumentiert die Schenkung eines Ebo und seiner Gemahlin Odalsinda an das Kloster St. Gallen. Im Text ist auch von einer Kirche in Rötteln \\"(ecclesia Raudinleim)\\" die Rede. Verfasser dieser Urkunde war ein Priester Landarius von der Kirche zu Rötteln. Von St. Blasien aus wurden Propsteien gebildet (1100 in Weitenau, 1126 in Bürgeln und Sulzburg) und ein Frauenkloster in Sitzenkirch. Die enormen Erweiterungen der Besitztümer verhalfen dem Kloster St. Blasien zu politischem und geistigem Einfluss und machten es weit über die Region bekannt. Im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert gewann auch das Dorf Lörrach an Bedeutung., Erste Erwähnung von Lörrach bis zum Ende der Herren von Rötteln., Im Jahr 1083 gründete der Bischof von Basel Burkhard von Hasenburg das Cluniazenser-Kloster St. Alban. Burkhard, der 35 Jahre Bischof von Basel war, unterstützte während des Investiturstreits König Heinrich IV. auf seinem Gang nach Canossa im Jahr 1077. Wegen der Treue Burkhards zu Heinrich hatte dieser das Bistum Basel mit Privilegien und Schenkungen zu stärken versucht. Bischof Burkhard seinerseits sicherte sein bischöfliches Territorium in Basel durch den Bau einer Stadtmauer rund um die Stadt., Aus dieser Zeit datiert die schriftliche Erstnennung Lörrachs im Jahr 1102, an die auch bei Jubiläumsfeierlichkeiten erinnert wurde., Aus dem Gründungsbericht des Klosters St. Alban geht hervor, dass Bischof Burkhard den Freiherrn Dietrich von Rötteln zum Schirmvogt des rechtsrheinischen Besitzes ernannte. Wörtlich heißt es in der Urkunde:, Die Aufzählung umfasst auch die Kirchen in Hauingen, Biesheim und die Martinskirche in Basel. Fraglich bleibt, warum die Erwähnung von Lörrach so spät erfolgte, zumal die umliegenden Nachbarorte in den karolingischen Urkunden der Klöster Lorsch und St. Gallen deutlich früher erwähnt wurden. Die plausibelste Theorie dafür ist, dass die Besitztümer in Kleinbasel und Lörrach von Heinrich IV. erst im Verlauf des 11. Jahrhunderts an den Basler Bischof gelangten. Dies würde erklären, wieso der nach archäologischen Erkenntnissen altbesiedelte und wahrscheinlich auch mit einem vormittelalterlichen Ortsnamen behaftete Ort nicht in den Urkunden vorkommt. Urkunden sind nur dort erhalten, wo etwas geschenkt wurde., Die Geschichte der freien Herren von Rötteln ist stark mit derjenigen Lörrachs verbunden. Die genaue Herkunft des Adelsgeschlechts ist nicht bekannt. Erstmals erwähnt wurden sie 1102/1103; in diesem Jahr erhielt ein Dietrich von Rötteln die Vogtei über die Güter des jungen Klosters St. Alban in Basel übertragen. Durch Erbschaft fielen den Herren von Rötteln weite Teile der Besitztümer der Herren von Waldeck zu. Man geht davon aus, dass die Herren von Rötteln damals bereits die Burg und die Kirche von Rötteln besaßen. Die Besitztümer der Herren von Rötteln müssen eine solide Basis gehabt haben, die ihnen auch starken Einfluss im Bereich des Bistums Basel und teilweise auch im Bistum Konstanz ermöglichte. Die Herren von Rötteln bekleideten vornehmlich kirchliche Ämter, teilweise als Domherren oder als Bischöfe. Was Dietrich von Rötteln, der wohl bis 1123 gelebt hat, alles besaß, lässt sich aufgrund mangelnder Schenkungsurkunden in den ersten Generationen kaum rekonstruieren., Im 12.

Jahrhunderts zum erzbischöflichen Herrschaftsgebiet Salzburg. Dadurch wurde das Gebiet lange Zeit vom zu Tirol gehörenden, umliegenden Gebiet isoliert. Erst die Ereignisse rund um die Napoleonischen Kriege bewirkten, dass Matrei Teil Tirols wurde. Wirtschaftlich blieb Matrei lange ein unterentwickeltes, von der Landwirtschaft geprägtes Gebiet. Durch den Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts einsetzenden Tourismus begann jedoch ein allmählicher Aufschwung der Gemeinde., Namensgebung., Erstmals urkundlich erwähnt wurde Matrei im Jahr 1170 als \\"Matereie\\".

Abgeleitet wird der Ortsname vom indo-europäischen \\"mater\\", der auf eine im Ostalpen- und Mittelmeerraum verehrte, göttliche Mutter zurückgeht, deren heimische Lautung \\"Anna divia Damatria\\" (die göttliche Herrin Erd-Mutter) war., 1335 wurde der Ort in einem Weihebrief für die nach einem Brand neu errichtete Kirche als in \\"bindisch Matrey\\" (\\"Windisch-Matrei\\") bezeichnet. Die Bezeichnung Windisch ist jedoch nicht auf die zu dieser Zeit bereits assimilierten Alpenslawen zurückzuführen, sondern diente der Unterscheidung des Ortes von Matrei am Brenner und war auch als Bezeichnung für die Zugehörigkeit zum Land Kärnten gebräuchlich. Die Bezeichnung Windisch-Matrei setzte sich jedenfalls auch in der Salzburger Kanzlei durch und blieb bis nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg amtlich. Um die oft irreführende Bezeichnung „Windisch“ zu ändern und auch um den Tourismus anzukurbeln, beschlossen 1921 Vertreter der Markt- und Landgemeinde eine Umbenennung in „Matrei am Großvenediger“, dies wurde jedoch von der Landesregierung abgelehnt. Deshalb wählten die Gemeindevertreter den Namen „Matrei in Osttirol“. Nachdem 1938 Osttirol jedoch Kärnten zugeschlagen wurde, stand der Name „Matrei in Kärnten“ zur Diskussion. Da sich aber die Matreier gegen diese Bezeichnung wehrten, setzte sich nun das früher propagierte „Matrei am Großvenediger“ durch. 1945 wurde der Name jedoch wieder in die heutige Form \\"Matrei in Osttirol\\" (offizielle Schreibweise \\"Matrei i. O.\\") geändert., Ur- und Frühgeschichte., Aufgrund fehlender Funde liegt die Urgeschichte des Matreier Gemeindegebietes im Dunkeln. Neolithische Jäger waren jedoch in Osttirol bereits im 7. bis 6. Jahrtausend vor Christus anwesend, wie eine 1987 am sogenannten Hirschbichl in St. Jakob im Defereggental entdeckte Fundstelle beweist. Mit der Jungsteinzeit (6. bis 3. Jahrtausend v. Chr.) setzten sich in Osttirol Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie Töpferei und Hausbau durch, Funde aus Matrei fehlen jedoch auch für diese Periode., Aus der frühen und mittleren Bronzezeit (ca. 22. bis 13. Jahrhundert v. Chr.), in der die Bronze den Stein als bestimmenden Werkstoff ablöste, sind erstmals auch Funde auf dem Gemeindegebiet Matreis bekannt. Am Matreier Klaunzerberg befand sich in der frühen Bronzezeit ein Schmelzplatz, an dem Keramikfunde ausgegraben wurden. In der späten Bronzezeit (Urnenfelderkultur) war Osttirol von der sogenannten Laugen-Melaun-Kultur geprägt, die sich vom Alpenrheintal über Tirol bis ins Kärntner Drautal erstreckte. In Matrei wurden aus dieser Zeit schlanke mittel- und endständige Lappenbeile aus Bronze entdeckt., Eisen- und Römerzeit., Mit der zweiten Hälfte des 8. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. begann in Osttirol die ältere Eisenzeit, die auf Grund des Hauptfundortes auch Hallstattzeit genannt wird. Diese Periode war vor allem von der verstärkten Verwendung des Eisens geprägt, das zuvor kaum verwendet worden war. Funde aus dieser Zeit sind besonders aus dem benachbarten Virgen bekannt. Die folgende jüngere Eisenzeit (La-Tène-Zeit), war in Osttirol von der Fritzens-Sanzeno-Kultur geprägt. Kennzeichen dieser Kultur sind unter anderem die typische Hausform (eingetiefte Häuser mit winkeligen Zugängen) und Keramiken mit seicht eingestrichenen oder gestempelten Mustern. Diese Keramiken entdeckte man auch in Matrei (Weißenstein)., Etwa um 100 v. Chr. fiel der Osttiroler Raum an die Kelten. Das Römische Reich schloss einen staatlichen Freundschaftsvertrag mit dem keltischen Königreich Noricum, um sich den Zugriff auf die Erzlagerstätten zu sichern. Im Gegensatz zum benachbarten Rätien kam Noricum jedoch 15 v. Chr. friedlich ans Römische Reich. Als Zentrum Osttirols entwickelte sich zu dieser Zeit Aguntum. Matrei spielte jedoch als Ausgangspunkt in das kupferreiche Virgental und als Kreuzungspunkt des Saumwegs über den Felber Tauern bereits früh eine gewichtige Rolle. Die Funde aus Matrei und Umgebung werden heute vom örtlichen Museumsverein gesammelt und ausgestellt., Matrei im Mittelalter., Matrei im Frühmittelalter., Ab dem 5. Jahrhundert n. Chr. drangen immer stärker germanische und slawische Stämme in die römischen Provinzen ein und zerstörten das benachbarte Aguntum. Zunächst rückten im 6. Jahrhundert die Baiern von Norden aus vor und stießen bis ins Pustertal vor. Als jedoch die Slawen von den Awaren bedroht wurden, drangen die Slawen immer weiter nach Westen vor und besiedelten schließlich das Drau- und Iseltal und somit auch das Gebiet von Matrei. Die Landnahme dürfte dabei großteils friedlich gegenüber der einheimischen Bevölkerung verlaufen sein, da durch die Abwanderung der Römer ausreichend freier Siedlungsraum vorhanden war. Zusätzlich erschlossen die Slawen neue Wirtschafts- und Siedlungsgebiete., Im 8. Jahrhundert geriet das slawische Karantanien, das eine wesentlich größere Ausdehnung als das heutige Kärnten hatte, an das Herzogtum Bayern und wurde von bairischen Kolonisten besiedelt. Slawische Machtträger wurden immer mehr durch bayrisch-fränkische Adelige verdrängt. Es folgte die Christianisierung der Region, wobei sich zunächst das Patriarchat Aquileia durchsetzte und wahrscheinlich die Urpfarrei Virgen (später Landdekanat Virgen mit Matrei, Kals und Defereggen) gründete. Für das Gebiet um Matrei setzte sich jedoch letztlich das Erzbistum Salzburg durch. Durch die Festlegung der Diözesangrenzen 811 durch Karl den Großen konnte das Erzbistum Salzburg seine Grenzen über die Iselregion sowie über das Gebiet links der Drau ausdehnen., Matrei im Hochmittelalter., Der Kärntner Lurngau reichte im Hochmittelalter etwa von Spittal an der Drau bis zum Anraser Bach. Der Lurngau umfasste aber auch das Iseltal und die Region um Matrei. Urkunden belegen die Zugehörigkeit des Matreier Ortes Zedlach (\\"Cetulic\\") zum Lurngau in den Jahren 1022 und 1029. Auch durch die Besitzverhältnisse war Matrei mit dem Lurngau verbunden. Der aus Oberschwaben stammende Graf Wolfrat von Alshausen-Isny-Veringen hatte zunächst Güter im Lurngau erworben. Sein Sohn Wolfrat II., der sich im Jahr 1121 erstmals Graf von Treffen nannte, verfügte jedoch nicht nur über Besitz am Ossiacher See, er gelangte auch in den Besitz von Lengberg und einer großen Grundherrschaft in Matrei. Während Wolfrats Sohn Ulrich II. zum Patriarchen von Aquileia ernannt wurde, heiratete Wilbirgis, eine seiner beiden Töchter, den Grafen Heinrich von Lechsgemünd, dessen Herrschaftsbereich im Oberpinzgau lag. Als Heiratsausstattung brachte Wilbirgis die Besitzungen und Burgen von Lengberg und Matrei in die Ehe ein. Heinrich konnte somit seine Herrschaft über den Alpenhauptkamm nach Süden ausdehnen, sein Stammschloss lag jedoch an der Mündung des Lechs in die Donau. Nach seinen Besitzungen in Matrei nannte sich Heinrich in der Folge oftmals auch „Graf von Matrei“, der Ort war jedoch nie eine Grafschaft, sondern immer nur eine „Herrschaft“. In ihrem Testament vermachte Wilbirgis die Schlösser Matrei und Lengberg jedoch rechtsgültig dem Patriarchat Aquileia, ihr Gatte verkaufte jedoch all seine Besitzungen im Jahr 1207 für 2850 Mark Silber dem Erzbischof Eberhard von Salzburg. Nur den Ertrag der Herrschaft Lengberg behielt Heinrich bis zu seinem Tod. Nach dem Tod Heinrichs (vor 1212) entbrannte zwischen Salzburg und Aquileia ein Streit um den Besitz von Matrei und Lengberg, wobei jedoch auch andere Besitzstreitigkeiten zur Klärung anstanden. Ein Schiedsgericht in Anras legte 1212 schließlich fest, dass alle Güter der Kontrahenten an den jeweiligen Inhaber des Diözesangebiets übergehen sollten. Dadurch fielen Matrei und Lengberg, weil im Salzburger Diözesangebiet gelegen, an das Erzbistum Salzburg., Ob der Auslöser für den Verkauf Matreis an den Salzburger Erzbischof die Zerstörung des Ortes im 12. Jahrhundert durch eine Naturkatastrophe war, bleibt Spekulation. Nach einer Sage soll sich der Hauptort einst zwischen dem heutigen Westende des Marktes und dem Schloss Weißenstein befunden haben., Matrei als Teil Salzburgs., Matrei wurde durch die neue Zugehörigkeit zu Salzburg in eine Randposition gedrängt. Vom Salzburger Kernland war es durch den Felber Tauern abgetrennt, der nur wenige Monate im Jahr passierbar war. Engere Beziehungen zu Tirol, das nun „Ausland“ war, wurden hingegen durch Handelsbehinderungen und amtliche Schikanen eingeschränkt. Zum Salzburger Gebiet gehörten neben Matrei-Markt und Matrei Land (so die spätere Bezeichnung) auch Streulagen im Defereggental. Ob die Kienburg, deren Besitz oftmals den Lechsgemündern zugeschrieben wird, zu diesem Zeitpunkt im Besitz Salzburgs war, geht aus den Quellen jedoch nicht hervor. Spätestens in der zweiten Hälfte des 13. Jahrhunderts hatte Matrei auch bereits das Marktrecht erhalten. Wann genau der Ort zum Markt erhoben worden war, ist jedoch nicht nachgewiesen. Matrei galt zudem als Salzburger Urpfarre, die neben dem heutigen Pfarrgebiet auch Mitteldorf, Huben und das Defereggental mit Ausnahme von St. Jakob umfasste. Das Erzbistum hatte jedoch nicht nur kirchlichen und politischen Einfluss, es stellte auch den größten Grundbesitzer in Matrei dar und besaß so viele Leibeigene, dass diese auf den eigenen Gütern nicht alle eingesetzt werden konnten. Neben dem Erzstift traten als Grundherren vor allem die Grafen von Görz sowie kirchliche Institutionen auf. Als Lehensformen gab es in Matrei das Beutellehen und das Freistift, das jedoch immer mehr an Bede: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Geschichte Osttirols, Matrei in Osttirol, Österreichische Ortsgeschichte, Marktgemeinde, Herrschaftsgebiet, Tirol, Tourismus, Namensgebung, Ur- und Frühgeschichte, Bronzezeit, Eisenzeit, Römerzeit, Mittelalter, Hochmittelalter, Landnahme, Christianisierung, Verkauf, Salzburgs, Randposition"},{"instruction":"","output":"- Open a new tab in your web browser - Type \\"https://www.google.com\\" in the address bar and press Enter - Once the Google homepage loads, click on the search bar - Enter your search query and press Enter or click on the \\"Google Search\\" button - The search results page will then display a list of relevant web pages, images, news, and other information related to your search query"},{"instruction":"GESTION DES INSCRIPTIONS ELEVES","output":"La gestion des inscriptions des élèves peut être réalisée de différentes manières, en fonction du contexte et des besoins de votre établissement.

So war in Ostfriesland im Mittelalter der Feudalismus nur wenig ausgeprägt, stattdessen entstand das Gefolgschaftssystem der Friesischen Freiheit. Erst 1464 wurde das Haus Cirksena mit der Reichsgrafschaft Ostfriesland belehnt. Der Absolutismus blieb in Ostfriesland jedoch unbekannt. In den zwei Jahrhunderten nach etwa 1500 machte sich ein spürbarer Einfluss der Niederlande bemerkbar – politisch, wirtschaftlich und kulturell. 1744 verlor die Grafschaft ihre Selbstständigkeit innerhalb des Heiligen Römischen Reichs und gehörte fortan zu Preußen, nach dem Wiener Kongress (1815) zum Königreich Hannover, ab 1866 wiederum zu Preußen und seit 1946 zu Niedersachsen., Prägend ist auch der Jahrhunderte währende Kampf gegen die Fluten der Nordsee. In dem flachen Land an der Küste begannen die Menschen um das Jahr 1000, sich durch die Anlegung von Warften und Deichen gegen die Fluten zu schützen. Dabei kam es jedoch immer wieder zu schweren Rückschlägen in Form von verheerenden Sturmfluten, die zu Deichdurchbrüchen, Überschwemmungen und Landverlusten führten., Fortschritte in der landwirtschaftlichen Nutzung waren durch verbesserte Melioration der Marschen und die planmäßige Urbarmachung der Moore (ab 1633) zu verzeichnen. Der Handel, insbesondere der Seehandel, hat zu fast allen Zeiten eine wichtige Rolle gespielt. So war die Stadt Emden um 1600 eine bedeutende Hafenstadt in Europa und entwickelte sich zugleich zu einem Hort des Calvinismus. Landwirtschaft und Fischerei waren über Jahrhunderte die wichtigsten Erwerbszweige. Die Industrialisierung hingegen fand erst spät statt., Geschichte., Frühgeschichte., Früheste Spuren menschlicher Anwesenheit finden sich von jungpaläolithischen Rentierjägern der Hamburger Kultur. Es folgen mesolithische Fundorte und später Nachweise neolithischer Siedlungen der Glockenbecherkultur, der Megalithkultur und der Schnurkeramischen Kultur. Auf Spiekeroog und Baltrum fanden Hobbyarchäologen 2016 und 2018 zwei menschliche Kieferknochen. Sie sind 7500 und 5500 Jahre alt und die ältesten bis dato gefundenen menschlichen Überreste im Gebiet der südlichen Nordsee. Der Spiekerooger Unterkiefer stammt von einem ca. 40-jährigen Mann, der im 6. Jahrtausend vor Christus lebte, also noch zu Zeiten der Jäger und Sammler. Der Unterkiefer von Baltrum gehörte ebenfalls zu einem männlichen Erwachsenen, der allerdings etwa 2000 Jahre später lebte, also in der Übergangszeit zu den ersten bäuerlichen Kulturen an der Nordseeküste., Überregional bedeutende Funde aus der Frühzeit sind die älteste Brandbestattung Nordwestdeutschlands (datiert auf 2700–2900 v.Chr.) und der Pflug von Walle von etwa 1000 v.Chr. geschätzt. Eine genaue Datierung des Fundes steht noch aus., Die ältesten Funde menschlicher Besiedelung in Ostfriesland wurden bei Hesel gemacht. Dort wurden unter anderem Reste einer Kultstätte entdeckt. Aus der Jungsteinzeit liegt eine Reihe von Steinwaffen und Keramiken vor. Hünengräber (Utarp und Tannenhausen) und Funde von Steinbeilen stammen aus der Zeit der Megalithkultur. Den bedeutendsten Fund aus der Bronzezeit stellt die Goldscheibe von Moordorf dar. Die Bevölkerung dünnte sich mit der Versumpfung der Landschaft merklich aus., Eine Neubesiedlung fand erst im zweiten Jahrhundert vor Christus statt. Die Siedler aus dem Großverband der germanischen Ingwäonen kamen wahrscheinlich aus Jütland und Skandinavien. Plinius der Ältere nennt Chauken und Friesen aus dem Großverband der Ingwäonen. Dabei kann bis heute nicht geklärt werden, ob die erwähnten \\"Ur-Friesen\\" \\"(„Frisii“)\\" germanischen Ursprungs waren oder erst durch den Zuzug germanisiert wurden., Während ursprünglich Chauken das Gebiet zwischen Ems und Weser bewohnten, begannen etwa um die Zeitenwende Friesen langsam in diesen Raum vorzudringen. Die Chauken wurden von ihnen teils verdrängt, teils in ihren Stammesverband aufgenommen. Seit dem zweiten Jahrhundert wurden die Chauken nicht mehr erwähnt. Ob sie im Stammesverband der Sachsen oder dem der Franken aufgingen, ist unklar. Von der Landseite her drängten sächsische Stämme in die Geestgebiete vor. Die späteren Ostfriesen gingen aus der Vermischung dieser Gruppen hervor., Die Grenze zwischen Friesen und Chauken hatte sich quer durch Ostfriesland gezogen. Es wird angenommen, dass Orte, deren Namen auf \\"-um\\" (früher \\"-hem\\") enden, friesische Siedlungen waren (zum Beispiel Jemgum, Bingum, Petkum, Borssum), Orte auf \\"-ens\\" hingegen chaukischen Ursprungs sind (zum Beispiel Esens, Wiesens, Popens, Schortens)., 12 v.Chr. erreichten die Römer unter ihrem Feldherrn Drusus erstmals Ostfriesland. Wenige Jahre später ankerte Germanicus in der Amisia (Ems). Der möglicherweise zur Versorgung und zum Schutz der Schiffe genutzte Fundplatz Bentumersiel (heute Gemeinde Jemgum) zählt zu den wenigen Orten in Niedersachsen, in denen Funde auf die Anwesenheit römischer Legionäre zu Beginn des 1. Jahrhunderts n. Chr. hinweisen. Bis 28 n. Chr. blieb Friesland Teil des Römerreiches, und im Jahr 47 wurde das Land erneut unterworfen. Doch der Kaiser befahl dem Befehlshaber Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo wieder abzuziehen., Einem Bericht des Tacitus zum Jahr 58 n. Chr. zufolge waren die Friesen „mit ihrem gesamten Volk“ in den breiten, zu dieser Zeit weitgehend menschenleeren Grenzstreifen rechts des unteren Niederrheins gezogen und hatten dort bereits mit der Bodenbearbeitung und dem Bau von Häusern begonnen. Doch die nach Rom geschickten Gesandten erhielten dort, obwohl sie auf die verschwenderisch freien Flächen verwiesen, nicht die Erlaubnis des Kaisers, dort zu siedeln. Daraufhin lösten römische Einheiten den Ansiedlungsversuch auf. Die Friesen beteiligten sich ein Jahrzehnt später am erfolglosen Bataveraufstand., Mittelalter (bis 1464)., Völkerwanderung, Heerkönige, gescheiterte Christianisierung., Mit dem Niedergang des Weströmischen Reiches versiegen vom 4. bis zum 7. Jahrhundert die Schriftquellen über die Region., Für das 5. und 6. Jahrhundert gibt es wenige archäologische Funde, was darauf hindeutet, dass es in dieser Zeit zu einem starken Rückgang der Besiedlung kam. Ursache dafür könnte ein Anstieg des Meeresspiegels und die dadurch bedingte Überflutung der Marsch und die Vernässung der Geest sein. Wahrscheinlich ist, dass ein Teil der Bevölkerung mit den Sachsen, Angeln und weiteren germanischen Völkern nach England übersetzte. Eine der wenigen Ausnahmen, die für eine kontinuierliche Besiedelung der Region sprechen, ist der Runensolidus von Schweindorf., In der Völkerwanderungszeit wurde die im östlichen Ostfriesland ansässige Bevölkerung der Chauken vermutlich in den föderativen Stammesverband der Sachsen eingegliedert. Auf eine kulturelle Annäherung deuten Funde neuer Keramikformen hin, die aus dem Gebiet westlich der Weser stammen, wo in dieser Zeit die Sachsen lebten. Zeugnisse kriegerischer Auseinandersetzungen, etwa Brandhorizonte, fehlen hingegen., Im 7. und 8. Jahrhundert begann eine Neubesiedlung im Rahmen einer Expansion des friesischen Siedlungsgebiets. Diese reichte im Westen bis zur Sincfal (nördlich von Brügge) und umfasste Südholland, Utrecht und Westgelderland. Seit dem 8. Jahrhundert wurden auch Wursten und die nordfriesischen Inseln besiedelt, und später das gegenüberliegende Festland. Funde aus dieser Zeit deuten darauf hin, dass die Siedler aus den friesischen Gebieten westlich der Lauwers stammten., Bis zu den ersten Deichbauten war eine Besiedlung nur in höher gelegenen Geestgebieten und auf sogenannten Warften im häufig von der Nordsee überfluteten Marschland möglich., Ab etwa 1000n.Chr. ermöglichten Deichbauten, die gesamte Marsch zu besiedeln. Hierauf spielt der Sinnspruch \\"Deus mare, Friso litora fecit\\" (Gott schuf das Meer, der Friese die Küsten) an., Zwischen 650 und 700 entstand ein friesisches Heerkönigtum, das gelegentlich immer noch als Großreichsbildung missverstanden wird. Unstreitig ist, dass diese Heerkönige sich gegen die fränkische Expansion (und die damit einhergehende Christianisierung) zur Wehr setzten, was wohl weite Teile des heutigen Westfrieslands, Ostfriesland und Gebiete bis zur Weser zusammenführte (Magna Frisia). Der erste überlieferte Name eines Heerkönigs ist Aldegisel, der offenbar ab 678 den christlichen Missionar Wilfrid unterstützte. Sein Sohn und Nachfolger Radbod hatte, wie sein Vater, seinen Machtschwerpunkt im Westen, im Raum Utrecht. Er stand 716 mit seinem Heerhaufen vor Köln und besiegte im selben Jahr den fränkischen Hausmeier Karl Martell, der damit seine einzige Niederlage hinnehmen musste. In wilhelminischer Zeit wurde Radbod († 719) zu Propagandazwecken geradezu zu einem Vorkämpfer germanischer Freiheit verklärt und, da er sich nicht taufen ließ, als Sinnbild der anti-römisch-klerikalen Kräfte stilisiert, im Zusammenhang mit dem sogenannten \\"Kirchenkampf\\". Auch Industriekomplexe wie die Zeche Radbod im östlichen Ruhrgebiet wurden nach ihm benannt. Er ist bis heute Teil der Folklore., Teil des Frankenreichs, Christianisierung., Nachfolger Radbods wurde Poppo. Er widersetzte sich vergeblich der Rückeroberung des westlichen Frieslands durch die Franken, und nach 720 waren alle Landesteile westlich der Vlie in fränkischer Hand. Endgültig schlug Karl Martell die Friesen in der Schlacht an der Boorne (734). Poppo fand dabei den Tod. Karl der Große eroberte 785 nach dem Sieg über die Sachsen ganz Friesland einschließlich der östlichen Gebiete bis zur Weser. Sachsen und Friesen, die gegen Karl gekämpft hatten, wurde das \\"Ius paternae hereditatis\\", das Recht auf ihr väterliches Erbe und damit ihr freies Erbeigen, entzogen. Zur Absicherung seiner Eroberungen ließ Karl zudem das Friesische Recht aufzeichnen und mit fränkischen Gesetzen in einer Übersicht zusammenfassen, der Lex Frisionum., Die Franken nahmen die gescheiterte Christianisierung durch die Missionare Liudger und Willehad wieder auf. Ostfriesland wurde zu einem Teil dem Bistum Bremen, zum anderen dem Bistum Münster zugeschlagen. Es entstand eine Klosterlandschaft an der niederländischen und deutschen Nordseeküste mit einem Höhepunkt im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert. Insgesamt lassen sich von Westfriesland über Groningen bis Ostfriesland etwa 120 Gründungen der verschiedenen Orden nachweisen.

Zum Dank dafür nahm das Krokodil den Jungen auf lange Reisen über das Meer mit. Als das Krokodil starb, wurde aus seinem Körper die Insel Timor, die von den Nachkommen des Jungen besiedelt wurde. Noch heute hat das Krokodil in Osttimor große symbolische Bedeutung. Traditionell wird es als „Großvater“ bezeichnet und es gibt den Brauch, beim Überqueren von Flüssen „Krokodil, ich bin Dein Enkel – friss mich nicht“ zu rufen., Vor der Kolonialzeit., Hintergrund., Die Küstenlinie der südostasiatischen Inselwelt veränderte sich im Laufe der Jahrtausende erheblich, was einen Einfluss auf mögliche Besiedlungen durch Einwanderer hatte. Stieg der Meeresspiegel vor etwa 70.000 Jahren stark an, sank er vor ungefähr 30.000 Jahren während des Letzteiszeitlichen Maximums. Vor zirka 18.000 Jahren stieg der Meeresspiegel erneut und Landmassen, wie Sundaland und Sahul wurden wieder durch das Wasser zerteilt. Weitere starke Veränderungen der Küstenlinie fanden vor 14.500, 11.500 und 7.500 Jahren statt und schufen so die heutige Inselwelt und den von Asien getrennten Kontinent Australien. Trotz dieser wechselhaften Veränderung der Geographie blieb Timor die ganze Zeit über eine Insel ohne eine Landverbindung zum Rest der Welt. Nur die zu überwindenden Distanzen schrumpften zeitweise erheblich., Die Bevölkerung Timors kam im Rahmen der allgemeinen Besiedlung der Region auf die Insel. Anthropologen gehen davon aus, dass die Nachkommen von mindestens drei Einwanderungswellen hier leben, wodurch auch die ethnisch-kulturelle Vielfalt Timors zu erklären ist. Interessanterweise bezeichnen sich alle Volksgruppen auf Timor als Einwanderer, die ursprünglich von woanders auf die Insel zogen. Je früher die Einwanderung den Mythen nach erfolgte, desto höher war der Status in den traditionellen Machtstrukturen auf Timor., Die timoresischen Völker kannten ursprünglich keine Schrift. Daher gibt es keine schriftlichen Überlieferungen von der Geschichte vor der europäischen Kolonisation. Dafür existiert eine reiche Tradition an mündlichen Überlieferungen, wie etwa beim Volk der Bunak im Zentrum der Insel. Die Geschichten wurden in wiederkehrenden Reimen und Alliterationen rezitiert. In jedem Dorf brachten die Alten den Jungen die Legenden des Clans bei, aber es gibt auch die Lian Nain (in etwa \\"Herr der Wörter\\"), Barden und zeremonielle Würdenträger, die stundenlang Verse rezitieren können. Meistens werden Verse aus zwei Zeilen verwendet, bei denen jede Zeile aus zwei Sätzen besteht. Der erste Satz der zweiten Zeile wiederholt dabei in anderen Wörtern den Inhalt des letzten Satzes der ersten Zeile. Die Sprachen sind reich an Metaphern und Symbolen aus der animistischen Kultur Timors. Legenden, wie der Schöpfungsmythos um das Krokodil, wurden außerdem bildlich dargestellt und dekorativ verwendet., Es ist teilweise nicht einfach, das einheimische Wissen über die Geschichte zu sammeln. In Oe-Cusse Ambeno gibt es traditionelle Einschränkungen zur Weitergabe geschichtlichen Wissens. Dies ist meist nur zwei oder drei Personen in jedem Dorf gestattet. Dabei dürfen sie aber nur über die Geschichte des eigenen Dorfes berichten, über die Historie anderer Dörfer darf man nichts erzählen, sofern diese überhaupt bekannt ist. Noch heute verlassen viele Einwohner Oe-Cusse Ambenos ihr Dorf fast ihr ganzes Leben nicht und kennen bestenfalls die Nachbardörfer. Folge ist auch, dass die Angaben oftmals von Dorf zu Dorf einander widersprechen. Über zwei bestimmte Dörfer in der Gemeinde darf überhaupt keine Auskunft über die Vergangenheit gegeben werden. Darüber herrscht ein Tabu. Will man Informationen über die Geschichte des hiesigen Reiches erfahren, gibt es nur wenige, die darüber Auskunft geben dürfen., Die ersten Siedler., Die ältesten Spuren menschlicher Besiedlung auf Timor sind Stand 2017 zwischen 43.000 und 44.000 Jahre alt. Sie wurden in der Höhle Laili bei Laleia (Gemeinde Manatuto) entdeckt. 2006 wurden bereits in der Kalksteinhöhle Jerimalai nahe Tutuala im äußersten Osten Timors 42.000 Jahre alte Spuren gefunden. Neben Steinwerkzeugen und Muschelschalen, die als Schmuck verwendet wurden, fand man die Überreste von Schildkröten, Thunfischen und Riesenratten, die den Höhlenbewohnern als Nahrung gedient hatten. Diese Funde erhärten die Theorie, dass die Besiedlung Australiens über die Kleinen Sundainseln erfolgte. Von dieser Besiedlungswelle scheinen keine Spuren mehr in der heutigen Bevölkerung Timors zu existieren. Die Überreste der Fische stammen zur Hälfte von Arten, die nur in der Hochsee leben. Dies belegt erstmals, dass Menschen bereits vor 42.000 Jahren weitab der Küste auf Fischfang gehen konnten. Zudem fand man einen etwa vier Zentimeter langen Angelhaken, der aus einer Schale einer Meeresschnecke hergestellt wurde. Er wird auf ein Alter zwischen 16.000 und 23.000 Jahre geschätzt und ist damit der älteste bekannte Angelhaken der Welt. Der Haken diente zum Fang von Fischen in den Küstengewässern, die zu dieser Zeit durch die Bildung der Korallenriffe fischreicher wurden. 38.000 bis 42.000 Jahre alt sind kleine Plättchen mit gebohrten Löchern aus der Schale des Gemeinen Perlboots \\"(Nautilus pompilius)\\", die ältesten bekannten Schmuckstücke Ostasiens und des pazifischen Raums., In Matja Kuru wurde ein 35.000 Jahre altes Knochenstück gefunden, das zur Befestigung von Harpunenspitzen am hölzernen Schaft diente. Es ist der älteste Nachweis dieser komplexen Bindungstechnik, die zwar in ganz Australien und Melanesien bekannt ist, deren älteste Zeugnisse bisher allerdings nur wenige hundert Jahre alt waren., Auch in anderen Höhlen nahe Tutuala wurden Archäologen fündig. Besiedlungsreste fanden sich in der Höhle Lene Hara, die auf 41.000 bis 43.000 Jahre datiert wurden. Die mehrfarbigen Wandmalereien, die Boote, Tiere und geometrische Strukturen zeigen, sind nur 2000 Jahre alt. Auf 5000 Jahre werden die Malereien in den Höhlen \\"O Hi\\" und Ile Kére Kére geschätzt, die Steingravuren, die Gesichter zeigen, sogar auf 10.000 Jahre. Weitere Felsmalereien finden sich an den Steilküsten von Tutuala und \\"Tunu Taraleu\\", in Lene Kici, Lene Cécé und Vérulu (alle nahe Tutuala), in Uai Bobo (in Venilale, Gemeinde Baucau), Lie Siri, Lie Kere, Lie Kere 2 und Lie Baai (auf dem Hochplateau von Baucau) und in der Region von Baguia (ebenfalls Gemeinde Baucau)., Man unterscheidet bei den Felsmalereien grundsätzlich zwei Zonen: Jene vom Plateau von Baucau und jene in der Umgebung von Tutuala. Pigmente in Schwarz, Rot, Gelb und Grün werden für vielfältige Motive verwendet: Linien und geometrische Figuren, strahlenumkränzte Kreise (bezeichnet als Sonnen oder Sterne), naturgetreue und Bilder im Röntgenstil von Tieren, Menschen, Anthropomorphe und Boote. Die meisten Bilder werden aber der neolithischen „austronesischen Maltradition“ (Austronesian Painting Tradition APT) zugerechnet. Auf dem nordöstlich gelegenen Kisar gibt es Wandmalereien, die zum Teil auffällige Ähnlichkeiten zu Malereien an der Ostspitze Timor zeigen. Sie sind mehr als 2500 Jahre alt und lassen auf enge Kontakte zwischen den beiden Inseln bereits zu dieser Zeit schließen., Daneben sind auch einige Handumrisse bekannt, bei denen der Künstler seine Hand als Schablone auf den Felsen drückte und Farbpigmente darüber pustete. Solche Handabdrücke sind hier seltener als in benachbarten Regionen zu finden, was als besonderes Merkmal der Felsmalereien auf Timor gilt, im Vergleich zu den anderen Inseln Südostasien. Die Archäologin Sue O’Connor gruppierte Handschablonen neben einfachen rot-figurativen, ausgefüllten Motiven in einer Reihe von Bildnissen, die sich aufgrund ihrer Lage in tieferen, aber zugänglichen Höhlenteilen von der APT unterscheiden. Bis 2020 fehlten aber Hinweise, dass diese Bilder aus einer anderen Zeitepoche stammten. Dann wurden von der Höhle Lene Hara erstmals Handumrisse beschrieben, die wahrscheinlich aus dem Pleistozän stammen. Sie ähneln Bildnissen in Australien und unterstützen auch vom geschätzten Alter her die Theorie der Besiedlungsroute Australiens über Timor., Auffällig ist das weitgehende Fehlen von Motiven großer Tiere, wie sie sost bei Felskunst aus dem Pleistozän oft vorkommt. Dies lässt sich damit erklären, dass Großtiere in der Fauna Timors weitgehend fehlen. Die hier ansässige Zwergform eines Stegodons starb deutlich vor der Ankunft der ersten Menschen auf der Insel aus., Die australo-melanesische Einwanderung., Man vermutet, dass \\"australo-melanesische Völker\\" (auch \\"vedo-austronesisch\\" genannt) etwa 40.000 bis 20.000 v. Chr., während der letzten Eiszeit, vom Norden und Westen her Timor erreichten. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt waren die Großen Sundainseln durch Landbrücken mit dem asiatischen Kontinent verbunden und der Weg über das Meer bis Timor deutlich kürzer. Ihre Nachkommen, die Atoin Meto \\"(Atoni)\\", repräsentieren wahrscheinlich die ursprüngliche Bevölkerung Timors und zeichnen sich durch eine sehr dunkle Hautfarbe und glatte, schwarze Haare aus. Sie stellen die Bevölkerungsmehrheit im Westen der Insel, auch in der osttimoresischen Exklave Oe-Cusse Ambeno., Gen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Geschichte Osttimors, Portugiesisch-Timor, Fremdherrschaft, indonesische Okkupation, Unabhängigkeit, innere Konflikte, Rebellenbewegung, Aufschwung, politische Auseinandersetzungen, Naturkatastrophe, COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geschichte Osttirols], Der Name Osttirol ist zwar bereits ab der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts bezeugt, gebräuchlich wurde diese Bezeichnung für den österreichischen politischen Bezirk Lienz (Osttirol) aber erst, nachdem Südtirol 1919 Italien zugeschlagen wurde. Osttirol liegt dadurch abgetrennt von Nordtirol zwischen Salzburg im Norden, Südtirol im Westen, der italienischen Region Venetien im Süden und Kärnten im Osten., Urgeschichte., Der älteste Beweis für die Anwesenheit von Menschen in Osttirol wurde im Jahre 1987 am sogenannten Hirschbichl im Defereggental auf 2143 Metern Seehöhe entdeckt. Unter den Artefakten fanden sich eine Geschossspitze aus Bergkristall und kleine Klingen aus Feuerstein, die auf einen saisonalen Jägerrastplatz mesolithischer Jäger aus dem 7. bis 6. Jahrtausend v. Chr. hindeuten., Mit der Jungsteinzeit (Neolithikum, 6. bis 3. Jahrtausend v. Chr.) setzten sich auch in Osttirol Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie Töpferei und Hausbau durch. Der wichtigste Fund dieser Zeit, ein Steinbeil aus Serpentin, stammt aus dem 5. Jahrtausend v. Chr. und wurde am Schlossberg von Lienz gefunden, später jedoch aus dem Schloss Bruck gestohlen. Weitere Funde (Keramiken) auf dem Breitegg (Nußdorf-Debant), Burg (Obermauern) und am Lavanter Kirchenbichl weisen auf neolithische Siedler hin. Von besonderer Bedeutung ist auch das Abri Gradonna bei Kals am Großglockner, das vermutlich als Kult- und Opferplatz diente. Hier wurden die ältesten Keramiken Osttirols (Gefäße mit quadratischen Öffnungen) sowie Feuersteine gefunden., Bronzezeit., Nach einer kurzen Kupfer-Übergangszeit löste mit der frühen und mittleren Bronzezeit (ca. 22. bis 13. Jahrhundert v. Chr.) die Bronze den Stein als bestimmenden Werkstoff ab. Das in Osttirol verwendete Erz dürfte dabei insbesondere aus dem oberen Iseltal stammen. Es wurde zunächst im Tagebau, später auch im Untertagebau abgebaut. Gegossen in Barren und als Ösenhalsringe wurde das Metall danach in den Handel gebracht oder diente als prämonetäres Zahlungsmittel. Metallene Einzelfunde dieser Periode stammen vor allem aus der Umgebung von Virgen. Zahlreicher sind Keramiken, die unter anderem am Lienzer Schlossberg, in Matrei (Klaunzerberg), Heinfels (Burghügel), Strassen (Jakobibichl) und Lavant (Kirchbichl) gefunden wurden. Planmäßige Siedlungsgrabungen und Gräberfunde aus dieser Zeit fehlen jedoch., In der späten Bronzezeit war der Osttiroler Raum von einer weitgehend einheitlichen Kultur geprägt, die ihre Toten in Urnen beisetzte (Urnenfelderkultur). Die Verbreitung der sogenannten Melauner- oder Laugner Kultur erstreckte sich dabei vom Alpenrheintal über Tirol bis ins Kärntner Drautal. In Osttirol konnte man Siedlungsschwerpunkte insbesondere durch Keramikfunde im bereits während der Steinzeit besiedelten Gebiet nachweisen. Prunkstücke sind eine steinerne Mehrfachgussform für Sicheln und Beile aus Virgen und ein Dreiwulstschwert aus Assling. Gräberfunde fehlen jedoch auch aus dieser Periode., Eisenzeit., Mit der zweiten Hälfte des 8. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. begann auch in Osttirol die ältere Eisenzeit, die auf Grund des Hauptfundortes auch Hallstattzeit genannt wird. Diese Periode war vor allem von der verstärkten Verwendung des Eisens geprägt, das zuvor kaum verwendet worden war. Sind aus der älteren Hallstattzeit nur wenige Streufunde aus dem oberen Iseltal bekannt, so wurde in Welzelach bei Virgen ein ganzes Gräberfeld aus der jüngeren Hallstattzeit entdeckt. Zwischen 1889 und 1891 legte Alexander Schernthanner hier 56 Steinkistengräber frei, die auch Waffen, Schmuck, Bernsteinperlen und einen figural verzierten Bronzeblecheimer enthielten. Weitere Siedlungs-, Grab- und Streufunde wurden im gesamten Bezirk gemacht, haben jedoch ihren Schwerpunkt im Virgental., Während der folgenden, jüngeren Eisenzeit (La-Tène-Zeit) war Osttirol von der Fritzens-Sanzeno-Kultur der Räter geprägt, die sich im Raume Alttirols um 500 v. Chr. auf großteils heimischer Grundlage entwickelte. Kennzeichen sind unter anderem die typische Hausform (eingetiefte Häuser mit winkeligen Zugängen) und die typische Keramik mit seicht eingestrichenen oder gestempelten Mustern., Etwa um 100 v. Chr. fiel der Osttiroler Raum an die Kelten (Laianken). Diese Periode dauerte jedoch nur kurz, da dieses Gebiet bereits ca. 15 v. Chr. friedlich an das Römische Reich fiel., Römerzeit., Ausbreitung der römischen Herrschaft., Angelockt von den zahlreichen Metallen der Tauern wie Gold, Bleiglanz, Antimon und Kupfer traten die Römer bereits früh in Osttirol auf. Um sich den Zugriff auf diese Bodenschätze zu sichern und das oberitalienische Gebiet vor Einfällen anderer Stämme zu schützen, schlossen die Römer in der ersten Hälfte des 2. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. einen staatlichen Freundschaftsvertrag (hospitium publicum) mit dem Königreich Noricum. Dieses keltische Königreich war zu dieser Zeit ein lockerer Stammesbund unter mehreren Kleinkönigen. Als Drusus und Tiberius 16/15 v. Chr. den Alpenraum in meist blutigen Feldzügen eroberten, dürfte Noricum davon nur wenig berührt worden sein. Vielmehr ging es unter Kaiser Claudius um 50 n. Chr. friedlich in der römischen Provinz Noricum auf., Das Interesse der Römer an den reichen Metalllagerstätten brachte auch der einheimischen Bevölkerung Wohlstand, gleichzeitig wurde sie jedoch einer straff organisierten Romanisierung unterzogen. Nahelegen dies die zwar nicht schlagartig, jedoch rapide abnehmenden Ausgrabungsfunde der keltischen Kultur nach der Machtübernahme der Römer. Dominierendes Zentrum Osttirols während der Römerzeit wurde die Stadt Aguntum mit ihrem Hinterland. Dieses Hinterland entsprach dabei in etwa dem heutigen Osttirol und dem Pustertal mit seinen Nebentälern. Das Einflussgebiet der Stadt reichte dabei im Norden bis zum Felber Tauern, im Osten bis zum Kärntner Tor, im Westen bis Mühlbachl (Pustertal) und im Süden bis zu den Übergängen zum Gailtal, Kreuzbergsattel und Enneberg., Aguntum., Durch das Auftreten der Römer verloren die zuvor angelegten Höhensiedlungen wie etwa der Lavanter Kirchbichl oder der Matreier Klaunzerberg an Bedeutung. Aguntum entstand vielmehr am hochwassergefährdeten Talgrund eines Beckens insbesondere aus verkehrsgeographischen Gesichtspunkten. Durch die Lage am Kreuzungspunkt der Drautalstraße mit der Straße über den Iselberg profitierte Aguntum vom Metallhandel aus dem Tauern- und Glocknergebiet sowie vom Kupferhandel aus dem inneren Iseltal und seinen Nebentälern, dem Virgen- und Defereggental. Dennoch sprechen Gegebenheiten wie ein unregelmäßiges, nicht rechtwinkeliges Straßensystem für eine Vorgängersiedlung auf dem Stadtgebiet Aguntums. Die Blütezeit der Stadt dürfte während des 1. und 2. Jahrhunderts gewesen sein. Sie erhielt das claudische Stadtrecht. Zahlreiche Ausgrabungen wie die Stadtmauer, ein Atriumhaus und ein \\"Prunkbau\\" zeugen noch heute vom Reichtum der Stadt. Obwohl durch die Stadt im 3. Jahrhundert mehrfach germanische Scharen gezogen waren, erholte sich die Stadt wieder von den Zerstörungen. Dennoch zog sich die Bevölkerung ab dem 3. Jahrhundert und insbesondere im frühen 4. Jahrhundert immer mehr aus den Tälern in die Höhensiedlungen zurück und verlieh ihnen damit einen Entwicklungsschub. Vor allem die Bergsiedlung in Lavant blühte nach einer 200-jährigen Pause im 3. Jahrhundert n. Chr. auf. 400/406 wurde Aguntum jedoch schließlich schwerst beschädigt und 610 bei einer großen Schlacht zwischen den Baiern und den Slawen von Grund auf zerstört., Sonstige Siedlungsschwerpunkte., Neben dem römischen Zentrum von Aguntum waren während der Römerzeit auch zahlreiche andere Siedlungen im Lienzer Becken besiedelt. So waren besonders die gegen Süden geneigten Hänge wie in Grafendorf, Oberdrum, Thurn und Oberlienz von Villae rusticae und vornehmen Wohnhäusern besiedelt. Weitere Siedlungsschwerpunkte finden sich in Matrei und Umgebung, das als Ausgangspunkt für das kupferreiche Virgental galt und als Kreuzungspunkt mit dem Saumweg über den Felber Tauern eine Rolle spielte. Auch in Kals lassen sich römische Funde nachweisen, wobei hier ebenfalls Tauernübergänge geografisch wichtig waren. Weitere Funde sind vom Mortbichl in der Gemeinde Bannberg und Tristach bekannt, wogegen von Lienz ostwärts bis zum Kärntner Tor archäologische Fundstätten aus der Römerzeit rar sind. Durch den Niedergang Aguntums erlangte ab dem 3. Jahrhundert auch die Siedlung am Lavanter Kirchbichl wieder steigende Bedeutung. Sie war nur durch ihre Lage am schwer zugänglichen Hügel geschützt und war ein Zentrum der Eisen- und Metallverarbeitung. Auch zwei frühchristliche Kirchen befanden sich hier. Die dortige, meist bäuerliche Bevölkerung lebte vor allem von der Viehzucht und ergänzte ihren Speiseplan durch Fischfang und Jagd. Der Wohlstand der Bevölkerung spiegelt sich insbesondere in den zahlreichen Funden von importierten Gläsern, Glasperlen sowie Schmuck und Gerätschaften wider. Um 610 wurde auch diese Siedlung im Krieg zwischen den Baiern und Slawen großflächig zerstört, verlor aber nicht ganz ihre Bedeutung., Mittelalter., Völkerwanderung., Ab dem 5. Jahrhundert drangen germanische und slawische Völker auf breiter Front in die römischen Provinzen ein (siehe vor allem Spätantike). Im 6. Jahrhundert drangen von Norden her auch die Baiern in Tirol ein und stießen bis ins Pustertal vor. Als jedoch die Slawen von den Awaren bedroht wurden, stießen diese immer weiter nach Westen vor und besiedelten das Drau- und Iseltal. Den Baiern wurde somit der weitere Weg nach Osten versperrt. Im 8. Jahrhundert geriet jedoch das slawische Karantanien, das eine wesentlich größere Ausdehnung als das heutige Kärnten hatte, an das Herzogtum Bayern und wurde von bairischen Kolonisten besiedelt. Auch das Christentum wurde nun in diesen Gebieten verbreitet. Die Romanen im Pustertal sowie die Slawen und Romanen im Drau- und Iseltal assimilierten sich kulturell allmählich, ihre Sprachen starben vermutlich im Hochmittelalter aus., Christianisierung., Baiernherzog Tassilo III. schenkte 769 dem Abt von Scharnitz einen Gebietsstreifen im mittleren Pustertal mit dem Auftrag, die Slawen zu missionieren. Dieser gründete daraufhin das Kloster Innichen, das jedoch bald dem Hochstift Freising überlassen wurde. Daneben versuchten zwei weitere Bistümer ihren Einfluss in: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Geschichte Osttirols, Osttirol, Bezirk Lienz, Südtirol, Venetien, Kärnten, Urgeschichte, Jungsteinzeit, Bronzezeit, Eisenzeit, Römerzeit."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Deutsche Ortsgeschichte, Hanse, Rostocker Geschichte], Die Geschichte Rostocks ist stark von der geografischen Lage der Stadt an der Unterwarnow nahe der Mündung in die Ostsee geprägt. Um 1165 als \\"Rozstoc\\" erstmals erwähnt, war bereits früher dort ein slawischer Handelsplatz in ein überregionales Seehandelsnetz eingebunden. Ab dem späten 12. Jahrhundert entwickelte sich eine deutsche Siedlung, der 1218 das lübische Stadtrecht bestätigt wurde und die rasch wuchs, so dass bald drei selbstständige Teilstädte existierten, die sich in den Jahren 1262 bis 1265 vereinigten. Rostock wurde zum Zentrum der Herrschaft Rostock und war seit Mitte des 13. Jahrhunderts Mitglied der Hanse. Während der Blüte der Hansestadt, die ihren Höhepunkt im 15. Jahrhundert erreichte, wurden repräsentative Profan- und Kirchenbauten im Stil der Backsteingotik errichtet und 1419 die Universität gegründet. Als mecklenburgische Landesstadt, der nie der Schritt zur Freien Stadt gelang, ist die Geschichte Rostocks von einem ständigen Gegen- und Miteinander mit den mecklenburgischen Herzögen geprägt. Dabei standen vor allem die wirtschaftlichen Interessen der Stadt den politischen und militärischen der Landesherren gegenüber. 1531 führte der Rat der Stadt offiziell die Reformation ein., Mit dem Niedergang der Hanse, dem Dreißigjährigen Krieg und einem Stadtbrand im Jahre 1677 sank Rostock in die Rolle einer Provinzstadt zurück, blieb jedoch das geistige und wirtschaftliche Zentrum Mecklenburgs. Die Industrialisierung setzte in Rostock relativ spät ein. In der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus wurden Rostock und Warnemünde ab Mitte der 1930er Jahre mit den Heinkel- und Arado Flugzeugwerken zu Zentren der Rüstungsindustrie und in dieser Folge auch erste Ziele des Luftkriegs im Zweiten Weltkrieg, der die Stadt schwer in Mitleidenschaft zog. In der DDR war Rostock Bezirksstadt und wurde systematisch ausgebaut. Seit der Deutschen Wiedervereinigung ist Rostock mit über 208.000 Einwohnern (2018) größte Stadt des Bundeslandes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern und als eines der vier Oberzentren des Landes mehr als doppelt so groß wie die Landeshauptstadt Schwerin. Im Jahr 2018 feierte die Stadt ihr 800-jähriges Jubiläum, im Jahr 2019 das 600-jährige Bestehen der Universität., Name., Die slawischen Kyzziner vom Stammesverband der Wilzen hatten um 600 dort Siedlungen. Sie nannten das Auseinanderfließen der Warnow \\"rastokŭ\\". Dieser altpolabische Name lässt sich übersetzen in \\"auseinander\\" für \\"roz\\" und \\"Fluss\\" für \\"tok\\"., Der Name hat sich im Laufe der Jahrhunderte nur leicht verändert; um 1165 wurde erstmals \\"Rozstoc\\" erwähnt. Die Burg wurde 1171 Urbs \\"Rozstoc\\", das Castrum 1182 \\"Rostoch\\" genannt. Weitere Varianten: 1189: \\"Rotstoc\\" und \\"Rotstoch\\", 1218 \\"Rozstoc\\", 1219 \\"Roztoc\\", 1240 \\"Rostok\\" und um 1366 schließlich \\"Rostock\\". Dort wo die Warnow, früher Varnowa in die Ostsee mündet, liegt folgerichtig Warnemünde. \\"Varna\\" bzw. \\"varn\\" bedeutet \\"Krähe\\", bzw. \\"Rabe\\"., Historisch wurde Rostock auch bei seinen gräzisierten oder latinisierten Namen genannt: \\"Rhodopolis\\" bzw. \\"Rostochium\\"., Ab 1990 trug die Stadt den Namenszusatz \\"Hansestadt\\". Am 18. März 2016 wurde durch das Innenministerium Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns der Namenszusatz \\"Hanse- und Universitätsstadt\\" genehmigt. Laut Beschluss der Bürgerschaft führt Rostock diesen Namenszusatz ab dem 1.Januar 2018., Mittelalter., Vor- und Frühgeschichte., Die Vorgeschichte Mecklenburgs ist bis zur Mitte des ersten Jahrtausends unserer Zeit durch germanische Besiedlung geprägt. Im Zuge der Völkerwanderung wanderten etwa ab dem 6. und 7. Jahrhundert slawische Stämme in den südlichen Ostseeraum, das Gebiet um die Unterwarnow bevölkerten die Kessiner. Rechts der Warnow, zwischen dem heutigen Dierkow und Gehlsdorf, sind ab dem 8. Jahrhundert Handwerker- und Handelsplätze archäologisch belegt. Neben zahlreichen Funden handwerklicher Erzeugnisse hat man Reste von Block- und Flechtwerkhäusern gefunden, die bis zu acht Metern lang und ähnlich breit waren. Aus Skandinavien sowie dem fränkischen Raum und der Eifel stammende Gegenstände beweisen, dass die Dierkower Siedlung ein (See-)Handelsort von überregionaler Bedeutung gewesen sein muss., Slawische Fürstenburg und Heinrich der Löwe., Spätestens im 12. Jahrhundert existierte in den Niederungen des rechten Warnowufers eine slawische Fürstenburg der zum Stamm der Liutizen gehörenden Kessiner mit einer frühstädtischen Marktsiedlung. Noch in Quellen des 13. Jahrhunderts wurde dieser Handwerker- und Handelsplatz als \\"Wendische Wik\\" bezeichnet., Die wohl früheste überlieferte Erwähnung Rostocks findet sich in der isländischen Knýtlinga-Saga (um 1260), in der von der Landung Knuts des Großen (994/995–1035) bei \\"Raudstokk\\" berichtet wird, womit allerdings auch die Odermündung gemeint sein könnte., Als erster sicherer Beleg Rostocks gilt daneben die Chronik Gesta Danorum des Dänen Saxo Grammaticus (um 1200). Andere frühe Chroniken sind die Slawenchroniken von Helmold von Bosau (um 1170) und von Arnold von Lübeck (um 1210)., Saxo Grammaticus berichtet, wie 1160 der Abodritenfürst Niklot im Abwehrkampf gegen den Sachsenherzog Heinrich den Löwen südlich von Rostock bei der Burg Werle fiel. Niklots Söhne Pribislaw und Wertislaw wurden zeitweise aus dem Abodritenland vertrieben. Im folgenden Jahr zerstörte der mit den Sachsen verbündete dänische König WaldemarI. die slawische Fürstenburg Rostock \\"(urbs roztoc)\\"., 1167 unterwarf sich Pribislaw Heinrich dem Löwen und wurde daraufhin von ihm mit einem großen Teil Westmecklenburgs belehnt, jedoch ohne die Grafschaft Schwerin. So konnte er einen beträchtlichen Teil der Herrschaft seines Vaters zurück erlangen und errichtete um 1170 die Burgen Mecklenburg, Ilow und Rostock neu. Allmählich entwickelte sich Rostock zu einem zweiten Schwerpunkt des Landes Mecklenburg neben der nahegelegenen Burg Kessin., Nach einer gemeinsamen Pilgerfahrt von Heinrich und Pribislaw 1172 nach Jerusalem vermählte Heinrich eine seiner Töchter mit Pribislaws Sohn BorwinI. (1178–1227)., Während Pribislaw seine Herrschaft durch ein hohes Maß an Weitsicht sicherte, entwickelte sich später zwischen seinem Sohn BorwinI. und NikolausI., dem Sohn Wertislaws, ein Konflikt um die Herrschaftsnachfolge, die bis zum offenen Krieg führte. Ein Siegel aus dieser Zeit zeigt Nikolaus als Fürsten von Rostock \\"(nicolaus de roztoc)\\", als reitenden Krieger mit Schwert., Deutsche Siedlung und Stadtwerdung., Nachdem 1160/61 die Fürstenburg Rostock zerstört worden war, wurden die Burg und ein Handwerkerwiek wahrscheinlich rechts der Warnow wieder aufgebaut. Noch im 12. Jahrhundert hatten sich aber auch auf dem hochgelegenen linken Warnowufer Handwerker und Kaufleute niedergelassen, darunter Holsteiner, Sachsen, Westfalen, Dänen und Slawen. Diese Siedlung auf dem Hügel um die spätere Petrikirche und den Alten Markt bildete den Ausgangspunkt der Stadtwerdung Rostocks. Die erste urkundliche Erwähnung Rostocks stammt von 1189, als Nikolaus den Mönchen des 1186 gegründeten Klosters Doberan Zollfreiheit auf dem Rostocker Markt gewährte. Die Erwähnung einer Clemens-Kirche mit deutschem Priester weist dabei auf die Christianisierung der Siedlung hin., Nach der Bestätigung des lübischen Stadtrechts durch Heinrich Borwin I. vom 24. Juni 1218 folgte eine Erweiterung der Siedlung nach Süden mit der Nikolaikirche als Mittelpunkt. 1232 wird die Marienkirche erstmals urkundlich als Pfarrkirche einer selbstständigen Siedlung erwähnt, die sich westlich, jenseits eines Warnowzuflusses („Grube“), an die ältere Stadt anschloss und über einen eigenen Markt und ein Rathaus verfügte. Nach einer neuerlichen Ausdehnung in Richtung Westen über die „Faule Grube“ als weitere natürliche Begrenzung entstand um 1252 die Neustadt als dritte eigenständige Siedlung, deren Mittelpunkt die Jakobikirche war. Von 1262 bis 1265 vereinigten sich die Siedlungen. Der mittlere Siedlungskern wurde zum Verwaltungszentrum der Stadt, in dem der Stadtrat und das Gericht ihren Sitz hatten und das Rathaus nach Lübecker Vorbild erbaut wurde., Während die „Wendische Wyk“ ihren Niedergang erlebte und Fürst Nikolaus das Kind seinen Besitz rechts der Warnow 1286 an die Stadt verkaufte, die an der aufgelassenen Burgstelle eine Ziegelei einrichtete, wuchs der städtische Bereich auf der linken Warnowseite bis zur Mitte des 13. Jahrhunderts so rasant an, dass der beanspruchte Raum bis in das frühe 19. Jahrhundert nicht mehr erweitert werden musste., Auch die beiden Stadtbrände von 1250 und 1265 konnten diesen Aufschwung nicht bremsen. Gestärkt wurde die Stellung Rostocks durch den Erwerb von Rechten, wie das Fischereirecht auf der Unterwarnow, und den Kauf der Rostocker Heide, die als riesiger Stadtforst den enormen Holzbedarf deckte und Platz für die umfängliche Schweinemast Rostocks bot., Gleichzeitig entwickelte sich die Stadt zum Zentrum der Herrschaft Rostock. Die Straßennamen „Amberg“ an der Petrikirche und „Burgwall“ bei der Marienkirche scheinen darauf hinzuweisen, dass befestigte landesherrliche Höfe in der Stadt angelegt wurden. Die dänische Lehnshoheit über Mecklenburg, die WaldemarII. 1214 Kaiser FriedrichII. abgerungen hatte, endete 1227 nach der Schlacht bei Bornhöved und dem Tod Heinrich BorwinsII. 1229 wurde das Land durch die mecklenburgische Hauptlandesteilung unter dessen Söhnen aufgeteilt und Heinrich BorwinIII. wurde Territorialherr über die Herrschaft Rostock., Der rasche Aufstieg Rostocks zur bedeutendsten Stadt Mecklenburgs ging im 13. Jahrhundert mit dem Schwinden der Landes- und Stadtherrschaft der Herren von Rostock einher, während gleichzeitig im Deutschen Reich die Macht des Königs zur Zeit des Interregnums 1254–1273 auf einem Tiefpunkt angelangt war. Der Vogt verlor zunehmend an Einfluss gegenüber dem Stadtrat, der aus einem exklusiven Kreis ratsfähiger Geschlechter der wohlhabenden Kaufmannschaft gebildet wurde. Ab 1289 sind Bürgermeister nachweisbar., Während die Burgwälle der landesherrlichen Burgen in und um Rostock abgetragen wurden, errichtete Rostock eine sieben Meter hohe und bis zu einem Meter breite steinerne Stadtmauer, die eine Fläche von ungefähr 1km² umschloss. In drei Metern Höhe konnten, falls erforderlich, hölzerne Wehrgänge angelegt werden. Zur Stadtbefestigung gehörten 22 Stadttore, von denen heute noch das Steintor, das Kröpeliner Tor, das Mönchent: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Deutsche Ortsgeschichte, Hanse, Rostocker Geschichte, geografische Lage, Unterwarnow, Ostsee, Slawischer Handelsplatz, lübisches Stadtrecht, Teilstädte, Backsteingotik"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Deutsche Ortsgeschichte, Frankfurt-Höchst, Geschichte (Rhein-Main), Geschichte von Frankfurt am Main], Die Stadt Höchst am Main, heute der Frankfurter Stadtteil Höchst, hat eine über zwölfhundertjährige Geschichte. Lange Zeit war Höchst eine eigenständige Stadt und Vorposten des Kurmainzer Gebiets vor den Toren Frankfurts. Erst 1928 erfolgte die Eingemeindung nach Frankfurt., Geografische Einordnung., Höchst entstand an der Kreuzung frühgeschichtlicher Verkehrswege. Unmittelbar nach der Mündung der Nidda in den Main, zweier damals schiffbarer Flüsse, schiebt sich eine Hangkante fast bis ans Flussufer heran. Das Plateau ist hochwassersicher und war gut zu verteidigen. Am Fuße des Hangs führte eine Furt durch den Main, oben verlief eine vorrömische Altstraße, die Antsanvia oder Hohe Straße, ein Vorläufer der späteren Elisabethenstraße, die von der Mainmündung bei Kastel über Höchst bis in den Vogelsberg führte. Ausgehend von der Niddamündung strebte der Lindenweg (auch \\"Linienweg\\" genannt), eine vor-römische, geradlinige Verbindung über den Taunus-Übergang bei der heutigen Saalburg ins Lahngebiet. Nördlich von Sossenheim zweigte von diesem die alte Handelsstraße, die hessische Weinstraße (Wagenstraße) in die Wetterau ab., Vor- und Frühgeschichte., Einzelne Funde von Werkzeugen und von bearbeiteten Geweihstücken vom Ende des Jungpaläolithikums im Bereich der Höchster Altstadt lassen den Schluss zu, dass das Höchster Gebiet zu dieser Zeit bereits gelegentlich von Menschen bewohnt war. Eine dauerhafte Besiedelung ist jedoch nicht nachweisbar., Erst mit Beginn der Jungsteinzeit lässt sich eine ständige menschliche Ansiedelung im Raum der Altstadt, der Höchster Neustadt und des Oberfeldes feststellen. Bei Bauarbeiten und Ausgrabungen wurden Siedlungsreste und Gefäßscherben aus der Bandkeramikzeit und der Glockenbecherkultur gefunden., Hügelgräber und Urnenfelder aus der Bronzezeit geben Aufschluss über eine fortdauernde menschliche Besiedlung des Höchster Raums. Ebenfalls bei Bauarbeiten gefunden wurden eisenzeitliche Gräber aus der Hallstatt- und La-Tène-Zeit, die auf keltische Bewohner hinweisen. Ein Oppidum lässt sich jedoch nicht nachweisen, wie auch noch von keiner festen Ortsstruktur im Sinne eines Dorfes ausgegangen werden kann., Römische und vorfränkische Zeit., Kurz nach der Zeitenwende errichteten die Römer auf dem Hochufer über dem Main ein Kastell. Nicht genau nachgewiesen, aber möglich ist, dass in Höhe der Wörthspitze bei der Niddamündung eine Brücke den flachen Main überspannte und die römische Ansiedlung mit den südmainischen Gebieten um die heutigen Orte Kelsterbach und Groß-Gerau verband., Die Römer bauten bestehende keltische Altstraßen aus und legten zahlreiche neue Verbindungen an: Zur Saalburg bzw. dem dortigen Taunus-Übergang den \\"Linden-\\" oder \\"Linienweg\\", über diesen nach dem Elisabethenstraßen-Übergang zur Wetterau die \\"Weinstrasse\\", auf der Wasserscheide Main / Nidda die \\"Hohe Straße\\" zum Vogelsberg und nach Thüringen. In nordwestlicher Richtung zum Feldberg zieht heute noch die \\"Königsteiner Straße\\", und die Strecke entlang dem Mainlauf findet sich nach der Niddabrücke als Verbindung über Griesheim und den Gutleuthof nach Frankfurt. Dies sind heute der \\"Nieder Kirchweg\\" sowie die \\"Stroofstraße\\"., In der geschützten Niddamündung wurde ein Flusshafen eingerichtet, am nördlichen Niddaufer entstand eine Militärziegelei im Bereich der heutigen Nieder Gemarkung. Die Legio XXII Primigenia stellte hier zwischen den Jahren 85 und 120 Ziegel her. Mit Weiterbau des Limes zur Mitte des 2. Jahrhunderts wurde die zeitweilig eingestellte Ziegelproduktion wieder aufgenommen. Erhalten sind mehr als 200 verschiedene Ziegelstempel, die meisten von der XXII. Legion., Die Siedlung verlor mit dem Bau der Elisabethenstraße über Hofheim und der Anlage des Limes an wirtschaftlicher und militärischer Bedeutung. Sie entwickelte sich zu einer zivilen Siedlung. Als die Alamannen ab 260 den Limes überwanden und in römisches Gebiet einfielen, zogen sich die Römer in ihre linksrheinischen Gebiete zurück und gaben ihre Besitzungen rechts des Rheins auf. Die Siedlung an der Niddamündung wurde zur Wüstung, Überlieferungen und Berichte über eine Wiederbesiedelung des Höchster Gebietes nach dem Rückzug der Römer gibt es nicht. Lediglich einige Indizien weisen auf ein alemannisches Gehöft im 4. Jahrhundert und einen merowingischen Königshof am Rande der heutigen Altstadt im 5. Jahrhundert hin., Unter dem Krummstab: Die mainzische Zeit – 790 bis 1803., Das Dorf Höchst im Früh- und Hochmittelalter., Erst aus dem 8. Jahrhundert gibt es wieder Hinweise auf eine Besiedelung des Hochplateaus über der Nidda mit Gehöften. Von einem Dorf im heutigen Sinn kann dabei allerdings keine Rede sein, es handelte sich vielmehr um eine lockere Ansammlung von Einzelgehöften. Die erste urkundliche Erwähnung dieser Ansiedlung erfolgte am 5. August 790 im Lorscher Codex, als der fränkische Gutsherr \\"Thiotmann\\" dem Kloster Lorsch ein Anwesen \\"„in villa hostat in Nitahgowe“\\" schenkte, im \\"„Dorf auf der hohen Stätte im Niddagau“\\". Zu späteren Zeiten schrieb der Renaissancelyriker Georg Calaminus die Hostato-Sage in Versform auf, nach der der Knappe Hostato als einziger die Schlacht von Roncesvalles überlebte und deswegen von Karl dem Großen als Dank für seine Tapferkeit zum Ritter geschlagen und zum Vogt der \\"hohen Stätte\\" ernannt wurde., Spätestens ab dem frühen 9. Jahrhundert hatte das Erzbistum Mainz, das nach Ausbau seiner Territorialherrschaft strebte, so viele Einzelprivilegien nach fränkischem Recht in den Gebieten entlang des Mains von Mainz bis Frankfurt auf sich vereinigt, dass Höchst Teil des Mainzer Besitzes war und nicht mehr zum Niddagau gehörte. Annalen des Klosters Fulda aus dem Jahr 849 berichten vom \\"„Hofgut Höchst im Gebiet von Mainz“\\". Die Mainzer Herrschaft dauerte fast tausend Jahre bis zum Jahr 1803, noch heute erinnert das Mainzer Rad im Höchster Wappen daran., Ab ungefähr 830 ließ der Mainzer Erzbischof Otgar von Mainz auf dem hohen Ufer über dem Main die Justinuskirche errichten, die bis heute weitgehend erhalten ist. Sie ist eine der ältesten Kirchen Deutschlands und das älteste Bauwerk Frankfurts. Die für die Siedlung viel zu große Kirche war ein Machtsymbol des Mainzer Erzbischofs gegenüber dem Frankfurter Königshof. Zugleich diente sie im Rahmen kirchlicher Siedlungspolitik dazu, die Entstehung einer dörflichen Ansiedlung und Konzentration der bis dahin in verstreuten Einzelgehöften lebenden Bevölkerung um die Kirche zu fördern. Otgars Nachfolger Rabanus Maurus weihte den Bau nach seiner Fertigstellung im Jahr 850. Die Justinuskirche diente als Dorfkirche. In der Folgezeit entwickelte sich das Dorf Höchst entlang der Hauptstraße zwischen einem mainzischen Fronhof im Westen, der im Bereich der \\"Wed\\" gelegen war, und der Justinuskirche im Osten. Die westliche Grenze Höchsts bildet ein Mündungsarm des Liederbachs, der über den Bereich des heutigen Schloßplatzes zum Main floss. Zu Beginn des 11. Jahrhunderts konnte von einem Dorf Höchst die Rede sein., Aus dem 11. Jahrhundert ist die Entstehung eines weiteren erzbischöflichen Hofes westlich der Justinuskirche überliefert. Zusammen mit der Justinuskirche wurde er dem Kloster St. Alban in Mainz geschenkt. Die Kirche wurde in Schriften des Stifts gezielt als einsturzgefährdet bezeichnet; St. Alban erhielt auf diese Weise als Dreingabe weitere Ländereien und Privilegien in Höchst. Renovierungsarbeiten an der angeblich baufälligen Kirche fanden jedoch nicht statt. Die Höchster Niederlassung der Abtei St. Alban blieb bis zum Jahr 1419 in Höchst., Im 12. Jahrhundert setzte das Bistum Mainz einen Burggrafen in Höchst ein; urkundlich erwähnt wird ein Graf \\"Gotfried von der Wartburg\\", ein Verwandter des Erzbischofs Heinrich I. Ein solcher Statthalter hatte üblicherweise seinen Sitz in einer Stadt oder einer Burg. Höchst war zu dieser Zeit noch keine Stadt, daher kann aus der nachgewiesenen Existenz eines Amtmanns geschlossen werden, dass bereits Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts eine Burg als Vorgängerin des heutigen Höchster Schlosses existierte. Bei Schachtungsarbeiten auf der Schlossterrasse wurden 1981 Gräben gefunden, die aufgrund ihrer abweichenden Ausrichtung nicht zur – nachgewiesenen – späteren gotischen Zollburg gehören konnten., Der in Höchst und anderen Orten des Untermains erhobene Mainzoll wurde von Kaiser Friedrich Barbarossa im Jahr 1157 aufgehoben und verboten. Lediglich an drei Orten, Frankfurt, Aschaffenburg und Neustadt durfte noch der Flusszoll erhoben werden. Mit dem Verfall der kaiserlichen Macht im 13. Jahrhundert hatte Kurmainz die Möglichkeit, in Höchst wieder Zoll zu erheben. Es wurde eine neue und größere Burg errichtet, die nach der Landseite hin eine hohe und fast fünf Meter dicke Schildmauer besaß. Folge des Burgbaus war eine bescheidene Ausdehnung Höchsts nach Westen. Durch den Aushub des Burggrabens wurde der tief eingeschnittene Mündungsarm des Liederbachs zugeschüttet, der Schloßplatz weitgehend auf sein heutiges Niveau angehoben und das Wasser direkt in den Burggraben geleitet., Im Norden und Osten des Burgplatzes entstand zwischen dem Ende des 13. und Anfang des 14. Jahrhunderts eine neue Bebauung. Der \\"Allmeygang\\", der bisher direkt zum Main geführt hatte, wurde auf den neuen Platz umgeleitet. Westlich der Burg stand der Ochsenturm als freistehender Wartturm, er wurde später in die im 15, Jahrhundert entstehende Stadtbefestigung einbezogen., Stadterhebung und Stadtentwicklung im Spätmittelalter., Die Stadterhebung Höchsts war für längere Zeit ein Streitpunkt zwischen Mainz und Frankfurt. Dabei ging es vorrangig um die Erhebung des Mainzolls durch die Mainzer Erzbischöfe, für die der Zoll eine wichtige Einnahmequelle bedeutete. Frankfurt hingegen betrachtete den Höchster Mainzoll als Handelshindernis und erwirkte mehrfach dessen kaiserliches Verbot. Dennoch erhoben die Mainzer den Mainzoll oft weiter, ohne sich um die Verbote zu kümmern. Dies blieb in der Zeit des Interregnums mit seiner geschwächten Königsmacht meist folgenlos. 1336 erteilte Kaiser Ludwig IV der Bayer Frankfurt ein Privileg, das jeglichen Bau befestigter Anlagen im Umkreis von sieben Meilen um Frankfurt verbot. Damit sollte eine Befestigung Höchsts verhindert werden., Am 11.

Dynastie des Mittleren Reichs (ca. 1900 v. Chr.). Der unbekannte Autor der Dichtung schildert in Form einer Ich-Erzählung die vermutlich fiktive Lebensgeschichte des Hofbeamten Sinuhe, der nach dem Tod des Königs (Pharao) Amenemhet I. in Panik gerät und nach einer abenteuerlichen Flucht schließlich in der Region Palästina sesshaft wird. Doch im Alter wird er von Heimweh geplagt. Tatsächlich bittet ihn Sesostris I., wieder heimzukehren, da er dessen Unschuld am Tode seines Vaters Amenemhet erkannt habe. Daraufhin kehrt Sinuhe nach Ägypten zurück und wird dort mit allen Ehren empfangen., Die Erzählung hat einen starken Bezug zum Königshof von Sesostris I. und wird teilweise als eine Art Propaganda angesehen, welche die Loyalität zum König betonen soll. Daneben scheint die Identität als Ägypter, insbesondere im Spiegelbild des Auslands, und der Wunsch, als Ägypter begraben zu werden, eine besondere Rolle zu spielen., Die meisten Ägyptologen stimmen darin überein, dass es sich um ein Meisterwerk der ägyptischen Literatur und die bekannteste Erzählung aus dem Alten Ägypten handelt, für Richard Parkinson allerdings \\"auf Kosten von anderen, weniger zugänglichen Werken.\\" Sie wurde noch lange nach ihrer Entstehung gelesen und weiterverbreitet. In moderner Zeit fand sie Eingang in die Literatur und das Medium Film., Überlieferung und Datierung., Die Erzählung ist auf zurzeit 36 bekannten Handschriften überliefert (8 Papyri und 28 Ostraka). Alle stammen aus dem Mittleren oder Neuen Reich und wurden in hieratischer Schrift, der Kursivschrift der Hieroglyphen und mittelägyptischer Sprache verfasst. Meist wird sie anhand Transkriptionen in die Hieroglyphen übersetzt. Als Standard-Edition gilt seit 1990 jene von Roland Koch., Entstehungszeit., Die Handlung der Sinuhe-Erzählung endet in den späten Regierungsjahren von Sesostris I. (regierte ca. 1956 bis 1910 v. Chr.), womit der frühestmögliche Entstehungszeitpunkt (Terminus post quem) gegeben ist. Die älteste überlieferte Handschrift (Papyrus Berlin 3022) datiert etwa 100 bis 150 Jahre später, in die zweite Hälfte der 12. Dynastie. Damit ist der spätestmögliche Entstehungszeitpunkt (Terminus ante quem) gegeben. Aus inhaltlichen Gründen wird im Allgemeinen angenommen, dass das Werk unmittelbar nach den geschilderten Ereignissen entstanden ist, möglicherweise noch während der Regierungszeit von Sesostris I. oder kurz danach., Handschriften des Mittleren Reiches., Die vollständigste und wohl älteste erhaltene Handschrift der Sinuhe-Erzählung ist der Papyrus Berlin 3022 (abgekürzt \\"B\\"). Er wurde vermutlich in einem thebanischen Privatgrab gefunden und datiert in die zweite Hälfte der 12. Dynastie; aufgrund eines Schreibfehlers zu Beginn des Briefs wird die Regierungszeit eines Königs mit dem Namen Amenemhet angenommen, womit Amenemhet II. und Amenemhet III. in Frage kämen. Ebenfalls aus Theben, aus einem Grab in der Nähe des späteren Ramesseums, stammt der Papyrus Berlin 10499 (abgekürzt \\"R\\"). Zusammengenommen bieten die beiden Papyri B und R den Text von Anfang bis Ende, und nach deren Zeilen- und Spalteneinteilung wird die Erzählung üblicherweise zitiert (R1–R24, B1–B311). B und R sind mehr als ein Jahrhundert jünger als die erste Niederschrift und weichen etwas von diesem (nicht mehr erhaltenen) Urtext ab., Vermutlich ebenfalls in die späte 12. Dynastie datieren zwei Papyrusfragmente mit nur wenigen Zeilen Text. Diese stammen aus Al-Lahun, das am östlichen Taleingang des Fayyum-Beckens liegt und sich in der direkten Umgebung des Regierungszentrums des Mittleren Reichs befand. Einen Großteil dieser Lahunpapyri entdeckte Flinders Petrie 1888–89, darunter vermutlich auch Papyrus UC 32106C, dessen Fundort nicht genau vermerkt wurde, der aber wohl zu einem Archiv mit literarischen und nichtliterarischen Texten gehörte. Der Text des Sinuhe befindet sich auf dem Verso; das Recto enthält einen unbekannten, vermutlich ebenfalls literarischen Text. Papyrus UC 32773 (auch Papyrus Harageh 1, abgekürzt \\"H\\") wurde in der Nekropole von Harageh von Reginald Engelbach gefunden und stammt womöglich aus einem Grab., Paläografisch lässt sich auch Papyrus Buenos Aires (abgekürzt \\"BA\\"), ein weiteres Fragment mit der Erzählung, in die 12. Dynastie datieren, allerdings ist über dessen Herkunft und Umstände des Erwerbs nichts bekannt., Handschriften des Neuen Reiches., Der sehr fragmentarische Papyrus Moskau 4657 (abgekürzt \\"G\\") enthält nur Passagen vom Anfang der Erzählung. Er wurde um 1900 vom russischen Ägyptologen Wladimir Semjonowitsch Golenischtschew angeblich in Luxor gekauft, über die Fundumstände ist allerdings nichts bekannt. Nach inhaltlichen Kriterien wurde auch schon eine Herkunft aus dem Norden angenommen, etwa aus Memphis, allerdings spricht die Ähnlichkeit zu den Papyri aus Deir el-Medina doch für eine Herkunft aus Theben. Paläografisch lässt er sich in die späte 18. oder 19. Dynastie datieren., Ein weiterer Papyrus des Neuen Reiches ist der Turiner Papyrus CGT 54015, der bis heute aber unpubliziert ist., Die 28 bisher bekannten Ostraka stammen wohl hauptsächlich aus dem Schulbetrieb des Neuen Reiches in Theben West, in der Schreibschule der Nekropolenarbeiter von Deir el-Medina, wenn auch einige davon bei Gräbern gefunden wurden, darunter zwei im Grab des Sennedjem. Sie datieren wahrscheinlich alle in die Ramessidenzeit. Die meisten enthalten kurze Schreibübungen, meist vom Anfang der Erzählung, \\"in denen die Schüler vor allem die Kalligraphie und die Gliederung (Rubra und Verspunkte) eines klassischen Textes in klassischer Sprache erlernen sollten\\"., Einzig das Ashmolean Ostrakon (abgekürzt \\"AOS\\") ist länger und bietet auf seiner Vorder- und Rückseite ca. 90 % der Erzählung. Möglicherweise diente es in einem Archiv aufbewahrt als Vorlage für die Schreibübungen der Schüler., Nur das Ostrakon Senenmut 149 (abgekürzt \\"S\\") stammt von einem anderen Ort in Theben-West, nämlich vom Grab des Senenmut (TT71) bei Deir el-Bahari, und datiert somit in die Zeit der Hatschepsut und des Thutmosis III. (frühe 18. Dynastie). Daneben gibt es keine direkten Zeugen für eine Beschäftigung mit dem Text in der 18. Dynastie, was aber vermutlich an der Überlieferungssituation liegt. So lassen Zitate in den Grabinschriften dieser Dynastie keinen Zweifel, dass die Erzählung auch zu dieser Zeit intensiv gelesen wurde, und auch das Ashmolean Ostrakon enthält Spuren einer Redaktion, die unter der Herrschaft Echnatons erfolgt sein muss., Tradierung bis in die Spätzeit., Ludwig D. Morenz sieht die Erzählung als Paradebeispiel für die Integration verschiedener Themen und Stile und als eine regelrechte „Buchausgabe“, die wohl bereits im Mittleren und im Neuen Reich in Privat-Bibliotheken aufbewahrt wurde. Somit zählte sie zum allgemeinen Bildungsgut. Eberhard Otto spricht von einem „lehrhaften Stück“, \\"eine amüsante „historische“ Erzählung, die im Grunde immer aktuell blieb und deren Sprache als Musterbeispiel „klassischer“ Formen zu lernen immer nützlich war\\"., Bei den vielen Ostraka mit Zitaten literarischer Texte, die in Deir el-Medina gefunden wurden, handelt es sich nach herkömmlicher Ansicht um Schreibübungen von Schülern. Nach anderer Meinung sind es Texte, die von gebildeten Arbeitern angefertigt und aufbewahrt wurden. Allerdings ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass so vielfach zitierte Texte wie das Buch Kemit aus bloßem Interesse an Literatur gelesen wurden. Außerdem wurden die literarischen Texte teilweise so stark entstellt, als seien sie nicht immer von den Schreibern (bzw. Schülern) verstanden worden., \\"Zitate und Anspielungen in königlichen und privaten Inschriften des zweiten und ersten Jahrtausend v. Chr. zeigen, dass die Beliebtheit weder auf den Schreiberstand noch auf das Neue Reich beschränkt war.\\" Zwar sind für die Zeit nach dem Neuen Reich keine weiteren Handschriften überliefert, doch die Tradierung anderer „klassischer“ Werke bis in die 27. Dynastie legt nahe, dass auch Sinuhe weiterhin kopiert wurde. Die Siegesstele des Pianchi aus der kuschitischen 25. Dynastie enthält gewisse Anspielungen auf die Sinuhe-Erzählung. Das späteste bekannte Zitat stammt vermutlich aus der Biographie des Udja-Hor-Resnet, der während der Perserzeit (525–401 v. Chr.) lebte:, Inhalt., Am Anfang werden im Stil einer autobiographischen Grabinschrift Sinuhes Name und Titulatur genannt, die er an seinem Lebensende trägt: \\"Der Graf und Fürst, der königlich unterägyptische Siegelbewahrer und einzige Freund (des Herrschers), der Richter und Verwalter in den Ländern der Asiaten, der wirkliche Bekannte des Königs, den er liebt, der Gefolgsmann, Sinuhe (Sohn der Sykomore)\\". Die eigentliche Erzählung beginnt mit dem Tod des Königs Amenemhet I. am 7. Achet III im 30. Regierungsjahr, wobei der große Kummer des Volkes beschrieben wird, nicht aber der Grund für den plötzlichen Tod, die Beschreibung passt aber gut zur Lehre des Amenemhet, nach der Amenemhet I. bei einem Attentat im Harem starb., Der „Kronprinz“ Sesostris I. ist gerade auf dem Rückweg von einem Libyenfeldzug, den er als Kommandant geleitet hat, als ihn Boten mit der Nachricht vom Tod seines Vaters erreichen. Ohne zu zögern und ohne sein Heer zu informieren, eilt Sesostris zur Residenz, um sich um die Regelung der Nachfolge zu kümmern. Als man auch nach den anderen Königskindern mit der Todesnachricht schickt, erfährt Sinuhe dies zufällig und ergreift daraufhin die Flucht. Detailreich beschreibt er seine Bestürzung und Panik, ohne ein genaues Motiv seiner überstürzten Flucht anzugeben., Die Flucht führt ihn durch verschiedene Orte und Länder. Er erreicht die Grenze zum vorderasiatischen Raum bei Wadi Tumilat, wo er sich zunächst aus Angst, von einem Wärter (Wächter?) gesehen zu werden, in einem Gebüsch versteckt, bis er nachts den heimlichen Grenzübertritt wagt, indem er die sogenannten „Mauern des Herrschers“ überwindet. Wenig später schildert er eindrücklich die Erfahrung seiner Todesnähe, als er fast verdurstet und im letzten Moment von Beduinen gerettet wird., Anschließend reist Sinuhe weiter nach Byblos, bis ihn Amunenschi, der Herrscher von Ober-Retjenu (Bergland von Syrien-Palästina), bei sich aufnimmt.

Olvasd el az alkalmazás dokumentációját vagy támogatási oldalát, vagy kérdezd meg más felhasználókat a problémáról, mielőtt bugreportot készítesz. 2. Ellenőrizd, hogy mások is jelentették-e már a hibákat: Keresd meg az adott alkalmazás fejlesztőit vagy fórumokat, hogy megnézd, mások is találkoztak-e már ugyanezzel a problémával, és hogy van-e valamilyen ismert megoldás rá. Ha már jelentették a hibát, akár úgy is dönthetsz, hogy egyszerűen követed a fejleményeket, és várakozol a javításra. 3. Készíts részletes bugreportot: Ha úgy döntesz, hogy elküldöd a bugreportokat, mindig legyenek részletesek és informatívak. Írd le a hiba lehetséges okait és körülményeit, valamint az útmutatókat a probléma megismétlésére. Töltsd fel a hiba képernyőképeit vagy rögzített videóit a bugreporthoz. Ez lehetővé teszi az alkalmazás fejlesztőinek, hogy könnyen reprodukálják és megoldják a problémát. 4. Ellenőrizd a telefonod szoftververzióját: Bizonyos hibák lehetnek a telefonod szoftverével vagy frissítéseivel összefüggésben. Győződj meg róla, hogy a legfrissebb verziót futtatod és nincs-e elérhető újabb frissítés. Néha a frissítések javíthatnak olyan hibákat, amelyeket korábban jelentettél. 5. Használd a hivatalos visszajelzési csatornákat: Ha az adott alkalmazásnak van hivatalos támogatói fóruma, e-mail címe vagy bugreport rendszere, használd ezeket a hivatalos csatornákat a jelentésedhez. Az alkalmazás fejlesztői valószínűleg jobban figyelnek ezekre a csatornákra, és nagyobb eséllyel foglalkoznak a panaszoddal. 6. Legyél türelmes: Nem minden hiba azonnal megoldódik, és néha hosszabb időt vehet igénybe, míg az alkalmazás fejlesztői válaszolnak vagy javítást végeznek. Legyél türelmes és ne add fel a jóváhagyást.

Jahrhundert), Schwangerschaftsabbrüche in Deutschland], Das Gesetz über die Unterbrechung der Schwangerschaft war ein von der Volkskammer, dem Parlament der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik (DDR), am 9.März 1972 beschlossenes Gesetz zur Regelung des Schwangerschaftsabbruchs. Mit seiner Verabschiedung wurde in der DDR für den Schwangerschaftsabbruch in Abkehr von der zuvor geltenden indikationsbasierten Regelung eine grundlegende Neufassung der Gesetzeslage in Form einer Fristenlösung eingeführt. Nach dieser erhielten Frauen das Recht, innerhalb von zwölf Wochen nach dem Beginn einer Schwangerschaft über deren Abbruch eigenverantwortlich zu entscheiden. Für den beteiligten Arzt bestand gemäß dem Gesetz die Pflicht zur Beratung der Schwangeren über die medizinische Bedeutung des Eingriffs und über die künftige Anwendung schwangerschaftsverhütender Methoden und Mittel., Das Gesetz traf in der DDR auf Kritik und Ablehnung durch die Kirchen beider Konfessionen sowie durch Teile der Ärzteschaft, zu einer öffentlichen Diskussion in nennenswertem Umfang kam es allerdings nicht. Bis zur politischen Wende von 1989 war die Beschlussfassung über das Gesetz jedoch die einzige Abstimmung in der Geschichte der Volkskammer, die nicht einstimmig ausfiel, da es 14Gegenstimmen und acht Enthaltungen gab. Die mit dem Gesetz geschaffene Rechtslage in der DDR, mit der erstmals in der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte für den Schwangerschaftsabbruch eine Fristenregelung in Kraft trat, beeinflusste in der Folgezeit auch die Debatte über die Novellierung des §218 StGB und die daraus resultierenden Gesetzesinitiativen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland sowie die Neuregelung des §218 StGB nach der deutschen Wiedervereinigung., Entstehung und Inhalt., Rechtliche Entwicklung., Gesetzliche Grundlage zum Schwangerschaftsabbruch in Deutschland war bis 1943 das 1871 verabschiedete Reichsstrafgesetzbuch mit den §§218–220, deren Strafandrohung in einer 1926 beschlossenen Neufassung abgemildert worden war. Das Reichsgericht hatte den Bestimmungen des Strafgesetzbuches, die ein generelles Verbot des Schwangerschaftsabbruchs ohne definierte Indikationen darstellten, in einer Entscheidung vom 11.März 1927 außerdem eine strenge medizinische Indikation als richterrechtlich formulierte Ausnahme hinzugefügt. Entsprechend diesem Urteil galt das Vorliegen einer „gegenwärtigen, auf andere Weise nicht zu beseitigenden Gefahr für die Schwangere“ als Rechtfertigungsgrund in Form eines übergesetzlichen Notstands. Im Dritten Reich änderte sich die Auffassung zur normativen Basis des Verbots des Schwangerschaftsabbruchs grundlegend, da nicht mehr primär die Tötung des werdenden oder ungeborenen Lebens als Begründung im Vordergrund stand. Vielmehr galt nun ein Sachentzug gegenüber dem Vater und dem Staat sowie ab 1943 eine „Beeinträchtigung der Lebenskraft des deutschen Volkes“ als Grundlage der Strafbarkeit. Darüber hinaus betraf das strikte Verbot mit Ausnahme der medizinischen Indikation nur rassenhygienisch erwünschte Schwangerschaften. Bei Eltern, die im Sinne der nationalsozialistischen Ideologie als „erbkrank und minderwertig“ galten, wurde hingegen auch eine eugenische Indikation erlaubt und sogar befürwortet. Ab 1943 galt für Abtreibung die Todesstrafe, wenn „die Lebenskraft des deutschen Volkes fortgesetzt beeinträchtigt“ wurde. Für andere Fälle von Abtreibung wurde die Zuchthausstrafe bis zu 15 Jahren wieder eingeführt. Gegen die Schwangere konnte sie allerdings nur in, im Gesetz nicht definierten, besonders schweren Fällen verhängt werden, gegen Dritte blieb in minder schweren Fällen Gefängnisstrafe möglich., Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges wurde diese Rechtslage in den einzelnen Ländern der Sowjetischen Besatzungszone zwischen 1945 und 1948 durch neue Regelungen mit erweiterten Indikationsmodellen ersetzt. Diese enthielten aufgrund der Kriegsfolgen eine kriminologische Indikation bei Schwangerschaft nach einer Vergewaltigung oder einem sexuellen Missbrauch, so zum Beispiel in Thüringen durch das „Gesetz über Unterbrechung der durch ein Sittlichkeitsverbrechen verursachten Schwangerschaft“ vom 29. August 1945, sowie mit Ausnahme des Gesetzes von Sachsen-Anhalt auch eine soziale Indikation bei vorliegender oder drohender sozialer Notlage, in Thüringen beispielsweise durch das „Gesetz über die Unterbrechung der Schwangerschaft“\\" vom 18. Dezember 1947. In Mecklenburg wurde 1947 auch die embryopathische Indikation eingeführt. Darüber hinaus wurde das Strafmaß gegenüber den zuvor geltenden gesetzlichen Bestimmungen erheblich verringert. Rund ein Jahr nach Gründung der DDR trat dann am 27.September 1950 das Gesetz über den Mutter- und Kinderschutz und die Rechte der Frau in Kraft, mit dem in §11 eine einheitliche Regelung der Indikationen für einen Schwangerschaftsabbruch eingeführt wurde. Ein Schwangerschaftsabbruch war laut §11 nur nach medizinischer oder embryopathischer Indikation zulässig, „wenn die Austragung des Kindes das Leben oder die Gesundheit der schwangeren Frau ernstlich gefährdet oder wenn ein Elternteil mit schwerer Erbkrankheit belastet ist“ und die Erlaubnis einer Kommission vorlag, die sich aus Ärzten, Vertretern der Organe des Gesundheitswesens und des Demokratischen Frauenbundes zusammensetzte., Ziel des Gesetzes über den Mutter- und Kinderschutz und die Rechte der Frau war neben der Förderung der Gleichberechtigung der Frauen und der Steigerung ihrer Erwerbstätigkeit insbesondere die Geburtenförderung als Teil der Bevölkerungspolitik. Die mit dem Gesetz ab 1950 in der DDR geltende Rechtslage führte in den folgenden Jahren einerseits zu einer der geringsten Raten an genehmigten Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen weltweit, andererseits zu einem Anstieg der Zahl illegaler Schwangerschaftsabbrüche und dazu, dass Frauen zu Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen bis zum Bau der Berliner Mauer auf Ärzte in West-Berlin auswichen. Im März 1965 kam es, ohne Änderung des Gesetzestextes, durch eine interne Rundverfügung des Ministeriums für Gesundheitswesen zur Erweiterung der Anwendung des §11 um eine kriminologisch und eine soziale Indikation. Die anderen Fälle des Schwangerschaftsabbruchs blieben weiterhin verboten und strafbar, die strafrechtlichen Bestimmungen der Ländergesetze galten zunächst weiter und wurden 1968 durch die §§153–155 des Strafgesetzbuches der DDR abgelöst., Mit dem 1972 beschlossenen Gesetz über die Unterbrechung der Schwangerschaft wurde dann die indikationsbasierte Rechtslage vollständig durch eine Fristenregelung abgelöst. Auch nach der Verabschiedung des Gesetzes und dessen Verkündung im Gesetzblatt der DDR am 15.März 1972 blieben die §§153–155 des StGB-DDR vollumfänglich und unverändert in Kraft, da eine Schwangerschaftsunterbrechung strafrechtlich als unzulässig galt, wenn sie „entgegen den gesetzlichen Vorschriften“ vorgenommen wurde. Die konkrete Definition der Voraussetzungen für die Zulässigkeit war damit, anders als im §218 des deutschen Strafgesetzbuches, nicht Teil der Bestimmungen des StGB-DDR, sondern erfolgte durch die entsprechenden Gesetze von 1950 beziehungsweise 1972. Gründe für die Neuregelung von 1972 waren, wie schon bei der Ausweitung der Indikationen im Jahr 1965, vor allem die hohe Dunkelziffer illegaler Schwangerschaftsabbrüche, die zunehmenden Forderungen nach Selbstbestimmung der Frauen sowie die Verjüngung und die Zunahme des Frauenanteils unter den Ärzten in der DDR. Für die Wahl des Zeitpunkts spielte darüber hinaus möglicherweise ein „Wettlauf“ mit den Reformbemühungen der sozialliberalen Koalition in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland eine Rolle. Sowohl im rechtshistorischen Kontext als auch im internationalen Vergleich war insbesondere die Anerkennung der Entscheidung über den Schwangerschaftsabbruch als \\"Recht der Frau\\" ein Novum; lediglich in der ein Jahr später beschlossenen Regelung in Dänemark ist eine vergleichbare Formulierung zu finden., Mit dem Einigungsvertrag vom 31.August 1990 wurden §1 Abs.1, §4 Abs.2 und §5 des Gesetzes über die Unterbrechung der Schwangerschaft aufgehoben., Vollständig außer Kraft trat das Gesetz 1993 nach der Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts zur bundeseinheitlichen Neuregelung der Rechtslage zum Schwangerschaftsabbruch., Bestimmungen., Laut der Präambel des Gesetzes über die Unterbrechung der Schwangerschaft, das aus fünf Paragraphen bestand, galt die Möglichkeit, über die Schwangerschaft und deren Austragung selbst zu entscheiden, als Erfordernis der „Gleichberechtigung der Frau in Ausbildung und Beruf, Ehe und Familie“ und damit als Beitrag zum Erreichen dieses Ziels im Rahmen der Frauen- und Familienpolitik der DDR. Gemäß §1 Abs.1 wurde demzufolge Frauen „zusätzlich zu den bestehenden Möglichkeiten der Empfängnisverhütung das Recht übertragen, über die Unterbrechung einer Schwangerschaft in eigener Verantwortung zu entscheiden“, um die Anzahl, den Zeitpunkt und die zeitliche Aufeinanderfolge von Geburten zu bestimmen., Dementsprechend war laut §1 Abs.2 eine schwangere Frau berechtigt, die Schwangerschaft innerhalb von zwölf Wochen nach deren Beginn „durch einen ärztlichen Eingriff in einer geburtshilflich-gynäkologischen Einrichtung“ abbrechen zu lassen. Für den beteiligten Arzt bestand gemäß §1 Abs.3 die Pflicht, „die Frau über die medizinische Bedeutung des Eingriffs aufzuklären und über die künftige Anwendung schwangerschaftsverhütender Methoden und Mittel zu beraten“., Der Abbruch einer länger als zwölf Wochen bestehenden Schwangerschaft war gemäß §2 an die Entscheidung einer Fachärztekommission gebunden und nur bei einer Gefährdung für das Leben der Frau oder beim Vorliegen anderer schwerwiegender Umstände zulässig., Gemäß §3 Abs. 1 war der Schwangerschaftsabbruch unzulässig, wenn die Frau an einer Krankheit litt, die im Zusammenhang damit zu schweren gesundheitsgefährdenden oder lebensbedrohenden Komplikationen führen konnte., Gemäß § 3 Abs. 2 war der Schwangerschaftsabbruch unzulässig, wenn der letzte Schwangerschaftsabbruch weniger als sechs Monate zurücklag, es sei denn, dass die Fachärztekommission eine Ausnahmegenehmigung erteilte., Vorbereitung, Durchführung und Nachbehandlung eines zulässigen Schwangerschaftsabbruches waren nach §4 Abs.1 „arbeits- und versicherungsrechtlich dem Erkrankungsfall gleichgestellt“., Darüber hinaus wurde durch §4 Abs.2 mit der Verabschiedung des Gesetzes die Abgabe ärztlich verordneter Mittel zur Empfängnisverhütung an: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Feminismus, Gesetz (DDR), DDR, Schwangerschaftsabbrüche, Rechtsquelle, Fristenlösung, Neufassung, indikationsbasiert, Novellierung, §218 StGB, Reichsstrafgesetzbuch"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Absolvent der Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Altphilologe (18.

Matthias Gesnerus\\" (* 9. April 1691 in Roth an der Rednitz; † 3. August 1761 in Göttingen) war ein Pädagoge, klassischer Philologe und Bibliothekar. Von 1730 bis 1734 wirkte er als Rektor der Thomasschule zu Leipzig. Bei der Gründung der Georg-August-Universität im Jahr 1734 wurde Gesner als Professor für Poesie und Beredsamkeit nach Göttingen berufen und übernahm als solcher gleichzeitig die Leitung der Göttinger Universitätsbibliothek. Während er in seiner Tätigkeit als Herausgeber klassischer Autoren nur wenig innovativ war, wurde er mit seinen Reformideen für den Schul- und Universitätsunterricht zu einem der wirksamsten Wegbereiter des Neuhumanismus. Sein 1749 erschienenes Hauptwerk, das vierbändige Wörterbuch \\"Novus Linguæ Et Eruditionis Romanæ Thesaurus\\" stellt noch heute eine der wichtigsten Grundlagen zur Erarbeitung des im Jahr 1900 begonnenen Großlexikons der lateinischen Sprache „Münchener Thesaurus“ dar., Leben und Werk., Kindheit und Schulzeit in Franken., Am 9. April 1691 wurde Johann Matthias Gesner in der kleinen Stadt Roth bei Nürnberg geboren. Sein Vater Johann Samuel Gesner (1661–1704) war 1687 als Prediger dorthin versetzt worden, starb aber schon, bevor sein jüngster Sohn Johann Matthias zwölf Jahre alt war. Gesners Mutter Maria Magdalena geb. Hußwedel (1670–1738) war die Tochter eines Ansbacher Kammerrats und entstammte einer alten Beamtenfamilie. Nach dem Tode ihres Mannes hatte sie neun Kinder zu versorgen und heiratete nur kurze Zeit später den Amtsnachfolger im Pfarrhaus Johann Zuckermantel. Dieser bemerkte schon bald die außergewöhnliche Begabung Johann Matthias’ und bereitete ihn durch private Unterrichtsstunden für die Aufnahme am Ansbacher Gymnasium vor. Da die Kosten des Schulbesuchs jedoch die finanziellen Möglichkeiten der Familie überstiegen, wurde Gesner durch öffentliche Mittel unterstützt. So verbrachte er seine Ansbacher Gymnasialjahre in einem Wohnheim für arme Schüler und wurde aufgrund seiner Begabung intensiv durch den damaligen Rektor des Ansbacher Gymnasiums, Georg Nikolaus Köhler, gefördert., Studienzeit in Jena., Im Jahr 1710 immatrikulierte sich Gesner an der Universität Jena. Durch die Vermittlung des ehemaligen Prinzenerziehers Jakob Friedrich Weihl, der schon in Ansbach auf Gesner aufmerksam geworden war, erhielt er ein Stipendium. Gleichzeitig verfasste Gesner Gelegenheitsgedichte zu Hochzeiten oder Geburtstagen, um seine finanzielle Situation zu verbessern. 1712 nahm ihn der Theologe Johann Franz Buddeus, Gesners bevorzugter Lehrer, in sein Haus auf und übertrug ihm den Unterricht seines Sohnes. Buddeus war es auch, der ihm den Zugang zur klassischen Philologie ebnete und ihm durch den Zugriff auf seine private Bibliothek die Möglichkeit eröffnete, seine Bildung eigenständig zu erweitern. 1714 veröffentlichte Gesner seine erste philologische Arbeit, die \\"Philopatris dialogus Lucianeus\\", in der er nachwies, dass die dem griechischen Schriftsteller Lukian von Samosata zugeschriebene \\"Philopatris\\" gar nicht von diesem stammen könne, sondern in der Zeit Kaiser Julians – also rund 200 Jahre später – entstanden sein müsse. Ein Jahr darauf erschien mit den \\"Institutiones rei scholasticæ\\" („Grundzüge der Pädagogik“) sein erstes pädagogisches Werk, in dem er die Ansichten der Schulreformer aus dem 17. Jahrhundert aufgriff und durch eigene Ideen erweiterte., Die Weimarer Jahre., Im Jahr 1715 erhielt Gesner über die Vermittlung seines Jenaischen Mentors Buddeus die Stelle des Konrektors am Wilhelm-Ernst-Gymnasium in Weimar. Im nahegelegenen Gera (heute Geraberg) heiratete er 1718 die Pfarrerstochter Elisabetha Caritas (1695–1761), geb. Eberhard, die ihm 1719 seinen ersten Sohn Carl Philipp (1719–1780), den späteren kursächsischen Hof- und Leibarzt gebar. Die 1721 geborene Tochter Elisabetha heiratete später Johann Jakob Huber, der von 1739 bis 1742 als außerordentlicher Professor für Anatomie an der Universität Göttingen wirkte und anschließend als Leibarzt des Landgrafen Wilhelm VIII. nach Kassel ging., Neben seiner Tätigkeit am Gymnasium war Gesner auch als Verwalter der herzoglichen Münzsammlung und Bibliothek – der sogenannten Schurzfleischschen Sammlung und späteren Herzogin-Anna-Amalia-Bibliothek – tätig. Im Rahmen dieser Tätigkeit schuf er einen neunbändigen Nominalkatalog, bereitete einen Sachkatalog vor, ergänzte den Bestand und fertigte einen gedruckten Bericht, die \\"Notitia Bibliothecæ Vimariæ praesertim Schurzfleischianæ\\" (1723) über die Bibliothek an., Seine Ernennung zum Bibliothekar verdankte Gesner einer Empfehlung seines Gönners Buddeus an den fürstlichen Hofmarschall Friedrich Gotthilf von Marschall. Zu diesem entwickelte Gesner bald ein enges freundschaftliches Verhältnis, aß beinahe täglich bei ihm zu Mittag und verbrachte seine Ferien auf dessen Gut in Oßmannstedt. Durch den regelmäßigen Umgang mit dem Hofmarschall erwarb Gesner grundlegende Kenntnisse in gesellschaftlichen Umgangsformen, was ihn später auch zur Übernahme repräsentativer Aufgaben befähigen sollte. Während seines knapp fünfzehnjährigen Aufenthalts in Weimar verfasste er zahlreiche, zumeist kleinere Arbeiten, darunter die \\"Chrestomathia Ciceroniana\\" (1717) und die \\"Chrestomathia Pliniana\\" (1723), kommentierte Zusammenstellungen von Texten aus den Schriften Ciceros und Plinius’ \\"Naturalis historia\\" zur Verwendung für den Sprachunterricht. Hier lernte Gesner bereits seinen späteren Kantor Johann Sebastian Bach kennen., Zwischenspiel in Ansbach., Nachdem Herzog Wilhelm Ernst von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach im Jahr 1728 gestorben war, entledigte sich dessen Nachfolger und Neffe Ernst August all jener, die unter seinem Onkel Einfluss gehabt hatten. In dem Bewusstsein, den inzwischen aus seinem Amt entfernten Marschall damit zusätzlich zu kränken, entzog er Gesner das Amt des herzoglichen Bibliothekars. Gesner, der diese Aufgabe bisher mit großer Hingebung ausgefüllt hatte, gab daraufhin auch sein Amt als Konrektor am Weimarer Gymnasium auf und ging im Juni 1729 als Rektor zurück an seine ehemalige Schule in Ansbach, wo er allerdings nur für kurze Zeit blieb., Rektor der Leipziger Thomasschule., Als der Rektor der Leipziger Thomasschule Johann Heinrich Ernesti im Oktober 1729 starb, wurde Gesner als sein Nachfolger nach Leipzig berufen. Ernesti hatte seit 1680 einen Lehrstuhl an der Leipziger Universität inne und hatte sich seit Beginn seines Rektorats an der Thomasschule im Jahr 1684 nur sehr nebensächlich um die schulischen Belange gekümmert. Als Gesner das Amt des Rektors im Juli 1730 übernahm, befand sich die Schule denn auch in einem Zustand größter Verwahrlosung. Von seiner neuen Aufgabe herausgefordert, reformierte Gesner die Schulordnung, sorgte für einen geregelten Unterricht und erneuerte den Lehrplan. Der Komponist Johann Sebastian Bach, dem im Rahmen seines Amtes als Kantor und Musikdirektor der Stadt Leipzig auch der Musikunterricht an der Thomasschule unterlag, hatte mit Gesners Vorgänger Ernesti schwerwiegende Auseinandersetzungen gehabt und soll bei der Nachricht von Gesners Kommen freudig ausgerufen haben: „Jetzt wird alles gut!“ Später widmete er ihm seinen \\"Kanon zu 2 Stimmen\\" (BWV 1075). Gesner, der Bach und seine Musik bewunderte, engagierte sich erfolgreich für dessen bessere Entlohnung und setzte dem Komponisten in einem seiner Kommentare zu Quintilians \\"Institutio oratoria\\" ein bleibendes Denkmal. Einer Textstelle, in der die Vielseitigkeit der Lautenspieler gelobt wird, fügte er die Anmerkung hinzu „\\"Oh Quintilian! Könntest du von den Toten auferstehen und unseren Bach sehen, dann würdest du dies für etwas unbedeutendes halten!\\"“. Gesners Verhältnis zu den Professoren der Leipziger Universität gestaltete sich dagegen von Beginn an schwierig. Aus Eifersucht auf sein hohes Ansehen beim Rat der Stadt verweigerten sie Gesner die Lehrerlaubnis und sorgten so dafür, dass er schon nach vierjähriger Tätigkeit wieder von Leipzig wegging., Gesners Wirken in Göttingen., Eine Universitätsgründung in der Provinz., 1734 wurde in Göttingen die erste Vorlesung gehalten. Es war ein großes Wagnis, gerade in einer solch unbedeutenden Stadt, die zudem noch unter den Folgen des Dreißigjährigen Krieges litt, eine Universität zu gründen. Das ehrgeizige Projekt konnte nur gelingen, wenn gleich zu Beginn Gelehrte mit außergewöhnlichem Ruf gewonnen werden konnten. Zur Erreichung dieses Ziels mussten aber in Göttingen Arbeitsbedingungen geschaffen wurden, die aus der Sicht möglicher Kandidaten ausreichend attraktiv waren, um den Weg in das kleine Provinzstädtchen mit seinen knapp tausend, zur Hälfte verfallenen Häusern anzutreten. Gerlach Adolph Freiherr von Münchhausen (1688–1770), hannoverscher Staatsminister unter König Georg II., der das Kurfürstentum in Personalunion mit Großbritannien von London aus regierte, hatte die Universitätsgründung angeregt, er war ihr erster Kurator und größter Förderer. Münchhausen erkannte, dass eine großzügige Ausstattung der Universität mit Büchern einer der Schlüssel war, um anerkannte Gelehrte für die Göttinger Universität zu begeistern. Deshalb steuerte er zu der aus der Bibliothek des Göttinger Gymnasiums bestehenden Grundausstattung von 708 Bänden weitere 2.154 Bände aus Dubletten der Königlichen Bibliothek in Hannover bei, darunter viele Editionen antiker Klassiker. Der entscheidende Coup gelang ihm jedoch damit, dass er die Erben des 1724 verstorbenen hannoverschen Staatsmannes Joachim Hinrich von Bülow dazu bewegen konnte, dessen berühmte und kostbare Privatbibliothek für die neue Universität zu stiften. Deren einzige Bedingung war, dass die Göttinger Universitätsbibliothek dauerhaft den Namen „Bibliotheca Buloviana“ tragen sollte, ein Name, der erst in den folgenden Jahrhunderten aufgegeben wurde. Trotz allem hing der Wert der Bibliothek in starkem Maße davon ab, inwieweit es Münchhausen gelang, für ihre Ergänzung, Pflege und den weiteren Ausbau einen fähigen und zugleich engagierten Direktor zu berufen., Berufung an die Georgia-Augusta., Den geeigneten Kandidaten für dieses Amt fand Münchhausen in Gesner, dessen bisheriges Leben in hohem Maße von seiner Liebe zu Büchern bestimmt war: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Ebenso umfasst es alle Regelungen, welche die Beziehungen im Gesundheitswesen zwischen Versicherungen, Versicherten, Leistungserbringern und anderen eingebundenen Gruppen betreffen. Die einschlägigen Regelungen behandelten den Krankenversicherungsschutz der Einwohner bis zum Jahr 2014 grundsätzlich als private Angelegenheit, eine allgemeine Krankenversicherungspflicht war nicht vorgesehen. Eine staatliche Gesundheitsfürsorge gibt es für Einwohner, die jünger als 65Jahre sind, nur in Ausnahmefällen. 2008 waren 45,7Millionen oder 15,3 % der rund 300Millionen Einwohner weder privat krankenversichert, noch konnten sie staatliche Hilfe beanspruchen. In medizinischen Notfällen sind Krankenhäuser unter dem \\"Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act\\" (EMTALA) gesetzlich verpflichtet, unversicherte oder nicht ausreichend versicherte Patienten auch dann in der Notaufnahme zu behandeln, wenn absehbar ist, dass diese die Rechnung nicht bezahlen können. Bei Gesundheitsproblemen, die (noch) nicht die Stufe eines medizinischen Notfalls erreichen, dürfen solche Patienten aber abgewiesen werden., 2008 waren 84,7 % der Einwohner der USA bei einer privaten Krankenversicherung leistungsberechtigt oder hatten Anspruch auf staatliche Gesundheitsfürsorge. Bei 59,3 % der Einwohner wird Krankenversicherungsschutz durch den Arbeitgeber vermittelt, 8,9 % der Einwohner haben sich selbst versichert (Direktversicherung) und 27,8 % haben einen Anspruch auf staatliche Gesundheitsfürsorge (bei den Prozentzahlen ist zu beachten, dass einige Personen im Jahresverlauf den Versicherungsstatus gewechselt haben und somit mehrfach erfasst sind)., Die Einwohner der Vereinigten Staaten gaben 2008 pro Kopf 7536 für das Gesundheitssystem aus, das ist rund doppelt so viel wie in Deutschland (3692 Int. ) oder Österreich (3836 Int. ) und immer noch deutlich mehr als in der Schweiz (4620 Int. ). Das US-Gesundheitssystem ist weltweit mit Abstand das teuerste., Im Jahr 2010 wurde nach intensiver Reformdiskussion der Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act („Obamacare“) verabschiedet. Mit diesem wurde beginnend ab dem Jahr 2014 eine Versicherungspflicht für die meisten Einwohner eingeführt. Einkommensschwache Einwohner erhalten einen staatlichen Zuschuss zu den Krankenversicherungsbeiträgen, den Krankenversicherungsgesellschaften wird es verboten, Kunden mit Vorerkrankungen zu benachteiligen. Die Zahl der Bürger ohne einen privaten oder öffentlichen Krankenversicherungsschutz sank bis 2015 auf 29Millionen oder 9,1 % der Bevölkerung., Geschichte., Bei den amerikanischen Ärzten waren Krankenversicherungen zunächst nicht sehr beliebt, unter anderem auch weil befürchtet wurde, dass diese die Preise herunterhandeln könnten. Die American Medical Association formulierte 1919 die Forderung, dass nichts zwischen Arzt und Patient treten soll. Während der großen Depression in den 1930er Jahren erkannten aber viele Arbeiter und auch Ärzte und Krankenhäuser den Nutzen von Krankenversicherungen, da nur noch wenige Einwohner genug Geld besaßen, um im Ernstfall einen Arzt bezahlen zu können. Krankenversicherungen hingegen halfen den Einwohnern, das Geld für größere Gesundheitsleistungen nach und nach anzusparen. In dieser Zeit entstanden die ersten großen Krankenversicherungen. Dabei handelte es sich um unabhängige Versicherungen unter dem gemeinsamen Namen Blue Cross oder Blue Shield (Franchisenehmer), die ihre Versicherungsnehmer gegen monatliche Beitragszahlungen in vertraglich festgelegtem Umfang von den Kosten für Gesundheitsleistungen freistellten. Bis Ende der 1960er Jahre bestand eine unmittelbare Arzt-Patient-Beziehung, wobei der Arzt unbeeinflusst von Krankenversicherungen entscheiden konnte. Patienten reichten die Rechnungen an die Krankenversicherung ein, Zuzahlungen des Patienten waren unüblich. Für schwerere Krankheiten standen kleinere unabhängige Krankenhäuser zur Verfügung, die weit überwiegend in gemeinnütziger Form betrieben wurden., Während des Zweiten Weltkrieges standen Löhne und Preise eine Zeit lang unter staatlicher Kontrolle. Die Gewerkschaften forderten daher anstelle von Lohnerhöhungen die Zusage von Gesundheitsleistungen durch den Arbeitgeber; dies gilt als Stunde Null des arbeitgebervermittelten Krankenversicherungsschutzes. 1960 betrugen die Kosten des Gesundheitssystems zwar nur 5,2 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukts (BIP); die Gesundheitsausgaben pro Einwohner lagen aber im weltweiten Vergleich bereits 20 % höher als im zweitteuersten Land. Dabei wurden nur 21 % aller Kosten für Gesundheitsversorgung von privaten Krankenversicherungen bezahlt, staatliche Gesundheitsfürsorgeprogramme gab es kaum; die meisten Einwohner verfügten also über keine Krankenversicherung, sondern bezahlten die Rechnungen selbst oder verzichteten auf die Inanspruchnahme von Ärzten. Aufgrund medizinischer Fortschritte in den 1950er Jahren wurden Operationen weniger riskant als früher und konnten häufiger eine Heilung herbeiführen. Dadurch wuchs die Nachfrage nach Krankenhausleistungen und auch die nach Krankenversicherungen., Am 30. Juli 1965 führte Präsident Lyndon B. Johnson mit dem \\"Social Security Act of 1965\\" Ergänzungen zur 1935 eingeführten Sozialversicherung ein. Der steuer- und beitragsfinanzierte Gesundheitsschutz umfasst, Ende der 1960er Jahre gingen immer mehr Versicherungen wie Kaiser Permanente dazu über, die Arztwahl zu beschränken. Festgelegte \\"primary-care\\"-Vertragsärzte übernahmen nicht nur die Grundversorgung, sondern entschieden als \\"Gatekeeper\\" auch darüber, ob ein Versicherungsnehmer zu (teureren) spezialisierten Ärzten oder in ein Krankenhaus überwiesen wird. Auch gingen viele Versicherungen dazu über, ihren Vertragsärzten Behandlungsanweisungen zu geben. Solche Krankenversicherungen entwickelten sich so zu \\"Health Maintenance Organizations\\". Diese wurden mit dem \\"Health Maintenance Organization Act\\" von 1973 durch die Bundesregierung finanziell und rechtlich gefördert. Da die medizinischen Fortschritte größere Investitionen der Leistungserbringer erforderten, entstanden in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren große Krankenhausketten wie die \\"Hospital Corporation of America\\" (HCA); diese entwickelten ebenfalls Behandlungsanweisungen für Ärzte und Pflegekräfte, damit die Krankenhäuser effizienter arbeiteten., In der staatlichen Krankenversicherung Medicare wurde 1983 das \\"Prospective payment system\\" eingeführt, um die Kosten von Behandlungen transparent und nachvollziehbar zu machen und um zu verhindern, dass unnötige Behandlungen (demand inducement) abgerechnet werden können. Danach werden die Patienten anhand der Diagnosen und der durchgeführten Behandlungen in Fallgruppen (Diagnosis Related Groups = Diagnosebezogene Fallgruppen) klassifiziert. Die Diagnosis Related Groups sind nach dem für die Behandlung erforderlichen ökonomischen Aufwand unterteilt., 1986 hatten zwischen 25 und 37 Millionen Bürger unter 65 Jahren keinen Krankenversicherungsschutz., Private Krankenversicherungen., Verschiedene Arten privater Krankenversicherungen., Die meisten privaten Krankenversicherungen in den USA lassen nur eine beschränkte Arztwahl zu. Der Hintergrund ist, dass im Gesundheitswesen prinzipiell kein vollkommener Markt besteht. Versicherungsnehmer haben keinen Anreiz zu Sparsamkeit, da sie von den Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung durch die Krankenversicherung freigestellt werden (Moral Hazard). Ebenso haben die Erbringer von Gesundheitsleistungen (Ärzte, Krankenhäuser, Pharmaindustrie etc.) keinen Anreiz zu Sparsamkeit. Außerdem haben Patienten in der Regel nicht genug medizinische Kenntnisse, um selbst beurteilen zu können, welche Leistungen notwendig sind beziehungsweise von welcher Qualität die angebotenen Leistungen sind., Managed-care-Modelle versuchen deshalb Angebot, Nachfrage und Finanzierung so miteinander zu verknüpfen, dass es nicht zu einer automatischen Kostenexplosion kommt. Dies soll hauptsächlich durch drei Strategien erreicht werden: Die erste Strategie beinhaltet, dass Verträge möglichst mit den Erbringern von Gesundheitsleistungen geschlossen werden, die bei hinreichender Qualität am billigsten sind (selective contracting). Anreize zur Sparsamkeit (innovative incentives) machen die zweite Strategie aus: So müssen Patienten häufig bei Behandlungen Zuzahlungen leisten, damit sie diese nicht leichtfertig in Anspruch nehmen. Ärzte und Nurse Practitioners bekommen häufig Bonuszahlungen, wenn sie möglichst wenig Patienten zu Spezialärzten oder in Krankenhäuser überweisen. Die dritte Strategie ist die Auswertung von Patientenhistorien dahingehend, dass die billigste Therapie gefunden werden kann (“utilization review”). Zu den Managed-Care-Modellen gehören neben den \\"Health Maintenance Organizations\\" auch \\"Preferred Provider Organizations\\"., So genannte Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) sind vertraglich verpflichtet, ihre freiwilligen Mitglieder mit ambulanten, stationären und zum Teil auch zahnärztlichen Leistungen zu versorgen. Es werden auch die Kosten für Behandlungen durch Leistungserbringer übernommen, sofern diese zum Netzwerk der Vertragspartner dazugehören. Der monatliche Beitrag ist fix und unabhängig von der Inanspruchnahme der Leistungen. Selbstbeteiligung an den Kosten gibt es nur in Ausnahmefällen. Zu den großen Anbietern gehört beispielsweise Kaiser Permanente, die auch eigene Kliniken besitzt. Die HMOs haben ein Jahresbudget, nach dem sich die Beiträge für die Versicherungsnehmer richten. Der Vorteil dieses Geschäftsmodells ist, dass die Kosten aufgrund von Synergieeffekten geringer sind. HMOs erlassen gegenüber ihren Vertragspartnern Behandlungsgrundsätze, deren Einhaltung auch überwacht wird. Der Nachteil ist, dass ein Versicherter nur bei Ärzten und Kliniken behandelt wird, die dem jeweiligen Netzwerk angehören., Seit den 1990er Jahren hat der Marktanteil von PPOs \\"(Preferred Provider Organizations)\\" deutlich zugenommen. Im Jahr 2002 hatten PPOs bereits einen Marktanteil von 52 Prozent erreicht. Bei diesem Geschäftsmodell werden auch Kosten erstattet, die nicht bei Vertragsärzten und Vertragskliniken entstanden sind. Bei der Behandlung durch Vertragsärzte oder Vertragskliniken trägt der Versicherte aber einen geringeren Eigenanteil., Herkömmliche Krankenversicherungen kennen demgegenüber ke: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Gesundheitspolitik, Gesundheitssystem, Gesundheitswesen, Krankenversicherungsschutz, staatliche Gesundheitsfürsorge, medizinische Notfälle, private Krankenversicherung, Krankenversicherungsbeiträge, Versicherungspflicht, Einkommensschwache Einwohner"},{"instruction":"Crie para mim um livro com o título \\"conselhos do mestre\\"","output":"Capítulo 1: O Encontro Era uma tarde ensolarada quando Pedro, um jovem curioso e ávido por conhecimento, decidiu visitar uma pequena livraria localizada no centro da cidade. Ao adentrar no aconchegante estabelecimento, seus olhos foram imediatamente atraídos por um livro com o título \\"Conselhos do Mestre\\". Intrigado e instigado pela misteriosa capa do livro, Pedro decidiu desvendar o mistério das páginas amareladas que repousavam debaixo da capa empoeirada. Ele pegou o exemplar, sentou-se em uma confortável poltrona e começou a ler. Capítulo 2: Em busca do conhecimento As páginas do livro traziam conselhos preciosos de um famoso mestre espiritual, que havia vivido séculos antes. Cada capítulo abordava um tema diferente e carregado de sabedoria. Pedro ficava cada vez mais cativado pelas palavras do mestre, absorvendo lições sobre autoconhecimento, amor, compaixão, paciência e equilíbrio. Conforme ele mergulhava nas páginas, Pedro percebia que o conhecimento contido no \\"Conselhos do Mestre\\" transcendia o tempo e ressoava profundamente em sua alma. Ele começava a compreender que a busca pelo conhecimento não era apenas intelectual, mas sim uma jornada de descobertas internas. Capítulo 3: Despertando a consciência À medida que Pedro avançava no livro, adentrava em capítulos que o levavam a refletir sobre o significado da vida, o propósito de sua existência e o valor das experiências vividas. Os conselhos do mestre incentivavam Pedro a olhar além das superfícies, a não julgar precipitadamente e a buscar a compreensão profunda das situações em sua vida. Cada página era como uma luz acesa dentro de Pedro, clareando seu caminho e possibilitando uma autodescoberta cheia de reflexões impactantes. Ele percebia a importância de viver no presente, de valorizar cada momento e de encontrar a felicidade nas coisas simples da vida. Capítulo 4: As transformações Após a leitura completa do livro, Pedro sentiu que havia passado por uma jornada transformadora. Os conselhos do mestre foram como o pólen de uma flor que o polinizou, fazendo-o florescer em uma nova versão de si mesmo. Agora, Pedro percebia a importância de compartilhar o aprendizado que adquiriu. Ele decidiu abrir um grupo de estudos em sua comunidade, onde discutiriam os conselhos do mestre e como aplicá-los em suas vidas. Capítulo 5: Espalhando a sabedoria O grupo de estudos que Pedro criou tornou-se um sucesso. Pessoas de diferentes idades e background reuniam-se para compartilhar suas experiências e absorver os ensinamentos do livro. A comunidade cresceu em compreensão, empatia e amor. Pedro percebeu que, ao compartilhar os conselhos do mestre, ele também estava aprendendo cada vez mais. Os outros membros do grupo trouxeram perspectivas únicas e novas lições que o ajudaram a crescer como indivíduo. Capítulo 6: O legado O livro \\"Conselhos do Mestre\\" tornou-se uma referência na cidade, sendo lido e comentado por muitos. Até mesmo outras comunidades vizinhas ouviram falar do grupo de estudos de Pedro e começaram a se interessar pela sabedoria contida naquele misterioso livro. O legado do mestre continuava vivo, trazendo luz e inspiração para todos os que tinham a oportunidade de ler suas palavras. Pedro sabia que o conhecimento e a sabedoria são tesouros a serem compartilhados, e ele estava grato por fazer parte dessa corrente de aprendizado e transformação. Epílogo: A Jornada Continua Pedro percebeu que o aprendizado nunca se encerra. A busca pelo conhecimento e pela sabedoria é uma jornada constante, que nos leva a lugares inexplorados e nos torna melhores a cada passo dado. Enquanto o sol se punha, Pedro fechou o livro com cuidado, mantendo o espírito do mestre em seu coração. Ele sabia que a obra que tinha em mãos era mais do que um simples livro; era um guia, uma bússola para uma vida plena e significativa.

Hierzu wird für gewerbesteuerliche Zwecke ein Gewerbeertrag ermittelt, welcher regelmäßig in einem Gewerbesteuermessbetrag in Höhe von 3,5 % des Gewerbeertrags mündet. Die hebeberechtigte Gemeinde muss die Gewerbesteuer mindestens in Höhe des doppelten Messbetrages erheben (Hebesatzminimum: 200 %)., Eine ertragsunabhängige Besteuerung der Substanz des Gewerbebetriebs erfolgte bis 1997 mit der \\"Gewerbekapitalsteuer\\", seitdem nur noch in den Gewinnhinzurechnungen, die bestimmte Finanzierungskosten in die gewerbesteuerliche Bemessungsgrundlage einbeziehen. Mit der Unternehmensteuerreform 2008 wurde diese Komponente ausgeweitet, um das Gewerbesteueraufkommen zu verstetigen., Die Gewerbesteuer ist die wichtigste originäre Einnahmequelle der Gemeinden in Deutschland. Es handelt sich nach Abs.2 Abgabenordnung um eine Realsteuer oder Sachsteuer, auch wenn diese Einordnung nach der Abschaffung der Gewerbekapitalsteuer und der Lohnsummensteuer umstritten ist. Die Gewerbesteuer zählt zu den Gemeindesteuern und den Objektsteuern. Rechtsgrundlage ist das Gewerbesteuergesetz (GewStG), die Gewerbesteuer-Durchführungsverordnung sowie als allgemeine Verwaltungsvorschriften die Gewerbesteuer-Richtlinien., Äquivalenzprinzip., Mit der Zahlung von Steuern erwirbt man keinen Anspruch auf eine bestimmte staatliche Leistung ( Abs.1AO). Dennoch wird die Gewerbesteuer häufig damit begründet, dass die Gewerbebetriebe die Lasten tragen sollen, die durch ihre Ansiedlung und Existenz entstehen. Tatsächlich ist bei keiner anderen Steuer das Äquivalenzprinzip derart stark ausgeprägt. Erhoben wird sie nach einer vermuteten Kostenverursachung. Doch obwohl die Gewerbesteuer als Refinanzierung für Infrastrukturmaßnahmen und Siedlungsfolgelasten gedacht ist, liegt ihr Grund nicht in der Abgeltung greifbarer wirtschaftlicher Vorteile., Geschichte der Gewerbesteuer., Die Gewerbesteuer wurde in Preußen 1891 durch die Miquelsche Steuerreform eingeführt., Die Grundlagen für ihre heutige Ausprägung wurden in der Realsteuerreform von 1936 gelegt, das Gewerbesteuergesetz datiert vom 1.Dezember 1936. Neben der erhobenen Gewerbeertragsteuer wurden das Gewerbekapital und–über die Lohnsummensteuer– auch die Arbeitsplätze besteuert. Durch unterschiedliche Messzahlen wurde aus den drei verschiedenen Bereichen ein Gewerbesteuermessbetrag ermittelt, auf den dann der Hebesatz angewendet wurde., 1978 wurde wegen der damit verbundenen negativen beschäftigungspolitischen Konsequenzen zunächst die Lohnsummensteuer abgeschafft. Mit dem \\"Haushaltsbegleitgesetz 1983\\" wurde erstmals eine Abzugsbeschränkung für Dauerschuldzinsen eingeführt. Ursprünglich war eine vollständige Hinzurechnung von Dauerschuldzinsen vorgesehen, d.h. Zinszahlungen minderten den Gewerbeertrag nicht. Damit wurde eine Gleichbehandlung von Eigenfinanzierung und Fremdfinanzierung angestrebt, da (kalkulatorische) Zinsen auf das Eigenkapital die Bemessungsgrundlage ebenfalls nicht mindern. Dieser Anspruch wurde aus dem Ziel der Besteuerung der objektiven Ertragskraft abgeleitet. Durch Gesetzesänderung wurde dies jedoch auf 60 % (ab 1983) bzw. 50 % (ab 1984) begrenzt., Das \\"Gesetz zur Fortsetzung der Unternehmensteuerreform\\" beendete ab 1998 die Gewerbekapitalsteuer, so dass die Gewerbesteuer zu einer nur ertragsabhängigen Steuer geworden ist – was zu einer erhöhten Konjunkturabhängigkeit geführt hat. Als Ausgleich erhielten die Gemeinden eine Beteiligung an der Umsatzsteuer., Bis zum Veranlagungszeitraum 2007 galt neben der Hinzurechnung der Dauerschuldzinsen zudem die hälftige Hinzurechnung von Miet- und Pachtzinsen, wenn diese nicht bereits beim Empfänger der Zahlungen (also in der Regel dem Leasinggeber) der Gewerbesteuer unterliegen. Damit sollte eine Doppelbelastung mit Gewerbesteuer vermieden werden. Wegen der Ungleichbehandlung von deutschen und ausländischen Unternehmen und der damit einhergehenden Beschränkung des grenzüberschreitenden Dienstleistungsverkehrs hatte der EuGH diese Vorschrift in seiner Eurowings-Entscheidung allerdings für EU-rechtswidrig erklärt., Die letzte große Änderung folgte 2008 mit dem \\"Unternehmensteuerreformgesetz\\". Dieses führte u.a. zu einer neuen Behandlung der Gewerbesteuer bei der steuerlichen Gewinnermittlung. Ab 2008 ist diese gemäß Abs.5b EStG keine Betriebsausgabe mehr und somit nicht abzugsfähig. Ferner wurde der Umfang der Hinzurechnungen von Finanzierungsaufwendungen erheblich ausgeweitet. Die Verbreiterung der Bemessungsgrundlage sowie der Wegfall des Betriebsausgabenabzuges und des Staffeltarifs sollen durch die Absenkung der Gewerbesteuermesszahl und die Erhöhung der Gewerbesteueranrechnung auf Gesellschafterebene ausgeglichen werden., Besteuerungsverfahren., Besteuerungsgegenstand., Besteuert werden Gewerbebetriebe, die entweder über ihre Rechtsform als Kapitalgesellschaft oder über ihre gewerbliche Tätigkeit im Sinne des Einkommensteuerrechts (Einzelunternehmen und Personengesellschaften) erfasst werden. Dabei wird für natürliche Personen und Personengesellschaften ein Freibetrag von 24.500€ gewährt ( Abs.1 Nr.1 GewStG). Für sonstige juristische Personen des privaten Rechts (z.B. Vereine) und nichtrechtsfähige Vereine, soweit sie einen wirtschaftlichen Geschäftsbetrieb unterhalten, gilt ein Freibetrag von 5.000€ ( Abs.1 Nr.2 GewStG). Freiberufliche oder andere nichtgewerbliche selbstständige Tätigkeiten sowie Land- und Forstwirtschaftliche Betriebe unterliegen nicht der Gewerbesteuer., Bemessungsgrundlage., Ausgangsbasis für die Bemessung der Gewerbesteuer ist der Gewerbeertrag. Dies ist der nach Einkommensteuer- bzw. Körperschaftsteuerrecht zu bestimmende Gewinn. Im Regelfall wird der Gewinn bzw. Verlust übernommen und im Einzelfall um bestimmte Beträge erhöht (Hinzurechnungen, GewStG) oder vermindert (Kürzungen, GewStG). Sowohl Hinzurechnungen als auch Kürzungen verfolgen verschiedene Ziele, die teilweise damit begründet werden, dass die Bemessungsgrundlage die objektive Ertragskraft – von der Finanzierungsentscheidung des Unternehmers im Einzelfall unabhängiger, realer Gewerbeertrag – eines Gewerbebetriebs abbilden soll. Nach der ursprünglichen Vorstellung des Gesetzgebers arbeitet ein angenommener fiktiver Standardbetrieb mit eigenem Kapital, mit eigenen Maschinen, jedoch in fremden (angemieteten) Räumen. Die Vorschriften über Hinzurechnungen und Kürzungen haben sich jedoch auch aus fiskalischen Gründen mehrfach geändert, so dass umstritten bleibt, welche Hinzurechnungen bzw. Kürzungen mit diesem Ziel begründet werden können., Berechnungsschema der Gewerbesteuer:, Gewinn aus Gewerbebetrieb (Gewinn) gem. EStG bzw. KStG, + Hinzurechnungen, − Kürzungen, = Gewerbeertrag vor Verlustabzug, − Gewerbeverlust aus Vorjahren, = Gewerbeertrag (abzurunden auf volle 100€), − Freibetrag von 24.500 € (nur für Einzelunternehmen und Personengesellschaften), bzw. 5.000 € für sonstige juristische Personen des privaten Rechts (z.B. Vereine), sowie gewerblich aktive nichtrechtsfähige Vereine, = Gewerbeertrag × Steuermesszahl (seit 2008: 3,5 %), = Steuermessbetrag × Hebesatz der Gemeinde, = festzusetzende Gewerbesteuer, - Gewerbesteuer-Vorauszahlungen, = Gewerbesteuerzahllast, Hinzurechnungen., Seit 2008 wird ein Viertel der Finanzierungsaufwendungen dem Gewinn wieder hinzugerechnet. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn die Miet- und Pachtzahlungen beim Empfänger dieser Zahlungen der Gewerbesteuer unterliegen. Finanzierungsaufwand sind die Entgelte für Schulden, die Rentenzahlungen und dauernden Lasten, die Gewinnanteile stiller Gesellschafter und die Finanzierungsanteile in Mieten, Pachten, Leasingraten und Lizenzen. Diese Finanzierungsanteile werden pauschal aus den gezahlten Gesamtentgelten ermittelt. Mit der Ausweitung der Regelung ist die zuvor beschriebene EU-Rechtswidrigkeit beseitigt. Um kleine und mittlere Unternehmen von der Ausweitung der Hinzurechnungen auszunehmen, ist ein Freibetrag von 200.000€ (bis einschl. 2019: 100.000 €) vorgesehen., Neben den Finanzierungsaufwendungen werden noch weitere Positionen dem Gewinn wieder hinzugerechnet: Die Gewinnanteile, die an persönlich haftende Gesellschafter einer KGaA verteilt worden sind ( Nr.4 GewStG), die nach den Vorschriften des Teileinkünfteverfahrens zuvor steuerfrei gestellten Dividenden ( Nr.5 GewStG), die Anteile am Verlust einer in- oder ausländischen gewerblichen Mitunternehmerschaft ( Nr.8 GewStG), die Zuwendungen zur Förderung steuerbegünstigter Zwecke ( Nr.9 GewStG) sowie bestimmte Teilwertabschreibungen und Veräußerungsverluste ( Nr.10 GewStG)., Kürzungen., Durch die Kürzungen soll eine mehrfache Belastung mit Realsteuern vermieden werden. So wird der Gewerbeertrag beispielsweise um einen Teil des Einheitswerts von betrieblichen Grundstücken gekürzt, da diese bereits der Grundsteuer unterliegen. Daneben werden insbesondere Gewinnanteile aus qualifizierten Beteiligungen (mehr als 15-%-Anteil) gekürzt, da diese bereits auf Ebene der ausschüttenden Kapitalgesellschaft der Gewerbesteuer unterlagen (sog. gewerbesteuerliches Schachtelprivileg). Überdies werden, um dem Inlandscharakter der Gewerbesteuer Rechnung zu tragen, ausländische Gewinnanteile gekürzt., Erweiterte Kürzung., Wohnungsbauunternehmen (Kapitalgesellschaft oder Genossenschaft) und andere grundstücksverwaltende Gesellschaften können den Vorteil der sogenannten \\"erweiterten Gewerbesteuerkürzung\\" (Vorschriften des ) in Anspruch nehmen.

Sie stammt aus Nordamerika und wird überall in Europa seit fast 400 Jahren in Parks und Gärten gepflanzt. Sie wächst inzwischen auch wild., Die Gewöhnliche Robinie war Baum des Jahres 2020 in Deutschland. In der Schweiz wird die Art auf der Schwarzen Liste der invasiven Neophyten geführt., Taxonomie., Die Gewöhnliche Robinie ist eine Pflanzenart aus der Unterfamilie der Schmetterlingsblütler (Faboideae) in der Familie der Hülsenfrüchtler (Fabaceae)., Die Robinie wird landläufig, nach ihrem Artnamen \\"pseudoacacia\\", auch als \\"falsche Akazie\\" bezeichnet. Sie ist zwar mit den Akazien (\\"Acacia\\") nicht besonders nah verwandt, die ihrerseits zur Unterfamilie der Mimosengewächse (Mimosoideae) gehören, beide ähneln sich jedoch in der Form der gefiederten Blätter und Dornen. Aber bereits die Blütenformen sind sehr verschieden. Eine Verwechslung von Arten beider Gattungen ist in Mitteleuropa nahezu ausgeschlossen, da Akazien nur in subtropischen und tropischen Gebieten heimisch sind und in Mittel- und Westeuropa nur an ganz wenigen Orten mit besonders mildem Klima gedeihen., Die Arten der Gattung \\"Robinia\\" (Robinien) sind fast alle Sträucher, Bäume sind neben \\"Robinia pseudoacacia\\" nur noch \\"Robinia neomexicana\\" und \\"Robinia viscosa\\"., Inwieweit verschiedene Formen der Robinie auf Kreuzungen mit anderen Robinienarten oder Mutationen zurückgehen, ist nicht immer sicher. Bekannt ist \\"Robinia pseudoacacia\\" var. \\"rectissima\\", welche 1936 in Long Island gefunden wurde. Markant für diese Varietät, deren Status allerdings umstritten ist, ist ein kerzengerader Schaft, der auch im Freistand ausgebildet wird. Diese Form hat ihr die Bezeichnung „Schiffsmast-Robinie“ eingebracht. Nachkommen dieser Bäume sind in der Forstpflanzenzüchtung begehrt., Namensherkunft., Carl von Linné, der die Gattung der Robinien (\\"Robinia\\") erstmals wissenschaftlich veröffentlichte, benannte diese nach Jean Robin, dem Hofgärtner der französischen Könige Heinrich III., Heinrich IV. und Ludwig XIII., Das wissenschaftliche Artepitheton \\"pseudoacacia\\" weist auf die (irreführende) Ähnlichkeit mit den Akazien hin. Die gelegentliche Verwendung des Trivialnamens Silberregen ist auf die traubenförmigen, herabhängenden weißen Blütenstände des Baums zurückzuführen – offenkundig in Anlehnung an die Namen der ebenfalls zu den Schmetterlingsblütengewächsen zählenden Gehölze Goldregen (Laburnum) und Blauregen (Wisteria)., Beschreibung., Erscheinungsbild (Habitus)., Die Gewöhnliche Robinie ist ein sommergrüner Baum mit rundlicher oder locker schirmartiger Krone, der im Freistand Wuchshöhen von 12 bis 20m und im geschlossenen Bestand Wuchshöhen von 20 bis 30m erreichen kann. Der Stammdurchmesser kann über 1 Meter erreichen. Die raue, dicke Borke des Stamms ist grau- bis dunkelbraun, tief gefurcht und häufig längsrissig. Die Äste stehen gedreht an einem kurzen Stamm, der zur Ausbildung einer Doppelkrone neigt. Der Baum ist weitgehend winterfrosthart., Die Gewöhnliche Robinie begrünt sich erst sehr spät im Frühjahr. Die wechselständigen und unpaarig gefiederten Laubblätter besitzen eine Länge von 15 bis 30cm. Sie bestehen aus einer leicht rinnigen Rhachis und etwa 9 bis 23 eiförmigen bis elliptischen oder länglichen, ganzrandigen und kurz gestielten, abgerundeten bis eingebuchteten, teils feinstachelspitzigen und 2–5cm langen Einzelblättchen. Sie können sich durch kleine Gelenke bei großer Hitze senkrecht nach unten klappen (Thermonastien). Es sind schnell abfallende, nadelige und minutiöse Stipellen vorhanden., Während der Blütenstandsbereich und die Krone meist ohne Dornen sind, sind besonders an den Schösslingen die Nebenblätter zu bis 3cm langen, rotbraun gefärbten Dornen umgebildet., Blütenstände und Blüten., Die weißen, gestielten Blüten der Gewöhnlichen Robinie erscheinen in den Monaten Mai bis Juni. Jeweils 10 bis 25 der stark bergamotteartig duftenden Blüten sind zusammengefasst in zwischen 10 und 25 Zentimeter langen, hängenden und traubigen, achselständigen Blütenständen an den jungen Zweigen. Die typischen Schmetterlingsblüten mit grün-rötlichem, haarigem Kelch bieten reichlich Nektar und werden daher von vielen Insekten aufgesucht, gern auch von Honigbienen. Im Elsass waren deshalb Robinien als Bienenweide für „Akazienhonig“ gepflanzt worden. Nektar und Staubbeutel werden gleichzeitig reif. Setzt sich ein Insekt auf die Blüte, tritt zuerst die Narbe heraus, die den eventuell mitgebrachten Pollen vom Bauch abbürstet., Früchte und Samen., Es werden seitlich stark abgeflachte, bespitzte und bauchseitig etwas geflügelte Hülsen gebildet. Sie sind braun, kurz gestielt, etwa 5 bis 12 Zentimeter lang und 1 bis 1,5 Zentimeter breit. Ihre Hülle ist pergamentig-ledrig. In den inneren Einbuchtungen der Hülsen liegen etwa 4 bis 14 Samen. Diese abgeflachten, rot- bis dunkelbraunen, etwas gesprenkelten und leicht nierenförmigen Samen, die im September ausgereift sind, sind 4 bis 7 Millimeter lang, glatt und sehr hartschalig. Die sie umgebende Hülse reißt allmählich während des Winters entlang der Rücken- sowie der Bauchnaht auf. Da die Früchte oder samenhaltigen Hülsen-Hälften mitunter bis in das nächste Frühjahr am Baum hängen bleiben und von starken Winden weit verweht werden, zählt die Gewöhnliche Robinie zu den sogenannten Winterstehern., Chromosomenzahl., Die Chromosomenzahl beträgt 2n = 20 oder 22., Ausbreitungsstrategie., Die Gewöhnliche Robinie blüht und fruchtet bereits im sechsten Lebensjahr. Sie verbreitet ihre Samen durch den Wind (sogenannte Anemochorie), jedenfalls so lange sie noch in den Hülsen oder Hülsenhälften hängen. Die Distanz, die die Samen der Pflanze auf diese Weise überwinden können, ist wegen ihres hohen Gewichts verhältnismäßig gering. Nur selten werden die Samen weiter als 100Meter verbreitet. Einzelsamen gehen auch bei Wind nur in der unmittelbaren Umgebung des Mutterbaumes zu Boden. Ihre Samen sind sehr lange keimfähig, die Dauer der Keimfähigkeit wird auf bis zu 30Jahre geschätzt. Zur Keimung benötigen die Pflanzen jedoch sehr viel Sonnenlicht. Diese Eigenschaften bedingen die Pionierfähigkeit der Robinie. Ausgehend von bestehenden Samenbäumen kann die Robinie sehr schnell neue offene Standorte bewachsen; die Art neigt sehr stark zum Verwildern., Die Robinie vermehrt sich außerdem durch Wurzelschösslinge vegetativ. Diese auch als „klonales Wachstum“ bezeichnete Verbreitung wird begünstigt, wenn es zu Standortstörungen wie etwa Bränden oder Rodungen kommt. Die Gewöhnliche Robinie reagiert darauf mit einer verstärkten Ausbildung von Wurzelbrut, die zu einer Verdichtung bereits bestehender Bestände führt; andere Arten werden dadurch verdrängt., Verbreitung., Natürliches Vorkommen., Die Gewöhnliche Robinie ist im atlantischen Nordamerika beheimatet und im Gebiet der Appalachen sowie der US-Bundesstaaten Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama und Arkansas verbreitet. Sie wächst dort als Pionierpflanze in Laubmischwäldern auf mäßig nährstoffreichen Sand- und Lehmböden in Höhen von bis zu 1600Metern. Ihr natürliches Verbreitungsgebiet zeichnet sich durch ein humides Klima mit jährlichen Niederschlägen zwischen 1020 und 1830Millimetern aus., Wie von Kowarik zitierten Untersuchungen zeigen, leitet die Gewöhnliche Robinie in ihrem ursprünglichen Verbreitungsgebiet die Waldregeneration nach „katastrophalen“ Störungen wie Waldbränden oder Kahlschlägen ein. Das neu besiedelte Gebiet wird für etwa 20 bis 30Jahre von dieser Baumart dominiert, bis sie von anderen Baumarten wie dem Tulpenbaum verdrängt wird. Die Baumarten, welche die Gewöhnliche Robinie an ihrem Standort zu verdrängen vermögen, wachsen höher als sie und spenden sehr stark Schatten. In Waldbeständen der Appalachen, die sich seit längerer Zeit ungestört entwickeln konnten, beträgt der Anteil der Robinie weniger als 4 %., Verbreitungsgebiet., Die anspruchslose Robinie wurde durch den Menschen in zahlreiche Gebiete verbreitet, die nicht zu ihrem ursprünglichen Verbreitungsraum gehören. Sie ist damit eine sogenannte hemerochore Pflanze und zählt aufgrund ihrer Einführung nach 1492 in Europa zu den Neophyten. Sie ist heute in Europa, Nordafrika, West- und Ostasien zu finden. Auch in Nordamerika hat sie, ausgehend von Anpflanzungen, ihr Verbreitungsgebiet sowohl räumlich als auch standortlich erheblich erweitert. Sowohl in Europa als auch in den neu besiedelten nordamerikanischen Verbreitungsgebieten wächst sie auf Standorten, die wesentlich trockener sind als die in ihrem ursprünglichen Verbreitungsgebiet., In den deutschen Wäldern kommt die Gewöhnliche Robinie nach den Ergebnissen der Dritten Bundeswaldinventur (2012) mit insgesamt 11.000 Hektar in der Hauptbestockung und 9.000 Hektar in der Jungbestockung vor, was einem Flächenanteil von deutlich unter einem Prozent entspricht. Daneben ist sie aber in Deutschland außerhalb der Wälder als Park- und Stadtbaum sowie „verwildert“ in trockenen Gebüschen, auf Brachflächen und entlang von Bahndämmen häufig vertreten. In der Schweiz wurde sie aufgrund ihres Ausbreitungspotenzials und der Schäden in den Bereichen Biodiversität, Gesundheit bzw. Ökonomie in die \\"Schwarze Liste der invasiven Neophyten\\" aufgenommen., Einführungsgeschichte in Europa., Nach Europa wurde die Robinie, so die meisten Quellen, im Jahr 1601 von Jean Robin, dem Pharmazeuten und Botaniker der Könige von Frankreich, aus Virginia eingeführt. Im Jardin des Plantes und auf der Place René Viviani vor der Nordfassade der Kirche St. Julien-le-Pauvre unweit von Notre-Dame werden zwei von Robin gepflanzte Exemplare als älteste Bäume von Paris angesehen. Die Robinie auf der Place Viviani mit einem Stammumfang von 3,90m ist vermutlich der ältere. Sie wurde im Ersten Weltkrieg durch Bomben beschädigt und von drei Betonpfeilern gestützt, blüht aber immer noch. Der Baum ist im Verzeichnis der bemerkenswerten Bäume Frankreichs (\\"Arbres rem: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Seine Farbe ist oberseits schwarz, unterseits weiß. Er lebt in den Küstengewässern des Nordatlantiks vor Europa, Nordwestafrika und dem Osten Nordamerikas, im Schwarzen Meer sowie in den amerikanischen und asiatischen Küstengewässern des Nordpazifiks. Seine Nahrung sind Fische, Krebstiere und Tintenfische., Schweinswale sind die mit Abstand häufigsten Wale in der Nord- und Ostsee, der Bestand ist jedoch rückläufig. Ursachen sind wahrscheinlich die Gifteinleitungen in die Meere und der Erstickungstod in Fischernetzen. Die Deutsche Wildtier Stiftung wählte den Gewöhnlichen Schweinswal zum Tier des Jahres 2022., Besonders in älterer Literatur wird der Gewöhnliche Schweinswal auch „Kleiner Tümmler“, „Braunfisch“ (niederländisch: \\"bruinvis\\") oder „Meerschwein“ genannt., Aussehen., Mit einer Körperlänge von maximal 1,85 Meter, in sehr seltenen Fällen auch über zwei Meter, ist der Schweinswal in europäischen Gewässern die kleinste vorkommende Art der Wale. Dabei schwanken die Körpergrößen je nach Untersuchungsgebiet, die Schweinswale der Ostsee werden etwa nur durchschnittlich 1,40 Meter (Männchen) bzw. 1,52 Meter (Weibchen) lang. Sein Körpergewicht beträgt durchschnittlich zwischen 50 und 60 Kilogramm und maximal etwa 90 Kilogramm, dabei sind die Weibchen größer und schwerer als die Männchen. Die Geschlechtsunterscheidung erfolgt wie bei den meisten Walen aufgrund der Lage der Afteröffnung und der Genitalfalte. Diese liegen bei den Weibchen eng beieinander im Afterbereich, bei den Männchen deutlich getrennt, wobei die Genitalfalte hier weiter vorne liegt., Im Vergleich zu anderen Zahnwalen ist der Schädel der Tiere vorn nur relativ wenig ausgezogen, durch ein aufliegendes Fettpolster ist diese „Schnauze“, das Rostrum, jedoch äußerlich nicht erkennbar. Der Körper ist gedrungen mit einer flachen und dreieckigen Rückenfinne. Der Rücken ist schwarz und mit einem von der Rückenflosse ausgehenden grauen Feld versehen, der Bauch ist weiß. Vom Mundwinkel führt eine schwarze Zeichnung bis zum vorderen Ansatz der Flipper., Die Rückenflosse, die Brustflossen, die Schwanzflosse (Fluke) sowie der Flukenstiel sind ebenfalls schwarz gefärbt. Bei jugendlichen Tieren sind auch Teile der Bauchseite schwarz, man spricht in diesem Fall von Jugendmelanismus. Albinismus ist unter den Schweinswalen sehr selten. Die Rückenflosse selbst besitzt keine konkave Rundung, sondern fällt hinten senkrecht ab, die Basis ist etwa doppelt so lang wie die Höhe der Flosse. Die Flipper sind relativ kurz und enden spitz. Die Fluke ist etwa 60 Zentimeter breit und kräftig gebaut., Die Kiefer beinhalten im Oberkiefer auf jeder Seite 22 bis 28, im Unterkiefer 21 bis 25 sehr kurze Zähne, die blatt- bis spatelförmig sind. Die hinteren Zähne weisen eine dreihöckrige Kaufläche auf., Population und Verbreitung., Der Schweinswal bevorzugt flache Gewässer, dabei wandert er im Frühjahr in die Küstengewässer und im Herbst in die küstenferneren Gebiete., Sein Verbreitungsgebiet umfasst große Teile der nördlichen Erdhalbkugel. An der amerikanischen Nordpazifikküste findet man die Tiere von Los Angeles bis an die Mündung des Mackenzie River in die Beaufortsee, an der asiatischen Pazifikküste vom Gelben Meer bis zur Tschuktschensee. Im Nordatlantik findet man ihn an der Ostküste Amerikas von Cape Cod bis Upernavik, manchmal auch an der grönländischen Küste bei Thule., Die östliche Atlantikküste bevölkern die Schweinswale von Nordafrika (Senegal, Mauretanien, Marokko) über die gesamte europäische Küstenlinie bis an die Küsten von Spitzbergen inklusive der Nordsee. In der Ostsee wird die Beltsee besiedelt, wobei über das Kattegat Populationen mit der Nordsee ausgetauscht werden. Im Mittelmeer gibt es keine eigenen Bestände, allerdings kommt es nicht selten zu Einwanderungen in das westliche Mittelmeer bis Mallorca über die Meerenge von Gibraltar sowie in das östliche Mittelmeer (Ägäis) aus dem Schwarzen Meer, wo es eine eigene Population gibt. In jüngerer Zeit werden vermehrt wieder Schweinswale in norddeutschen Flüssen gesichtet, nachdem sie seit hundert Jahren zunehmend aufgrund der Wasserverschmutzung verschwunden waren., Die Gesamtzahl der heute noch lebenden Schweinswale ist unbekannt, es wird jedoch davon ausgegangen, dass sie weltweit noch sehr hoch liegt. Das Bundesamt für Naturschutz gibt in seinem Monitoringbericht die Zahl für die deutschen Nordseegewässer in Abhängigkeit von der Jahreszeit mit 15.000 bis 54.000 an. Die Gesamtpopulation für die Nordsee wird auf 300.000 Exemplare geschätzt. Kleiner sind die Individuenzahlen einzelner Lokalpopulationen, vor allem im Schwarzen Meer und in der Ostsee. In der Ostsee wird der Bestand im westlichen Teil auf 800 bis 2.000 im östlichen und zentralen auf 100 bis 600 Tiere geschätzt. Gefährdet sind Schweinswale vor allem durch die Fischerei und die lauter gewordenen Meere durch Schiffsverkehr und Pfahlrammungen für Offshorewindparks, bei denen aus Kostengründen der schallvermindernde Blasenschleier nicht eingesetzt wird. Die Zahl der Totfunde hat sich in den letzten 10 Jahren an der Küste Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns verdreifacht. Die Art wird von der International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources als gefährdet eingeschätzt., Der Schweinswal steht in allen europäischen Staaten unter Naturschutz und ist im Anhang II des Washingtoner Artenschutzabkommens gelistet. Die Europäische Union verbietet Einfuhr, Transport und Haltung., Lebensweise., Die Schweinswale bevorzugen als Lebensraum ruhige Küstenbereiche mit mäßiger Tiefe von etwa 20 Metern, kommen jedoch gelegentlich auch in Hochseegewässern vor., Schweinswale ernähren sich beinahe ausschließlich von Fischen, daneben auch von Borstenwürmern, Schnecken, Krebstieren und Tintenfischen. Die Nahrungszusammensetzung variiert dabei je nach den geografischen Verhältnissen. In der Nordsee stellen die Plattfische (Pleuronectiformes) einen sehr großen Anteil dar, in der Ostsee die Grundeln (Gobiidae), außerdem in beiden Gewässern der Kabeljau (\\"Gadus morhua\\"). Die gefressenen Fische sind dabei meistens kleiner als 25 Zentimeter, da die Schweinswale größere Fische nicht verschlucken können. Die Nahrungssuche findet vor allem am Gewässergrund statt, wo der Schweinswal den Boden aufwühlt. Die Tagesration eines Wales liegt bei etwa 4,5 Kilogramm Fisch., Natürliche Feinde der Schweinswale sind vor allem größere Haie und Schwertwale. So fand man Schweinswalreste im Magen des Grönlandhais (\\"Somniosus microcephalus\\") sowie des Weißen Hais (\\"Carcharodon carcharias\\"). Der Schwertwal (\\"Orcinus orca\\") stellt im Vergleich zu den Haien jedoch den natürlichen Hauptfeind der Schweinswale dar. Daneben verhalten sich auch andere Zahnwale gelegentlich aggressiv gegenüber ihrem kleinen Verwandten. So wurden mehrfach Große Tümmler (\\"Tursiops truncatus\\") und Gemeine Delfine (\\"Delphinus delphis\\") beobachtet, die Schweinswalen durch Stöße mit ihrem Kopf in die Flanke schwere Verletzungen beibrachten. Als bedeutender Fressfeind wurde durch Untersuchungen an gestrandeten Kadavern junger Schweinswale auch die Kegelrobbe nachgewiesen., Als Parasiten sind vor allem Meerneunaugen sowie Fadenwürmer, Saugwürmer, Bandwürmer und Kratzer nennenswert. Die durch die Fischnahrung aufgenommenen Fadenwürmer der Gattung \\"Ansisakis\\" werden dabei regelmäßig in großen Knäueln im Magen der Wale gefunden und \\"Stenurus minor\\" bevölkert die Bronchien, die Lunge sowie das Herz-Kreislaufsystem und kann durch Ansiedlung im Gehör die Wale auch taub machen. Ein besonders häufiger Parasit des Magen-Darm-Traktes sowie der Gallengänge ist der Saugwurm \\"Campula oblanga\\", der unter anderem Hepatitis und Cholangitis auslösen kann. Außenparasiten wie etwa die Walläuse sind bei den Schweinswalen dagegen eher selten zu finden., Verhalten., Schweinswale leben meistens als Einzelgänger oder in Zweierverbänden. Größere Gruppen bis maximal sieben Tiere, Schulen genannt, konnten bislang nur selten beobachtet werden. Zur Paarungszeit und zur Nahrungssuche treffen sich gelegentlich mehrere Schulen, sodass Herden von über hundert Tieren entstehen können. Diese sind jedoch selten und nicht sehr lange von Bestand. Jungtiere bleiben immer eine Zeit lang bei ihrer Mutter, die genaue Dauer ist unbekannt. Dabei ist die Bindung zwischen Jungtier und Mutter sehr eng und allein gelassene Junge stoßen Stresslaute aus, um die Mutter zu rufen., Ebenfalls nicht bekannt ist, ob Schweinswale Reviere bilden und diese gegen Eindringlinge verteidigen oder ob es eine Rangordnung unter Schweinswalen gibt. Allerdings wurde von Drohverhaltensweisen bei Schweinswalen berichtet. So droht ein Tier einem anderen durch Zuwenden des Kopfes und Ausstoßen von Klicklauten, danach kommt es zu einem Kopfnicken sowie Schlägen mit dem Schwanz., Schweinswale erreichen Geschwindigkeiten von maximal etwa 22km/h und springen nur sehr selten aus dem Wasser. Die maximale Tauchtiefe beträgt etwa 90Meter und die Tauchzeit etwa sechs Minuten. Die meiste Zeit schwimmen die Tiere mit einer Geschwindigkeit von etwa 7km/h dicht unter der Wasseroberfläche und durchstoßen diese beim normalen Schwimmen etwa zwei- bis viermal pro Minute, um zu atmen. Beim Auftauchen verkrümmt der Wal seinen Körper zu einem Halbkreis und taucht direkt nach dem Atemvorgang mit dem Kopf voran wieder ab. Hermann Burmeister beschrieb 1853 dieses Verhalten folgendermaßen:, Den Vortrieb liefert beinahe ausschließlich die Schwanzflosse, die auf- und abwärts geschlagen wird. Die Brustflossen dienen vor allem der Steuerung und der Stabilisierung im Wasser. Einen wesentlichen Einfluss auf die Geschwindigkeit hat die Beschaffenheit der glatten Haut sowie die stromlinienförmige Gestalt der Tiere. Ausgedehnte Ruhephasen gibt es nicht, stattdessen verharren die Tiere mehrmals in der Stunde für vier bis sechs Sekunden in einer Ruhestellung an der Wasseroberfläche, wobei sie jedoch absinken und dann wieder in ihren natürlichen Bewegungsrhythmus zurückfallen., Eine wichtige Rolle im Verhalten der Schweinswale spielt die Fähigkeit, Laute von sich zu geben, das Spektrum ist dabei sehr groß. Die Kommunikation der Tiere erfolgt über Klicklaute, die aus hochfrequenten (110 bis 150Kilohertz) und tieffrequenten (etwa 2Kilohertz) Tönen aufgebaut sind. Hinzu kommen Töne, die die Tiere zur Echolokalisation abgeben: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"FFH-Arten, Schweinswale, Gewöhnlicher Schweinswal, Nordatlantik, Ostsee, Küstengewässer, Fischerei, Naturschutz, Lebensraum, Kommunikation"},{"instruction":"CAN u give me a udf of a Non-uniform heat flux on this reciver based on jeters profile?","output":"Certainly!

Der Trivialname „Erdfinsterspinne“ rührt von der einst angenommenen Zugehörigkeit der Bodentrichterspinnen (\\"Coelotes\\") mitsamt dieser Art zur Familie der Finsterspinnen (Amaurobiidae), die jedoch mittlerweile widerlegt ist., Das Verbreitungsgebiet der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne erstreckt sich von Europa bis in die Türkei. Dort kommt sie in einem breiten Spektrum an Habitaten (Lebensräumen) vor, ist jedoch besonders in Wäldern verschiedener Art auffindbar und bewohnt dort mit großer Vorliebe den Bodenbereich. Dabei ist die Häufigkeit der Art von der Diversität des Waldbiotops mitsamt den unterschiedlichen Mikrohabitaten sowie der Luftfeuchtigkeit abhängig. Letztere ist bei der Wahl des Lebensraumes vor allem deshalb relevant, da die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne eher hemihygrophil (feuchtigkeitsliebend) ist und deshalb zu trockene, aber auch zu feuchte Habitate meidet., Die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne legt wie alle den Trichterspinnen angehörigen Arten ein für die Familie typisches und namensgebendes Trichternetz zum Fang von Beutetieren an, dessen Aufbau allerdings bei dieser Art variieren kann. Neben dem eigentlichen Netzteppich für den Beutefang verfügt das Netz dementsprechend auch über eine in einem Hohlraum angelegte Wohnröhre. Mithilfe des Fangnetzes erbeutet die Spinne ein großes Spektrum an anderen Wirbellosen, besonders jedoch Käfer. Das Weibchen der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne zeigt ein verglichen mit anderen Spinnen hochentwickeltes Brutverhalten. Die Jungtiere verweilen noch einige Zeit im Netz und werden von ihrer Mutter gefüttert, ehe sie sich verselbstständigen., Merkmale., Das Weibchen der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne erreicht eine Körperlänge von 10 bis 13 und das Männchen eine von 8 bis 10 Millimetern. Der Körperbau der Art entspricht dem anderer Bodentrichterspinnen (\\"Coelotes\\")., Das Prosoma (Vorderkörper) der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne ist wie bei den anderen Bodentrichterspinnen und anders als bei anderen Trichterspinnen kaum verschmälert. Der Carapax (Rückenschild des Prosomas) ist dunkel rotbraun bis schwarz gefärbt. Das Sternum (Brustschild des Prosomas) erscheint fast schwarz. Die Beine der Art sind einfarbig rotbraun bis dunkel rotbraun gefärbt., Das Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) besitzt eine dunkelgraue bis schwarzgraue Grundfärbung. Dorsal (rückenseitig) befindet sich auf selbiger Seite ebenfalls im anterioren (vorderen) Teil des Opisthosomas ein dunkles Medianband, das nach hinten hin zunehmend verengt und schließlich am posterioren (hinteren) Bereich des Opisthosomas in eine gelbgraue Winkelzeichnung übergeht. Posterior befinden sich auf der dorsalen Fläche des Opisthosoma gelblich-graue Seitenstreifen. Lateral (seitlich) ist das Opisthosoma mit gelblichgrauen Mustern versehen., Genitalmorphologische Merkmale., Beim Männchen der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne verfügt ein einzelner Pedipalpus (umgewandelte Extremität im Kopfbereich), wie bei Bodentrichterspinnen (\\"Coelotes\\") üblich, über eine Apophyse (chitinisierter Fortsatz) an der Patella (Glied zwischen Femur (Schenkel) und Tibia (Schiene)), dessen distaler Rand deutlich eingerückt ist. Der Konduktor (Samenleiter) eines einzelnen Bulbus (männliches Geschlechtsorgan) weist eine schmale, kurze Spitze auf., Die Epigyne (äußeres weibliches Geschlechtsorgan) der Art wird innerhalb der Gattung besonders durch die parallel verlaufenden Seitenränder gekennzeichnet. Der Vorderrand ist stark ausgeprägt. Dazwischen befindet sich eine quadratische Grube., Differenzierung von ähnlichen Spinnen., Die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne sieht vielen anderen Arten der Bodentrichterspinnen (\\"Coelotes\\") ähnlich, etwa der Alpen-Bodentrichterspinne (\\"C. solitarius\\"). Die anderen Vertreter der Gattung verfügen über ein kleineres Verbreitungsgebiet oder sind im Allgemeinen seltener als die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne., Die meisten Ähnlichkeiten teilt die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne mit der Westlichen Bodentrichterspinne (\\"C. atropos\\"), deren Opisthosoma meistens heller und weniger deutlich gezeichnet ist. Außerdem ist beim Männchen der Westlichen Bodentrichterspinne die Apophyse an der Patella mit drei kurzen, abgerundeten Fortsätzen ausgestattet, während die Epigyne dieser Art anterolateral (vorne seitlich) eine undeutliche Vorwölbung aufweist., Die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne kann überdies leicht mit der sehr ähnlichen und zu den Scheinbodentrichterspinnen (\\"Inermocoelotes\\") zählenden Stachellosen Bodentrichterspinne (\\"I. inermis\\") verwechselt werden, die ebenfalls gemeinsam mit der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne angetroffen kann, wenn auch zumeist in geringerer Individuendichte. Aufgrund der starken Ähnlichkeiten beider Arten zueinander lässt sich die Stachellose Bodentrichterspinne genauso lediglich anhand genitalmorphologischer Merkmale sicher von der Stachellosen Bodentrichterspinne unterscheiden. Der Konduktor eines einzelnen Bulbus ist bei der Stachellosen Bodentrichterspinne basal mit einem breiten Fortsatz versehen und die Spitze von je einem Bulbus verläuft quer zur Längsachse des Cymbiums (drittes und letztes Sklerit, bzw. Hartteil des Bulbus). Die Grube der Epigyne des Weibchens ist bei dieser Art doppelt so lang wie breit und besitzt überdies ein mehr oder weniger gewundenes Erscheinungsbild., Vorkommen., Die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne ist in Europa und der Türkei vertreten. Das Verbreitungsgebiet reicht nördlich bis nach Dänemark. In Mitteleuropa ist die Art mit Ausnahme des Baltikums und der Oblast Kaliningrad sowie Kroatien flächendeckend verbreitet, was auch auf Westeuropa zutrifft. Dort ist die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne in den Benelux-Ländern, auf dem Festland Frankreichs und auf Großbritannien nachgewiesen., Auf Großbritannien selber ist die Art vor allem im Südosten Englands vertreten und ersetzt dort die Westliche Bodentrichterspinne (\\"Coelotes atropos\\"). Von den anderen Teilen Großbritanniens existieren nur vereinzelte Funde der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne. Alte Überlieferungen der Art aus Yorkshire und Berwickshire beruhen vermutlich auf Verwechslungen mit der Westlichen Bodentrichterspinne, die im Gegensatz zur Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne vor allem den Westen und den Norden Großbritanniens bewohnt., In Osteuropa ist die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne nur in der Ukraine und in Belarus präsent, während sie in Südosteuropa bislang in den Staaten Rumänien, Bulgarien und Nordmazedonien sowie auf dem Festland Griechenlands und dem europäischen Teil der Türkei nachgewiesen wurde., In Deutschland bewohnt die Art besonders die gebirgigen Regionen. Beispiele sind die Fränkische Alb, der Burgberg bei Erlangen und das Gebiet des Ortsteils Rathsberg bei Erlangen., Lebensräume., Die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne bewohnt bevorzugt Wälder, die nicht zu trocken sein dürfen. Darunter wiederum werden insbesondere Laub- und Nadelwälder gesucht, die eine höhere Bonität (Qualität des Bodengrunds) aufweisen. Am häufigsten bewohnt die Art gebirgige Waldgebiete auf lehmigen Böden. Die Spinne bewohnt aber genauso ebene Areale mit sandigem Untergrund, wobei sie die Unterschiede der Feuchtigkeit beider Bodengründe dadurch ausgleicht, indem sie Gebiete mit hohem Grundwasserstand besiedelt., Die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne benötigt, wie für hemihygrophile (feuchtigkeitsliebende) Arten üblich, zwar eine höhere Sättigung von Wasserdampf in der umgebenden Luft, besitzt dabei aber verglichen mit anderen Lebensformen, die eine gleiche Bevorzugung besitzen, eine hohe Widerstandsfähigkeit gegenüber der relativen Luftfeuchte von 30 % bis 75 %. Aufgrund dessen ist es der Spinne auch möglich, Trockengebiete mit Rohhumus zu bewohnen, da dieser eine hohe Wasserkapazität sowie gute Isolation gegenüber einer für die Spinne zu hohen Wärme aufweist., Da die Feuchtigkeit in den von der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne bevorzugten Habitaten stark schwankt, ist die Art dort in inselartigen Populationen vertreten. In Übergangsgebieten der bevorzugten Lebensräume, darunter trockene dürftige Kiefernbestände, kann die Spinne ebenfalls zahlreich vorkommen. Dies ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass sie sich nicht in umgebende Trockengebiete ausbreiten kann., Von Wäldern ausgehend bewohnt die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne auch Waldränder, Feldgehölze sowie Busch- und Heckenlandschaften. Gelegentlich werden auch holzarme Offenlandhabitate, wie Magerrasen, Brachen, Ruderalflächen oder Heiden von der Art besiedelt. Auf Großbritannien ließ sich die Spinne zusätzlich auch an mit Moosen bewachsenen Gewässerufern nachweisen., Gefährdung., Der Gefährdungsgrad der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne fällt je nach Land unterschiedlich aus. Die Art gilt in ihrem Verbreitungsgebiet grundsätzlich als sehr häufig. In der Roten Liste gefährdeter Arten Tiere, Pflanzen und Pilze Deutschlands wird die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne als „ungefährdet“ eingestuft, da sie auch in Deutschland als sehr häufig gilt und die Bestände sowohl lang- als auch kurzfristig gleichbleibend sind., Obgleich dort deutlich seltener, so wird die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne in der Roten Liste Großbritanniens (1991) gemäß IUCN-Maßstab in der Kategorie LC („Least Concern“, bzw. nicht gefährdet) erfasst. Dort gilt die Art zwar als weit verbreitet, jedoch eher nur als lokal vertreten und auch nie in hoher Dichte vorfindbar. Als Bedrohung der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne auf der Insel werden der Verlust von natürlichen Waldgebieten durch intensive Forstwirtschaft und der Verlust von Heidelandschaften sowie das Entfernen von abgefallenen Stämmen und Totholz betrachtet. In der Roten Liste der Spinnen Tschechiens (2015) wird die Gewöhnliche Bodentrichterspinne in der IUCN-Kategorie ES („Ecologically Sustainable“, bzw. ökologisch anpassbar) erfasst., Lebensweise., Die Biologie der Gewöhnlichen Bodentrichterspinne wurde 1961 von Erwin Tretzel ausführlich beschrieben. Die Spinne ist wie alle Bodentrichterspinnen (\\"Coelotes\\") terrestrisch (bodenbewohnend) und außerdem wie alle Trichterspinnen (Agelenidae) nachtaktiv. Auch die für die Familie typische versteckte Lebensweise ist bei dieser Art vorhanden.

Dies trifft jedoch auch auf einige andere Spinnenarten zu, was zu Verwirrungen führen kann. Der englischsprachige Trivialname der Art lautet \\"Glossy ant spider\\" (übersetzt: „Glänzende Ameisenspinne“)., Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne ist holarktisch verbreitet. Dort bewohnt die wie alle Schillerspinnen tagaktive Art eine Vielzahl von Lebensräumen, ist jedoch wie viele andere Plattbauchspinnen xerothermophil, bevorzugt also trockene und warme Lebensräume. Sie ruht wie alle Arten der Familie in der Nacht in einem Wohngespinst und jagt tagsüber als Laufjäger (also ohne Spinnennetz) andere Gliederfüßer. Im Gegensatz zu einigen anderen Ameisenspinnen erbeutet die Art nicht nur Ameisen, sondern ist ein opportunistischer Räuber., Die Gattung der Schillerspinnen mitsamt der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne wurde in der Vergangenheit der Familie der mit den Plattbauchspinnen nahe verwandten und optisch ähnlichen Sackspinnen (\\"Clubiona\\") zugeordnet, was mit den für letztere Familie typischen konisch geformten Spinnwarzen begründet wurde. Diese Zugehörigkeit gilt mittlerweile als widerlegt., Merkmale., Das Weibchen der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne erreicht eine Körperlänge von 2,7 bis 4,5 und das Männchen eine von drei bis vier Millimetern. Der Körperbau entspricht dem anderer Schillerspinnen (\\"Micaria\\"), womit auch diese Art durch ihr langgestreckte Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) Ameisen imitiert (Mimikry). Beide Geschlechter sehen sich optisch sehr ähnlich, der Geschlechtsdimorphismus ist nur gering ausgeprägt., Das Prosoma (Vorderkörper) besitzt eine Länge von 1,3 bis 1,8 Millimetern. Der Carapax (Rückenschild des Prosomas) ist dunkelbraun bis schwarz gefärbt und ist überdies mit sechs gleichmäßigen von der Fovea (Apodem) ausgehenden und aus weißen Härchen bestehenden Radiärstreifen versehen. Die Kopfpartie und das Zentrum des Carapax erscheinen silbrig glänzend., Die Beine haben eine gelbliche Grundfärbung. Die Femora (Schenkel) des ersten und des zweiten Beinpaares sowie die Coxae (Hüftglieder) erscheinen schwarz. Hingegen sind die Femora des dritten und des vierten Beinpaares anders als bei anderen Schillerspinnen immer gleichmäßig gefärbt. Die Coxae und die Trochanter (Schenkelringe) der Beinpaare zwei bis vier verfügen auf der Dorsalseite über eine weiße Behaarung. Beim Weibchen sind, anders als beim Männchen, die Tibien (Schienen) des ersten und des zweiten Beinpaares auf der Ventralseite nicht mit Borsten versehen. Die Pedipalpen (umgewandelte Extremitäten im Kopfbereich) sind einfach gebaut., Das Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) weist eine schwarzgraue bis schwarze Farbgebung und überdies eine durch Lichtbrechung erzeugte Irisierung auf. Es verfügt vorne über einen kurzen und weiter hinten im Zentrum über einen bis zu den Seitenrändern reichenden weißen Querbalken. Dahinter befindet sich noch eine Reihe aus zwei bis drei ebenfalls weißen Punkten. Diese können aber auch verwachsen sein und somit eine Linie bilden. Beide möglichen Formationen reichen ebenfalls an die beiden seitlichen Ränder des Opisthosomas., Aufbau der Geschlechtsorgane., Die Bulbi (männliche Geschlechtsorgane) der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne weisen je ein stark verlängertes Retinaculum (Halteband) auf. Außerdem befindet sich hier anders als bei den meisten anderen Schillerspinnen (\\"Micaria\\") bei je einem Bulbus eine Borste auf dem Cymbium (vorderes Sklerit, bzw. Hartteil des Bulbus). Beim Tegulum (mittleres Sklerit des Bulbus) verläuft der retrolaterale (rückseits gerichtete) Rand fast gerade und der Embolus (letztes Sklerit des Bulbus) ist kräftig gebaut. Die terminale (am Ende gelegene) Kurve des Spermatophors (Hohlraum für den Transport des Spermas) befindet sich in der distalen Hälfte des Embolus., Die Epigyne (weibliches Geschlechtsorgan) der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne ist breiter als lang. Die Anterior-transversale (vorgelegt und quer verlaufende) Falte verläuft gerade bis schwach gekrümmt und die Kopulationsgänge gleichmäßig gekrümmt., Ähnliche Arten., Die artenreiche Gattung der Schillerspinnen (\\"Micaria\\") weist mehrere der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne ähnliche Arten auf. Eine dieser Arten ist die Streifbein-Schillerspinne (\\"M. micans\\"), die mit der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne oft zusammen vorkommt, im Gegensatz zu dieser aber nur in Europa und Zentralasien vertreten ist. Ein wesentliches Unterscheidungsmerkmal sind die bei der Streifbein-Schillerspinne auf der Dorsalseite der Femora des vierten Beinpaares vorhandenen Längsstreifen, die der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne dort fehlen bzw. bei der die Femora des dritten und des vierten Beinpaars gleichmäßig gefärbt sind. Eine genaue Unterscheidung ist bei den Männchen der beiden Arten auch anhand genitalmorphologischer Merkmale möglich. Bei einem einzelnen Bulbus des Männchens der Streifbein-Schillerspinne ist dessen Tegulum retrolateral eingekerbt und der Embolus ist wesentlich schlanker als bei der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne. Außerdem ist im Falle der Streifbein-Schillerspinne Art die terminale Kurve des Spermatophors basal angelegt. Die Epigyne des Weibchens dieser Art ist gleich lang wie breit und die anterior-transversale Falte ist hier M-förmig gekrümmt. Ferner verlaufen hier die Kopulationskanäle nur teilweise parallel und nicht gleichmäßig gekrümmt zueinander., Eine weitere, der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne stark ähnelnde Art innerhalb der Gattung der Schillerspinnen ist die Rindenschillerspinne (\\"M. subopaca\\"), die jedoch überwiegend an den Stämmen von Kiefern zu finden ist. Ähnliches trifft auch auf \\"Micaria albovittata\\" und die Schlesische Schillerspinne (\\"M. silesiaca\\") zu, bei denen die Punktierung auf dem Opisthosoma jedoch deutlich weniger bis gar nicht präsent ist. Außerdem bewohnt die Schlesische Schillerspinne zumeist trockene Heiden und sandige Habitate, \\"M. albovittata\\" vorzugsweise Graslandschaften auf Klippen. Die Arktoalpine Schillerspinne (\\"M. alpina\\"), die Moos- und Graslandschaften in gebirgigen Regionen in Höhen ab 750 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel bewohnt, kann von der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne durch die weniger stark bis gar nicht vorhandenen Querbalken unterschieden werden. Eine der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne entfernt ähnliche Art ist die Große Schillerspinne (\\"M. formicaria\\"), die jedoch deutlich größer wird und auf dem Carapax rot schillernde Schuppenhaare aufweist. Außerdem setzt sich die Zeichnung auf dem Opisthosoma der Großen Schillerspinne lediglich aus den auch bei den anderen Schillerspinnen vorhandenen Querbinden zusammen., Vorkommen., Das Verbreitungsgebiet der Gewöhnlichen Schillerspinne umfasst die Vereinigten Staaten, Kanada, Europa, Georgien, Russland, (europäischer bis fernöstlicher Teil), Kasachstan, China, Japan und möglicherweise die Türkei und Zentralasien. In Europa ist die Art flächendeckend anzutreffen und lediglich in Spitzbergen, dem Franz-Josef-Land, Nowaja Semlja, der Republik Moldau, Bosnien und Herzegowina, den Balearischen Inseln sowie Sizilien nicht nachgewiesen., In Mitteleuropa ist die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne ebenfalls weit verbreitet. Selbiges trifft auf die Britischen Inseln zu., Lebensräume., Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne bewohnt ein breites Spektrum an Habitaten, bevorzugt aber sonnige und warme Lebensräume. Dazu zählen Sandheiden, Kreideflächen, Dünen mit Torfmoosen (Sphagnum), verlassene Gebiete, jedoch auch Salzwiesen und Moosschichten in Laubwäldern. Darüber hinaus bewohnt die Art auch Trockenrasen, Waldlichtungen, Wiesen, Ödland, Wegränder, Siedlungsbereiche und Feuchtgebiete sowie gelegentlich Brachlandschaften., Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne kann bis zu einer Höhe von 4.000 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel gefunden werden, was jedoch bislang lediglich in Nordamerika nachgewiesen ist. In Europa ist die Art in den Alpen bis zu einer Höhe von 2.200 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel anzutreffen. Zusätzlich ist die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne auf den Britischen Inseln bis zu einer Höhe von 700 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel vorfindbar., Gefährdung., Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne ist bedingt durch ihr großes Verbreitungsgebiet und ihre Anpassungsfähigkeit nicht bedroht und darüber hinaus die häufigste Art der Schillerspinnen (\\"Micaria\\") in Europa, wobei dies auch auf die Streifbein-Schillerspinne (\\"M. micans\\") zutreffen kann., In der Roten Liste gefährdeter Tiere, Pflanzen und Pilze Deutschlands bzw. der Roten Liste und Gesamtartenliste der Spinnen Deutschlands (2016) etwa wird die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne als „ungefährdet“ gewertet, da die Art auch in Deutschland sehr häufig ist und ihre Bestandsentwicklungen sowohl langfristig als auch kurzfristig gleich bleibend sind., Lebensweise., Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne zählt, wie alle kontrastreich gefärbten Plattbauchspinnen (Gnaphosidae) einschließlich der Schillerspinnen (Gattung \\"Micaria\\"), zu den tagaktiven Vertretern der Familie. Die Nacht verbringt die Art in für Plattbauchspinnen typischen Wohngespinsten., Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne teilt mit diesen ihre schnelle und ruckartige Fortbewegung, die bei der Art wie bei den anderen der Gattung bedingt durch deren optische Erscheinung an die von Ameisen erinnert. Diese Ähnlichkeit wird durch zitternde Bewegungen der Vorderbeine, die den Fühlerbewegungen von Ameisen ähneln, verstärkt. Diese Form Mimikry dient vermutlich dazu, Prädatoren (Fressfeinde) abzuschrecken, da Ameisen von vielen Räubern aufgrund ihrer Wehrhaftigkeit gemieden werden. Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne wurde bisher in Gesellschaft von Waldameisen (\\"Formica\\"), Wegameisen (\\"Lasius\\") und Ameisen der Gattung \\"Tetramorium\\" nachgewiesen. Dabei kann die Spinne auch in den Nestern der Ameisen vorkommen., Jagdverhalten und Beutefang., Die Gewöhnliche Schillerspinne ist wie alle Plattbauchspinnen (Gnaphosidae) ein aktiver Laufjäger, der kein Spinnennetz zum Fangzweck anlegt. Sie ist, anders als andere: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Plattbauchspinnen, Schillerspinnen, Ameisenspinnen, Mimikry, Glossy ant spider, xerothermophil, opportunistischer Räuber, genitalmorphologische Merkmale, Verbreitungsgebiet, Naturschutz"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Ameisensackspinnen], Der Gewöhnliche Ameisenvagabund (\\"Phrurolithus festivus\\"), auch bekannt unter dem Namen Gefleckte Feldspinne, ist eine Spinne aus der Familie der Ameisensackspinnen (Phrurolithidae). Er war ursprünglich nur paläarktisch verbreitet und wurde in Kanada eingeführt. Die äußerst anpassungsfähige Art bewohnt eine Vielzahl sowohl an trockenen als auch an feuchten Habitaten (Lebensräume) und kann ebenfalls in menschengemachten Lebensräumen angetroffen werden, bevorzugt aber allgemein Freiflächen., Ein besonderes Merkmal des Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabunds, das dieser mit anderen Ameisensackspinnen teilt, ist das Nachahmen von Ameisen in Form der Bates’schen Mimikry. Dafür imitiert die Art die Bewegungen von Ameisen und ahmt diese auch optisch nach. Diese Imitation dient dem Prinzip der Bates’schen Mimikry entsprechend dazu, gegenüber Prädatoren (Fressfeinden) abschreckend zu wirken, da Ameisen aufgrund ihrer Wehrhaftigkeit für viele Räuber eine unbeliebte Beute darstellen., Der wie alle Arten der Gattung tagaktive Gewöhnliche Ameisenvagabund bewegt sich ebenso nach Eigenart der Ameisenvagabunden zumeist schnell umher und erbeutet dabei als aktiver Laufjäger beliebige Gliederfüßer, die kleiner als der Jäger selbst sind. Der Paarung geht kein Balzverhalten voraus. Ein begattetes Weibchen legt einige Zeit nach der Paarung mehrere Eikokons mit vergleichsweise wenig Eiern ab. Ansonsten ist der Lebenszyklus der Spinne wenig erforscht., Merkmale., Das Weibchen des Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabunds kann nach Sven Almquist (2006) eine Körperlänge von 2,7 bis zu 3,8 sowie im Durchschnitt 3,1 ± 0,2 und das Männchen eine von 2,6 bis zu 3 sowie durchschnittlich 2,8 ± 0,1 Millimetern erreichen. Damit handelt es sich wie bei allen Ameisensackspinnen (Phrurolithidae) um eine kleinere Spinnenart. Der grundsätzliche Körperbau der Spinne gleicht dem anderer Ameisenvagabunden (\\"Phrurolithus\\")., Die Beinformel lautet wie bei vielen Spinnen 4-1-2-3., Legende für angegebene Richtungslagen:, Bei der Art erscheint das Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) abgewinkelt und anterior (vorne) wie posterior (hinten) etwa gleich breit., Sexualdimorphismus., Der Gewöhnlicher Ameisenvagabund weist wie viele Spinnen einen ausgeprägten Sexualdimorphismus (Unterschied der Geschlechter) auf. Dieser macht sich neben den Dimensionen auch in der Farbgebung von Weibchen und Männchen bemerkbar. Außerdem verfügt das Männchen wie bei Ameisenvagabunden (\\"Phrurolithus\\") üblich über ein Scutum (sklerotisierte, bzw. verhärtete Platte) auf dem Opisthosoma, das dem Weibchen fehlt., Weibchen., Beim Weibchen kann laut Almquist der Carapax (Rückenschild des Prosomas, bzw. Vorderkörpers) eine Länge von 1,04 bis zu 1,35 und durchschnittlich 1,2 ± 0,06 sowie eine Breite von 0,86 bis zu 1,09 und im Durchschnitt 0,97 ± 0,05 Millimetern aufweisen. Das Verhältnis zwischen Länge und Breite des Carapax beläuft sich beim Weibchen auf 1,16 bis 1,34, wobei der Durchschnittswert hier 1,23 ± 0,05 beträgt. Der Carapax ist beim Weibchen außerdem um 52 Grad geneigt., Der Carapax des Weibchens ist dunkel gelblich braun und die Cheliceren (Kieferklauen) bräunlich gefärbt. Promarginal (innen vorderseitig) sind die Cheliceren je mit drei und retromarginal (innen rückseitig) mit einem Zahn versehen. Das Sternum (Brustschild des Prosomas) hat eine braune Grundfarbe, wobei es marginal (randseitig) eine dunklere Farbgebung aufweist, die in die Weite geht. Die Beine sind gelblich braun gefärbt, die Femora (Schenkel) erscheinen dunkler., Das Opisthosoma des Weibchens hat dorsal eine dunkelbraune Grundfärbung sowie schillernde Setae (chitinisierte Haare). Anterolateral (vorne seitlich) befinden sich auf dem Opisthosoma zwei weiße Flecken, während median (mittig) auf diesem Körperabschnitt ein weißes Zickzackband verläuft. Nicht selten befinden sich posterior auf dem Opisthosoma schmale und blasse Winkelflecken. Ventral erscheint das Opisthosoma gräulich und es verfügt dort außerdem über kleine blasse Punkte., Männchen., Beim Männchen ist der Carapax 1,2 bis 1,38 und im Durchschnitt 1,27 ± 0,04 Millimeter lang sowie 0,97 bis 1,2 und durchschnittlich 1,06 ± 0,05 Millimeter breit. Das Längen-Breiten-Verhältnis des Carapax beträgt hier 1,13 bis 1,3 und zumeist 1,21 ± 0,04 und seine Neigung 28 Grad., Der Carapax des Männchens hat eine dunkelbraune Farbgebung und ist medial am kephalen (am Kopf gelegenen) Bereich mit weißen sowie posterior mit radiär angelegten Reihen ebenso weißer Setae bedeckt. Die Cheliceren des Männchens sind dunkelbraun gefärbt und tragen anders als die des Weibchens keine Zähne. Das Sternum ist wie beim Weibchen braun gefärbt und marginal dunkler, hier jedoch weniger ausladend. Die Beine des Männchens haben eine gelblich braune Grundfärbung. Dabei sind hier die Femora dunkelbraun und die Coxae (Hüftglieder) sowie die Trochanter (Schenkelringe) hellgelbbraun gefärbt., Die Dorsalseite des Opisthosomas weist beim Männchen eine schwarze Färbung auf, während sich hier anterolateral je zwei fleckenartige Formationen aus weißen Setae befinden. Wie beim Weibchen verläuft auch beim Männchen median auf der Dorsalseite des Opisthosomas ein weißes Zickzackband. Zusätzlich befindet sich beim Männchen ein Büschel aus weißen Setae am Apex (Spitze) des Opisthosomas. Die Ventralfläche des Opisthosomas ist hier gelblich braun bis braun gefärbt., Genitalmorphologische Merkmale., Die Pedipalpen (umgewandelte Extremitäten) vom Männchen des Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabundes sind fast schwarz gefärbt. Dabei erscheinen die Femora dunkelbraun. Ein einzelner Pedipalpus kann von denen anderer männlicher Ameisenvagabunden (\\"Phrurolithus\\") mitunter durch die für die Gattung typische retrolaterale (seitlich rückliegende) Apophyse (chitinisierter Fortsatz) an seiner Tibia (Schiene) unterschieden werden, die hier im Vergleich sehr groß ist und ein schaufelförmiges Erscheinungsbild aufweist. Der basale (an der Basis gelegene) Teil eines Bulbus (männliches Geschlechtsorgan) der Art ist hervorstehend. Eine weitere teguläre (rückseitige) Apophyse an je beiden Pedipalpen ist beim Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabund breit gebaut und verfügt über eine gebogene Spitze. Der gebogene Embolus (drittes und letztes Sklerit bzw. Hartteil eines Bulbus) erscheint pflockartig., Die Epigyne (weibliches Geschlechtsorgan) des Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabunds wird innerhalb der Gattung mitunter durch ihre posterior sklerotisierte (verhärtete) Platte gekennzeichnet. Außerdem ragt das Geschlechtsorgan über die epigastrische (beim Magen befindliche) Furche geringfügig hinaus. Die Epigyne des Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabunds besitzt eine eher kleinere Kopulationsöffnung und die Kopulationsgänge sind vergleichsweise kurz und breit. Die primärem Spermatheken (Samentaschen) der Art sind transversal (quer) angelegt, die sekundären sind groß und oval geformt., Differenzierung von anderen Ameisenvagabunden., Da sich alle Ameisenvagabunden (\\"Phrurolithus\\") mitsamt dem Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabunden einander sehr ähneln und insbesondere die Fleckenzeichnung vermutlich bei allen Arten der Gattung derart vorhanden ist, ist eine Unterscheidung dieser wie auch beim Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabunden nur anhand der genitalmorphologischen Merkmale gegeben., Beim Kleinen Ameisenvagabunden (\\"P. minimus\\") sind beim Männchen die Pedipalpen schwarz gestreift und eine einzelne daran befindliche Tibialapophyse stark gebogen. Ein Bulbus besitzt hier je distal (von der Körpermitte entfernt) eine spitz zulaufende und gekrümmte Apophyse. Die Epigyne des Kleinen Ameisenvagabunden besitzt median gelegene Kopulationsöffnungen. Für den Südlichen Ameisenvagabunden (\\"P. nigrinus\\") ist vor allem die gebogene Tibialapophyse mit langer, abgesetzter Spitze an einem einzelnen Pedipalpus beim Männchen typisch, während die Epigyne der Art durch eine große mediane Grube charakterisiert wird. Für das Männchen des Östlichen Ameisenvagabunden (\\"P. pullatus\\") ist mit symmetrischer Spitze ausgestattete Tibialapophyse an einem Pedipalpus typisch. Ferner hat hier ein Bulbus jeweils zwei distale Apophysen, die den Embolus überragen. Die Epigyne dieser Art verfügt über lateral gelegene Kopulationsöffnungen. Bei \\"P. szilyi\\", dem fünften in Mitteleuropa vorkommenden Ameisenvagabunden, ist die Tibialapophyse an einem Pedipalpus des Männchens mit einer wenig abgesetzten Spitze und ein Bulbus mit breiter und rundlicher distaler Apophyse versehen. Die Epigyne hat, ähnlich wie die des Südlichen Ameisenvagabunden eine große mediane Grube, die hier allerdings am Vorderrand eingedellt erscheint., Vorkommen., Das ursprüngliche Verbreitungsgebiet des Gewöhnlichen Ameisenvagabunds erstreckte sich über Europa, Nordafrika, die Türkei, Kaukasien, Russland (europäischer bis fernöstlicher Teil), Kasachstan, Iran, China, Korea, Japan. In Kanada wurde er überdies eingeführt. Auch in Europa selber ist die Art flächendeckend vertreten und fehlt in Kontinentaleuropa lediglich in Kroatien, Bosnien und Herzegowina und dem Kosovo sowie zusätzlich auf der russischen Doppelinsel Nowaja Semlja, in Franz-Josef-Land, Island und auf der Inselgruppe Spitzbergen, Sardinien, den Balearischen Inseln, Kreta und Zypern. In Nordafrika fehlen Nachweise der Spinne aus Tunesien und Ägypten., Der Gewöhnliche Ameisenvagabund ist vor allem in West- und Mitteleuropa weit verbreitet. Auf Großbritannien ist er vor allem im südlichen Teil der Insel häufig, während sein Vorkommen dort im Westen stark verstreut ist. Nach Norden hin reicht das Verbreitungsgebiet der Art auf Großbritannien bis in den zentralen Teil Schottlands., Lebensräume., Der Gewöhnliche Ameisenvagabund bewohnt eine große Anzahl sowohl an trockenen als auch an feuchten Habitaten (Lebensräumen) und wurde mitunter in Graslandschaften, Gärten, Streuschichten und der Unterseite von Steinen nachgewiesen. Gleiches trifft auf die Nähe von mit Wasser gefüllten Gruben sowie der Unterseite von Steinen in Steinbrüchen zu. Weitere erwiesene Lebensräume der Art sind Trockenwiesen, Dünenheiden, Bodenstreu unter Wacholder (\\"Juniperus\\") und die Unterseite von Steinen auf Kalkflächen. Auch wurde die Spinne in Weinbergen, sonnigen Wäldern und an Stränden nachgewiesen., Der Gewöhnliche Ameisenvagabund kann bis in Höhen von bis zu 1.350 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel angetroffen wer: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Ameisensackspinnen, Gewöhnlicher Ameisenvagabund, Gefleckte Feldspinne, Habitate, Bates’sche Mimikry, Laufjäger, Eikokons, Merkmale, Sexualdimorphismus, Genitalmorphologische Merkmale, Unterscheidung, Verbreitungsgebiet, Lebensräume, Höhenlage."},{"instruction":"10 отличий typescript и javascript с примерами","output":"1) Typescript предоставляет статическую типизацию, в то время как JavaScript является динамически типизированным языком. В Typescript можно явно указывать типы данных для переменных, функций и параметров функций, а в JavaScript типы данных определяются автоматически. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript let x: number = 5; x = \\"hello\\"; // Ошибка компиляции \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript let x = 5; x = \\"hello\\"; // Будет работать, так как тип неявно определяется \`\`\` 2) Typescript имеет возможность использовать классы и интерфейсы для создания объектно-ориентированного кода. В JavaScript это возможно только с помощью функций-конструкторов и прототипов. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript interface Animal { name: string; speak: () => void; } class Dog implements Animal { name: string; constructor(name: string) { this.name = name; } speak(): void { console.log(\\"Woof!\\"); } } const dog = new Dog(\\"Rex\\"); dog.speak(); // Выведет \\"Woof!\\" \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript function Animal(name) { this.name = name; } Animal.prototype.speak = function() { console.log(\\"Some sound!\\"); } function Dog(name) { Animal.call(this, name); } Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog; const dog = new Dog(\\"Rex\\"); dog.speak(); // Выведет \\"Some sound!\\" \`\`\` 3) Typescript поддерживает модули, что позволяет организовать код в отдельные файлы и экспортировать из них нужные функции, переменные и классы. В JavaScript для организации кода используются только функции. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript // Файл utils.ts export function add(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; } // Файл main.ts import { add } from './utils'; console.log(add(5, 3)); // Выведет 8 \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript // Файл utils.js function add(x, y) { return x + y; } // Файл main.js const add = require('./utils'); console.log(add(5, 3)); // Выведет 8 \`\`\` 4) Typescript позволяет использовать строгий режим проверки типов, который включает в себя более строгую проверку присваиваемости типов и запрет на использование некоторых небезопасных операций. Такого режима в JavaScript нет. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript const x: number = 5; const y: string = \\"hello\\"; y = x; // Ошибка компиляции \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const x = 5; const y = \\"hello\\"; y = x; // Будет работать, так как типы данных не проверяются \`\`\` 5) Typescript позволяет использовать стрелочные функции и имеет усовершенствованный синтаксис для работы с лямбда-выражениями. В JavaScript у стрелочных функций и лямбда-выражений другой синтаксис. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript const add = (x: number, y: number): number => { return x + y; } console.log(add(5, 3)); // Выведет 8 \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const add = (x, y) => { return x + y; } console.log(add(5, 3)); // Выведет 8 \`\`\` 6) Typescript имеет возможность использовать параметры по умолчанию при определении функций, что позволяет задать значения по умолчанию для аргументов функции. В JavaScript это не поддерживается. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript function greet(name: string = \\"Guest\\"): void { console.log(\`Hello, {name}!\`); } greet(); // Выведет \\"Hello, Guest!\\" greet(\\"John\\"); // Выведет \\"Hello, John!\\" \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript function greet(name) { if (name === undefined) { name = \\"Guest\\"; } console.log(\`Hello, {name}!\`); } greet(); // Выведет \\"Hello, Guest!\\" greet(\\"John\\"); // Выведет \\"Hello, John!\\" \`\`\` 7) Typescript позволяет использовать перечисления (enums), что упрощает их использование и обеспечивает статическую типизацию для значений перечислений. В JavaScript для создания перечислений обычно используются объекты или просто набор констант. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript enum Direction { Up, Down, Left, Right } const dir: Direction = Direction.Up; console.log(dir); // Выведет 0 \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const Direction = { Up: 0, Down: 1, Left: 2, Right: 3 } const dir = Direction.Up; console.log(dir); // Выведет 0 \`\`\` 8) Typescript позволяет использовать дженерики (generics), что позволяет создавать обобщенные типы данных и функции, работающие с разными типами данных одновременно. В JavaScript такой функциональности не предусмотрено. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript function reverse<T>(items: T[]): T[] { return items.reverse(); } const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const reversedNumbers: number[] = reverse(numbers); console.log(reversedNumbers); // Выведет [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] const strings: string[] = [\\"hello\\", \\"world\\"]; const reversedStrings: string[] = reverse(strings); console.log(reversedStrings); // Выведет [\\"world\\", \\"hello\\"] \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript function reverse(items) { return items.reverse(); } const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const reversedNumbers = reverse(numbers); console.log(reversedNumbers); // Выведет [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] const strings = [\\"hello\\", \\"world\\"]; const reversedStrings = reverse(strings); console.log(reversedStrings); // Выведет [\\"world\\", \\"hello\\"] \`\`\` 9) Typescript имеет возможность использовать перегрузку функций, что позволяет определить несколько вариантов функции с разными типами входных параметров или разными типами возвращаемых значений. В JavaScript такое не поддерживается. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript function multiply(x: number, y: number): number; function multiply(x: number, y: number[]): number[]; function multiply(x: number, y: number | number[]): number | number[] { if (Array.isArray(y)) { return y.map(item => item * x); } else { return x * y; } } console.log(multiply(5, 10)); // Выведет 50 console.log(multiply(5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Выведет [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript function multiply(x, y) { if (Array.isArray(y)) { return y.map(item => item * x); } else { return x * y; } } console.log(multiply(5, 10)); // Выведет 50 console.log(multiply(5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Выведет [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] \`\`\` 10) Typescript поддерживает компиляцию кода в ECMAScript 5, 6 или другие версии JavaScript, что позволяет использовать новые возможности языка, даже если они не поддерживаются текущей версией JavaScript. В JavaScript всегда используется актуальная версия языка. Пример: Typescript: \`\`\`typescript const x: number = 5; let y: string = \\"hello\\"; const z = x ** 2; // Возведение в степень через оператор ** (ECMAScript 2016) y = y.padStart(10, \\"0\\"); // Добавление нулей в начало строки (ECMAScript 2017) \`\`\` JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const x = 5; let y = \\"hello\\"; const z = Math.pow(x, 2); // Возведение в степень через функцию Math.pow y = y.padStart(10, \\"0\\"); // Добавление нулей в начало строки (ES2021) \`\`\` Это лишь некоторые из отличий между Typescript и JavaScript. Оба языка имеют свои особенности и предназначены для разных целей, поэтому выбор между ними зависит от конкретных требований и задачи, которую необходимо решить."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geysir, Quelltyp, Vulkanismus], Ein Geysir [], auch Geiser [], ist eine heiße Quelle, die ihr Wasser in regelmäßigen oder unregelmäßigen Abständen als Fontäne ausstößt. Einen solchen Ausbruch bezeichnet man als Eruption. Namengebend für Geysire ist der \\"Große Geysir\\" auf Island., Etymologie., Die Bezeichnung \\"Geysir\\" (\\"Geiser\\") wurde im 19. Jahrhundert aus dem isländischen \\"geysir\\" (Name der vorhin erwähnten heißen Springquelle, dann als Appellativ verallgemeinert für alle derartigen Phänomene) entlehnt. Es handelt sich um ein Nomen Agentis zum schwachen Verb \\"geysa\\" „in heftige Bewegung versetzen, hervorstürmen, -stürzen“, das wiederum das Frequentativum des Verbs \\"gjósa\\" „hervorbrechen, -sprudeln, -stürzen“ ist., Ähnliche Erscheinungen., Weitere postvulkanische oder mit Thermalquellen in Zusammenhang stehende Erscheinungen:, Vorkommen., Geysire erfordern eine spezielle Kombination von geologischen und klimatischen Bedingungen, die nur an wenigen Orten großflächig bestehen. Geysire sind von drei Faktoren abhängig: einer Wasserversorgung in Form eines Grundwasserleiters, einer Wärmequelle (eine Plume oder Superplume) und mindestens einem Reservoir mit einer Verengung zum zugehörigen Leitungssystem., Es existieren sechs Geysirfelder größeren Ausmaßes:, In den USA existieren vereinzelt Geysire wie in Nevada, Kalifornien, Oregon und Alaska., Über eine nennenswerte Anzahl verfügen Papua-Neuguinea (16 aktive Geysire), Neubritannien (16), Narage (1), Lihir- und Ambitle-Inseln (9), Deidei- und Iamelele-Inseln (12) sowie Indonesien mit 8 aktiven Geysiren auf Sumatra, 4 auf Java, 3 auf Celebes und einem aktiven auf der Insel Bacan., Daneben existieren Geysire noch in Peru (10), Volksrepublik China (10), Mexiko (9), auf den Fidschiinseln (5), Japan (4), Kenia (4), Äthiopien (2), Bolivien (2) und Myanmar (1)., Über 300 aktive Geysire, etwa die Hälfte von allen weltweit existierenden, befinden sich im Yellowstone-Nationalpark. Dagegen gibt es in Island, im „Land der Geysire“ lediglich zwei nennenswerte Geysire: den Großen Geysir und den Strokkur. Letzterer eruptiert unregelmäßig im Abstand von wenigen Minuten und manchmal auch bis zu dreimal kurz hintereinander. Der Große Geysir, der nach einem Erdbeben gegen Ende des 13. Jahrhundert erstmals in schriftlichen Quellen beschrieben wurde, brach dagegen zuletzt um 1916 mit Wassersäulen von 70 bis 80 m Höhe aus. Nach zwei kräftigen Erdbeben im Jahr 2000 kam es allerdings wie schon früher nach Erdstößen mit mehrmonatiger Verzögerung zu einem vorübergehenden Anstieg der Aktivität mit unregelmäßigen Ausbrüchen, die allerdings mit früheren Höhen nicht vergleichbar waren und nach wenigen Jahren auch wieder völlig zum Erliegen kamen., Die Zahl der aktiven Geysire ist mit Vorsicht zu betrachten, da Geysire sehr schnell inaktiv werden können und in selteneren Fällen inaktive Geysire zum Beispiel durch Erdbeben wieder aktiviert werden. Mehrere der oben gezählten Geysire sind außerdem in Gefahr, durch geplante Nutzung geothermischer Energie zu erlöschen oder inaktiv zu werden. Siehe: Durch Menschen zerstörte Geysire. Andererseits kann, wie im Fall des Fly Geyser, durch eine fehlerhafte Geothermie-Bohrung ein Geysir aus Menschenhand entstehen., Weitere, recht große Geysirfelder gab es bis in die 1980er Jahre in Nevada: \\"Beowawe\\" und \\"Steamboat Springs\\". Durch die Errichtung geothermischer Kraftwerke in der Nähe wurde die vorhandene Hitze allerdings verringert und der Wasserspiegel sank so weit, dass die Geysire nicht mehr aktiv sind., Eigenschaften., Das erste naturwissenschaftliche Modell für die Funktion eines Geysirs erklärte 1846 der deutsche Chemiker Robert Wilhelm Bunsen auf Grund eines leicht nachvollziehbaren Experiments, in dem ein Modell-Geysir in verkleinertem Maßstab mit beheiztem Kessel als Reservoir und einer Röhre als Kanal nachgebaut wurde und auch „eruptives Verhalten“ zeigt., Geysire kommen in aktiven vulkanischen Gebieten vor. Sie besitzen einen Kanal in Form einer Röhre, der in ein unterirdisches Wasserreservoir mündet. Es können sich auch mehrere Wasserreservoire hintereinander befinden. Typischerweise werden Geysire über das Grundwasser gespeist. Das ausgestoßene Wasser hat eine Temperatur zwischen 90°C und knapp über dem Siedepunkt, das Wasser im Reservoir kann auf wesentlich höhere Temperaturen überhitzt sein., Der Eruptionskanal beziehungsweise Verengungen im Eruptionskanal spielen eine wesentliche Rolle bei den Eruptionen des Geysirs. Ist keine Verengung vorhanden bzw. ist sie zu weit, so kann der Wasserdampf ungehindert austreten (Dampfquelle) oder sofern der Dampf weit genug abkühlt und kondensiert, entsteht eine heiße Quelle. Je enger die Engstelle ist, desto stärker wird die thermische Konvektion unterbunden, und von der Höhe des Eruptionskanals hängt der Druck ab, den die Wassersäule und teilweise auch das umgebende Gestein auf das erhitzte Wasser weiter unten ausübt. Um dies zu veranschaulichen: Die Engstelle zwischen dem oberen Reservoir und dem Eruptionskanal des Old Faithful hat einen Durchmesser von etwa zehn Zentimetern. Die Engstelle befindet sich in ca. 7,5m Tiefe über dem oberen Reservoir. Old Faithful wurde bis auf reichlich 16m Tiefe mit einer Videokamera befahren, insofern sind die Verhältnisse bis in diese Tiefe recht gut bekannt und die Dynamik der Eruption dieses Geysirs ist recht gut erklärbar., Die Wärme einer Magmakammer erhitzt das Grundwasser auf über 100°C. Durch den Druck der darüber stehenden Wassersäule siedet das Wasser zunächst nicht (Siedepunktserhöhung). Bei einer Eruption geschieht im einfachsten Fall Folgendes: Erst wenn die Temperatur im Reservoir auf weit über den Siedepunkt angestiegen ist, steigen einzelne Dampfblasen durch die Engstelle im Kanal aufwärts und pressen einen Teil der Wassersäule nach oben. Dadurch sinkt unten der Druck rapide ab und das überhitzte Wasser geht schlagartig in Dampf über., Herausgeschleudert wird eine Mischung aus kochend heißem Wasserdampf, kühlerem beziehungsweise kondensiertem Wasser und gelösten Mineralien sowie Gesteinspartikeln. Im Laufe der Jahre werden durch das heiße Wasser feine Spalten im Gestein zu Schächten aufgeweitet und im günstigsten Fall durch im Wasser vorübergehend gelöste Mineralien (z.B. Silikate) ausgekleidet und damit stabilisiert. Besteht auf dem Weg zur Oberfläche keine wirksame Verengung z.B. durch einen Übergang von einer Kammer (Reservoir) zu einer Leitung, so tritt das Wasser als heiße Quelle oder Dampfquelle zu Tage., Im Wesentlichen wird das Bunsen-Modell heute noch als zutreffend angesehen, auch wenn Bunsen meinte, dass die Verhältnisse in der Natur selbst verwickelter seien und dass statt eines senkrechten Kanals eine „gekniete Röhre“ vorhanden sein müsse, an deren höchstgelegenem unterirdischem Teil sich Dampf sammeln müsse, bis der Druck ausreicht, um das Wasser auszuschleudern. Untersuchungen am Old Faithful mit einer Temperatur-, Druck- und Kamerasonde im Jahr 1992 haben aber gezeigt, dass das Modell mit dem gerade aufsteigenden Kanal hinreichend ist (Lit.: Scott Bryan, 1995), wenn eine ausreichende Verengung vorhanden ist. Die Funktion der Verengung (engl. constriction) ist ausreichend, um Dampfblasen vorübergehend zurückzuhalten, sie ersetzt die Funktion des Rohrknies im Bunsen-Modell., John Sargent Rinehart beschreibt (1980) sechs Geysirmodelle:, Folgende Faktoren beeinflussen die Tätigkeit von Geysiren:, Auch rein äußerlich ohne Beobachtung der Eruptionstätigkeit lassen sich Geysire meist von Thermalquellen unterscheiden., Arten von Geysiren., Bezogen auf die Periodizität der Eruptionen gibt es mehr oder weniger regelmäßig ausbrechende und unregelmäßig ausbrechende Geysire. Es gibt Geysire, bei denen sich starke und schwache Eruptionen unterscheiden lassen. Dass starke Eruptionen die unregelmäßigeren sind, lässt sich nicht nachweisen. Der \\"Steamboat-Geysir\\" im Yellowstone-Nationalpark hat sehr unregelmäßige starke Eruptionen, der \\"Castle-Geysir\\" gehört zu den Geysiren mit dem regelmäßigsten Intervall, solange er nicht in schwachen Eruptionen ausbricht. Weitere Unterscheidungsmöglichkeiten sind im Abschnitt Begriffsdefinitionen beschrieben., Geysire in Neuseeland., Die meisten der neuseeländischen Geysire wurden seit 1886 durch natürliche Einflüsse oder durch Eingriff des Menschen zerstört., Das größte verbleibende Geysirfeld in Neuseeland ist heute Whakarewarewa in der Nähe von Rotorua., Geysire in der Dichtung., Liebevoll, wenn auch nicht in den Einzelheiten korrekt beschreibt Karl May die Geysire, Sinterterrassen und Schlammtöpfe im Yellowstone-Nationalpark in seiner Amerika-Erzählung \\"Der Sohn des Bärenjägers\\" (anderer Titel: \\"Unter Geiern – 1. Teil\\") im Kapitel \\"Am P’a-wakon-tonka\\"., Das Ende eines Geysirs., Warum ein Geysir inaktiv wird oder erlischt., Durch die permanenten Eruptionen vergrößert sich der Schlot (Eruptionskanal) mit der Zeit und der Geysir wird zu einer heißen Quelle. Menschengeschaffene künstliche Geysire sind in dieser Hinsicht meist sehr stabil, da das Bohrloch in der Regel verrohrt wird., Erdbeben in der Umgebung eines Geysirs können zu einer wesentlichen Veränderung seines Eruptionsverhaltens führen. Er kann nicht nur wieder erwachen, er kann auch inaktiv werden oder erlöschen., Der Bau von geothermischen Kraftwerken in der Nähe von Geysiren führt meistens dazu, dass die Geysire nicht mehr ausbrechen, da der Grundwasserspiegel und die Temperatur des Wassers, das den Geysir speist, sinken., Die Zugabe von Detergentien wie Spülmittel oder Schmierseife zum Thermalwasser, um einen Ausbruch zu provozieren, wirkt sich auf Dauer auch nachteilig auf die Eruptionstätigkeit aus. Wo diese Praxis früher üblich war, um Touristen einen Ausbruch vorzuführen, ist sie inzwischen meist durch Gesetzgebung verboten (Beispiel: Großer Geysir, Island)., Oft führt auch Vandalismus zum Ende der Eruptionstätigkeit eines Geysirs. Werden Steine oder Gegenstände in den Schlot geworfen, kann die Eruptionstätigkeit aufhören. Meist wird der Eruptionskanal verstopft, der Druck der Eruption reicht nicht aus, um den Fremdkörper auszuwerfen und der Geysir wird zur heißen Quelle., Das spektakulärste Ende eines Geysirs steht bevor, wenn das umgebende Gestein dem D: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Keywords: Geysir, Quelltyp, Vulkanismus, Eruption, Island, Etymologie, postvulkanische Erscheinungen, geologische Bedingungen, Grundwasserleiter, Wärmequelle."},{"instruction":"Give a Really Shortest Backstory about Streets of Rage SEGA Game Series/SCP Foundation x Naruto Crossover Timelines, SCP-9999: “Shiva, the Unstoppable God” meeting these hero characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno (Shiva’s Girlfriend #1), Shikamaru Nara, Hinata Hyuga, Rock Lee, Gaara, Jiraiya, Minato Namikaze (Fourth Hokage), Itachi Uchiha, Might Guy, Tsunade, Neji Hyuga, Tobirama Senju (Second Hokage), Hashirama Senju (First Hokage), Kushina Uzumaki, Asuma Sarutobi, Yamato, Kurenai Yuhi, Ino Yamanaka (Shiva’s Girlfriend #2), Choji Akimichi, Shino Aburame, Sai, Konohamaru Sarutobi, Iruka Umino, Killer Bee, Kakuzu, Nagato/Pain, Temari (Shiva’s Girlfriend #3), Kankuro, Darui, Omei, and Mei Terumi, and then later on meets the villains sometimes, Orochimaru, Itachi Uchiha, Akatsuki - A criminal organization composed of powerful rogue ninja, including members such as: Kisame Hoshigaki, Deidara, Sasori, Hidan, and Kakuzu, Zabuza Momochi, The Sound Four, Kabuto Yakushi, Obito Uchiha, Madara Uchiha, and Kaguya Otsutsuki, and SCP-9999: “Shiva, the Unstoppable God”, Object Class: Keter, Special Containment Procedures: SCP-9999 is to be contained within a specially-designed chamber equipped with high-intensity electromagnetic fields and reinforced titanium walls.
