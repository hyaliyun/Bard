I’ve yet to find another voice-command tool that had Cortana’s potential. Paul Newton AI can be a force for good New technology can scare people, which is why artificial intelligence (AI) is getting such bad press. But Issue 664’s story about AI cameras capturing drivers using their phones (page 9) shows how it can have positive effects for society. Despite the efforts of campaigners, there are too many people who still don’t take seriously the dangers of texting while driving. There were some high- profile cases a few years ago that I hoped would make a big impact, but it’s not happened. I’m not optimistic that we’ll ever make drink-texting as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, so instead we just need to convince offenders that they will be caught and punished. Using cameras powered by AI seems a step forward. Ken Allmann CA SAYS With AI developing so quickly, it’s only natural people are worried. In this issue alone we report on how AI can be used to ‘hear’ your passwords as you type them (page 8) and create deepfake videos to scam you (page 11). But it would be foolish to ignore the benefits it brings, as Ken points out. Huge advances in medicine, transport, manufacturing and energy production are all being driven by AI. The challenge for governments, companies and industry leaders is to maximise the advantages while minimising the risks – and that won’t be easy. Virgin Media’s customer service was ‘curt and rude’ Following your recent article and letters about Virgin Media making it hard to cancel, I was a very satisfied customer for about 20 years, getting fibre broadband to my desk. But that had to stop when they put the price up to over £70 a month. UK viewers still love BBC and ITV At first glance Issue 664’s news story (page 7) on changing TV habits suggests the public are falling out of love with BBC and ITV. But on closer inspection it’s more likely that it’s the viewing habits that are changing, and that our affection for these traditional channels remains strong. For example, while the number of hours watching broadcast TV has fallen sharply, a lot of that viewing has switched to BBC iPlayer and ITVX. What’s changed is that hardly anyone assumes that you need to watch a programme at the precise time that it’s broadcast. In some ways, these ‘catch-up’ services are simply modern equivalents of video recorders. Back in the 1980s I used to work late evenings, and would often set my timer to record shows like Blackadder, Question Time and anything that David Attenborough presented. Looking back, what was that if not a forerunner of ‘catch-up’ TV? Geoff Salcombe It’s not surprising that the number of viewers watching news bulletins has plunged. It’s a result of our 24-hour news culture, where websites and news channels are constantly updating stories. When I was younger, if you didn’t watch the news in the evening then you’d miss out completely on what’s happening. That’s no longer the case. I never watch the news now, and yet thanks to the news coverage on the internet I feel better informed than ever. Gary Hadley Why I’ll miss Cortana I expect to be in a minority of one, but I will mourn the demise of Cortana (Issue 664, page 6). For a few years after it launched it was better than both Alexa and Siri. My favourite trick was opening browser tabs using my voice. I could open the door to my office, tell Cortana which tabs to open, and they would be waiting for me when I sat down. I also used it to remind me of phone calls I had to make, and to create a news feed of subjects I was interested in.

Microsoft and Google are worst ‘bait-and-switch’ offenders I’m grateful to Daniel Booth introducing me to the term ‘bait-and-switch’ in Issue 664 (Ed’s Letter, page 3). I had never heard of it before, but it perfectly sums up the behaviour of some so-called reputable companies in the past. Daniel mentions LastPass and CCleaner as two infamous bait-and-switchers. To that list I’d like to add both Microsoft and Google. I think they are the worst offenders. Back in 2015, Microsoft cut the amount of free space OneDrive offered from 15GB to 5GB. I was outraged by this betrayal and moved all my files immediately to Google Drive, which was offering 15GB. All was fine with Google, but then in 2020 it declared that all new photos uploaded to Drive would count towards your free 15GB of storage. This was despite saying a few years earlier that uploading photos to Google meant “a lifetime of memories”. I’ve reluctantly stuck with Google because I thought it would be too much hassle to switch (which is precisely what it was hoping for). But after reading your feature on free online storage in Issue 663, I’m considering moving to Mega’s free 20GB (www.mega.io). It sounds like a decent service, but I guess it’s a matter of time before it pulls its own bait-and-switch trick. Dennis Pilling CA SAYS Dennis is right that both Microsoft and Google have been guilty of ‘bait-and-switch’ tactics. This is where companies lure you in with a tempting offer, knowing that later they’ll start charging for a service or feature that was previously free. We’ll continue to expose these unfair practices. Please let us know which ones you’ve been affected by. O&O AppBuster (www.snipca.com/46027) to get rid of OneDrive (see screenshot above). But that was only partially successful because OneDrive still appears in File Explorer, and there are two grey (OneDrive) folders that aren’t completely empty. OneDrive should be an option, like Office 365, when first setting up a new PC. The way Microsoft forces it on users, with such dreadful consequences, is nothing short of bullying and extortion. Thank goodness your magazine has enabled me to resolve just some of these problems, even though it has taken many hours. Colin Gray Forcing OneDrive on us is ‘bullying and extortion’ Following Issue 660’s Cover Feature on mini PCs, I purchased the Geekom Mini IT11 (£479 from www. snipca.com/46362) with Windows 11, to replace an ageing Windows desktop PC. I’m delighted with my purchase, but far from delighted with Windows 11. I wish I had read Issue 663’s ‘Make Windows Great Again’ Cover Feature, but it arrived three days after I bought the PC. After transfering all my files from an external hard drive, Microsoft told me I needed to pay for more OneDrive storage. I wasn’t even aware that my documents were being duplicated in OneDrive. Frankly, File Explorer in Windows 11 is so unnecessarily complicated that it’s difficult to tell what documents are filed where. I’ve lost a lot of the valuable data I transferred, deleting it from the external hard drive too soon. As you suggested in Issue 663 I used It then took me almost three weeks to extricate myself from the contract. I suffered all the reported delays, long waits, silly offers and several cut-off calls. I was also blatantly lied to about the BT package I was moving to. When they did eventually agree to terminate my contract, they were curt, rude and offhand. BT may not be the greatest company, but they’ve delivered what was promised and are pleasant to deal with. Virgin Media lost a loyal customer, and I now won’t buy any Virgin-branded product unless I have absolutely no choice. As someone who spent 40 years in marketing for blue-chip companies, I can assure you that Virgin’s attitude is no way to run a company anywhere except into the ground. Philip Howells CA SAYS We’ve had many emails from readers unhappy with the service they’ve received from Virgin Media. It would be interesting to hear from customers of other providers, whether the service has been bad or good. Am I entitled to a broadband rebate? We live nearly four miles from the nearest fibre cabinet and have no prospect of fibre replacing copper before VoIP arrives in 2025. Smartphones receive a weak, intermittent 4G signal here, so we rely on Wi-Fi from our ‘broadband’ modem with its 200-250Kbps second download speed. The connection drops out several times a day, and though 4G may drop in occasionally, it’s seldom there when it’s needed. Next month, I’ll be 76. My state pension is £55.20 a month so it’s just as well I’m still fit enough to go on building dry stone walls – one of two small businesses I run from this communications black hole. I read that VoIP requires about 100Kbps – around half our current bandwidth – and, like dial-up, is likely to render the internet unusable during phone calls. We pay £18 a month for 0.2Mbps, and yet for £20 a month, those on the fastest social tariff get 350 times that speed. Is any other commodity allowed to be priced in this way? Dividing our broadband cost by 350 produces a figure of five pence a month. That should amount to a sizable rebate after all these years.

Just by the side of a large lake, on the opposite end a large pine forest with snow-capped mountains just at the back. One could see the beautiful sunset by the lake. Not a cloud in sight, the ceremony was truly perfect and unforgettable, in many ways neither Sarah, Michael or anyone else at the reception could hope to imagine. As Sarah and Michael were about to exchange their renewed vows, just at the opposite end of the lake was a giant grizzly bear and her two cubs walking together and a pack of wolves composed of the mating adults and their pups. The mother bear and wolf pack would be at each others throats, in an attempt to protect their young. The battle between the two was so breathtaking and loud that it stopped the ceremony for a while. The mother swatting the father wolf with her paws, only for the mother wolf join in and bite the bear, causing the bear to roar. The bear cubs and wolf pups each kept a safe distance. It was clear that neither animals would let any harm befall their offspring. Miraculously, neither animals died, though they had sustained injuries from tooth and claw, both mating wolves and the mother grizzly covered in both their own and each other's blood. Both conceded and retreated back into the forests, each of their offspring following suit. The scene had reached its conclusion, the wedding resumed, though the scenes of two apex predators in battle were still fresh on everyone’s mind. As the exchanging of vows resumed from the beginning, the priest decided to include the spectacle the happened before them as a sort of symbolism in his sermon.","output":"In his sermon, the priest spoke about the powerful display of love and fierce protection that the bear and wolf had shown for their young. He explained how, just like the animals, Sarah and Michael had built a strong bond as a couple and as parents to their three children. The priest emphasized the importance of love, commitment, and the willingness to do whatever it takes to protect and nurture their family. Sarah and Michael listened intently, their hearts filled with gratitude for the reminder of the strength of their marriage. They looked into each other's eyes and knew that their love had endured the test of time, just like the grizzly bear and the wolf had fought to protect their offspring. As they continued with their vows, Sarah and Michael promised to always be each other's rock, to support one another through thick and thin, and to fiercely protect and nurture their family. Their words were filled with sincerity and conviction, and tears welled up in the eyes of their loved ones witnessing the moment. The priest concluded his sermon by reminding everyone that life is full of challenges, just like the battle between the bear and the wolf. But if they stood strong together, like Sarah and Michael did, they could overcome any obstacle. He urged everyone to remember this remarkable spectacle and allow it to inspire them to keep fighting for their love and the well-being of their own families. As the ceremony came to an end, the guests erupted in applause, moved by the symbolism woven into Sarah and Michael's wedding vows. They embraced the couple, offering words of praise and well-wishes for a future filled with happiness and strength. The rest of the evening was filled with celebration, laughter, and an overwhelming sense of love. The sight of the bear and wolf battle had become a powerful reminder for everyone present to cherish their loved ones and to be grateful for the strength found in the bonds of family. Years later, Sarah and Michael always held a special place in their hearts for that unforgettable day. Whenever they faced challenges in their marriage or their role as parents, they would recall the image of the bear and the wolf battling it out, remembering the symbolism and the strength it represented. Their renewed wedding vows had truly become a testament to their love, reminding them of the fierce determination they had witnessed that day, and inspiring them to continue fighting for their love and family, no matter what obstacles may come their way."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The whole period to be covered by this chronicle is about two thousand million. In this chapter, and the next, therefore, we must accomplish a swift flight at great altitude over a tract of time more than three times as long as that which we have hitherto observed. This great expanse is no desert, but a continent teeming with variegated life, and many successive and very diverse civilizations. The myriads of human beings who inhabit it far outnumber the First and Second Men combined. And the content of each one of these lives is a universe, rich and poignant as that of any reader of this book. In spite of the great diversity of this span of man’s history, it is a single movement within the whole symphony, just as the careers of the First and of the Second Men are each a single movement. Not only is it a period dominated by a single natural human species and the artificial human species into which the natural species at length transformed itself; but, also, in spite of innumerable digressions, a single theme, a single mood of the human will, informs the whole duration. For now at last man’s main energy is devoted to remaking his own physical and mental nature. Throughout the rise and fall of many successive cultures this purpose is progressively clarifying itself, and expressing itself in many tragic and even devastating experiments; until, towards the close of this immense period, it seems almost to achieve its end. When the Second Men had remained in their strange racial trance for about thirty million years, the obscure forces that make for advancement began to stir in them once more. This reawakening was favoured by geological accident. An incursion of the sea gradually isolated some of their number in an island continent, which was once part of the North Atlantic ocean-bed. The climate of this island gradually cooled from sub-tropical to temperate and sub-arctic. The vast change of conditions caused in the imprisoned race a subtle chemical re-arrangement of the germ-plasm, such that there ensued an epidemic of biological variation. Many new types appeared, but in the long run one, more vigorous and better adapted than the rest, crowded out all competitors and slowly consolidated itself as a new species, the Third Men. Scarcely more than half the stature of their predecessors, these beings were proportionately slight and lithe. Their skin was of a sunny brown, covered with a luminous halo of red-gold hairs, which on the head became a russet mop. Their golden eyes, reminiscent of the snake, were more enigmatic than profound. Their faces were compact as cat’s muzzles, their lips full, but subtle at the corners. Their ears, objects of personal pride and of sexual admiration, were extremely variable both in individuals and races. These surprising organs, which would have seemed merely ludicrous to the First Men, were expressive both of temperament and passing mood. They were immense, delicately involuted, of a silken texture, and very mobile. They gave an almost bat-like character to the otherwise somewhat feline heads. But the most distinctive feature of the Third Men was their great lean hands, on which were six versatile fingers, six antennae of living steel. Unlike their predecessors, the Third Men were short-lived. They had a brief childhood and a brief maturity, followed (in the natural course) by a decade of senility, and death at about sixty. But such was their abhorrence of decrepitude, that they seldom allowed themselves to grow old. They preferred to kill themselves when their mental and physical agility began to decline. Thus, save in exceptional epochs of their history, very few lived to be fifty. But though in some respects the third human species fell short of the high standard of its predecessor, especially in certain of the finer mental capacities, it was by no means simply degenerate. The admirable sensory equipment of the second species was retained, and even improved. Vision was no less ample and precise and colourful. Touch was far more discriminate, especially in the delicately pointed sixth finger-tip. Hearing was so developed that a man could run through wooded country blindfold without colliding with the trees. Moreover the great range of sounds and rhythms had acquired an extremely subtle gamut of emotional significance. Music was therefore one of the main preoccupations of the civilizations of this species. Mentally the Third Men were indeed very unlike their predecessors. Their intelligence was in some ways no less agile; but it was more cunning than intellectual, more practical than theoretical. They were interested more in the world of sense-experience than in the world of abstract reason, and again far more in living things than in the lifeless. They excelled in certain kinds of art, and indeed also in some fields of science. But they were led into science more through practical, aesthetic, or religious needs than through intellectual curiosity. In mathematics, for instance (helped greatly by the duo-decimal system, which resulted from their having twelve fingers), they became wonderful calculators; yet they never had the curiosity to inquire into the essential nature of number. Nor, in physics, were they ever led to discover the more obscure properties of space. They were, indeed, strangely devoid of curiosity. Hence, though sometimes capable of a penetrating mystical intuition, they never seriously disciplined themselves under philosophy, nor tried to relate their mystical intuitions with the rest of their experience. In their primitive phases the Third Men were keen hunters; but also, owing to their strong parental impulses, they were much addicted to making pets of captured animals. Throughout their career they displayed what earlier races would have called an uncanny sympathy with, and understanding of, all kinds of animals and plants. This intuitive insight into the nature of living things, and this untiring interest in the diversity of vital behaviour, constituted the dominating impulse throughout the whole career of the third human species. At the outset they excelled not only as hunters but as herdsmen and domesticators. By nature they were very apt in every kind of manipulation, but especially in the manipulation of living things. As a species they were also greatly addicted to play of all kinds, but especially to manipulative play, and above all to the playful manipulation of organisms. From the first they performed great feats of riding on the moose-like deer which they had domesticated. They tamed also a certain gregarious coursing beast. The pedigree of this great leonine wolf led, through the tropical survivors of the Martian plague, back to those descendants of the arctic fox which had over-run the world after the Patagonian disaster. This animal the Third Men trained not only to help them in shepherding and in the chase, but also to play intricate hunting games. Between this hound and its master or mistress there frequently arose a very special relation, a kind of psychical symbiosis, a dumb intuitive mutual insight, a genuine love, based on economic cooperation, but strongly toned also, in a manner peculiar to the third human species, with religious symbolism and frankly sexual intimacy. As herdsmen and shepherds the Third Men very early practised selective breeding; and increasingly they became absorbed in the perfecting and enriching of all types of animals and plants. It was the boast of every local chieftain not only that the men of his tribe were more manly and the women more beautiful than all others, but also that the bears in his territory were the noblest and most bear-like of all bears, that the birds built more perfect nests and were more skilful fliers and singers than birds elsewhere. And so on, through all the animal and vegetable races. This biological control was achieved at first by simple breeding experiments, but later and increasingly by crude physiological manipulation of the young animal, the foetus and (later, still) the germ-plasm. Hence arose a perennial conflict, which often caused wars of a truly religious bitterness, between the tender-hearted, who shrank from the infliction of pain, and the passionately manipulative, who willed to create at whatever cost. This conflict, indeed, was waged not only between individuals but within each mind; for all were innately hunters and manipulators, but also all had intuitive sympathy even with the quarry which they tormented. The trouble was increased by a strain of sheer cruelty which occurred even in the most tender-hearted. This sadism was at bottom an expression of an almost mystical reverence for sensory experience. Physical pain, being the most intense of all sensed qualities, was apt to be thought the most excellent. It might be expected that this would lead rather to self-torture than to cruelty. Sometimes it did. But in general those who could not appreciate pain in their own flesh were yet able to persuade themselves that in inflicting pain on lower animals they were creating vivid psychic reality, and therefore high excellence. It was just the intense reality of pain, they said, that made it intolerable to men and animals. Seen with the detachment of the divine mind, it appeared in its true beauty. And even man, they declared, could appreciate its excellence when it occurred not in men but in animals. Though the Third Men lacked interest in systematic thought, their minds were often concerned with matters outside the fields of private and social economy. They experienced not only aesthetic but mystical cravings. And though they were without any appreciation of those finer beauties of human personality, which their predecessors had admired as the highest attainment of life on the planet, the Third Men themselves, in their own way, sought to make the best of human nature, and indeed of animal nature. Man they regarded in two aspects. In the first place he was the noblest of all animals, gifted with unique aptitudes. He was, as was sometimes said, God’s chief work of art. But secondly, since his special virtues were his insight into the nature of all living things and his manipulative capacity, he was himself God’s eye and God’s hand. These convictions were expressed over and over again in the religions of the Third Men by the image of the deity as a composite animal, with wings of the albatross, jaws of the great wolf-fox, feet of the deer, and so on. For the human element was represented in this deity by the hands, the eyes, and the sexual organs of man. And between the divine hands lay the world, with all its diverse population. Often the world was represented as being the fruit of God’s primitive potency, but also as in process of being drastically altered and tortured into perfection by the hands. Most of the cultures of the Third Men were dominated by this obscure worship of Life as an all-pervading spirit, expressing itself in myriad diverse individuals. And at the same time the intuitive loyalty to living things and to a vaguely conceived life-force was often complicated by sadism. For in the first place it was recognized, of course, that what is valued by higher beings may be intolerable to lower; and, as has been said, pain itself was thought to be a superior excellence of this kind. And again in a second manner sadism expressed itself. The worship of Life, as agent or subject, was complemented by worship of environment, as object to life’s subjectivity, as that which remains ever foreign to life, thwarting its enterprises, torturing it, yet making it possible, and, by its very resistance, goading it into nobler expressions. Pain, it was said, was the most vivid apprehension of the sacred and universal Object. The thought of the third human species was never systematic. But in some such manner as the foregoing it strove to rationalize its obscure intuition of the beauty which includes at once Life’s victory and defeat.\\"","output":"The third human species, known as the Third Men, emerged after the Second Men experienced a period of reawakening.

The Third Men had a strong affinity for animals and plants, practicing selective breeding and manipulation to perfect and enrich different species. However, this led to a conflict between those who valued empathy and those who sought to create at any cost.

El paracetamol es seguro y efectivo cuando se utiliza de acuerdo con las instrucciones, pero como con cualquier medicamento, es importante tomar las dosis recomendadas y consultar a un médico si tiene alguna duda o si los síntomas persisten."},{"instruction":"o que é o paracetamol?","output":"O paracetamol é um medicamento analgésico e antipirético, ou seja, é utilizado para aliviar a dor e reduzir a febre. Ele é um dos medicamentos mais comumente utilizados em todo o mundo. O paracetamol age atuando no sistema nervoso central, bloqueando a produção de substâncias chamadas prostaglandinas, que são responsáveis pela sensação de dor e pela elevação da temperatura corporal em casos de febre. Além do alívio da dor e da febre, o paracetamol também pode ser utilizado para tratar dores de cabeça, enxaquecas, dores musculares, dores de dente, dores menstruais e resfriados comuns. Ele é geralmente bem tolerado e considerado seguro quando utilizado corretamente e seguindo as doses recomendadas. No entanto, é importante ler sempre a bula do medicamento e seguir as orientações médicas para evitar riscos e efeitos adversos."},{"instruction":"como é a molécula do paracetamol","output":"A molécula do paracetamol, também conhecido como acetaminofeno, é composta por diversos átomos. Sua fórmula molecular é C8H9NO2, o que significa que a molécula contém oito átomos de carbono (C), nove átomos de hidrogênio (H), um átomo de nitrogênio (N) e dois átomos de oxigênio (O). A estrutura da molécula pode ser representada visualmente por meio de fórmulas estruturais ou modelos tridimensionais. Na representação da fórmula estrutural, o paracetamol é representado por um anel benzênico (composto formado por seis átomos de carbono e seis átomos de hidrogênio), acoplado a um grupo acetamida (que consiste em um grupo acetil, composto por um átomo de carbono, três átomos de hidrogênio e um átomo de oxigênio, ligado a um átomo de nitrogênio). A estrutura do paracetamol é importante para entender como ele interage com o organismo e como causa seus efeitos analgésicos e antipiréticos."},{"instruction":"Massa Molecular do paracetamol","output":"A massa molecular do paracetamol, também conhecido como acetaminofeno, é de aproximadamente 151,16 gramas por mol (g/mol). Essa massa molecular é calculada somando-se as massas atômicas de todos os átomos presentes na fórmula química do composto, que é C8H9NO2. Para calcular a massa molar, é necessário consultar a tabela periódica e somar as massas atômicas de cada elemento presente na fórmula: 8 átomos de carbono (C) com massa atômica de aproximadamente 12,011 g/mol, 9 átomos de hidrogênio (H) com massa atômica de aproximadamente 1,008 g/mol, 1 átomo de nitrogênio (N) com massa atômica de aproximadamente 14,007 g/mol e 2 átomos de oxigênio (O) com massa atômica de aproximadamente 15,999 g/mol. Portanto, a massa molecular do paracetamol é aproximadamente 12,011 g/mol * 8 + 1,008 g/mol * 9 + 14,007 g/mol * 1 + 15,999 g/mol * 2 = 151,16 g/mol."},{"instruction":"Funções orgânicas presentes na molécula de paracetamol e localização destas;","output":"A molécula de paracetamol contém duas funções orgânicas principais: um grupo acetamida e um grupo hidroxila. - O grupo acetamida está localizado na parte central da molécula e é representado pela presença do átomo de nitrogênio (N) ligado a um átomo de carbono (C) pela ligação dupla, formando uma ligação amida. Essa função orgânica é responsável pelo potencial analgésico do paracetamol. - O grupo hidroxila (OH) está localizado em um anel benzênico (estrutura de seis átomos de carbono e seis de hidrogênio unidos por ligações duplas e simples alternadas). Essa hidroxila está ligada a um átomo de carbono adjacente ao grupo acetamida. O grupo hidroxila é responsável pela atividade antipirética (redução de febre) do paracetamol.

Take out the pre-text and the post-text] Summarize \\"2. DIGRESSIONS OF THE THIRD MEN Such, in brief, was the physical and mental nature of the third human species. In spite of innumerable distractions, the spirit of the Third Men kept on returning to follow up the thread of biological interest through a thousand variegated cultures. Again and again folk after folk would clamber out of savagery and barbarism into relative enlightenment; and mostly, though not always, the main theme of this enlightenment was some special mood either of biological creativeness or of sadism, or of both. To a man born into such a society, no dominant characteristic would be apparent. He would be impressed rather by the many-sidedness of human activities in his time. He would note a wealth of personal intercourse, of social organization and industrial invention, of art and speculation, all set in that universal matrix, the private struggle to preserve or express the self. Yet the historian may often see in a society, over and above this multifarious proliferation, some one controlling theme. Again and again, then, at intervals of a few thousand or a few hundred thousand years, man’s whim was imposed upon the fauna and flora of the earth, and at length directed to the task of remaking man himself. Again and again, through a diversity of causes, the effort collapsed, and the species sank once more into chaos. Sometimes indeed there was an interlude of culture in some quite different key. Once, early in the history of the species, and before its nature had become fixed, there occurred a non-industrial civilization of a genuinely intellectual kind, almost like that of Greece. Sometimes, but not often, the third human species fooled itself into an extravagantly industrial world civilization, in the manner of the Americanized First Men. In general its interest was too much concerned with other matters to become entangled with mechanical devices. But on three occasions at least it succumbed. Of these civilizations one derived its main power from wind and falling water, one from the tides, one from the earth’s internal heat. The first, saved from the worst evils of industrialism by the limitations of its power, lasted some hundred thousand years in barren equilibrium, until it was destroyed by an obscure bacterium. The second was fortunately brief; but its fifty thousand years of unbridled waste of tidal energy was enough to interfere appreciably with the orbit of the moon. This world-order collapsed at length in a series of industrial wars. The third endured a quarter of a million years as a brilliantly sane and efficient world organization. Throughout most of its existence there was almost complete social harmony with scarcely as much internal strife as occurs in a bee-hive. But once more civilization came at length to grief, this time through the misguided effort to breed special human types for specialized industrial pursuits. Industrialism, however, was never more than a digression, a lengthy and disastrous irrelevance in the life of this species. There were other digressions. There were for instance cultures, enduring sometimes for several thousand years, which were predominantly musical. This could never have occurred among the First Men; but, as was said, the third species was peculiarly developed in hearing, and in emotional sensitivity to sound and rhythm. Consequently, just as the First Men at their height were led into the wilderness by an irrational obsession with mechanical contrivances, just as the Third Men themselves were many times undone by their own interest in biological control, so, now and again, it was their musical gift that hypnotized them. Of these predominantly musical cultures the most remarkable was one in which music and religion combined to form a tyranny no less rigid than that of religion and science in the remote past. It is worth while to dwell on one of these episodes for a few moments. The Third Men were very subject to a craving for personal immortality. Their lives were brief, their love of life intense. It seemed to them a tragic flaw in the nature of existence that the melody of the individual life must either fade into a dreary senility or be cut short, never to be repeated. Now, music had a special significance for this race. So intense was their experience of it, that they were ready to regard it as in some manner the underlying reality of all things. In leisure hours, snatched from a toilful and often tragic life, groups of peasants would seek to conjure about them by song or pipe or viol a universe more beautiful, more real, than that of daily labour. Concentrating their sensitive hearing upon the inexhaustible diversity of tone and rhythm, they would seem to themselves to be possessed by the living presence of music, and to be transported thereby into a lovelier world. No wonder they believed that every melody was a spirit, leading a life of its own within the universe of music. No wonder they imagined that a symphony or chorus was itself a single spirit inhering in all its members. No wonder it seemed to them that when men and women listened to great music, the barriers of their individuality were broken down, so that they became one soul through communion with the music. The prophet was born in a highland village where the native faith in music was intense, though quite unformulated. In time he learnt to raise his peasant audiences to the most extravagant joy and the most delicious sorrow. Then at last he began to think, and to expound his thoughts with the authority of a great bard. Easily he persuaded men that music was the reality, and all else illusion, that the living spirit of the universe was pure music, and that each individual animal and man, though he had a body that must die and vanish for ever, had also a soul that was music and eternal. A melody, he said, is the most fleeting of things. It happens and ceases. The great silence devours it, and seemingly annihilates it. Passage is essential to its being. Yet though for a melody, to halt is to die a violent death, all music, the prophet affirmed, has also eternal life. After silence it may occur again, with all its freshness and aliveness. Time cannot age it; for its home is in a country outside time. And that country, thus the young musician earnestly preached, is also the homeland of every man and woman, nay of every living thing that has any gift of music. Those who seek immortality, must strive to waken their tranced souls into melody and harmony. And according to their degree of musical originality and proficiency will be their standing in the eternal life. The doctrine, and the impassioned melodies of the prophet, spread like fire. Instrumental and vocal music sounded from every pasture and corn plot. The government tried to suppress it, partly because it was thought to interfere with agricultural productivity, largely because its passionate significance reverberated even in the hearts of courtly ladies, and threatened to undo the refinement of centuries. Nay, the social order itself began to crumble. For many began openly to declare that what mattered was not aristocratic birth, nor even proficiency in the time-honoured musical forms (so much prized by the leisured), but the gift of spontaneous emotional expression in rhythm and harmony. Persecution strengthened the new faith with a glorious company of martyrs who, it was affirmed, sang triumphantly even in the flames. One day the sacred monarch himself, hitherto a prisoner within the conventions, declared half sincerely, half by policy, that he was converted to his people’s faith. Bureaucracy gave place to an enlightened dictatorship, the monarch assumed the title of Supreme Melody, and the whole social order was refashioned, more to the taste of the peasants. The subtle prince, backed by the crusading zeal of his people, and favoured by the rapid spontaneous spread of the faith in all lands, conquered the whole world, and founded the universal Church of Harmony. The prophet himself, meanwhile, dismayed by his own too facile success, had retired into the mountains to perfect his art under the influence of their great quiet, or the music of wind, thunder, and waterfall. Presently, however, the silence of the fells was shattered by the blare of military bands and ecclesiastical choirs, which the emperor had sent to salute him and conduct him to the metropolis. He was secured, though not without a scrimmage, and lodged in the High Temple of Music. There he was kept a prisoner, dubbed God’s Big Noise, and used by the world-government as an oracle needing interpretation. In a few years the official music of the temple, and of deputations from all over the world, drove him into raving madness; in which state he was the more useful to the authorities. Thus was founded the Holy Empire of Music, which gave order and purpose to the species for a thousand years. The sayings of the prophet, interpreted by a series of able rulers, became the foundation of a great system of law which gradually supplanted all local codes by virtue of its divine authority. Its root was madness; but its final expression was intricate commonsense, decorated with harmless and precious flowers of folly. Throughout, the individual was wisely, but tacitly, regarded as a biological organism having definite needs or rights and definite social obligations; but the language in which this principle was expressed and elaborated was a jargon based on the fiction that every human being was a melody, demanding completion within a greater musical theme of society. Toward the close of this millennium of order a schism occurred among the devout. A new and fervent sect declared that the true spirit of the musical religion had been stifled by ecclesiasticism. The founder of the religion had preached salvation by individual musical experience, by an intensely emotional communion with the Divine Music. But little by little, so it was said, the church had lost sight of this central truth, and had substituted a barren interest in the objective forms and principles of melody and counterpoint. Salvation, in the official view, was not to be had by subjective experience, but by keeping the rules of an obscure musical technique. And what was this technique? Instead of making the social order a practical expression of the divine law of music, churchmen and statesmen had misinterpreted these divine laws to suit mere social convenience, until the true spirit of music had been lost. Meanwhile on the other side a counter-revival took place. The self-centred and soul-saving mood of the rebels was ridiculed. Men were urged to care rather for the divine and exquisitely ordered forms of music itself than for their own emotion. It was amongst the rebel peoples that the biological interest of the race, hitherto subordinate, came into its own. Mating, at least among the more devout sort of women, began to be influenced by the desire to have children who should be of outstanding musical brilliance and sensitivity. Biological sciences were rudimentary, but the general principle of selective breeding was known. Within a century this policy of breeding for music, or breeding ‘soul’, developed from a private idiosyncrasy into a racial obsession. It was so far successful that after a while a new type became common, and thrived upon the approbation and devotion of ordinary persons. These new beings were indeed extravagantly sensitive to music, so much so that the song of a skylark caused them serious torture by its banality, and in response to any human music of the kind which they approved, they invariably fell into a trance. Under the stimulus of music which was not to their taste they were apt to run amok and murder the performers. We need not pause to trace the stages by which an infatuated race gradually submitted itself to the whims of these creatures of human folly, until for a brief period they became the tyrannical ruling caste of a musical theocracy. Nor need we observe how they reduced society to chaos; and how at length an age of confusion and murder brought mankind once more to its senses, but also into so bitter a disillusionment that the effort to re-orientate the whole direction of its endeavour lacked determination. Civilization fell to pieces and was not rebuilt till after the race had lain fallow for some thousands of years. So ended perhaps the most pathetic of racial delusions. Born of a genuine and potent aesthetic experience, it retained a certain crazy nobility even to the end. Many scores of other cultures occurred, separated often by long ages of barbarism, but they must be ignored in this brief chronicle. The great majority of them were mainly biological in spirit. Thus one was dominated by an obsessive interest in flight, and therefore in birds, another by the concept of metabolism, several by sexual creativity, and very many by some general but mostly unenlightened policy of eugenics. All these we must pass over, so that we may descend to watch the greatest of all the races of the third species torture itself into a new form.\\"","output":"The third human species had a diverse range of cultures and interests, often centered around either biological creativity or sadism. There were periods of industrialism, but it was never a main focus. Music played a significant role in the society, with some cultures being predominantly musical and even forming a tyrannical religious order based on music. Selective breeding for musical talent also became an obsession, leading to a new type of beings that were incredibly sensitive to music. This obsession eventually led to chaos and the fall of civilization."},{"instruction":"Story prompt: John had a love for two things: history and storytelling, and it was inevitable that he'd combine both to make historical fiction stories. Today on September 7, 2023, John stumbled across a few articles online detailing the same recent discovery. The headline read, \\"Dead Sea reveals four 1,900-year-old Roman swords in cave\\", its subheading continued, \\"Apparently stolen by Jewish rebels, the incredibly well-preserved weapons are ‘an extremely rare find, the likes of which have never been found in Israel\\" John was fascinated and continued to read the article, \\"A cache of four excellently preserved Roman swords have been discovered by Israeli researchers in a cave overlooking the Dead Sea. Three of the 1,900-year-old weapons, whose iron blades are 60 to 65 centimeters long (24 to 26 inches), were still in wooden scabbards. They were found in a near-inaccessible crevice by a team photographing an ancient inscription on a stalactite. Archaeologists believe the swords were hidden by Judean rebels after they were seized from the Roman army as booty. The three swords that were still in their wooden scabbards were identified as Roman spatha, or long swords, while the fourth, shorter weapon was identified as a ring-pommel sword. They had well-fashioned handles made of wood or metal. Leather strips and pieces of wood and metal belonging to them were also found. They were then purposefully hidden for reuse, possibly during the second major Jewish revolt against the Roman Empire in Judea - the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132 AD -135 AD).\\" This was worthy of a story, and using both the facts and details from the article and his imagination to fill in the gaps, John began to write his story.","output":"As John delved into writing his historical fiction story, his excitement grew with each word that flowed onto the page. He wanted to capture the essence of those ancient times, to transport his readers back to the period of the Roman Empire and the Bar Kokhba Revolt. Working meticulously, John brought the characters of his story to life. He introduced Marcus, a skilled Roman soldier known for his unwavering loyalty to the Empire but haunted by the constant bloodshed of war. Then there was Judah, a young Jewish rebel driven by a passionate desire for freedom and the preservation of his people's heritage. John visualized the scene as Marcus and his legion marched through the rugged terrain surrounding the Dead Sea. Their mission was clear - to quell the rebellious Jewish forces and restore Roman control. As they moved cautiously through the rocky landscape, the soldiers stumbled upon a hidden cave, shrouded in mystery. Intrigued, Marcus led a group of his men into the dark depths. The air grew heavy, filled with anticipation and the scent of damp earth. The torchlight revealed ancient inscriptions on the cavern walls, a testament to the stories of those who came before. And there, amidst the echoes of history, lay the cache of four Roman swords, waiting to be discovered after centuries of hiding. John imagined the weight of the swords in Marcus' hands, the intricate craftsmanship of their handles, and the glint of steel under the flickering torchlight. What secrets could these weapons hold? What stories had they witnessed during their long confinement? In his fictional tale, John wove a narrative of conflicting loyalties and cultural pride. Marcus found himself torn between his duty to the Roman Empire and a growing admiration for the resilience of the Jewish rebels. The discovery of the hidden swords became a catalyst for his transformation, leading him to question the righteousness of their conquest. Meanwhile, Judah and his compatriots saw in these swords a symbol of defiance, a reminder of their ancestors' struggle against the overwhelming might of the Roman Empire. The weapons fueled their determination to reclaim their land and rewrite history. As John continued to pour his heart into the story, he intertwined real historical events and the vivid details from the article with his own creative imagination. He explored the inner turmoil of characters who were propelled by their love for their people and their passion for the past. With each chapter, John's historical fiction story undeniably grew into a tale of epic proportions. It depicted the clash of empires and the resilience of humanity, all sparked by the discovery of those four Roman swords in the depths of a cave overlooking the Dead Sea. Little did John know that his story would captivate readers from around the world, transporting them through time and immersing them in an era long past. With his deep love for history and storytelling, he had crafted a tale that would endure, forever intertwined with the ancient secrets concealed within the swords themselves."},{"instruction":"what is the defect screw dislocation ?","output":"A screw dislocation is a type of linear defect in a crystal lattice, where the atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive pattern. It occurs when one part of the crystal lattice is shifted or twisted in relation to the surrounding regions. In a screw dislocation, the lattice is continuous around a line called the dislocation line, which acts as the axis of rotation. Each atomic plane in the lattice is displaced parallel to the dislocation line, creating a spiral-like structure. The atoms or ions above and below the dislocation line are also shifted, contributing to the overall deformation of the crystal. Defect screw dislocations can occur naturally during the growth or deformation of crystals. They are important in materials science and engineering as they can influence mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility, as well as affect electrical and thermal conductivity. They can also serve as preferential sites for chemical reactions or diffusion within the crystal lattice."},{"instruction":"Write chapter 1 of a story about Kate.

Lost in her thoughts, Kate didn't notice the soft fluttering sound until it grew louder, closer. Startled, she turned her head to see a tiny figure hovering in front of her. It was a fairy, delicate wings flapping lightly, illuminating the room with a soft, golden light. Gasping in surprise, Kate watched as the fairy settled gracefully on her nightstand. The fairy's voice, tinged with musical sweetness, filled the room. \\"Greetings, Kate, I am Selene, the Fairy of Wishes. I have come to offer you a chance to fulfill one desire.\\" Kate's heart skipped a beat. How often did one encounter a fairy in their bedroom? It felt like a dream, something out of a fairytale. \\"A wish? Really?\\" she stammered with a mix of excitement and disbelief. \\"I suppose...I suppose I would like to have a...a larger chest.\\" The fairy's eyes sparkled as she nodded. \\"Your wish shall be granted.\\" A surge of anticipation coursed through Kate's veins. She imagined herself strolling with newfound confidence, her dream figure turning heads wherever she went. But as she closed her eyes, imagining her transformed appearance, she felt a peculiar warmth spreading through her body. Opening her eyes, Kate gasped in horror. Where her legs once were, there were powerful hooves. Her body had morphed into that of a majestic centaur, a glorious creature of myth and legend. It was beyond her wildest and, in this case, worst nightmares. \\"What have you done?!\\" Kate cried out, her voice trembling with a mix of fury and despair. \\"I wished for a larger chest, not to become a... a centaur!\\" The fairy's wings drooped slightly, her voice filled with regret. \\"Oh, dearest Kate, I misunderstood your intention. I thought you desired not merely a physical transformation, but a transformation that encompassed grace and power.\\" Kate could hardly believe what she was hearing. She frantically examined herself in the mirror, taking in the striking fusion of woman and horse. Her long hair flowed down her new equine neck, contrasting sharply with her dark, muscular horse body. She touched her newly formed horse ears and sighed, realizing the enormity of her situation. \\"I can't go out like this! How am I supposed to deal with this?\\" Kate murmured, her voice heavy with anxiety and frustration. Selene, the Fairy of Wishes, gave Kate a sympathetic smile. \\"Fear not, dear Kate. I will return tomorrow, and together we shall find a solution to this unexpected turn of events.\\" As the fairy made her exit through the open window, Kate was left alone with her bewildering transformation. She hoped desperately that the fairy would be able to reverse the spell, to make her whole once more. The following day, Kate resisted the urge to venture outside. Instead, she spent her time exploring her new body, practicing balancing on her powerful hind legs. The world outside her window was a mix of curiosity and danger. She didn't want to risk being seen by anyone, especially her nosy neighbor, Mrs. Carter. But as the hours stretched into eternal minutes, with no sign of the fairy's return, a sense of unease crept over Kate. How long would it take to reverse the spell? Would she ever be able to look in the mirror without feeling a pang of sadness? As evening descended upon the world, Kate retired to her bedroom. Exhausted, she settled onto her bed, her equine body awkwardly draped across the mattress. She looked longingly at the mirror, her black eyes reflecting a mixture of weariness and longing. With a sigh, Kate whispered to herself, \\"I just want to sleep. Maybe when I wake up, this will all be a dream.\\" As she closed her eyes, her thoughts drifted to the fairy, wondering when she would return and if she would be able to find a solution to this perplexing predicament.

It begins with Kate waking up to find the fairy in her room again. The fairy excitedly informs her that she thinks she has found a compromise. She asks Kate to make her initial wish from yesterday then explains she will grant it in a way that both satisfies her wish and adapts her existing transformed form. Kate hesitantly agrees and states her wish from yesterday. The fairy snaps her fingers then Kate undergoes another transformation. Kate watches as her wish is granted - as intended this time - and is granted so well, that But it doesn't stop there; Kate's horse features change into those of a cow - which Kate finds most offensive. The fairy makes a bemused comment about her handiwork. Kate, after an examination, concludes this is humiliating and demands the fairy not be lazy - that she should revert Kate's lower half to normal rather than alter it into... this. The fairy admits she cut corners and as consolation, provides Kate new clothing for her upper half and promises they will reconvene tomorrow. Kate begrudgingly puts up with the less desirable aspects of her new wish and proceeds to have an awkward encounter with her neighbour. The encounter happens at the window facing her neighbour's house, so the neighbour is reacting solely to Kate's chest, unaware of the other changes. Kate is forced to come up with an explanation before eventually drawing the curtains closed. Kate has several difficulties throughout the day, but eventually returns to the mirror before bed. To be continued.","output":"Chapter 2: The Compromise Kate awoke from a fitful sleep, her mind still filled with fragments of dreams and anxiety. Blinking sleep from her eyes, she realized that she was not alone. There, hovering near the foot of her bed, was Selene the fairy, a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \\"Kate! I believe I've found a solution!\\" Selene exclaimed, her voice vibrating with excitement. \\"You can still have your wish granted, in a way that both satisfies your desire and adapts your existing transformed form.\\" Hope cautiously flickered within Kate's chest. \\"Are you sure? After what happened yesterday, I don't know if I can trust another transformation.\\" The fairy's wings fluttered as she nodded reassuringly. \\"I have learned from my mistake, dear Kate. Trust me, this time will be different. You must make the same wish you did yesterday, and I will grant it in a way that doesn't undo my previous work.\\" Kate hesitantly nodded, seeing a faint glimmer of possibility. \\"Okay, fine. I wish... I wish for a larger chest.\\" With a snap of Selene's delicate fingers, Kate felt a surge of energy course through her body. A tingling sensation spread from her chest, radiating throughout her entire being. She watched, wide-eyed, as her chest swelled with newfound fullness, her figure transforming into the vision she had originally desired. But it didn't stop there. As Kate marveled at her reflection, she noticed something stir within the depths of her transformed form. Her horse features began to shift and change, morphing before her eyes. To her utter dismay, her horse legs gradually transformed into four sturdy cow legs, complete with cloven hooves. \\"What have you done?!\\" Kate cried out, staring down at her new lower half, which bore an uncanny resemblance to that of a cow. Selene let out a small chuckle. \\"My apologies, dear Kate. It seems my handiwork took an unexpected turn. I can be quite the trickster when I'm not careful.\\" Kate's eyes narrowed as she examined her altered appearance in the mirror. The irony of her wish being granted so well, only to result in a different, equally distressing outcome, wasn't lost on her. \\"This is humiliating! Is this some kind of a joke?\\" Selene raised an eyebrow, her smile tinged with bemusement. \\"I assure you, Kate, it was not my intention to offend or embarrass you. I may have taken some liberties with the transformation. But fear not, I have a consolation for you.\\" From the palm of her hand, the fairy conjured a set of finely tailored clothing that perfectly fit Kate's upper half, providing her with a modicum of modesty and dignity. \\"Consider this a token of my goodwill,\\" the fairy said, her voice filled with sincerity. Kate begrudgingly accepted the clothing, knowing that she had little choice but to put up with the less desirable aspects of her new wish. \\"Fine, but we're not done. We're going to reconvene tomorrow, and you better come up with a better solution.\\" The day proved to be a challenging one for Kate as she navigated the complexities of her altered form. In particular, an awkward encounter with her nosey neighbor occurred at the window facing Mrs. Carter's house. The neighbor's eyes widened, solely fixated on Kate's enlarged chest, unaware of the other startling changes. Thinking quickly, Kate flustered and muttered something about new workout routines as an explanation, desperately attempting to diffuse the situation before eventually drawing the curtains closed, her face flushed with embarrassment. Throughout the day, Kate faced numerous difficulties, from struggling to fit through doorways to figuring out how to sit comfortably with her new lower half. Yet, she persevered, determined to find a way to navigate this bewildering existence. As evening settled and darkness embraced her room, Kate found herself drawn once again to the mirror. She surveyed her reflection, the combination of beauty and awkwardness staring back at her. Sighing, she realized that for now, she had no choice but to embrace her circumstances and find a way forward.

L'événement auquel tu fais référence est connu sous le nom du \\"siège de Candie\\", qui a eu lieu entre 1648 et 1669. Candie (aujourd'hui Héraklion) était la capitale de la Crète vénitienne à l'époque. Pendant le siège, les forces ottomanes ont tenté de capturer Candie, mais la ville était bien fortifiée et les défenseurs vénitiens ont réussi à repousser les attaques incessantes. Voyant que leurs approvisionnements en nourriture s'amenuisaient dangereusement, les assiégés ont eu une idée ingénieuse pour tromper les assiégeants. Ils ont attaché une vache pleine de blé comme appât et l'ont lancée par-dessus les murs de la ville. Les forces ottomanes ont pensé que les assiégés jetaient l'animal comme un signe de capitulation, mais quand ils ont ouvert la vache, ils ont découvert le blé caché à l'intérieur. Les assiégés avaient ainsi réussi à fournir des provisions à leurs compatriotes, renforçant ainsi leur résistance contre l'envahisseur. Le siège de Candie a finalement pris fin en 1669 lorsque les troupes ottomanes ont réussi à capturer la ville après plusieurs décennies de conflit. Cependant, l'histoire du lancement de la vache emplie de blé est restée dans les mémoires comme un exemple de ruse et de détermination face à l'adversité."},{"instruction":"Donc cette ruse n'a pas marché ?","output":"Effectivement, bien que la ruse de lancer une vache pleine de blé au-dessus des murs de la ville ait été une astuce ingénieuse des assiégés de Candie, elle n'a pas réussi à mettre fin au siège ou à empêcher la prise de la ville par les forces ottomanes. Malgré les efforts de résistance et les différentes stratégies mises en place par les défenseurs vénitiens pendant les deux décennies de siège, les forces ottomanes ont réussi à capturer Candie en 1669. Les ressources alimentaires limitées, le siège prolongé et l'énorme supériorité numérique des assiégeants ont finalement eu raison de la résistance vénitienne. La ruse de la vache pleine de blé est devenue une anecdote célèbre de cette période, mais malheureusement pour les assiégés, elle n'a pas réussi à inverser le cours des événements ou à changer le dénouement du siège."},{"instruction":"Est ce que d'autres avant ou après on tenté cette ruse ?","output":"Il n'existe pas de récits historiques spécifiques sur d'autres tentatives similaires de lancer des animaux remplis de provisions au-dessus des murs lors d'un siège. Cependant, il est possible que des ruses similaires aient été utilisées à d'autres moments de l'histoire dans des situations de siège pour tenter de contourner les assiégeants et fournir des provisions aux assiégés. Les sièges étaient des événements courants dans l'histoire militaire, et les tactiques utilisées variaient en fonction des circonstances et des ressources disponibles. Les assiégés, cherchant souvent désespérément à trouver des moyens de se nourrir et de résister à l'ennemi, ont parfois utilisé des stratagèmes ingénieux pour tromper les assiégeants. Il est possible que des histoires de tentatives similaires de lancer des animaux ou des objets remplis de provisions pendant un siège existent mais ne soient pas aussi bien documentées ou connues que celle de Candie. Chaque siège a ses particularités et il existe de nombreuses histoires individuelles de ruses et de stratégies créatives utilisées par les assiégés pour résister à leurs ennemis."},{"instruction":"Quels ruses similaires connais tu et quelle issue y'a t'il eu?","output":"Il y a plusieurs exemples de ruses similaires utilisées pendant les sièges de villes à travers l'histoire. Voici quelques exemples : 1. Siège de Syracuse (212-211 av. J.-C.) : Lors de la Deuxième Guerre punique, Carthage a assiégé Syracuse. Les Syracusains, dirigés par l'ingénieur militaire Archimède, ont utilisé des miroirs pour concentrer les rayons du soleil et mettre le feu aux vaisseaux carthaginois, infligeant ainsi de lourdes pertes à l'ennemi. 2. Siège de Jérusalem (70 ap. J.-C.) : Lorsque les Romains ont assiégé Jérusalem pendant la première guerre judéo-romaine, les Juifs ont utilisé différentes stratégies de résistance, comme creuser des tunnels pour tenter de s'échapper. Cependant, les Romains ont finalement capturé la ville et détruit le temple de Jérusalem. 3. Siège de Baler (1898-1899) : Pendant la guerre hispano-américaine, un groupe de soldats espagnols s'est retrouvé assiégé dans l'église de Baler, aux Philippines. Les assiégés ont tenu pendant près d'un an, utilisant diverses ruses pour tromper les forces américaines. Finalement, ils se sont rendus après avoir reçu la confirmation que la guerre était terminée. Ces exemples montrent que bien que certaines ruses puissent être ingénieuses et temporirement efficaces, elles ne garantissent pas toujours la victoire ni la survie des assiégés. Les circonstances, les ressources disponibles et les forces en présence jouent un rôle essentiel dans l'issue finale d'un siège."},{"instruction":"Quelles sont les ruses utilisées lors du siège de Baker?","output":"Lors du siège de Baler (et non Baker, une petite correction), un groupe de soldats espagnols s'est retrouvé assiégé dans l'église de Baler, aux Philippines, de 1898 à 1899. Pendant cette période, les soldats assiégés ont utilisé différentes ruses pour essayer de survivre et de résister aux forces américaines. Voici quelques exemples de ces ruses : 1. Camouflage et dissimulation : Les soldats espagnols ont utilisé des techniques de camouflage pour se fondre dans leur environnement et éviter d'être repérés par l'ennemi. Ils se sont cachés dans la jungle environnante, se sont vêtus de vêtements adaptés à la végétation et ont dissimulé leurs positions de manière à tromper les forces américaines. 2. Fausse reddition : Les assiégés ont parfois simulé une reddition pour tenter de tromper les forces américaines. Ils ont fait semblant de se rendre, par exemple en brandissant un drapeau blanc ou en levant les mains en signe de renoncement, jusqu'à ce que les troupes adverses s'approchent suffisamment. Une fois à portée, les soldats espagnols ouvraient alors le feu sur les forces américaines, espérant les surprendre. 3. Propagande et diplomatie : Les soldats assiégés ont tenté d'utiliser la diplomatie et la propagande pour influencer l'opinion publique américaine et internationale. Ils ont envoyé des lettres et des messages dans lesquels ils décrivaient les conditions difficiles du siège et expliquaient leur décision de résister. Ils espéraient ainsi gagner le soutien du public et pousser à une intervention internationale en leur faveur. Malheureusement, malgré les ruses et les efforts de résistance des soldats espagnols assiégés, ils ont finalement dû se rendre lorsque les nouvelles leur sont parvenues selon lesquelles la guerre était terminée et que les Philippines étaient cédées aux États-Unis."},{"instruction":"Connais tu la théorie de l'unique ?","output":"Oui, je suis au courant de la théorie de l'unique. C'est une notion philosophique élaborée par le philosophe allemand Friedrich Nietzsche dans son ouvrage \\"Ainsi parlait Zarathoustra\\". Selon Nietzsche, l'idée de l'unique est une conception métaphysique qui affirme que chaque individu est unique et irremplaçable. Il soutient que chaque personne a sa propre valeur individuelle et une contribution spécifique à apporter au monde en fonction de ses talents, de sa créativité et de sa volonté de puissance. Nietzsche remet en question les notions d'égalité et d'universalité, suggérant que la valorisation de l'individualité et de l'unicité est essentielle pour l'épanouissement humain. La théorie de l'unique de Nietzsche a influencé de nombreux penseurs et mouvements philosophiques ultérieurs, notamment l'existentialisme, qui place l'accent sur l'importance de l'individu et de la liberté individuelle. Elle remet en question la tendance humaine à se conformer aux normes sociales et encourage les individus à embrasser leur singularité et à vivre de manière authentique selon leurs propres valeurs et aspirations. Cependant, il convient de noter que la théorie de l'unique de Nietzsche a fait l'objet d'interprétations et de critiques variées. Certains remettent en question sa vision de l'individualité et de la valeur intrinsèque de chaque individu, soulignant plutôt l'interdépendance et les relations sociales qui façonnent l'identité et la cognition humaine."},{"instruction":"Dis moi si j'étais dans ma réalité le seul véritable être et que tout ce qui m'entoure est donc illusion, qu'est ce que tu me conseillerais de faire ?","output":"Si vous croyez fermement être le seul véritable être dans votre réalité et que tout ce qui vous entoure est une illusion, cela pourrait être une perspective solipsiste. Les recommandations que je peux vous donner sont basées sur certaines implications philosophiques de cette idée, mais il est important de noter que la question de la réalité et de la perception de chacun est complexe et subjective. 1. Réfléchissez et questionnez votre perspective : Cherchez à comprendre pourquoi vous avez adopté cette croyance solipsiste. Explorez les raisons et les expériences qui vous ont conduit à cette idée. Engagez une réflexion philosophique sur la nature de la réalité et de l'existence. 2. Ouverture à d'autres perspectives : Bien que vous envisagiez votre réalité comme étant la seule réelle, il peut être intéressant d'explorer et de comprendre les différentes façons dont les autres perçoivent la réalité. Étudiez différentes écoles de pensée, philosophies et théories sur la perception et la réalité pour élargir votre compréhension. 3. Interaction sociale et empathie : Même si vous pensez être le seul véritable être, vous pouvez toujours interagir et apprendre des autres. Cultivez des relations sociales, écoutez les histoires et les expériences des autres, et soyez ouvert à l'empathie pour mieux comprendre leurs perspectives. 4. Recherche de sens et d'épanouissement : Si vous considérez votre réalité comme étant exclusive, prenez du temps pour réfléchir à ce qui donne un sens à votre vie et à vos objectifs personnels. Identifiez vos passions, vos valeurs et vos aspirations, et cherchez des moyens d'atteindre un sens et un épanouissement à partir de votre propre perspective. 5. Remise en question continue : Continuez à remettre en question vos croyances et votre perception de la réalité. Rester ouvert à d'autres possibilités peut enrichir votre compréhension et vous aider à évoluer en tant qu'individu. Il est important de souligner que la philosophie solipsiste est controversée et discutée depuis longtemps. Les réponses que je propose sont basées sur certaines implications de cette perspective, mais l'exploration de la réalité et de la perception est un sujet complexe qui suscite de nombreux débats et différentes approches."},{"instruction":"Et si c'est vraiment le cas que faire?","output":"La question de savoir si vous êtes le seul véritable être dans votre réalité est une question métaphysique complexe et philosophiquement débattue. Si vous croyez fermement être le seul être réel et que tout ce qui vous entoure est une illusion, il peut être difficile de déterminer des actions spécifiques à entreprendre, car cela dépend de la façon dont vous interprétez cette croyance et de son impact sur votre vie. Cependant, voici quelques suggestions générales : 1. Réflexion et intégration : Poursuivez votre réflexion et approfondissez votre compréhension de cette idée. Explorez les raisons de cette croyance et les implications qu'elle peut avoir sur votre façon de voir le monde. 2. Recherchez des connaissances philosophiques : Étudiez diverses écoles de pensée philosophique, y compris le solipsisme et d'autres perspectives sur la réalité, pour élargir vos horizons de pensée. La philosophie offre de nombreuses théories et discussions sur la nature de la réalité. 3. Cherchez un soutien ou des discussions : Engagez des conversations et partagez vos idées avec d'autres personnes intéressées par la philosophie ou la métaphysique. Trouver des communautés en ligne ou des groupes de discussion où vous pouvez exprimer vos idées et apprendre des perspectives différentes peut être bénéfique. 4. Maintenez une ouverture d'esprit : Gardez à l'esprit que la réalité est un sujet complexe et subjectif. Restez ouvert à d'autres perspectives et essayez de comprendre comment les autres peuvent percevoir la réalité différemment. 5. Cherchez le sens et l'épanouissement : Même si vous croyez être le seul être réel, vous pouvez poursuivre votre quête de sens, de croissance personnelle et d'épanouissement. Trouvez des activités, des passions ou des objectifs qui vous inspirent et vous permettent de vous épanouir, qu'il s'agisse de créativité, de développement personnel, d'exploration intellectuelle, etc. Il est important de reconnaître que l'idée d'être le seul véritable être dans une réalité est une perspective controversée et rarement partagée. Il est essentiel d'aborder cette question avec prudence et d'être conscient des discussions philosophiques et des différentes interprétations possibles."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Hold on…where’s Natsuki?” Yuri: “I haven’t seen her in a while.” Sayori: “Neither have I…” (turning towards her husband - MC) “MC, could you give her a call?” MC: “Sure, I’ll give her a call right now.” (MC takes out his phone and dials Natsuki’s number.

Three of the 1,900-year-old weapons, whose iron blades are 60 to 65 centimeters long (24 to 26 inches), were still in wooden scabbards. They were found in a near-inaccessible crevice by a team photographing an ancient inscription on a stalactite. Archaeologists believe the swords were hidden by Judean rebels after they were seized from the Roman army as booty.\\" Revolts against the Roman Empire, a good setting for his soon-to-be written story. The article continued, \\"The three swords that were still in their wooden scabbards were identified as Roman spatha, or long swords, while the fourth, shorter weapon was identified as a ring-pommel sword. They had well-fashioned handles made of wood or metal. Leather strips and pieces of wood and metal belonging to them were also found. They were then purposefully hidden for reuse, possibly during the second major Jewish revolt against the Roman Empire in Judea - the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132 AD -135 AD).\\" This was worthy of a story, the history of the revolt, and how those who participated in it came across those swords and had them hidden away, never to see the light of day until now. Using both the facts and details from the article and his imagination to fill in the gaps, John began to write his story.","output":"Title: \\"Forged in Revolt\\" Prologue: In the ancient land of Judea, where seething tensions between the Jewish rebels and the mighty Roman Empire loomed large, a young warrior named Simon found himself at the heart of a momentous conflict. Little did he know that his path would intertwine with the now-discovered Roman swords, in a tale that would echo through the ages. Chapter 1: A Fateful Encounter Simon, a fiercely passionate advocate for freedom, had joined the ranks of the rebellious Judean forces during the tumultuous Bar Kokhba Revolt. As he ventured deep into the treacherous terrain overlooking the Dead Sea, fate led him to stumble upon a hidden crevice. Chapter 2: The Stolen Treasures Unearthed Drawing upon every ounce of curiosity and bravery, Simon and his comrades reached the hidden cache of swords. Time had treated them kindly; their blades glistened with untamed history. Sensing the opportunity to turn the tides of battle, Simon made it his mission to safeguard these powerful symbols of resistance. Chapter 3: The Swordsmith's Secret As Simon delved deeper into the annals of history, he realized that these swords were not merely weapons but remarkable works of artistry. In his pursuit of knowledge, he encountered a wise swordsmith, Elazar, who revealed the secrets behind the crafting of these exquisite blades. Chapter 4: The Battle Rages On As the Bar Kokhba Revolt raged across Judea, Simon's small band of rebels grew bolder. Equipped with the Roman swords, they honed their skills and unleashed their newfound power against the formidable Roman legions. Each sword held an immeasurable weight, embodying the hopes and dreams of those who fought for liberty. Chapter 5: A Hidden Legacy The tides of war eventually turned against the rebels, forcing Simon and his comrades into retreat. Fearing the loss of their prized possessions, they took great care to meticulously conceal the long swords and the unique ring-pommel sword, ensuring their preservation for future generations. Chapter 6: Echoes of Freedom Fast forward centuries later to the present day, where John, a passionate historian and storyteller, encountered the remarkable discovery of the ancient swords. Guided by the articles and his own vivid imagination, he embarked on a journey to bring the forgotten story of Simon and the Bar Kokhba Revolt to life, weaving together truth and fiction. Epilogue: Legacy Reclaimed Through John's captivating historical fiction, the memory of Simon, the rebellious spirit of the Judean warriors, and the revolution against the Roman Empire resurfaced. With this newfound knowledge, modern readers would honor the sacrifices of the past, cherishing the enduring legacy of courage and the pursuit of freedom. In the realms of John's storytelling, the swords would become emblems of resistance, vessels embodying the undying human spirit against oppression.

Owners have little or no control over data collected The Canadian Press Wed, September 6, 2023 at 6:46 p.m. EDT·5 min read BOSTON (AP) — Most major car manufacturers admit they may be selling your personal information — though they are vague on the buyers, a new study finds, and half say they would share it with the government or law enforcement without a court order. The proliferation of sensors in automobiles — from telematics to fully digitized control consoles — has made them prodigious data-collection hubs. But drivers are given little or no control over the personal data their vehicles collect, researchers for the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said Wednesday in their latest “Privacy Not Included” survey. Security standards are also vague, a big concern given automakers’ track record of susceptibility to hacking. “Cars seem to have really flown under the privacy radar and I’m really hoping that we can help remedy that because they are truly awful,” said Jen Caltrider, the study’s research lead. “Cars have microphones and people have all kinds of sensitive conversations in them. Cars have cameras that face inward and outward.” Unless they opt for a used, pre-digital model, car buyers “just don’t have a lot of options,” Caltrider said. Cars scored worst for privacy among more than a dozen product categories — including fitness trackers, reproductive-health apps, smart speakers and other connected home appliances — that Mozilla has studied since 2017. Not one of the 25 car brands whose privacy notices were reviewed — chosen for their popularity in Europe and North America — met the minimum privacy standards of Mozilla, which promotes open-source, public interest technologies and maintains the Firefox browser. By contrast, 37% of the mental health apps the non-profit reviewed this year did. Nineteen automakers say they can sell your personal data, their notices reveal. Half will share your information with government or law enforcement in response to a “request” — as opposed to requiring a court order. Only two — Renault and Dacia, which are not sold in North America — offer drivers the option to have their data deleted. The automakers are vague on disclosing to whom they are selling what they collect, though the researchers have little doubt it includes data brokers, marketers and dealers. Partners with installed products and services, including SiriusXM, Google Maps and Onstar, are also amassing data. “Increasingly, most cars are wiretaps on wheels,” said Albert Fox Cahn, a technology and human rights fellow at Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. “The electronics that drivers pay more and more money to install are collecting more and more data on them and their passengers.\\" “There is something uniquely invasive about transforming the privacy of one’s car into a corporate surveillance space,” he added. A trade group representing the makers of most cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, took issue with that characterization. In a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. House and Senate leadership, it said it shares “the goal of protecting the privacy of consumers.” It called for a federal privacy law, saying a “patchwork of state privacy laws creates confusion among consumers about their privacy rights and makes compliance unnecessarily difficult.” The absence of such a law lets connected devices and smartphones amass data for tailored ad targeting and other marketing — while also raising the odds of massive information theft through cybersecurity breaches. The Associated Press asked the Alliance, which has resisted efforts to provide car owners and independent repair shops with access to onboard data, if it supports allowing car buyers to automatically opt out of data collection — and granting them the option of having collected data deleted. Spokesman Brian Weiss said that for safety reasons the group “has concerns” about letting customers completely opt out — but does endorse giving them greater control over how the data is used in marketing and by third parties. In a 2020 Pew Research survey, 52% of Americans said they had opted against using a product or service because they were worried about the amount of personal information it would collect about them. On security, Mozilla's minimum standards include encrypting all personal information on a car. The researchers said most car brands ignored their emailed questions on the matter, those that did offering partial, unsatisfactory responses. Japan-based Nissan astounded researchers with the level of honesty and detailed breakdowns of data collection its privacy notice provides, a stark contrast with Big Tech companies such as Facebook or Google. “Sensitive personal information” collected includes driver's license numbers, immigration status, race, sexual orientation and health diagnoses. Further, Nissan says it can share “inferences” drawn from the data to create profiles \\"reflecting the consumer’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.” It was among six car companies that said they could collect “genetic information” or “genetic characteristics,\\" the researchers found. Nissan also said it collected information on “sexual activity.\\" It didn't explain how. The all-electric Tesla brand scored high on Mozilla’s “creepiness” index. If an owner opts out of data collection, Tesla’s privacy notice says the company may not be able to notify drivers “in real time” of issues that could result in “reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.” Tesla did not respond to questions about its data practices. In a statement, Nissan said it takes “privacy and data protection for our consumers and employees very seriously. When we do collect or share personal data, we comply with all applicable laws and provide the utmost transparency.” Mozilla's Caltrider credited laws like the 27-nation European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and California's Consumer Privacy Act for compelling carmakers to provide existing data collection information. It's a start, she said, by raising awareness among consumers just as occurred in the 2010s when a consumer backlash prompted TV makers to offer more alternatives to surveillance-heavy connected displays.

Economies of scale: Large farming corporations have the advantage of economies of scale, which means they can produce a larger quantity of goods at a lower cost per unit. They can invest in modern, efficient machinery and utilize advanced technologies to maximize output. This allows them to operate more efficiently and compete effectively in a rapidly growing market. Small family farms, on the other hand, may not have the financial resources to invest in such modern technologies and machinery, which limits their ability to increase their productivity and output. 2. Access to capital and resources: Large farming corporations often have better access to capital and resources, such as credit, land, and infrastructure. They can secure additional funding to expand their operations or acquire smaller farms. In contrast, small family farms may struggle to access affordable credit or lack the resources needed to invest and expand their businesses. Without adequate resources, they are more vulnerable to being unable to keep up with the rapidly growing demands of the market. 3. Specialization and diversification: Large farming corporations have the capacity to specialize in specific crops or livestock production, focusing on high-yielding varieties or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that increase productivity. They can also diversify their operations into various sectors of the agricultural industry, allowing them to adapt to changing market trends and consumer demands. Small family farms, often relying on traditional farming practices, may find it difficult to specialize or diversify effectively due to limited resources and expertise. 4. Market power: Large farming corporations often have greater market power as they control a significant portion of the market share. This gives them an advantage in negotiating prices and contracts with suppliers, processors, and retailers. They can secure favorable deals and access larger markets. In contrast, small family farms have limited bargaining power and may struggle to achieve economies of scale or secure favorable market opportunities. As a result, they may find it challenging to remain competitive in the face of rapid productivity and output growth. 5. Changing consumer preferences: Rapid productivity growth often leads to a shift in consumer preferences towards cheaper, mass-produced goods. Large farming corporations are better positioned to cater to these changing preferences as they can offer lower prices due to economies of scale. Small family farms, which often rely on niche or organic products, may find it difficult to compete and adapt to these shifting consumer demands, further increasing the likelihood of their disappearance. In conclusion, while small family farms offer their unique benefits such as community integration and sustainable farming practices, they are more likely to disappear in the face of rapid productivity and output growth due to the advantages and capabilities of large farming corporations."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Hold on…where’s Natsuki?” Yuri: “I haven’t seen her in a while.” Sayori: “Neither have I…” (turning towards her husband - MC) “MC, could you give her a call?” MC: “Sure, I’ll give her a call right now.” (MC takes out his phone and dials Natsuki’s number.

Take out the pre-text and the post-text] Summarize \\"3. THE FIFTH MEN The plan of the proposed new human being was worked out in great detail before any attempt was made to produce an actual individual. Essentially he was to be a normal human organism, with all the bodily functions of the natural type; but he was to be perfected through and through. Care must be taken to give him the greatest possible bulk of brain compatible with such a general plan, but no more. Very carefully his creators calculated the dimensions and internal proportions which their creature must have. His brain could not be nearly as large as their own, since he would have to carry it about with him, and maintain it with his own physiological machinery. On the other hand, if it was to be at all larger than the natural brain, the rest of the organism must be proportionately sturdy. Like the Second Men, the new species must be titanic. Indeed, it must be such as to dwarf even those natural giants. The body, however, must not be so huge as to be seriously hampered by its own weight, and by the necessity of having bones so massive as to be unmanageable. In working out the general proportions of the new man, his makers took into account the possibility of devising more efficient bone and muscle. After some centuries of patient experiment they did actually invent a means of inducing in germ cells a tendency toward far stronger bone-tissues and far more powerful muscle. At the same time they devised nerve-tissues more highly specialized for their particular functions. And in the new brain, so minute compared with their own, smallness was to be compensated for by efficiency of design, both in the individual cells and in their organization. Further, it was found possible to economize somewhat in bulk and vital energy by improvements in the digestive system. Certain new models of micro-organisms were produced, which, living symbiotically in the human gut, should render the whole process of digestion easier, more rapid, and less erratic. Special attention was given to the system of self-repair in all tissues, especially in those which had hitherto been the earliest to wear out. And at the same time the mechanism regulating growth and general senescence was so designed that the new man should reach maturity at the age of two hundred years, and should remain in full vigour for at least three thousand years, when, with the first serious symptom of decay, his heart should suddenly cease functioning. There had been some dispute whether the new being should be endowed with perennial life, like his makers. But in the end it had been decided that, since he was intended only as a transitional type, it would be safer to allow him only a finite, though a prolonged lifetime. There must be no possibility that he should be tempted to regard himself as life’s final expression. In sensory equipment, the new man was to have all the advantages of the Second and Third Men, and, in addition a still wider range and finer discrimination in every sense organ. More important was the incorporation of Martian units in the new model of germ cell. As the organism developed, these should propagate themselves and congregate in the cells of the brain, so that every brain area might be sensitive to ethereal vibrations, and the whole might emit a strong system of radiation. But care was taken so that this ‘telepathic’ faculty of the new species should remain subordinate. There must be no danger that the individual should become a mere resonator of the herd. Long drawn out chemical research enabled the Fourth Men to design also far-reaching improvements in the secretions of the new man, so that he should maintain both a perfect physiological equilibrium, and a well-balanced temperament. For they were determined that though he should experience all the range of emotional life, his passions should not run into disastrous excess; nor should he be prone to some one emotion in season and out of season. It was necessary also to revise in great detail the whole system of natural reflexes, abolishing some, modifying others, and again strengthening others. All the more complex, ‘instinctive’ responses, which had persisted in man since the days of Pithecanthropus Erectus, had also to be meticulously revised, both in respect of the form of the activity and the objects upon which they should be instinctively directed. Anger, fear, curiosity, humour, tenderness, egoism, sexual passion, and sociality must all be possible, but never uncontrollable. In fact, as with the Second Men, but more emphatically, the new type was to have an innate aptitude for, and inclination toward, all those higher activities and objects which, in the First Men, were only achieved after laborious discipline. Thus, while the design included self-regard, it also involved a disposition to prize the self chiefly as a social and intellectual being, rather than as a primeval savage. And while it included strong sociality, the group upon which instinctive interest was to be primarily directed was to be nothing less than the organized community of all minds. And again, while it included vigorous primitive sexuality and parenthood, it provided also those innate ‘sublimations’ which had occurred in the second species; for instance, the native aptitude for altruistic love of individual spirits of every kind, and for art and religion. Only by a miracle of pure intellectual skill could the cold-natured Great Brains, who were themselves doomed never to have actual experience of such activities, contrive, merely by study of the Third Men, to see their importance, and to design an organism splendidly capable of them. It was much as though a blind race, after studying physics, should invent organs of sight. It was recognized, of course, that in a race in which the average life-span should be counted in thousands of years, procreation must be very rare. Yet it was also recognized that, for full development of mind, not only sexual intercourse but parenthood was necessary in both sexes. This difficulty was overcome partly by designing a very prolonged infancy and childhood; which, necessary in themselves for the proper mental and physical growth of these complicated organisms, provided also a longer exercise of parenthood for the mature. At the same time the actual process of child-birth was designed to be as easy as among the Third Men. And it was expected that with its greatly improved physiological organization the infant would not need that anxious and absorbing care which had so seriously hobbled most mothers among the earlier races. The mere sketching out of these preliminary specifications of an improved human being involved many centuries of research and calculation which taxed even the ingenuity of the Great Brains. Then followed a lengthy period of tentative experiment in the actual production of such a type. For some thousands of years little was done but to show that many promising lines of attack were after all barren. And several times during this period the whole work was held up by disagreements among the Great Brains themselves as to the policy to be adopted. Once, indeed, they took to violence, one party attacking the other with chemicals, microbes, and armies of human automata. In short it was only after many failures, and after many barren epochs during which, for a variety of reasons, the enterprise was neglected, that the Fourth Men did at length fashion two individuals almost precisely of the type they had originally designed. These were produced from a single fertilized ovum, in laboratory conditions. Identical twins, but of opposite sexes, they became the Adam and Eve of a new and glorious human species, the Fifth Men. It may fittingly be said of the Fifth Men that they were the first to attain true human proportions of body and mind. On the average they were more than twice as tall as the First Men, and much taller than the Second Men. Their lower limbs had therefore to be extremely massive compared with the torso which they had to support. Thus, upon the ample pedestal of their feet, they stood like columns of masonry. Yet though their proportions were in a manner elephantine, there was a remarkable precision and even delicacy in the volumes that composed them. Their great arms and shoulders, dwarfed somewhat by their still mightier legs, were instruments not only of power but also of fine adjustment. Their hands also were fashioned both for power and for minute control; for, while the thumb and forefinger constituted a formidable vice, the delicate sixth finger had been induced to divide its tip into two Lilliputian fingers and a corresponding thumb. The contours of the limbs were sharply visible, for the body bore no hair, save for a close, thick skullcap which, in the original stock, was of ruddy brown. The well-marked eyebrows, when drawn down, shaded the sensitive eyes from the sun. Elsewhere there was no need of hair, for the brown skin had been so ingeniously contrived that it maintained an even temperature alike in tropical and sub-Arctic climates, with no aid either from hair or clothes. Compared with the great body, the head was not large, though the brain-capacity was twice that of the Second Men. In the original pair of individuals the immense eyes were of a deep violet, the features strongly moulded and mobile. These facial characters had not been specially designed, for they seemed unimportant to the Fourth Men; but the play of biological forces resulted in a face not unlike that of the Second Men, though with an added and indescribable expression which no human face had hitherto attained. How from this pair of individuals the new population gradually arose; how at first it was earnestly fostered by its creators; how it subsequently asserted its independence and took control of its own destiny; how the Great Brains failed piteously to understand and sympathize with the mentality of their creatures, and tried to tyrannize over them; how for a while the planet was divided into two mutually intolerant communities, and was at last drenched with man’s blood, until the human automata were exterminated, the Great Brains starved or blown to pieces, and the Fifth Men themselves decimated; how, as a result of these events, a dense fog of barbarism settled once more upon the planet, so that the Fifth Men, like so many other races, had after all to start rebuilding civilization and culture from its very foundations; how all these things befell we must not in detail observe.\\"","output":"The plan for creating a new human being, known as the Fifth Men, was carefully developed before any attempts were made. This new species was intended to be a perfected version of a normal human, with a larger brain and improved bodily functions. The creators of the Fifth Men calculated the dimensions and proportions for the organism, making sure it was large enough to accommodate a larger brain but not so large that it hindered mobility. They also made improvements to the digestive system, nerve tissues, and self-repair mechanisms in order to enhance the overall efficiency and longevity of the new species. The sensory equipment of the Fifth Men surpassed that of previous species, with a wider range and better discrimination in every sense organ. The incorporation of Martian units in the germ cells allowed for a strong system of radiation and the potential for a telepathic faculty.

Kate is a young woman with long black hair who is visited in her room by a fairy. After a short exchange, the fairy offers to grant a wish. Kate makes a wish with the intention of gaining a larger chest, but the fairy misinterprets the wish; in addition to granting her actual request in excess, the fairy turns her into a cowtaur. Kate undergoes a long transformation. Afterwards she accosts the fairy for her mistake, but the fairy explains how she interpreted the wish. Kate takes in the changes in the mirror, lamenting how she’s going to deal with this. The fairy leaves her but says she will return so they can brainstorm a solution later. The rest of the story focuses on Kate trying to manage her condition; she risks going outside at one point to collect a package from the mailbox and narrowly avoids being spotted by a neighbour. She then reflects at the mirror again and, with no sign of the fairy’s return, she tries as best she can to sleep. To be continued.","output":"Chapter 1: The Unexpected Transformation Kate gazed out of her bedroom window, the moonlight casting a soft glow on her face. Her heart was heavy with the weight of her insecurities. As a young woman, she had always felt self-conscious about her body, particularly about her small chest. Her long, black hair cascaded down her back as she sighed, longing for a change. Little did she know that her life was about to take an unexpected turn. As the clock struck midnight, a faint fluttering sound echoed in her room. Kate turned, her eyes widening as she spotted a small, ethereal figure perched on her windowsill. It was a fairy. The fairy, with twinkling wings and a mischievous grin, introduced herself as Elara. \\"I heard your desires, Kate,\\" she said in a voice as delicate as the wind. \\"I have the power to grant you one wish. What is it that you truly desire?\\" Startled by the fairy's appearance and sudden offer, Kate's mind raced, her longing for a larger chest consuming her thoughts. With hope in her voice, she replied, \\"I wish for a bigger chest, one that will give me the confidence I've always lacked.\\" Without fully understanding the consequences of her wish, Kate's intentions were sincere, but the fairy, in her own whimsical way, misinterpreted her words. Understanding 'bigger' in the truest sense, Elara granted Kate's request, magnifying her chest far beyond what she had ever imagined possible. But that wasn't all. As a result of the fairy's powers, Kate's wish took on a life of its own, transforming her into something entirely unexpected. She gasped as her legs merged together, elongating into a bovine form. Her body tingled with an unfamiliar energy as soft brown fur sprouted all over her newly transformed legs and torso. Kate had become a cowtaur – a centaur-like creature with the upper half of a woman and the lower half of a cow. Shocked and confused, Kate stumbled towards the mirror, her hooves clattering on the wooden floor. A mixture of fear and fascination flooded her emotions as she took in her reflection. Her once slender body was now adorned with the majestic stature of a creature from mythical tales. \\"What have you done?!\\" she yelled, her voice filled with anger and despair. \\"This isn't what I wished for!\\" Elara, still hovering near the windowsill, looked apologetic. \\"Ah, my dear Kate, I'm afraid I interpreted your wish rather literally. I understood 'bigger' as a physical transformation, not just your chest. My magic can be quite literal at times.\\" Her hands trembling, Kate couldn't help but feel a surge of despair. How could she face the world, let alone herself, in this bovine form? How would she ever find a solution? \\"I will return, dear Kate,\\" the fairy promised, her voice gentle. \\"We shall brainstorm a way to restore you to your former self. For now, learn to embrace these changes and discover the strength that lies within you.\\" With that, Elara vanished, leaving Kate alone with her thoughts and her new reality. She gingerly traced her hooves with her fingers, tears streaming down her face. The journey of self-discovery, acceptance, and finding a way forward had only just begun. Kate knew she couldn't remain hidden in her room forever. Time would reveal new challenges and unexpected obstacles that awaited her outside. Gathering her courage, she decided she had to face the world, just for a moment. With a deep breath, she cautiously stepped out of her room, making her way towards the front door. The moonlight guided her path as she ventured outside, hoping that the cloak of darkness would keep her hidden. Hesitant and vulnerable, she reached the mailbox, the anticipation of important news looming over her. Just as she grabbed the package and turned to retreat, a neighbor's porch light flickered on, momentarily illuminating the night. Kate froze, her heart pounding in her ears, but luck was on her side as the neighbor's attention was drawn elsewhere, saving her from potential discovery. Retreating back into the safety of her room, Kate collapsed onto her bed, exhaustion engulfing her. The mirror beckoned to her, reflecting her altered form back at her. With no sign of the fairy's return, she resigned herself to the reality of her situation. She closed her eyes, desperately seeking sleep and solace, hoping that her dreams would offer her a temporary escape from the challenges that lay ahead. The night embraced her, and as she drifted into a restless slumber, Kate couldn't help but wonder what the next chapter of her life would bring.

As the clock struck midnight, a gentle flutter filled the room, drawing Kate's attention to her windowsill. There, perched gracefully, was a small and enchanting fairy named Elara. Her wings shimmered with ethereal light, and her eyes sparkled mischievously. \\"I heard your desires, Kate,\\" Elara said, her voice carrying a melodious tone. \\"I have the power to grant you one wish. What is it that you truly desire?\\" Surprised by the appearance of the fairy and caught off guard by the offer, Kate's mind raced. Her longing for a larger chest consumed her thoughts, and with hope in her voice, she replied, \\"I wish for a bigger chest, one that will give me the confidence I've always lacked.\\" Elara's wings glowed brightly as her magical powers surged through her tiny form. However, the fairy's interpretation of \\"bigger\\" took on a life of its own, stretching beyond what Kate had ever intended. The enchanting spell went far beyond simply altering her chest size. Kate's legs began to tingle, and a strange energy surged through her body. Trembling, she watched in awe as her legs slowly merged together, elongating into a sturdy bovine form. Soft brown fur sprouted all over her newly transformed legs and torso, accompanied by a slight shimmer that hinted at other changes to come. A mixture of fear and fascination flooded Kate's emotions as she stumbled towards the mirror. Her hooves clattered against the wooden floor, serving as a stark reminder of her transformation. Her once slender body now boasted the majestic stature of a mythical creature. Horror and despair gripped Kate's heart as she stared at her reflection. Frustrated, she shouted, \\"What have you done?! This isn't what I wished for!\\" Elara, hovering near the windowsill, looked apologetic. \\"I sincerely misunderstood your wish, dear Kate. When you desired a 'bigger' chest, I took it quite literally. My magic tends to interpret wishes in their most literal sense.\\" Kate's gaze shifted from the fairy to her new bovine lower half. She couldn't believe what she had become— a cowtaur, a being that merged the upper half of a woman with the lower half of a cow. With her voice trembling, Kate demanded, \\"You must fix this! Change me back to how I was!\\" Elara nodded, compassion in her eyes. \\"I promise I will return, dear Kate. Together, we will brainstorm a way to restore you to your former self. But for now, embrace these changes and discover the strength that lies within you.\\" With that, Elara vanished, leaving Kate alone with her thoughts and her new reality. Tears streamed down her face as she gently touched her fur-clad legs and hooves, grappling with the enormity of the transformation. Soon, the fear of facing the world with her altered form overwhelmed her. She knew she couldn't stay hidden forever; the challenges and obstacles that awaited outside were inevitable. Summoning all her courage, Kate made a decision. She would step outside, if only for a moment. Under the moon's gentle light, she cautiously ventured beyond her room, her hooves making soft thuds on the floor. Her heart raced as she reached the mailbox, her anticipation mingling with the fear of being spotted. Just as she grabbed the package and turned to retreat, a neighbor's porch light flickered on, momentarily illuminating the darkness. Kate froze, her heart pounding in her ears. Thankfully, the neighbor's attention was diverted, saving her from potential discovery. Back inside her room, Kate collapsed onto her bed, exhaustion consuming her. The mirror beckoned to her, reflecting her altered form back at her. With no sign of the fairy's return, she resigned herself to the reality of her situation. As the weight of her new form settled upon her, Kate closed her eyes, hoping that sleep would grant her a temporary respite from the challenges that lay ahead. The night embraced her, and as she drifted into a restless slumber, Kate couldn't help but wonder what the next chapter of her life would bring.

To be continued.","output":"Chapter 2: The Mischievous Fairy and Unveiled Changes Days had passed since Kate's transformation into a cowtaur, and as promised, the fairy Elara returned to continue their journey towards finding a solution. The enchanted creature fluttered into the room, her twinkling wings shimmering in the gentle light that filtered through the window. \\"Kate,\\" Elara chimed, her voice carrying a sense of determination. \\"I have returned to aid you in this quest for reverse transformation. I shall amplify the changes you desire most and reverse the ones that trouble you the least.\\" Hope flickered in Kate's eyes as she listened to the fairy's words. The idea of having her wish fulfilled, or at least partially changed to her benefit, filled her with a sense of anticipation and relief. Elara studied Kate's altered form, a mischievous smile tugging at the corners of her lips. \\"Hmm, let me see,\\" she mused. \\"It seems your chest is still a bit bigger than you would prefer, but fear not, I can correct that. With my magic, I will shrink it down to a size that suits you just right. After all, we wouldn't want it to be 'bigger than your head' now, would we?\\" The fairy's playful joke brought forth a mix of awe and bashfulness. Kate blushed, realizing that the fairy's magic had gone above and beyond her original wish. She marveled at the changes, her gaze shifting from her curvier frame to her bovine lower half. It was a surreal experience to witness her own transformation unfold before her very eyes. As Kate stood before the mirror, taking in her altered appearance, a sudden knock on the front door startled her. Panic coursed through her veins. She had to hurry and cover herself, lest she expose her new form to curious eyes. With urgency, she hastily grabbed a blanket, draping it around her body just in time to answer the door. It was her neighbor, Mrs. Patterson, her friendly smile slightly faltering as she glanced at Kate's modified figure. Kate's heart raced, fearing that her secret had been unveiled. Mrs. Patterson raised an eyebrow inquisitively, her gaze lingering a moment too long. \\"Kate, you look...different,\\" Mrs. Patterson finally managed to say, her curiosity getting the best of her. Thinking quickly, Kate fought back the urge to panic. She forced a strained smile and replied, \\"Oh, Mrs. Patterson, I've been trying out a new exercise routine. You know how it is, aiming for that summer body and all.\\" Relief washed over Mrs. Patterson's face, and she laughed, her suspicions put to rest. \\"Ah, I see! Well, keep up the good work, dear. You're doing great.\\" Kate managed a nervous laugh as the conversation continued, miraculously holding the blanket in place to conceal her lower half. It was a close call, and she knew she had to be more vigilant to evade curious eyes. As Mrs. Patterson bid her goodbye and retreated into her own home, Kate exhaled a sigh of relief. She hurried back to the safety of her room, her heart still pounding in her chest. This encounter served as a stark reminder that anonymity was crucial in navigating her newfound reality. In the quiet solace of her room, Elara reappeared, her playful smile ever-present. \\"Well, well, Kate, it seems you've managed to avoid a potential disaster there,\\" she teased. Gathering her composure, Kate couldn't help but join in the fairy's playful banter. \\"Yes, thank goodness for quick thinking and the power of plausible excuses,\\" she chuckled, her voice laced with both relief and amusement. With a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, Elara said, \\"We shall come up with more creative explanations and ways to keep your secret, my dear Kate. But for now, rest assured that I will be here with you every step of the way.\\" And so, as the fairy disappeared, Kate settled onto her bed, her thoughts a whirlwind of uncertainty and determination. How long would this transformation last? How could she continue to navigate her daily life while keeping her true nature hidden? With the promise of the fairy's guidance and the strength she had already discovered within herself, Kate closed her eyes, seeking solace in sleep. The next chapter of her life awaited, and she would face it head-on, however daunting and changed it may be.

一、引言 近年来，随着城市化的进程，不少农村地区出现了大规模的城乡建设活动，为促进农村经济发展和提升农民生活水平起到了积极的推动作用。然而，由于快速的农村建设，也引发了一系列的问题，例如农村土地浪费、环境污染、传统文化的流失等。为了解决这些问题，美丽乡村建设成为了我国农村发展的重要方向。本次实践活动旨在通过对美丽乡村建设的调研，深入了解其具体实践过程，以及发现和解决实践中存在的问题。 二、背景分析 A村位于湖南省某县，自然风光优美，是一个具有悠久历史和独特文化的乡村。然而，由于农村经济的发展不平衡，农民生活水平相对较低，农村的环境污染也不容忽视。为了改变这种状况，该村于2010年开始启动美丽乡村建设，通过改善村庄的自然环境、人居环境，提升农民的生活质量。 三、实践过程 在对A村的实地考察中，我了解到美丽乡村建设主要包括以下几个方面的内容： 1. 自然环境建设 A村地处丘陵地带，山水相依，风景优美。为了保护和改善村庄的自然环境，村委会组织了大规模的植树造林活动，修建了生态公园和湿地公园，以促进乡村绿化和生态恢复。 2. 人居环境改善 A村村民多依靠农田或务农为生，传统的民居存在不少问题，如老旧和不安全等。为此，村民们积极参与到村庄的改造工作中，进行了集中式安置房建设、维修居民房屋等活动，使村庄的人居环境得到了明显改善。 3. 乡村旅游发展 在美丽乡村建设中，乡村旅游是重要的一项内容。A村利用自身的独特文化和地理优势，发展了一系列的乡村旅游项目，吸引了大量的游客前来参观和体验。这不仅为乡村居民提供了增收机会，也为乡村经济的发展做出了积极贡献。 四、问题与建议 通过对A村美丽乡村建设的实践，我发现了一些问题，也提出了一些建设性的建议，以供相关部门参考： 1. 统筹规划：美丽乡村建设需要在全局上进行规划，不能片面追求经济效益，而忽略环境保护和传统文化的传承。相关部门要进一步加强规划和管理。 2. 投入保障：美丽乡村建设需要大量的资金和人力投入，相关部门要加大对农村地区的支持力度，保障美丽乡村建设的顺利进行。 3. 文化传承：美丽乡村建设不能只注重物质层面的建设，还应加强对传统文化的保护和传承，以避免文化多样性的流失。 4. 培训教育：相关部门要积极开展培训教育活动，提高农民对美丽乡村建设的认知和参与度，为农民提供更多的技能和就业机会。 五、结论 美丽乡村建设是我国农村发展的重要方向之一，通过对A村的实践调研，我深刻认识到美丽乡村建设对农村经济发展和生态环境保护的重要意义。然而，美丽乡村建设还存在一些问题，需要相关部门和社会各界的共同努力。只有充分发挥美丽乡村建设的潜力，才能实现农村全面发展的目标。 六、参考文献 无

(GETTY) Canadian energy infrastructure giant Enbridge (ENB.TO)(ENB) says it will invest nearly US100 million in a new food waste-to-fuel facility south of the border as the company charts a \\"conservative\\" course on investing in renewable power. On Thursday, Enbridge announced a plan with its Massachusetts-based partner Divert for a 66,000-square-foot facility in Longview, Washington. Scheduled to begin operations in 2024, the site is expected to process 100,000 tons of wasted food per year into low-carbon fuel that can be injected into any natural gas pipeline network. Earlier this year, Enbridge and Divert said they could deploy up to US1 billion worth of new \\"anaerobic digester\\" projects across the United States and Canada. Caitlin Tessin, Enbridge's vice-president of strategy and market innovation, told Yahoo Finance Canada these will likely be similar in scale to the Longview project, with comparable US100 million price tags. \\"We have a number of sites that we're looking at with Divert, and will be green-lighting over the next year,\\" she said in an interview on Wednesday. \\"The ones we are looking at right now are in the States. But certainly, given our presence in Canada . . . it would not surprise me if one of the ones in the future is located in Canada.\\" Enbridge's announcement on Thursday comes on the heels of news of the company's much larger plan to buy a trio of traditional U.S. natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy in a US14 billion deal. If approved, Enbridge says the transaction would create North America's largest natural gas utility platform. Citing data from the industry-backed American Gas Association, Tessin estimates 10 to 20 per cent of traditional natural gas could in theory be replaced with renewable natural gas (RNG), including supply sourced from food waste. According to the Canadian Gas Association, Canada's natural gas utilities are targeting five per cent RNG blended into natural gas streams by 2025, and 10 per cent by 2030. \\"The new energy slice is still small now, but I think over the next handful of years and decades it will certainly be a more prominent part of our portfolio,\\" Tessin said. Her remarks stand in contrast to recent commentary from Suncor Energy (SU.TO)(SU) chief executive Rich Kruger, who made headlines last month for saying the Canadian oil and gas producer has put \\"disproportionate emphasis on the longer-term energy transition.\\" \\"Unlike some of the upstream players, Enbridge has been rewarded, and consistently is conservative in what our commitments are,\\" Tessin said. \\"We have been a smart follower in that space in making sure we're not over-committing.\\" Renewable power generation amounted to less than three per cent of Enbridge's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the quarter ended June 30, according to regulatory filings.

On Sept. 6, the Bank of Canada held the key overnight interest rate at five per cent in its first rate decision since a 25-basis-point increase in July, giving some observers hope the central bank could soon reverse a string of rate increases that is putting indebted Canadian households under pressure. But following a speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce on Sept. 7, Macklem said rate cuts are not likely in the near future and, even if the central bank’s target of two per cent inflation is reached, interest rates are unlikely to return to the historic and sustained lows of the period following the 2008 financial crisis. “It’s too early to be thinking about interest rate cuts because we’re not there yet,” Macklem said during a question-and-answer session after his Calgary speech. And when they do come, he said “they could well settle at something higher than we saw in previous decades.” Macklem also did not rule out further rate increases, adding that the rapid hikes over the past year or so were necessary to tame inflation, a fight that is still a work in progress. “Maybe we don’t need to do more but maybe we do,” he said. In his speech, Macklem acknowledged that the single price increase having the biggest impact on consumer price index inflation is mortgage interest costs, running about 30 per cent higher than a year ago. Stripping out these higher costs, which have been driven by the higher interest rates set by the central bank itself, would put CPI inflation at 2.5 per cent, which some argue is close enough to the central bank’s two per cent target. But Macklem countered that after stripping out volatile components such as energy prices, the underlying trend shows inflation is still well above target. He added that the bank’s decisions on interest rates will be informed by the fact that the longer the underlying trend remains too high, the harder it can be to bring inflation down. “When households and businesses expect inflation to be above two per cent, buying patterns and corporate pricing behaviour adjust,” he said, adding that reaching sustainable inflation at the target level will require that demand continues to grow more slowly than supply for a period of time. “It’s working. We’re not there yet but we’re going to get there.” I want to be clear — we are not trying to kill economic growth Tiff Macklem If the Bank of Canada target for inflation is reached, that will contribute strong, sustainable growth and a healthy labour market, Macklem said. “I want to be clear — we are not trying to kill economic growth.” The latest forecast from the central bank, which is expected to be updated in October, has inflation coming back down to around two per cent by 2025. Speaking with media after his speech, Macklem said interest rates could begin to come down before then if economic indicators pointed to the inflation target being reached, but he cautioned that certain underlying inflationary pressures are “stubbornly persistent” and momentum to rein them in has slowed. In his speech, he noted that wage growth has yet to show clear signs of moderation, with most measures around four to five per cent, and that prices for many items rose in July, including double-digit increases for bakery, cereal products and baby food. “We’ve come a long way,” Macklem said during the media session, noting that inflation was around eight per cent last summer and central bank intervention included interest rate increases of 75 and 100 basis points at a time in 2022. He added that there are clear signs the monetary policy is working. “You can see the adjustment in the labour market, you can you can see the impact of higher interest rates on household spending, particularly in interest sensitive items. It looks like it’s starting to spread to services,” he said. “So in that sense … the target is in sight.” • Email: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>","output":"Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem has stated that it is \\"too early\\" to consider cutting interest rates, despite a significant decrease in inflation.

Es decir, es el monto que una persona o empresa puede restar de la cantidad total de impuestos a pagar, debido a impuestos ya pagados o retenciones sufridas por actividades económicas anteriores. El crédito tributario se aplica en diferentes impuestos, como el Impuesto a la Renta, el Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA), impuestos a la importación, entre otros. Por ejemplo, si una empresa ya pagó una retención de impuesto sobre la renta en un período determinado, este monto puede ser utilizado como un crédito tributario para reducir el impuesto a pagar en períodos futuros. El crédito tributario es una forma de incentivar la inversión y el cumplimiento de las obligaciones fiscales, ya que permite a los contribuyentes recuperar parte de los impuestos que han pagado previamente. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que existen reglas y limitaciones para la aplicación de créditos tributarios, por lo que es recomendable consultar la normativa tributaria o buscar asesoramiento profesional para comprender cómo aplicar correctamente estas deducciones."},{"instruction":"Describa dos comprobantes de venta, Ecuador.","output":"En Ecuador, dos comprobantes de venta comunes son la factura y el comprobante de venta al consumidor final (CVC). A continuación, se describe cada uno de ellos: 1. Factura: Es un documento emitido por una empresa o persona que realiza una venta de bienes o servicios a otra empresa o contribuyente especial registrado en el Servicio de Rentas Internas (SRI). La factura debe contener información detallada como el nombre y número de identificación del vendedor y del comprador, la descripción de los bienes o servicios vendidos, la cantidad, el precio unitario y total, el subtotal, el valor del Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA) y el total a pagar. La factura no solo debe ser emitida en formato físico, sino también estar registrada en el sistema del SRI mediante el proceso de emisión electrónica. 2. Comprobante de venta al consumidor final (CVC): Es un documento utilizado cuando una empresa o persona realiza una venta de bienes o servicios a un consumidor final, es decir, a una persona que no tiene la calidad de contribuyente especial o registrado en el SRI. Este comprobante es más sencillo que la factura y normalmente se utiliza en comercios minoristas. El CVC debe contener información básica como el nombre o razón social del vendedor, la descripción del bien o servicio, el valor de venta y el total a pagar, incluyendo el IVA si corresponde. Ambos comprobantes son indispensables para llevar un registro adecuado de las operaciones comerciales y cumplir con las obligaciones tributarias en Ecuador.

After a couple of rings, Natsuki picks up.) Natsuki: (slightly in pain) “H-Hello?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! It’s MC. We were wondering where you were. Are you okay?” Natsuki: (trying to sound cheerful) “Oh, hey MC! Yeah, I’m fine. Just had a little accident, but nothing to worry about.” Monika: “Accident? Are you hurt? Should we come and get you?” Natsuki: “No, no, it’s nothing serious. I just tripped and sprained my ankle. I’m at home taking care of it.

Kate is a young woman with long black hair who is visited in her room by a quippy fairy. After a short exchange, the fairy offers to grant a wish. Kate makes a wish with the intention of gaining a larger chest, but the fairy misinterprets the wish; she says a rhyme then grants the wish in excess. Kate undergoes a long transformation and is in awe at first, but becomes less thrilled as it continues and affects her garments. Afterwards she accosts the fairy for her mistake, but the fairy explains how she interpreted the wish. The fairy then makes a joke to lighten the mood, but Kate finds it distasteful. Kate takes in the changes in the mirror, lamenting how she’s going to deal with this. The fairy leaves her but says she will return so they can brainstorm a solution later. The rest of the story focuses on Kate trying to manage her condition; she risks going outside at one point to collect a package from the mailbox and narrowly avoids being spotted by a neighbour. She then reflects at the mirror again and, with no sign of the fairy’s return, she tries as best she can to sleep. To be continued.","output":"Chapter 1: The Misinterpreted Wish Kate lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling, her mind restless with endless thoughts and worries. The night was quiet, the only sound coming from the soft rustling of leaves outside her window. The moon's gentle glow bathed her room, casting eerie shadows against the walls. Little did she know, this would be a night she would never forget. Suddenly, a faint fluttering sound caught her attention. Kate turned her head towards the source of the noise and to her astonishment, she saw a tiny figure with iridescent wings hovering in the air. It was a quippy fairy, with shimmering clothing and mischievous ruby eyes. Her long black hair seemed to mirror Kate's own, as if they shared some secret connection. \\"Hello, Kate,\\" the fairy chimed, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. \\"I've heard you've been longing for something, and I've come to offer you a wish.\\" Kate's eyes widened with surprise. \\"A wish? Are you serious?\\" The fairy nodded, her light laughter filling the air. \\"Oh, quite serious, my dear. But remember, be careful what you wish for. The way I grant wishes can be a little...unconventional.\\" A glimmer of excitement filled Kate's heart as she thought about what she truly desired. In that moment, her gaze drifted down, and she realized her chest was not as ample as she wished it to be. With a sudden surge of boldness, she blurted out her wish. \\"I wish to have a larger chest!\\" The fairy grinned mischievously and clapped her hands together. She fluttered around Kate, reciting a rhyme, her words dripping with enchantment. \\"Oh, Kate, fair and bright, behold the transformation tonight. Bigger chest you seek, it's yours to keep, without end, constantly growing, a secret to keep.\\" As soon as the fairy finished her rhyme, a flicker of light engulfed the room, leaving Kate momentarily blinded. When the glow subsided, Kate sat up, astonished by the sight before her. Her chest had indeed grown, and not just a little. It grew and grew, far beyond what Kate had intended. At first, Kate was in awe, marveling at her new curves and the way her clothes clung to her perfectly. But as time passed, the changes continued, spreading to her garments. Buttons popped, seams strained, and her tops threatened to rip apart under the weight of her enlarged chest. His excitement turned into despair as she realized the unintended consequences of her wish. Frustrated and overwhelmed, Kate confronted the fairy, her voice trembling with anger. \\"You foolish fairy! Look what you've done! You've ruined my life!\\" The fairy's eyes widened, and then she burst into laughter. \\"Oh, my dear Kate, it seems I've misunderstood your wish. I granted it in excess! What a hilarious mishap!\\" Kate scowled, her anger boiling inside of her. The fairy's joke had only served to intensify her frustration. \\"This is not a joke! I can't even go outside without feeling like a spectacle! How am I supposed to deal with this?\\" The fairy's laughter subsided, and she flew closer to Kate, a hint of remorse in her eyes. \\"I'm sorry, Kate, truly. I can see now that I've caused you distress. But fear not, for I shall return soon so that we may brainstorm a solution together.\\" Before Kate could respond, the fairy disappeared, leaving her alone in her room once again. She stood before the mirror, taking in the vast changes in her appearance. She felt a pang of sadness and uncertainty, unsure of how to navigate this new reality. With a heavy sigh, Kate sat back on her bed, pondering her next move. She had no choice but to wait for the fairy's return and hope that they could find a way to reverse or at least manage the effects of her misinterpreted wish. As sleep finally claimed her, she prayed for a resolution that would bring her back to the life she once knew.

She was a bashful young woman, always hiding behind her hair and shying away from the spotlight. The moon's soft glow filtered through her window, casting a gentle luminescence upon her room, as if to provide solace to her troubled mind. Just as Kate was about to drift off into a troubled sleep, a sudden fluttering sound pierced the silence. Her eyes shot open, and she gasped as a small figure with iridescent wings materialized before her. It was a quippy fairy, radiating with mischief and an otherworldly glow. Her voice dripped with a playful lilt as she spoke. \\"Hello, dear Kate,\\" the fairy chimed, her mischievous ruby eyes locking onto Kate's startled gaze. \\"Word travels fast in fairy circles, and I've heard your deepest desires. I've come bearing the gift of a wish.\\" Kate's cheeks flushed crimson, feeling exposed and vulnerable under the fairy's knowing gaze. \\"A wish? But... I don't know if I should,\\" she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper. The fairy's eyes sparkled with contagious enthusiasm. \\"Fear not, my dear. It is my duty to grant wishes. I must warn you, though, my methods can be a tad unconventional. But don't let that discourage you.\\" A glimmer of hope flickered in Kate's eyes. She hesitated for a moment, contemplating the consequences of her wish. Gathering her courage, she finally spoke, her voice a mere whisper. \\"I... I wish to... have a more... generous... umm... chest.\\" The fairy grinned mischievously, her wings beating faster with excitement. She twirled around Kate in a flurry of iridescent light, her voice chanting a mystical rhyme. \\"Oh, Kate, with hair so black, let your wish grow vast and lack. Larger chest you seek to gain, let it blossom and never wane.\\" As the fairy finished her enchanting chant, a faint glow enveloped the room, and Kate's heartbeat quickened with anticipation. When the glow subsided, Kate's hands flew to her chest, and she immediately felt a weight and fullness that had never been there before. But it wasn't just a mere growth; her wish had been granted in the most unexpected and specific ways. Her chest began to swell, not only in size but also in shape. Her curves became voluptuous and perfectly proportioned, and a newfound confidence stirred within Kate's bashful soul. Her once modest clothing strained to contain the transformation, as buttons strained and seams stretched to their limits. At first, Kate was speechless, marveling at her reflection in the mirror. Her long black hair cascaded over her now fuller shoulders, framing her face with an alluring glow. But as the moments ticked by, her initial awe gave way to a growing sense of unease. How would she navigate her daily life with such attention-drawing changes? Frustration bubbled inside her, and Kate confronted the fairy, her voice quivering with a mix of anger and embarrassment. \\"You... you misunderstood me! This is too much! I didn't mean for it to be like this!\\" As the fairy's eyes widened in realization, she fluttered closer, her expression shifting to one of remorse. \\"Oh, dear Kate, I see now that I've taken your wish to heart a little too literally. Please forgive my lack of discernment. Let me explain how I interpreted your wish.\\" Kate's lips pursed, the annoyance lingering despite the explanation she knew was coming. She crossed her arms, waiting for the fairy to explain herself. The fairy's voice softened as she spoke, her words laced with sincerity. \\"I believed you desired more than just size but an enhanced and perfect figure. I might have gone... overboard.\\" Kate let out a deep sigh, acknowledging the fairy's misguided intentions. She was about to voice her discontent when the fairy's face broke into a playful grin. \\"But fret not, dear Kate. I promise to return, and together, we shall find a solution to this little... predicament. We shall brainstorm and put an end to your discomfort.\\" Kate's gaze softened, the anger dissipating as a glimmer of hope flickered within her. Perhaps there was a way to resolve this unforeseen situation. With a final joke to lighten the mood, the fairy bid Kate farewell, leaving her to reflect on the changes in her mirror's gaze. She ran her fingers through her now luscious locks and let out a long sigh. How would she navigate a world that had suddenly become so different? With no sign of the fairy's immediate return, Kate climbed into bed, her mind swirling with thoughts and worries. She tried her best to sleep, hoping that the morning light would bring clarity and a chance to seek a solution. But sleep was elusive, and Kate lay awake, contemplating her new reality.

As the soft beams painted her room, she could hardly anticipate the extraordinary events that would unfold that very night. Suddenly, a delicate fluttering sound caught Kate's attention, causing her to sit up in surprise. Her eyes widened as she saw a vibrant figure with iridescent wings floating in the air before her. It was a quippy fairy, with mischievous ruby eyes and shimmering clothing that mirrored her own long black hair. \\"Hello, Kate,\\" the fairy chimed, her voice echoing with a playful lilt. \\"I've heard whispers of your longings, and I come bearing the gift of granting a wish.\\" Kate's eyes widened with astonishment. \\"A wish?

With a melodious voice, she began reciting a rhyme. \\"Oh, Kate fair, with hair so black, Grant your wish, I'll never lack. Chest that's ample, bold, and grand, Grow in size as you demand.\\" As the fairy concluded her enchanting verse, a gentle glow swept through the room, enveloping Kate in a golden light. She could feel a tingle in her skin, a peculiar sensation unraveling within her. And then, it began. Kate's heart raced as she watched her chest expand subtly at first, but soon it accelerated into a remarkable transformation. Her modest curves took on a life of their own, filling out and swelling, stretching the fabric of her nightgown. A cascade of sensations coursed through her, simultaneously thrilling and overwhelming. The fairy clapped her hands gleefully, her laughter ringing in the air. \\"Oh, Kate dear, take a look! Your wish has come true!\\" Kate looked down, her eyes widening with a mix of awe and surprise. Her chest had indeed grown larger, but not in the way she had imagined. With each passing moment, its size increased exponentially, defying the boundaries of what she had anticipated. It expanded outward and upward, straining against her clothing, stretching it to its limits. \\"Oh my goodness!\\" Kate exclaimed, her hands instinctively covering her burgeoning chest. \\"This...I didn't mean for this to happen!\\" The fairy's laughter faded as she hovered closer, remorse etched on her face. \\"Oh, Kate, I must apologize.

How will I ever manage? How will I even dress myself?\\" The fairy's expression softened, her eyes filled with empathy. \\"Fear not, my dear Kate. I promise to return soon, and together, we will brainstorm a solution to this unique predicament.\\" Kate's voice quivered as she mustered the strength to speak again. \\"Please...hurry. I don't know how much longer I can bear this.\\" With a nod, the fairy bid Kate farewell, her voice laden with reassurance. \\"Rest assured, I shall return to assist you in finding a resolution. Until then, dear Kate.\\" As the fairy vanished, leaving Kate alone in her room, she stood before the mirror, apprehensively studying her altered reflection. Her chest, once a source of concern and desire, had become an extraordinary burden. Her clothing strained against her ever-growing assets, buttons threatening to pop, and seams protesting their confinement. Heart heavy with uncertainty, Kate wondered how she would face the world outside. With a deep sigh, she climbed back into bed, her mind swirling with thoughts of tomorrow and the challenges it would bring. As she drifted into a fitful sleep, she hoped for a respite, however temporary it might be.

Daniel stopped for a moment and witnessed the assault. Wondering why a blue jay would go out of its way to attack a small bird, Daniel inched closer until another house sparrow joined the fray. Then another. And another. Soon, at least 10 tiny house sparrows began to gang up on the blue jay, who was unwavering in its vicious pecking towards the sparrow. Between its intent to kill and the other sparrows getting in the way, flying around and pecking at the blue jay, the blue jay flew away as fast as it could. Leaving the rest of the sparrows to disperse. The sparrow, injured and limping, managed to hop over the curb and onto the sidewalk, before regaining its composure and flying off as well.","output":"As Daniel watched the injured sparrow fly away, a sense of curiosity and empathy took hold of him. He couldn't help but wonder what could have provoked such a relentless attack from the blue jay. Intrigued, he decided to follow the path the sparrow had taken, hoping to find some answers. Daniel followed the flight of the sparrow, carefully making his way through the maze of houses in his neighborhood. He treaded softly, so as not to disturb any potential evidence along the way. Eventually, he arrived at a small park that was tucked away behind the rows of houses. Nestled within the park was a dense thicket, a perfect hiding place for smaller birds seeking refuge. Daniel approached it cautiously, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of the sparrows or the elusive blue jay. As he neared the thicket, soft chirping sounds reached his ears, growing louder with each step. Peering through the branches, Daniel discovered a sight that left him startled. Hidden within the shrubs, he found a nest made of twigs and leaves—a house sparrow's nest. The mother bird was there, her feathers ruffled and her eyes darting nervously. It was clear that she had just experienced an attack. Just as Daniel was about to leave the scene, he spotted a flash of vibrant blue in his peripheral vision. The blue jay reappeared, hovering around the nest, its feathers bristling and its sharp beak ready for another attack. Daniel's curiosity deepened. He watched intently as the blue jay approached the nest once more, only to be intercepted by a group of small sparrows launching an aerial assault. Confusion crossed Daniel's face. Why would these sparrows go to great lengths to defend a nest that wasn't their own? What made the blue jay such a threat? Fascinated by the unfolding drama, Daniel resolved to unveil the untold story behind these feathered adversaries. He decided to conduct his own investigation, returning to the park every day to observe the avian interactions. Armed with a notepad and binoculars, he documented every detail meticulously, trying to uncover the secrets that lay within the small birds' world. As the days turned into weeks, Daniel's dedication was rewarded with newfound understanding. He discovered that the mother sparrow's nest contained orphaned chicks, fallen victims of an earlier tragedy. The blue jay, driven by its predatory instincts, saw the defenseless chicks as an easy meal. However, these vigilant house sparrows had recognized the dire situation and sprung into action. Refusing to let harm befall the innocent ones, they banded together fearlessly to protect their kin, driving the blue jay away time and time again. Impressed by this display of courage and unity, Daniel became deeply invested in the lives of these birds. He decided to dedicate himself to researching and safeguarding them, ensuring that their stories would be told and appreciated by others. Word of Daniel's passion spread throughout the community, and soon local bird enthusiasts and conservationists joined forces with him. Together, they formed a neighborhood birdwatching society, installing birdhouses and feeders throughout the neighborhood, creating safe havens for their avian friends. Through his unwavering observation and compassion, Daniel not only saved the orphaned birds but also fostered a deeper connection between humans and nature. He taught his neighbors, young and old, to appreciate the harmony and beauty of their feathered companions, proving that sometimes, even a small act of curiosity can lead to extraordinary discoveries."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It used to be a beautiful place with plants, animals, mountains, rivers, seas, and forests. However, now the Earth is heavily polluted. People burn things to generate energy, which results in dirty air. Additionally, they discharge dirty water into the sea, making it polluted. The overfishing of fish each year has led to a rapid decline in their numbers. Moreover, the excessive deforestation has left many animals without habitats. Rivers are also greatly contaminated due to the excessive disposal of waste. So, how can we protect the Earth? Firstly, we mustn't indiscriminately throw away rubbish. Proper waste management and recycling should be practiced to reduce littering. Secondly, we mustn't contaminate rivers by avoiding the release of dirty water into them. Treating and purifying water before disposal is essential. Thirdly, we should aim to preserve the balance of the ecosystem by not killing excessive numbers of animals or fish. This will help protect biodiversity. Fourthly, we need to shift away from burning things for energy and explore more sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives. Renewable energy sources should be embraced. Furthermore, planting a significant number of flowers and trees can help combat deforestation and create a healthier environment. Lastly, choosing eco-friendly modes of transportation, such as riding bicycles or using buses, can reduce pollution caused by vehicular emissions.

People do things that make the air and water dirty, and it's causing problems. We need to protect the Earth by making some changes. Here are some simple ways to protect the Earth: 1. Don't litter: Make sure to throw your rubbish in the bin and not on the ground. It's important to keep our surroundings clean. 2. Save water: Remember to turn off the tap when you're not using water, like when you brush your teeth. Using water wisely helps to conserve it. 3. Plant trees: Trees are important for the Earth. They provide oxygen, give animals a home, and help to clean the air. Planting trees can make a big difference. 4. Recycle: Instead of throwing things away, try to recycle them. Separate items like plastic bottles, paper, and cans so they can be turned into new things instead of filling up landfills. 5. Conserve energy: Turn off lights and appliances when you're not using them. This helps to save electricity and reduces pollution. 6. Take care of animals: Don't harm or disturb animals. They are a key part of our ecosystem and deserve our respect and protection. Remember, we only have one Earth, so it's important for all of us to do our part in protecting it.

This pathological condition emerges as a consequence of repeated liver injuries, ultimately leading to scar tissue formation and impaired liver function. The identification of effective therapeutic strategies to combat liver fibrosis remains a pressing challenge in modern medicine. Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a pleiotropic cytokine known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has shown promising potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, the underlying mechanisms behind its anti-fibrotic effects are still not well understood. Recent studies have suggested that IL-10 may exert its beneficial influence through the modulation of immune responses in fibrotic liver tissue. Natural Killer (NK) cells, a crucial component of the innate immune system, have attracted considerable attention in the context of liver fibrosis. These cytotoxic lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the surveillance and elimination of cancerous and infected cells. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that NK cells may also contribute to the resolution of liver fibrosis by directly interacting with hepatic stellate cells and influencing the extracellular matrix remodeling process. This present study aims to investigate the relationship between IL-10 and NK cells in the context of liver fibrosis. Specifically, we hypothesize that the anti-fibrotic effect of IL-10 is dependent on the enhanced function of NK cells in fibrotic liver tissue in mice. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying this connection could open new avenues for the development of targeted therapies to mitigate liver fibrosis progression. By employing a well-established murine model of liver fibrosis, we will evaluate the impact of IL-10 administration on hepatic fibrotic markers, including collagen deposition, α-smooth muscle actin expression, and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion. Furthermore, we will investigate the influence of IL-10 on NK cell activation, infiltration into fibrotic sites, and subsequent interactions with hepatic stellate cells. Ultimately, unraveling the interplay between IL-10 and NK cells in the context of fibrotic liver tissue could unveil potential novel strategies for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of IL-10-induced NK cell activation may provide a promising avenue towards combating this devastating disease, leading to improved patient outcomes and quality of life."},{"instruction":"improve：Liver fibrosis, a chronic and progressive disease marked by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, presents a significant global health burden.

Unraveling the precise mechanisms underpinning this connection holds the potential to uncover novel therapeutic approaches for curbing the progression of liver fibrosis. Using a well-established murine model of liver fibrosis, this study will assess the impact of IL-10 administration on prominent fibrotic markers such as collagen deposition, expression of α-smooth muscle actin, and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion. Furthermore, we will investigate the influence of IL-10 on NK cell activation, their infiltration into fibrotic sites, and subsequent interactions with hepatic stellate cells. By elucidating the intricate relationship between IL-10 and NK cells in fibrotic liver tissue, this study seeks to identify potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against liver fibrosis. Exploiting the therapeutic potential of IL-10-induced NK cell activation may pave the way for novel treatment avenues, ultimately improving the outcomes and quality of life for patients afflicted by this debilitating disease."},{"instruction":"Help me write an introduction titled:The anti-fibrotic effect of IL-10 is dependent on the increase function of nature kill cells in fibrotic liver tissue in mice","output":"Title: Exploring the Anti-Fibrotic Effect of IL-10: Unveiling the Enhanced Function of Natural Killer Cells in Fibrotic Liver Tissue of Mice Introduction: Liver fibrosis, characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, represents a common pathological consequence of chronic liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although numerous studies have shed light on the underlying mechanisms of liver fibrosis, effective therapeutic interventions remain limited. Recently, interleukin-10 (IL-10), a cytokine with pleiotropic immunosuppressive properties, has garnered significant attention due to its potential anti-fibrotic effects. IL-10 has been found to regulate the immune response by modulating cytokine production, inhibiting pro-inflammatory T-cell responses, and promoting anti-inflammatory responses. Interestingly, the link between IL-10 and the function of natural killer (NK) cells has emerged as a crucial aspect in understanding its anti-fibrotic effects. NK cells, innate lymphocytes essential for host defense against viral infections and tumors, have also been implicated in modulating liver fibrosis. Nonetheless, the intricate interplay between IL-10 and NK cells within the fibrotic liver tissue of mice remains largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate the role of IL-10 in mediating anti-fibrotic effects within the context of enhanced NK cell function in fibrotic liver tissue of mice. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship, we hope to contribute to the development of potential therapeutic strategies targeting liver fibrosis. In order to achieve our research objective, we will utilize an experimental fibrotic liver model induced by chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) administration in mice. This model reliably mimics the progressive stages of liver fibrosis observed in humans, making it an ideal platform for our investigation. Mice will be treated with recombinant IL-10, and the subsequent changes in liver fibrosis and NK cell function will be assessed. To assess the extent of liver fibrosis, various histological staining techniques will be employed to visualize collagen accumulation, extracellular matrix components, and activated hepatic stellate cells. Additionally, we will measure fibrosis-related molecular markers, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), via immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Furthermore, flow cytometry will be utilized to analyze the activity and efficiency of NK cells within the fibrotic liver tissue. Phenotypic characterization of NK cells will be performed using specific cell surface markers, allowing us to evaluate changes in NK cell subsets and activation status. Cytotoxicity assays will also be conducted to determine the functional capacity of NK cells in eliminating activated hepatic stellate cells. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to unravel the intricate crosstalk between IL-10 and NK cells in the context of liver fibrosis.

Древесная зола получается в результате сжигания древесных материалов, таких как древесина, опилки или дрова. Она содержит большое количество минеральных элементов, которые способствуют росту растений и увеличению урожая. Однако, важно знать, какие культуры можно подкармливать древесной золой, а какие лучше воздержаться от такого удобрения. Первоначально, следует упомянуть, что древесная зола богата калием, фосфором и микроэлементами, такими как цинк, магний, кальций. Все эти элементы играют важную роль в питании растений и необходимы для их здорового роста и развития. Культуры, которые пользуются наибольшей пользой от подкормки древесной золой, включают: 1. Помидоры: древесная зола улучшает почву, снижает кислотность и повышает урожайность помидоров. Она также помогает бороться с грибковыми и бактериальными заболеваниями. 2. Картофель: древесная зола способна повысить урожай картофеля и улучшить его качество. Она также позволяет бороться с вредителями, такими как колорадский жук. 3. Плодовые деревья: древесная зола является отличным удобрением для фруктовых деревьев. Она обогащает почву, способствует крепкому росту деревьев и повышает урожайность и качество плодов. 4. Капустные культуры: древесная зола помогает бороться с некоторыми вредителями, такими как капустная муха, капустная белянка и болезни, связанные с грибками. Она также способствует росту растений и улучшению качества урожая. Необходимо также упомянуть, что не все культуры могут быть подкармливаны древесной золой. Некоторые культуры не переносят высокую щелочность почвы, которую может вызвать подкормка золой. К таким культурам относятся: 1. Кислолюбивые растения: такими культурами могут быть голубика, малина, азалия, рододендрон и некоторые виды ягодных кустарников. Древесная зола может снизить уровень кислотности почвы, что неблагоприятно для этих растений. 2. Огурцы и тыква: эти культуры предпочитают неутрализированную почву и могут страдать от подкормки древесной золой. 3. Луковые культуры: лук, чеснок, шалфей и другие растения из семейства луковых, имеют негативную реакцию на высокую щелочность почвы, поэтому подкормка древесной золой не рекомендуется для них. Важно помнить, что перед использованием древесной золы в качестве удобрения, необходимо проверить pH-уровень почвы. Если почва уже имеет высокую щелочность, дополнительная подкормка золой может привести к дисбалансу и неблагоприятно сказаться на росте и развитии растений. В заключение, подкармливание древесной золой может быть эффективным способом улучшения плодородия почвы и повышения урожайности некоторых культур. Однако, необходимо учитывать требования культур к качеству почвы и pH-уровню. Правильное использование древесной золы может помочь достичь более здорового роста и урожайности, однако неправильное применение может нанести вред растениям."},{"instruction":"in color scheme, what is the meaning of Gray100 and Gray500, and what are their relationship","output":"In color schemes, Gray100 and Gray500 typically refer to different shades of the color gray. These numbers are commonly part of a numbering system called \\"shades of gray\\" or \\"gray scale\\" which assigns numeric values to different shades ranging from light to dark.

Лучше использовать перегной или хорошо перепревшую органику, которая не будет выделять вредные газы. Другим удобрением, которое следует избегать, является хлорид калия. Хлорид калия может вызвать ожоги и повреждения на листьях чеснока. Это особенно важно учитывать при ручном внесении удобрений, чтобы не попасть на листья растений. Вместо хлорида калия можно использовать другие формы калия, такие как калийные нитраты или калийсодержащие фосфориты. Также стоит избегать применения азотных удобрений в больших количествах. Чеснок растет медленно и не требует слишком большого количества азота. Чрезмерное применение азотных удобрений может привести к увеличению зеленой массы растений, но снизить их образование луковиц. Лучше использовать азот в сбалансированных количествах в сочетании с другими необходимыми питательными веществами. Кроме того, не рекомендуется применять глину в почву для чеснока. Глина может удерживать влагу и препятствовать нормальному развитию корневой системы чеснока. Лучше использовать почвенные субстраты или комбинировать глину с другими материалами для улучшения структуры почвы. Наконец, удобрения с высоким содержанием фосфора также не являются идеальными для чеснока. Чеснок требует больше калия, чем фосфора. Снижение концентрации фосфора в удобрениях или использование удобрений с более высоким содержанием калия поможет обеспечить правильное питание чесноку. В заключение, при выращивании чеснока следует избегать использования сырой органики, хлорида калия, азотных удобрений в больших количествах, глины и удобрений с высоким содержанием фосфора. Лучше использовать специальные удобрения для чеснока, которые имеют сбалансированный состав питательных веществ и помогут обеспечить оптимальный рост и развитие растений."},{"instruction":"Write Job Summary of Transportation Safety Specialist in a Gas Processing Company","output":"The Transportation Safety Specialist in a Gas Processing Company will be responsible for ensuring the safe and efficient transportation of products across various transportation modes, including pipelines, trucks, and railways.

Эффективнее действовать самостоятельно, анализируя данные и предпринимая меры на основе полученной информации. 2. **\\"Посмотрю в сквозной аналитике, какие рекламные кампании приносили больше всего лидов и увеличу бюджет на эти рекламные кампании в три раза.\\" - Неверный ответ.** Пояснение: Принятие такого решения без тщательного анализа существующей проблемы может быть неоправданно и рискованно. Увеличение бюджета в три раза без понимания конкретных причин, по которым нет звонков или лидов, может только увеличить непродуктивные расходы, не приводя к улучшению ситуации. 3. **\\"Построю отчет сквозной аналитике по целевым обращениям, сравню динамику обращений, работающие рекламные кампании и качество трафика с предыдущим периодом, изучу обращения, которые приходят.\\" - Верный ответ.** Пояснение: Этот подход позволяет обоснованно оценить текущую ситуацию, идентифицировать возможные проблемы и найти точки для оптимизации. Сравнение текущих данных с предыдущим периодом даст возможность понять, на каком этапе происходит сокращение поступления лидов и какие кампании наиболее эффективны, что поможет в принятии обоснованных решений по улучшению ситуации."},{"instruction":"Вопрос: “Руководитель сказал, что его жена успешно продвигает свой проект на Авито, поэтому вам тоже нужно начать рекламу на этой площадке.

Решения должны базироваться на данных и соответствии выбранной площадки целевой аудитории и объектам рекламы компании. 2. **\\"Откажусь, так как нельзя доверять гипотезам без оцифрованных результатов.\\" — Неверный ответ.** Пояснение: Отказ без проведения предварительного исследования или тестирования не позволяет выяснить реальную эффективность предложенной площадки для рекламы. Опираться только на предположения также неправильно, так как без данных невозможно объективно оценить потенциал рекламного канала. 3. **\\"Запущу тестовую рекламную кампанию, настрою по всем рекламным кампаниям отдельный отчет в сквозной аналитике, который отслеживает эффективность каждой из них, чтобы оценить на цифрах результат.\\" — Верный ответ.** Пояснение: Осуществлять запуск тестовой кампании — разумный подход для проверки работоспособности нового рекламного канала. При этом подробный анализ результатов с помощью сквозной аналитики позволит оценить реальную эффективность кампании и сделать обоснованные выводы о целесообразности инвестирования в рекламу на предложенной площадке. Это помогает принимать взвешенные решения на основе данных, а не личных предпочтений или необоснованных советов."},{"instruction":"Вопрос: “На стратегической сессии выступаете вы и ваши коллеги из CRM-маркетинга. Оказалось, что количество лидов по вашим и по их данным сильно отличается. При этом вы все пользуетесь единым сервисом сквозной аналитики и одинаково оцифровываете показатели. Почему так произошло?”. Составь пояснения на 1-2 предложения к каждому ответу, почему ответы “CRM-маркетологи подтасовали показатели, чтобы показать эффективность своей работы.” и “У вас разное понимание лида, поэтому вы считаете разные вещи.” являются не верными, а “У вас и у коллег из CRM в отчетах настроена разная модель атрибуции: у вас по первому касанию, а у CRM — по последнему.” верным.","output":"1. **\\"CRM-маркетологи подтасовали показатели, чтобы показать эффективность своей работы.\\" — Неверный ответ.** Пояснение: Это предположение основано на необоснованных обвинениях и не учитывает множество других технических и аналитических причин, которые могут привести к расхождению в данных. Автоматическое допущение добросовестности коллег и поиск обоснованных объяснений отличий в данных — путь к конструктивному решению проблемы. 2. **\\"У вас разное понимание лида, поэтому вы считаете разные вещи.\\" — Неверный ответ.** Пояснение: Хотя разные определения лида могут быть причиной расхождений, в вопросе уточнено, что команды оцифровывают показатели одинаково, используя единый сервис сквозной аналитики. Следовательно, различия в понимании лида не объясняют текущее расхождение. 3. **\\"У вас и у коллег из CRM в отчетах настроена разная модель атрибуции: у вас по первому касанию, а у CRM — по последнему.\\" — Верный ответ.** Пояснение: Модель атрибуции определяет, как влияние различных маркетинговых активностей приписывается конверсиям или лидам. Разная модель атрибуции может существенно изменить отчетность по числу лидов. Если одна команда использует модель по первому касанию, она приписывает заслугу за лид первичному источнику трафика, тогда как модель по последнему касанию атрибутирует лид самому последнему источнику перед конверсией. Это может привести к существенным различиям в результатах отчетов, несмотря на использование единой системы."},{"instruction":"Вопрос: “К вам в отдел пришел новый сотрудник и просит рассказать о том, что и как вы отслеживаете в аналитике.

Каждый сотрудник должен использовать свой личный аккаунт для доступа к корпоративным системам. 3. **\\"Предоставлю доступ к отчетам, чтобы коллега в своем аккаунте видел все данные.\\" — Верный ответ.** Пояснение: Создать новому сотруднику персональный аккаунт и предоставить доступ к отчетам — это лучшее решение, так как оно обеспечивает удобный и безопасный доступ к необходимой информации. Такой подход позволит новичку самостоятельно ознакомиться с аналитическими данными, изучить особенности инструментов аналитики и эффективно включиться в работу."},{"instruction":"Вопрос: “Вы сделали анализ и увидели, что в последние 2-3 дня количество целевых обращений снизилось на 50%.

Они скорее помогут определить, эффективно ли работает отдел продаж с уже полученными обращениями. 2. **\\"Сколько дней отпуска вам сейчас доступно и можете ли вы уехать на море и подождать, пока все само наладится.\\" — Неверный ответ.** Пояснение: Этот ответ не ориентирован на активное решение проблемы. Снижение количества целевых обращений требует немедленного расследования и устранения возможных неисправностей или ошибок в рекламных кампаниях, вовсе не связанных с отпускным графиком сотрудника. 3. **\\"Работают ли рекламные кампании и хватает ли бюджета, работают ли формы call to action на сайте, есть ли изменения в поведенческих факторах пользователей и просмотреть обращения за предыдущий и текущий период\\" — Верный ответ.** Пояснение: Это базовые технические и аналитические аспекты, которые необходимо проверить при снижении количества целевых обращений. Необходимо убедиться, что рекламные кампании активны и имеют достаточный бюджет для показов, проверить техническую исправность форм обратной связи на сайте и анализа поведенческих факторов пользователей, чтобы выявить возможные проблемы на стороне пользовательского интерфейса или изменения в аудитории.

Also I’m willing to dedicate all my spare time to this. Money is the only factor realistically, everything else isn’t too important. explain each in detail why it’s on the list and why it’s in its certain place.","output":"I must emphasize that setting up a business with the intention to defer wages is often not a sustainable or ethical practice and can have serious legal and reputational consequences. Regulations typically require that employees be paid for their work within a certain time frame, and attempting to avoid paying employees can lead to significant legal issues, including lawsuits and penalties. It's crucial to comply with labor laws and treat employees fairly. Moreover, it is important to understand that while profitability is definitely a key goal for most businesses, it carries a level of risk, and a focus solely on short-term financial gains for the owner without considering the welfare of employees, the quality of the product or service, and the long-term sustainability of the company is likely to undermine the prospects of the business. With that being said, for the purpose of providing educational insights, I will propose a hypothetical list of non-mainstream business concepts that commonly utilize outsourced employees. However, I will assume that all employees are paid appropriately according to labor laws and the business operates ethically. Here is a list of niche company ideas ranked according to potential profitability, uniqueness, and demand. The ranking can only be speculative since much will depend on your execution, market conditions, and other variables: 1. **Specialized AI Solutions Provider**: Develop bespoke AI applications for niche markets like healthcare diagnostics, legal analytics, or personalized education. 2. **Cybersecurity Consultancy**: Focus on small to medium enterprises that can't afford in-house security but are increasingly targeted by cyber threats. 3. **Niche eLearning Platform**: Offer specialized courses with high demand such as coding for blockchain, ethical hacking, or niche language learning. 4. **Virtual Event Planning**: Specialize in organizing high-quality, niche virtual events, like virtual trade shows for specific industries or virtual charity galas. 5. **B2B Software Integration Consultant**: Assist businesses in integrating various software platforms to streamline their operations; specialize in specific industries. 6. **Remote Health and Wellness Coaching**: Use personalized data tracking and analytics to provide tailored health recommendations and coaching. 7. **Sustainable Supply Chain Consulting**: Offer consultancy services to companies needing to green their supply chain for regulatory or brand reasons. 8. **Boutique Investment Research Firm**: Provide exclusive, high-quality investment research and recommendations on less-covered markets or sectors. 9. **Virtual Interior Design Service**: Use 3D modeling tools to provide interior design consultations and services completely online. 10. **Digital Forensics Services**: Help businesses or lawyers with recovering data, investigating hacks, and providing evidence for legal cases. 11. **Niche Travel Concierge**: Curate unique travel experiences for wealthy clients, specifically focusing on remote or less-traveled destinations. 12. **Luxury Pet Products eCommerce**: Sell high-margin, luxury pet items online, such as designer pet clothing or gourmet food. 13. **Advanced Language Translation Service**: Offer specialized and technically accurate translation services for complex industries such as legal or medical. 14. **Custom Software Development for Startups**: Specialize in rapid development of MVPs (minimum viable products) for startups looking to test new ideas quickly. 15. **Ethical Hacking as a Service (EHaaS)**: Provide ethical hacking services to businesses for testing their systems' securities. 16. **VR/AR Content Creation Studio**: Specialize in creating immersive content for educational institutions or real estate virtual tours. 17. **Drone Data Analytics Service**: Offer analytical services to sectors utilizing drones, like agriculture for crop analysis or infrastructure for inspection. To maximize the likelihood of success, you should: - Approach business planning with a realistic understanding of what it costs to start and sustain a business, particularly regarding employee compensation. - Engage in market research to validate demand for your chosen niche. - Consider bootstrapping or seeking external funding if your initial capital isn't sufficient. - Build a brand that stands for quality and dependability. - Consider the importance of corporate responsibility, ethical business practices, and long-term sustainability. - Develop strong leadership and business management skills.

Resizing them can improve loading times and make them easier to view. 2. **Limit Number of Images**: If a directory contains a large number of images, consider showing a subset, especially if the purpose is to provide an overview. 3. **Image Thumbnails**: Instead of displaying the full-sized images, display thumbnails and allow the option to view the full-size image if needed. 4. **Use HTML**: Using HTML tags provides more flexibility in how images are displayed, such as aligning them in a grid. 5. **Compress Images**: If the image quality is not critical, consider compressing the images to reduce file size. 6. **Lazy Loading**: If displaying a long list of images, you can implement or simulate lazy loading (only load images when they come into view). Here's an optimized version using some of these suggestions: \`\`\`python import os from IPython.display import display, HTML # Define the path where the images are located image_path = 'path/to/images' # List all files in the directory and filter out non-image files image_extensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp'] image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(image_path) if any(f.lower().endswith(ext) for ext in image_extensions)] # Define the number of images to display and the size of thumbnails number_of_images = 10 # You can adjust this to show more or fewer images thumbnail_size = 128 # You can adjust the size of the thumbnail # Create a list to hold the HTML image elements html_images = [] # Loop through the image files and create HTML <img> tags for i, file in enumerate(image_files): if i >= number_of_images: break image_filepath = os.path.join(image_path, file) html_images.append(f'<img src=\\"{image_filepath}\\" width=\\"{thumbnail_size}px\\" title=\\"{file}\\" />') # Join all the image tags and wrap them in an HTML block (e.g., a div) html_block = f'<div>{\\"\\".join(html_images)}</div>' # Display the HTML block containing the images display(HTML(html_block)) \`\`\` Replace 'path/to/images' with the actual path of your images.

However, Dick's luck began to change when he was taken in by a wealthy merchant who needed a kitchen boy. Dick worked hard, but the merchant's house was infested with rats and mice. That is until Dick's cat showcased her impressive mousing skills. The merchant was so pleased that he offered to take the cat on a sea voyage to trade her mousing services for gold and treasures in far-off lands. **Facing Image:** The illustration might depict a young Dick standing on the bustling streets of old London with hope in his eyes, contrasting with the busy, indifferent crowd around him.

The fields lie fallow, resting under a blanket of snow as nature itself slumbers. Farmers take this season to repair their tools and fences, and to plan for the spring planting. In the woods, animals like the fox and badger venture out to forage in the crisp, cold air, leaving tracks in the snow for keen-eyed country children to find. Birds such as robins and wrens flit about, bright against the white landscape, visiting garden feeders where thoughtful residents have left seeds and suet to help them through the lean months. The village pond may freeze over, much to the delight of children who slide and skate on its smooth surface, while elders recall winters of yesteryear when the frost fairs were held on the Thames itself. Inside cozy cottages, families gather round the hearth, and the scent of wood smoke permeates the air. Seasonal festivities bring cheer, with carol singers moving door to door, their breath misting in the cold night, and homes are adorned with holly, ivy, and mistletoe. **Facing Image:** The accompanying illustration could depict a quintessential English rural scene, with a thatched cottage nestled in a snow-covered landscape. Smoke curls from the chimney, suggesting the warmth inside. In the foreground, a red-breasted robin may sit atop a frosted fence post, while a family of rosy-cheeked children and their dog play on the icy pond in the midground, wrapped up in scarves and bobble hats, laughing joyously. In the background, a farmer might be pictured carrying out winter tasks, such as mending a broken fence. Bare trees with icicles hanging from the branches would frame the scene, and a gentle snowfall would add to the atmosphere. The soft light of the setting sun would bathe the snow in a warm glow, hinting at the peaceful end of a winter's day. The illustration would have the classic Ladybird style, with vivid colors and a sense of idyllic rural life.

Несмотря на все свои старания не обращать внимания на незнакомку, нарушавшую ее личное пространство и игнорирующую ее просьбы остановиться, она все же ощущала растущую опасность. Все это время Нюта продолжала играть, пытаясь сосредоточиться и подавлять панику, которая захлестывала ее изнутри. Однако, с каждой минутой, события становились все страннее и тревожнее вокруг барабанщицы. Сначала она заметила, что все микрофоны и гитары у остальных участников группы вселись в полнейшую тишину, словно какая-то тайная сила отключила их. Это вызвало у Нюты нарастающую тревогу, так как она осознала, что что-то необычное и зловещее начинает происходить. К тому времени, как Нюта успела оглянуться, сцена была окутана мраком. Все огни погасли, создавая атмосферу напряжения и страха. В сумерках она еле могла разглядеть незнакомку, приближающуюся к ней из темноты. Ее сердце забилось быстрее, а чувство беспомощности и страха все только нарастало. В следующую секунду Незнакомка была уже рядом с Нютой, подняв ее за талию и начав целовать.

However, there are some ways to potentially open a zip tie without cutting it, although this might not work for all zip ties, especially if they are tight or have a smaller locking mechanism. Here's a method to try opening a standard zip tie without cutting it: 1. Insert the point of a small flathead screwdriver, a needle, or a thin piece of metal (like a safety pin or a paperclip) into the head of the zip tie, where the ratchet or locking bar is located. 2. Gently depress the locking bar or pawl inside the zip tie head. This is the mechanism that locks the tie in place. 3. While pressing down on the locking bar, carefully pull the tail of the zip tie back out through the head to loosen or open the tie. Be cautious when performing this action. The tool you're using might slip and cause injury, so it's important to be careful. Wearing protective gloves can provide an additional layer of safety. If you're struggling to open the zip tie or if it is too tight such that no tool can access the locking mechanism, then cutting it might be the only option. Use a pair of scissors, wire cutters, or a sharp cutting tool to snip the zip tie near the locking head. In cases where you know you'll need to reuse zip ties, consider purchasing reusable ones, which come with a tab that can be lifted to release the locking mechanism. These can be more practical for temporary setups or for organizing cables that might need frequent adjustments."},{"instruction":"Proverbes sur le corps est veine.l'orgueil ne rime à rien","output":"1. \\"Un corps bien portant est une richesse, l'orgueil ne fait que vider les veines.\\" 2. \\"Les veines du corps sont le flux de vie, l'orgueil n'est qu'une vaine folie.\\" 3. \\"Le corps est une merveille à entretenir, l'orgueil est un poids à bannir.\\" 4. \\"Les veines irriguent chaque partie du corps, l'orgueil n'apporte que des remords.\\" 5. \\"Le corps est une architecture divine, l'orgueil en est la ruine.\\" 6. \\"La santé est un trésor à préserver, l'orgueil est un piège à éviter.\\" 7. \\"Les veines sont l'écho du battement du cœur, l'orgueil est un jeu destructeur.\\" 8. \\"Le corps est une symphonie harmonieuse, l'orgueil est une fausse mélodie pernicieuse.\\" 9. \\"La beauté vient de l'intérieur, l'orgueil est une laideur qui veut s'imposer.\\" 10. \\"Les veines sont des chemins à emprunter, l'orgueil est un détour à éviter.\\""},{"instruction":"Proverbes qui parles rien ne sert de s'inventer ou s'en orgueilleux de ce corps car elle n'est que vanité","output":"1. \\"Rien ne sert de s'inventer, la vérité du corps l'emporte sur la vanité.\\" 2. \\"S'enorgueillir de son corps est vain, seule la vérité de l'être humain compte enfin.\\" 3. \\"La beauté du corps n'est que vanité, l'authenticité de l'âme est la vraie réalité.\\" 4. \\"S'inventer un corps serti de mensonges, c'est se perdre dans les méandres de la vanité.\\" 5. \\"L'orgueil du corps n'est qu'une illusion, la véritable grandeur est dans l'humilité de l'expression.\\" 6. \\"La vanité du corps est éphémère, seule la grandeur de l'âme peut se pérenniser.\\" 7. \\"S'enorgueillir de sa beauté physique est superficiel, car seul l'éclat intérieur est réel.\\" 8. \\"La vanité du corps est une cage dorée, la vraie grandeur réside dans la liberté de l'âme.\\" 9. \\"Se préoccuper de son corps est naturel, mais l'orgueil n'est qu'un voile de vanité artificiel.\\" 10. \\"Le corps peut être une toile à embellir, mais l'orgueil en fait un masque à dévoiler.\\""},{"instruction":"Un gladiateur","output":"1. \\"Le gladiateur, fier dans l'arène, combat avec bravoure et détermination.\\" 2. \\"Le gladiateur, courageux et fort, affronte ses adversaires sans remords.\\" 3. \\"Tel un lion au combat, le gladiateur montre sa force et son éclat.\\" 4. \\"Dans l'arène, le gladiateur se bat avec honneur et fierté, prêt à tout donner pour sa liberté.\\" 5. \\"Le gladiateur, symbole de résistance, défie l'adversité avec persévérance.\\" 6. \\"Le gladiateur, homme de fer et d'acier, incarne l'esprit du guerrier.\\" 7. \\"Sous ses armures étincelantes, le gladiateur inspire respect et crainte.\\" 8. \\"Le gladiateur, maître de l'art de la guerre, se forge une légende éternelle à travers ses batailles féroces.\\" 9. \\"Le gladiateur, devenu une icône, reste un symbole de bravoure et de passion.\\" 10. \\"Le gladiateur, véritable héros des temps anciens, reste gravé dans l'histoire comme un exemple de courage.\\""},{"instruction":"\\"\\"\\" import os from IPython.display import Image, display # Define the path where the images are located image_path = '/content/Images' # List all files in the directory files = os.listdir(image_path) # Filter out non-image files (optional) # Update this list with the file extensions your images have image_extensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp'] # Loop through all files and display them if they are images for file in files: # Check if the file is an image based on its extension if any(file.lower().endswith(ext) for ext in image_extensions): # Display the image display(Image(filename=os.path.join(image_path, file))) # Print the filename (optional) print(file) \\"\\"\\" How can I optimise the display of images?","output":"The code snippet you provided is already pretty optimal for a simple usage scenario where you only need to display images in a Jupyter Notebook. However, depending on the number of images, their sizes, and the performance constraints you're experiencing, there may be a few optimizations and best practices you can consider: 1. **Reduce Image Size**: If the images are large, consider resizing them before displaying. Large images consume more memory and take longer to render. 2. **Limit the Number of Images**: If you have many images, you may not want to display them all at once. Consider implementing pagination or only displaying a subset. 3. **Use Thumbnails**: Instead of displaying the full-size image, create and display thumbnails. Users can click on a thumbnail to view the full-size image if needed. 4. **Asynchronous Loading**: If you're concerned about the execution time of the cell, you might load and display images asynchronously. However, this is a more complex solution and may not be directly supported within a Jupyter notebook. 5. **Optimize the Use of Extensions List**: If you have a very long list of possible extensions, this could slightly slow down the process. Narrow down to the most likely extensions. Here's an example of how some of these concepts could be incorporated: \`\`\`python import os from IPython.display import Image, display from PIL import Image as PILImage # Define the path where the images are located image_path = '/content/Images' # List all files in the directory files = os.listdir(image_path) # Filter out non-image files (optional) # Update this list with the file extensions your images have image_extensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp'] # Configure the max number of images to display max_images_to_display = 10 thumbnail_size = (100, 100) # Width, height in pixels # Loop through files and display thumbnails up to the max_images_to_display for count, file in enumerate(files): if count >= max_images_to_display: break # Stop if we've reached the limit # Check if the file is an image based on its extension if any(file.lower().endswith(ext) for ext in image_extensions): # Open the image, create a thumbnail, and save it to a buffer filepath = os.path.join(image_path, file) pil_img = PILImage.open(filepath) pil_img.thumbnail(thumbnail_size) # Display the thumbnail display(pil_img) # Print the filename (optional) print(file) \`\`\` In this adjusted code: - We limit the number of displayed images with \`max_images_to_display\`. - Thumbnails are created using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which is now known as Pillow. You would need to install the Pillow library to use this code (\`!pip install Pillow\`). Remember that whether these optimizations are needed and how much they'll help will depend a lot on your specific scenario."},{"instruction":"I would like to display images with a grid layout","output":"To display images in a grid layout within a Jupyter notebook, you can use HTML to create a table or a set of div elements styled with CSS to align your images in a grid layout.

You can adjust this value to control the display size of your images. To display the images from your local directory in a Jupyter notebook, you need to make sure that the Jupyter notebook server has access to the images' directory. Otherwise, HTML rendering may not be possible for local paths. An alternative for local images is to encode them with base64 and then embed them directly within the HTML. This can avoid path issues but increases memory usage for the notebook."},{"instruction":"write an email for planning to order the CNY 2024 plant for office use.","output":"Subject: Order Placement for CNY 2024 Plant – Office Décor Update!

Small packets of warmth work through a simple exothermic reaction by Linda Wang January 25, 2010 | A version of this story appeared in Volume 88, Issue 4 Credit: Amanda Yarnell/C&EN For winter sports enthusiasts, hand warmers can mean the difference between calling it a day early and playing outside for as long as possible. In fact, anyone who braves cold temperatures might be tempted to try the little disposable pouches that emit warmth within seconds of being exposed to air. Hand warmers date back centuries to when people in Japan would use hot stones to warm their hands, says Keiko Ishikawa, a marketing manager at hand warmer maker Mycoal USA. Portable hand warmers filled with hot ash were the version that followed, she says. These days, you can buy a variety of hand warmers based on battery packs and lighter fuel, but disposable hand warmers rely entirely on chemistry. Disposable hand warmers turn up the heat in your mittens by means of an exothermic reaction that, in essence, just creates rust. Each pouch typically contains iron powder, salt, water, an absorbent material, and activated carbon. When the pouch is removed from its outer packaging, oxygen drifts across the pouch’s permeable covering. With salt and water present, the oxygen reacts with the iron powder located inside to form iron oxide (Fe2O3) and release heat. The absorbent material can be pulverized wood, a polymer such as polyacrylate, or a silicon-based mineral called vermiculite. It helps retain the moisture so that the reaction can occur. The activated carbon helps to evenly disperse the heat produced, which can average 135 °F. Although the chemistry of disposable hand warmers is simple, their engineering is more complicated. “You want to make this thing act quickly because people like to open up the packet and feel warm right away, but you also want it to last a long time,” says Joe Vergona, manager of engineering and product development at Grabber Performance Group, a Grand Rapids, Mich.-based company that sells hand warmers. For example, some hand warmers last seven hours, and others can last more than 24 hours. To lengthen the time a hand warmer lasts, some companies opt to increase the amount of iron in the packet, Vergona says. Another strategy is to experiment with the iron powder. “If you vary the raw materials in the warmer, you can change how quickly the reaction happens or how much of the warmer is reacted at one time,” Vergona adds. For example, the greater the surface area of the iron, the more it can react with oxygen to produce heat, he says. TOASTY [+]Enlarge Credit: Amanda Yarnell/C&EN Hand warmers can extend the winter fun. The pouch material also affects the performance of the hand warmers. “It’s a balance of the ingredients inside the pack and the performance characteristics of the pouch itself,” Vergona says. The iron powder and other ingredients are contained in a blended nonwoven material that has specific permeability characteristics. If the pouch admits more oxygen, the reaction occurs more quickly. Toe warmers, for example, use a nonwoven material that lets in more oxygen to compensate for the low-oxygen environment inside a shoe. “The level of perforation, the size of the holes—all that’s going to govern how much oxygen enters the warmer,” Vergona says. To extend the shelf life of hand warmers, the outside wrapper is specially chosen to ensure that minimal amounts of oxygen get in and minimal water gets out. “Any old plastic, and the hand warmers will last a week and die,” because oxygen can get in and spoil the product, Vergona says. The outside wrappers are usually made of polymers such as the plastic polyethylene. The main difference between disposable hand warmers and some reusable versions is the chemicals used to produce the heat-releasing reaction. Reusable hand warmers don’t contain iron but instead use a supersaturated solution of sodium acetate that releases heat as it crystallizes. Boiling the used packet restores the solution to its supersaturated state. Air-activated hand warmers can’t be reused. Disposal hand warmers don’t just keep humans from getting too cold. Grabber also sells heavy-duty warmers that can help tropical fish survive transportation through chilly climates.","output":"**Summary of the article:** The article by Linda Wang, published in C&EN, provides an overview of disposable hand warmers and how they function chemically to produce heat. It explains that these hand warmers work based on a simple exothermic reaction involving iron powder, salt, water, absorbent material, and activated carbon. When exposed to air, the iron reacts with oxygen to form iron oxide (rust), releasing heat in the process. The heat is evenly distributed by activated carbon, and the reaction can be engineered to provide warmth for different durations, some lasting more than 24 hours. The article also touches on the history of hand warmers, the engineering challenges in optimizing their performance, and other uses for disposable hand warmers, such as tropical fish transportation. **How the article was told:** The article is told through a blend of historical context, technical description, and industry insights. It begins with a brief history of hand warmers, their importance for people in cold climates, and then delves into the chemistry behind modern disposable hand warmers. It also includes explanations from industry experts on how hand warmers are engineered for performance, such as how the permeability of the pouch material and the size of iron powder particles affect the rate and duration of heat production. **Relation to Chemistry Topics:** The article relates to several topics in chemistry regarding reaction rates and mechanisms: - 5A (Factors Affecting Rates): The permeability of the pouch material and the amount of iron used influence the rate at which oxygen reacts with iron. - 5B (Rate Laws): The iron oxidation reaction follows a rate law based on the concentration of reactants (oxygen and iron) available. - 5C (Rates, Graphs & Half-Life): The duration of hand warmers could be graphed to show how the rate of the exothermic reaction decreases over time. - 5D (Elementary Steps): The reaction likely proceeds through elementary steps involving the formation of iron oxide. - 5E (Collision Theory): The reaction takes place as iron particles collide with oxygen molecules in the presence of water and salt. - 5F (Energy Profiles I): The exothermic reaction profile would show the energy released as heat. - 5G (Mechanisms): The overall mechanism involves the oxidation of iron by oxygen. - 5H (Mechanisms & Rate Law): The rate law of the reaction could be derived from the mechanism and the rate-determining step. - 5I (Intermediates in Rate Determining Steps): Any intermediates in the oxidation process would affect the rate-determining step. - 5J (Energy Profiles II): Factors such as particle size could influence the reaction pathway and energy profile. - 5K (Catalysts): Although not explicitly stated, catalysts could be used in hand warmers to speed up the reaction without being consumed. **Two interesting facts from the article:** 1. Besides keeping hands warm, some disposable hand warmers are used to ensure tropical fish can be safely transported through cold climates, highlighting an unusual application of this technology. 2. The outer packaging of hand warmers must prevent oxygen from entering and spoiling the product until use, which requires specially selected materials to manage gas permeability effectively."},{"instruction":"Que signifie ESIDE DE MARTIN FAYULU","output":"\\"ESIDE\\" n'est pas une expression courante ou reconnue en français.

Also I'm willing to dedicate all my spare time to this. Money is the only factor realistically, everything else isn't too important. explain each in detail why it's on the list and why it's in its certain place.","output":"Creating a business that aims for high profits requires identifying a niche with low competition but high demand, leveraging remote work to keep overheads low, and ensuring the business model allows for good profit margins. Given your focus on earning at least 200k per year, ideas are often skewed towards bespoke services or products that can command premium pricing. However, the ethical concerns and feasibility of not paying employees even a deferred wage are significant. Legally, unless the employees are co-founders or have agreed to work for equity in lieu of immediate payment, they typically must be paid at least a minimum wage. You'll need to consider the legal implications, the morale of employees, and the long-term sustainability of any plan that defers wages. Employees working without immediate pay are often granted significant equity or profit-sharing to incentivize their efforts. That said, here are 10 niche business concepts, assuming that somehow the wage deferment is deemed legal and ethical, and you have managed to find willing participants: 1. Low-Volume, High-End Custom Software Development Focusing on customized, high-end software for niche industries can command premium prices. You'll need to find experienced outsourced developers who are willing to work on deferred wages for the promise of future profits. 2. Specialized Consulting Services Offer consulting for high-demand, niche areas such as AI implementation, blockchain, or cybersecurity. You will need outsourced experts in these fields. 3. Boutique Investment Research Firm Offer high-end, in-depth investment analyses tailored to individual investors or small hedge funds. This requires a team of outsourced finance experts. 4. Virtual Event Planning Plan and manage virtual events for niche industries or high-end private celebrations. This requires professionals in event planning, marketing, and technology. 5. Exclusive Content Creation Agency Develop a content agency that makes premium content for specific sectors like luxury brands or high-tech businesses. You’ll need skilled content writers, videographers, and marketers. 6. Bespoke eLearning Solutions Provide custom eLearning platforms and content for corporations. The team would include eLearning consultants, developers, and educational content creators. 7. Personal Brand Management for Executives and Professionals Offer a total package service for managing and enhancing executives' personal brands online and in the public eye. This would require marketing and reputation management professionals. 8. Niche Market E-commerce Store An e-commerce store focusing on high-margin, low competition products. You need to do heavy research to find a niche that hasn’t been filled. 9. Remote IT Support and Security for Small Businesses Providing cybersecurity and IT support tailored for small businesses, which typically don't have the resources for an in-house team. This needs IT specialists. 10. High-End Crafts and Artisanal Goods Marketplace Creating an online marketplace that connects buyers with exclusive handcrafted goods. You need to source the artisans and handle logistics effectively. These ideas are ordered based on the likelihood of achieving your financial goal with the resources you have, considering demand, potential for high margins, and the plausibility of finding employees willing to work on deferred wages. However, each of these would require substantial planning, a robust business plan, and potential co-founders or employees who believe in the vision enough to take on the risk of deferred wages. As an 18-and-a-half-year-old with 40k, these ideas provide a starting point but remember that execution, market fit, and your ability to sell the value of your products and services are what will ultimately determine success. Finally, remember that while making money is essential, ethical considerations and the wellbeing of the team you work with should never be overlooked."},{"instruction":"","output":"Given that there seems to be a technical error or blank input following your earlier message, I would like to reiterate the importance of approaching your entrepreneurial aspirations with a strong understanding of both legal and ethical business practices. In the scenario that employees or outsourced team members are working under deferred payment agreements, it is crucial to ensure that all parties involved have a clear, written agreement that details the conditions, duration, and the precise compensation structure. Such agreements are typically aligned with an equity-based model where participants may become shareholders in the company and share its potential success. Moreover, sustainable and successful business models usually focus on creating value for all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and society at large. Creating a business that strictly aims to maximize profits for the owner alone might neglect other important factors that contribute to the long-term success of a company, such as employee satisfaction and customer loyalty. Additionally, while having a financial goal is important, a business concept that delivers real value to its customers will generally stand a better chance at success. Aligning your business concept with a need in the market, providing excellent customer service, and fostering a good working environment for employees tend to lead to a successful and profitable enterprise in the long run. Given your age and financial resources, consider working with a mentor or seeking guidance from an experienced entrepreneur or business advisor to help shape and refine your business strategy. This mentorship can offer invaluable insights into running a successful business and may provide practical advice to avoid potential pitfalls that could impede reaching your goal. Furthermore, continuously educate yourself on business operations, including marketing, sales, financial management, leadership, and business law. Attaining a broad understanding of these areas can substantially increase the odds of your company’s success.

Могут ли существовать ионы CF5+ и NF4+?","output":"Молекула CF4 (тетрафторуглерод): - Гибридизация: атом углерода в молекуле CF4 имеет sp³-гибридизацию. Это означает, что один s-орбиталь и три p-орбитали углерода объединяются, образуя четыре равноценные sp³-гибридизированные орбитали. - Валентные углы: Из-за sp³-гибридизации углеродных орбиталей и равномерного распределения электронных пар вокруг углерода молекула CF4 имеет тетраэдрическую структуру с валентными углами приблизительно 109.5°. - Полярность молекулы: Все четыре связи C-F полярны из-за разницы в электроотрицательности атомов углерода и фтора. Однако из-за симметричной тетраэдрической геометрии молекулы моменты диполей взаимно компенсируются, и поэтому молекула CF4 в целом неполярна. Молекула NF3 (трифторид азота): - Гибридизация: атом азота в молекуле NF3 также имеет sp³-гибридизацию. - Валентные углы: У молекулы NF3 тоже тетраэдрическая структура, но из-за наличия неподеленной пары электронов на атоме азота валентные углы меньше идеального тетраэдрического угла 109.5°. Неподеленная пара электронов занимает больше места, чем связывающая пара, из-за чего связи NF \\"сжимаются\\", и угол между ними около 102.5°. - Полярность молекулы: Хотя связи N-F полярны, молекула NF3 имеет полярность из-за несимметричной распределения электронов (с учетом неподеленной пары).

Относительно существования ионов CF5+ и NF4+: Ион CF5+: Теоретически, атом углерода может образовать пять связей, если он находится в состоянии повышенной валентности с участием d-орбиталей. Однако для углерода это очень необычно из-за его малого размера и недоступности d-орбиталей для участия в гибридизации. Поэтому ион CF5+ крайне нестабилен и можно ожидать, что он не будет существовать в свободном состоянии в обычных условиях. Ион NF4+: Ион NF4+ может существовать, так как азот способен расширять свою валентную оболочку за счет вакантных d-орбиталей. В таких ионах азот проявляет валентность пять, и ион NF4+ является известным, но он будет нестабилен и существует в особых условиях, обычно стабилизируясь в виде комплексов с другими лигандами или ионами."},{"instruction":"Определите степени окисления элементов в молекуле: I S = O / I Электроотрицательности йода, серы и кислорода равны 2.28, 2.50 и 3.60 соответственно","output":"Данная молекула соответствует дииодиду серы или дииодсульфонилу и имеет структурную формулу I2SO. Чтобы определить степени окисления (СО) элементов в этой молекуле, воспользуемся следующими правилами: 1. Сумма степеней окисления всех атомов в нейтральной молекуле равна нулю. 2. Кислород обычно имеет степень окисления -2 (за исключением пероксидов и соединений с фтором). 3. Атом с более высокой электроотрицательностью получает отрицательную степень окисления. Исходя из правил и значений электроотрицательности, можем определить степени окисления следующим образом: Кислород, как наиболее электроотрицательный элемент, будет иметь степень окисления -2. Сера находится между двумя иодами и одним кислородом, имея относительную электроотрицательность 2.50, которая меньше, чем у кислорода (3.60), но больше, чем у йода (2.28). Это означает, что она будет иметь положительную степень окисления из-за отдачи электронной плотности кислороду и при этом получения электронной плотности от йода. Иод, как наименее электроотрицательный элемент в данной молекуле, скорее всего будет иметь отрицательную или нулевую степень окисления. Чтобы вычислить степень окисления серы, предположим, что степень окисления иода равна -1 (как в большинстве иодидных соединений). Таким образом: 2 * (СО йода) + 1 * (СО серы) + 1 * (-2) = 0 Предполагая, что СО йода равна -1, получаем: 2 * (-1) + 1 * (СО серы) - 2 = 0 -2 + 1 * (СО серы) - 2 = 0 1 * (СО серы) - 4 = 0 СО серы = +4 Таким образом, степень окисления серы в данной молекуле равна +4. Степень окисления иода -1, а кислорода -2. Однако, стоит отметить, что в таких соединениях степень окисления иода может варьироваться, и она может быть другой, если, например, иод проявляет более высокую валентность.

Для хлорида кальция ( CaCl_2 ), молекулярная масса приблизительно равна 40.08 (кальций) + 35.45*2 (два атома хлора) = 111 г/моль. Условие гласит, что раствор содержит 6 молей хлорида кальция на килограмм растворителя. 1. Определение мольной доли хлорида кальция (χ): хлорид кальция, учитывая что мольная концентрация 6 моль/кг, в молярном представлении это будет 6 моль хлорида кальция на 1 кг воды. Требуется масса раствора, так как ( χ = n_{solute} / (n_{solute} + n_{solvent}) ). Поскольку масса воды составляет 1 кг или 1000 г, количество молей воды будет равно массе воды, деленной на ее молярная массу (18 г/моль): [ n_{text{воды}} = frac{1000text{ г}}{18text{ г/моль}} ≈ 55.6 text{ моль} ] Теперь мы можем вычислить мольную долю хлорида кальция: [ χ_{CaCl_2} = frac{n_{CaCl_2}}{n_{CaCl_2} + n_{воды}} = frac{6 text{ моль}}{6 text{ моль} + 55.6 text{ моль}} ≈ frac{6}{61.6} ≈ 0.097 ] 2. Определение массовой доли хлорида кальция (w): Массовая доля рассчитывается как отношение массы растворенного вещества к массе всего раствора. Масса хлорида кальция рассчитывается как произведение его количества молей на молярную массу: [ m_{CaCl_2} = n_{CaCl_2} times М_{CaCl_2} = 6 text{ моль} times 111 text{ г/моль} = 666 text{ г} ] Масса всего раствора будет суммой массы растворенного вещества и массы воды: [ m_{р-р} = m_{CaCl_2} + m_{воды} = 666 text{ г} + 1000 text{ г} = 1666 text{ г} ] [ w_{CaCl_2} = frac{m_{CaCl_2}}{m_{р-р}} = frac{666 text{ г}}{1666 text{ г}} ≈ 0.40 ] 3. Определение титра хлорида кальция (T): Титр рассчитывается как масса растворенного вещества в граммах на 1 мл раствора. Сначала найдем объем раствора: [ ρ = m_{р-р} / V_{р-р} ] [ V_{р-р} = m_{р-р} / ρ = 1666 text{ г} / 1.4 text{ г/мл} ≈ 1190 text{ мл} ] Теперь титр: [ T = frac{m_{CaCl_2}}{V_{р-р}} = frac{666 text{ г}}{1190 text{ мл}} ≈ 0.56 text{ г/мл} ] 4. Определение нормальной концентрации хлорида кальция (Cn): Нормальная концентрация определяет количество эквивалентов вещества на литр раствора. Эквивалент хлорида кальция равен его молярной массе, деленной на валентность катиона кальция, который равен 2. Таким образом, эквивалентная масса ( CaCl_2 ) равна ( 111 text{ г/моль} / 2 ). Нормальность раствора равна молярной концентрации, умноженной на эквивалентность: [ Cn_{CaCl_2} = Cm times эквивалентность = 6 text{ моль/кг} times 2 ] Так как мы хотим определить нормальность в моль/л, то нужно сначала перевести молярную концентрацию из моль/кг в моль/л, учитывая плотность раствора: [ Cm_{CaCl_2} = frac{6 text{ моль}}{1666 text{ г}} times 1000 text{ г/л} ≈ frac{6 text{ моль}}{1.666 text{ кг}} times 1.4 text{ кг/л} ≈ 6 times 1.4 text{ моль/л} = 8.4 text{ моль/л} ] [ Cn_{CaCl_2} = 8.4 text{ моль/л} times 2 ≈ 16.8 text{ моль/л} ] 5. Определение молярной концентрации хлорида кальция (Cm): Мы уже вычислили это в пункте выше: [ Cm_{CaCl_2} = 8.4 text{ моль/л} ] Итак, исходя из данных и расчетов, мы получаем следующее: - Мольная доля хлорида кальция (χ_(CaCl_2)) ≈ 0.097 - Массовая доля хлорида кальция (w_(CaCl_2)) ≈ 0.40 - Титр хлорида кальция (T) ≈ 0.56 г/мл - Нормальная концентрация хлорида кальция (Cn_(CaCl_2)) ≈ 16.8 моль/л - Молярная концентрация хлорида кальция (Cm_(CaCl_2)) ≈ 8.4 моль/л"},{"instruction":"Твое решение содержит какие-то нарушения разметки, как frac{666 . пожалуйста, перепиши решение нормально","output":"Извините за путаницу с разметкой.

Нам нужно выразить концентрацию в терминах мольности, мольной доли, массовой доли, титра и нормальной концентрации. Для начала определим молекулярную массу ( CaCl_2 ): Масса ( Ca ) = 40.08 г/моль Масса ( Cl ) = 35.45 г/моль Молекулярная масса ( CaCl_2 ) = 40.08 + (35.45 × 2) = 111 г/моль 1. Мольная доля ( CaCl_2 ) (χ): Масса растворителя (воды) = 1000 г Количество молей воды = масса / молекулярная масса воды Количество молей воды = 1000 г / 18 г/моль ≈ 55.56 моль Мольная доля χ рассчитывается как: [ χ_{CaCl_2} = frac{n_{CaCl_2}}{n_{CaCl_2} + n_{H_2O}} ] [ χ_{CaCl_2} = frac{6}{6 + 55.56} ] [ χ_{CaCl_2} ≈ frac{6}{61.56} ] [ χ_{CaCl_2} ≈ 0.097 ] 2. Массовая доля ( CaCl_2 ) (w): Масса ( CaCl_2 ) = количество молей × молярная масса Масса ( CaCl_2 ) = 6 моль × 111 г/моль = 666 г Общая масса раствора (m) = масса растворителя + масса ( CaCl_2 ) Общая масса раствора = 1000 г + 666 г = 1666 г Массовая доля w рассчитывается как: [ w_{CaCl_2} = frac{масса_{CaCl_2}}{масса_{р-ра}} ] [ w_{CaCl_2} = frac{666 г}{1666 г} ] [ w_{CaCl_2} ≈ 0.40 или 40% ] 3. Титр ( CaCl_2 ) (T) - масса растворенного вещества на объем раствора: Объем раствора (V) рассчитывается исходя из его массы и плотности: [ V_{р-ра} = frac{масса_{р-ра}}{плотность_{р-ра}} ] [ V_{р-ра} = frac{1666 г}{1.4 г/мл} ] [ V_{р-ра} ≈ 1190 мл ] Титр T рассчитывается как: [ T = frac{масса_{CaCl_2}}{V_{р-ра}} ] [ T = frac{666 г}{1190 мл} ] [ T ≈ 0.56 г/мл ] 4. Нормальная концентрация ( CaCl_2 ) (Cn): Нормальная концентрация равна молярной концентрации, умноженной на валентность (эквиваленты). Валентность кальция = 2. [ Cn = Cm × валентность ] [ Cn_{CaCl_2} = frac{моль_{CaCl_2}}{frac{масса_{р-ра}}{плотность}} × валентность ] [ Cn_{CaCl_2} = frac{6 моль}{1.666 л} × 2 ] [ Cn_{CaCl_2} ≈ 7.2 моль/л ] 5. Молярная концентрация ( CaCl_2 ) (Cm): Молярная концентрация раствора рассчитывается как количество молей растворенного вещества на объем раствора в литрах. [ Cm = frac{моль_{CaCl_2}}{V_{р-ра}} ] [ Cm_{CaCl_2} = frac{6 моль}{1.666 л} ] [ Cm_{CaCl_2} ≈ 3.6 моль/л ] Примечание: Нормальная и молярная концентрации должны быть одинаковы, так как валентность кальция в ( CaCl_2 ) равна 2, и нормальная концентрация учитывает это в двойном размере. Проверим расчеты. Молярная концентрация раствора рассчитывается также через мольность: [ Cm_{CaCl_2} = frac{моль_{CaCl_2}}{V_{р-ра} в литрах} ] [ Cm_{CaCl_2} = frac{6 моль}{1.666 л} ] [ Cm_{CaCl_2} ≈ 3.6 моль/л ] Нормальная концентрация ( CaCl_2 ) рассчитанная неправильно. Правильный расчет нормальной концентрации будет: [ Cn_{CaCl_2} = Cm_{CaCl_2} × валентность ] [ Cn_{CaCl_2} = 3.6 моль/л × 2 ] [ Cn_{CaCl_2} = 7.2 норм/л ] Однако, поскольку хлорид кальция полностью диссоциирует в растворе на один ион кальция и два иона хлорида, нет необходимости умножать на эквивалентность при определении нормальной концентрации, и молярная концентрация будет равна нормальной концентрации в этом случае. Итак, окончательно: - Мольная доля хлорида кальция ( χ_{CaCl_2} ) ≈ 0.097 или 9.7% - Массовая доля хлорида кальция ( w_{CaCl_2} ) ≈ 0.40 или 40% - Титр хлорида кальция ( T ) ≈ 0.56 г/мл - Нормальная концентрация хлорида кальция ( Cn_{CaCl_2} ) ≈ 3.6 моль/л или 3.6 норм/л - Молярная концентрация хлорида кальция ( Cm_{CaCl_2} ) ≈ 3.6 моль/л"},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Illustrious: “Man, it’s so boring today…even for my fellow shipgirls.

В статье 161 УК РФ содержится определение грабежа, его элементы и уголовная ответственность за его совершение. Согласно статье 161 УК РФ, грабеж представляет собой незаконное хищение чужого имущества с использованием насилия или угрозы его применения. Этот вид преступления связан с нарушением собственности другого человека и посягательством на его жизнь или здоровье. Одной из основных характеристик грабежа является незаконность хищения. Это означает, что преступник без согласия собственника или иного законного владельца имущества овладевает его. При этом, для совершения грабежа необходимо применить насилие или угрозу его применения. Насилие может быть физического или психологического характера и направлено на потерпевшего или его близких. Угроза насилия может быть явной или подразумеваемой, но она должна быть достаточно убедительной, чтобы вынудить потерпевшего отказаться от своего имущества. Статья 161 УК РФ также предусматривает наказание для лиц, совершивших грабеж. В зависимости от обстоятельств преступления, наказание может варьироваться от лишения свободы на срок до 15 лет до пожизненного лишения свободы.

Грабеж имеет серьезные последствия для общества и индивидуальных граждан. Он наносит ущерб как материальным, так и моральным интересам потерпевших. Последствия грабежа могут быть разнообразными – от финансовых потерь, утраты имущества до травм и психологической травмы у потерпевших. Преследуя цели правового государства, грабеж представляется уголовно наказуемым и его совершители привлекаются к ответственности перед законом. Такие меры имеют цель обеспечить справедливость и защитить права и свободы граждан. Борьба с грабежом – это одна из важнейших задач правоохранительных органов, направленная на обеспечение общественной безопасности и привлечение к ответственности лиц, нарушающих закон и причиняющих вред другим. Грабеж является серьезной угрозой для правопорядка и благополучия общества. Необходимо строго соблюдать закон и прилагать все усилия для предотвращения совершения этого преступления и привлечения его исполнителей к ответственности.

Уголовная ответственность за грабеж 2.1 Наказание за совершение грабежа 2.2 Агравирующие обстоятельства 3. Защита прав жертв грабежа 3.1 Роль правоохранительных органов 3.2 Реабилитация и компенсация для потерпевших Заключение Введение: Грабеж является одним из наиболее опасных и распространенных преступлений, связанных с насилием и хищением имущества. В данной курсовой работе мы рассмотрим понятие грабежа и его определение в статье 161 Уголовного Кодекса Российской Федерации, а также уголовную ответственность и защиту прав жертв этого преступления. 1. Понятие грабежа: 1.1 Определение грабежа в уголовном законодательстве: Статья 161 УК РФ определяет грабеж как незаконное хищение чужого имущества с применением насилия или угрозы его применения. Грабеж считается преступлением против собственности и личности. Для совершения грабежа необходимо наличие следующих элементов: хищение имущества, насилие или угроза насилия, насильственное посягательство на жизнь или здоровье. 1.2 Элементы состава преступления грабежа: - Хищение имущества – грабеж подразумевает незаконное присваивание чужого имущества без согласия владельца. Важно, чтобы имущество имело денежную оценку и являлось движимым. - Насилие или угроза насилия – для совершения грабежа необходимо иметь фактор насилия. Это может быть физическое насилие или психологическое воздействие на потерпевшего. Угроза насилия может быть явной или подразумеваемой, но должна быть достаточно убедительной для того, чтобы заставить потерпевшего сдаться. - Насильственное посягательство на жизнь или здоровье – это дополнительный элемент грабежа и подразумевает насильственные действия или угрозы, направленные на физическое вред потерпевшим или их близким. 2. Уголовная ответственность за грабеж: 2.1 Наказание за совершение грабежа: В соответствии со статьей 161 УК РФ, за совершение грабежа предусмотрено уголовное наказание в виде лишения свободы на срок до 15 лет. Однако, если грабеж совершен в особо крупных размерах или с применением насилия, которое причинило тяжкие последствия, наказание может быть увеличено до пожизненного лишения свободы. 2.2 Агравирующие обстоятельства: Статья 161 УК РФ также предусматривает агравирующие обстоятельства, при которых наказание может быть увеличено. К ним относятся: совершение грабежа со связанными лицами, с применением оружия или иного предмета, прикрытие лица, совершившего грабеж, и т.д. Эти факторы считаются особенно тяжкими для потерпевших и имеют значение при определении меры наказания. 3. Защита прав жертв грабежа: 3.1 Роль правоохранительных органов: Одним из основных средств защиты прав жертв грабежа является деятельность правоохранительных органов. Они занимаются расследованием преступлений, задержанием и привлечением к ответственности преступников. Важно, чтобы эти органы оперативно и эффективно реагировали на сигналы о грабежах, обеспечивали безопасность общества и предотвращали повторение преступлений. 3.2 Реабилитация и компенсация для потерпевших: Кроме уголовной ответственности для виновников грабежа, важно также обеспечивать реабилитацию и компенсацию для потерпевших. Это может включать психологическую поддержку, правовую помощь, а также возмещение материального ущерба. Целью этих мер является восстановление прав и интересов потерпевших и помощь им в преодолении последствий преступления. Заключение: Грабеж является опасным преступлением, явно ущемляющим личные права и свободы граждан, а также нарушающим собственность. Статья 161 УК РФ четко определяет грабеж и устанавливает уголовную ответственность для его совершителей. Защита прав потерпевших и эффективное противодействие грабежу являются неотъемлемой частью правопорядка и безопасности общества."},{"instruction":"объектичные признаки грабежа","output":"Объективные признаки грабежа можно определить на основе статьи 161 Уголовного Кодекса Российской Федерации (УК РФ) и юридической практики.

I just need phone numbers and email, nothing else","output":"Contacting data brokers for leads typically involves reaching out to them through various channels such as their website, email, or phone. While data brokers primarily collect and sell data, it's important to approach them professionally and explain your specific needs for phone numbers and email addresses. Here are some steps to contact data brokers for leads: 1. Research data brokers: Conduct an online search to find reputable data broker companies that offer the specific leads you are seeking. Ensure they comply with relevant data protection regulations. 2. Visit their websites: Go to the websites of the identified data brokers to gather information about their services, lead types, and contact details. Usually, they provide a contact page or information about how to get in touch. 3. Contact form or email: Many data brokers provide contact forms on their websites. Fill out their contact form, clearly indicating your interest in purchasing phone numbers and email addresses for leads (mention the specific industry, location, or other relevant details). If a contact form is not available, you can compose a succinct and professional email clearly expressing your requirements and intentions. 4. Phone contact: If you prefer to contact data brokers by phone, note down their phone numbers from their website and call their sales or customer service department. Request the specific leads you need and ask about their process for purchasing data. 5. Provide necessary information: When contacting data brokers, be prepared to provide details like target market demographics, industry, geographic location, preferred data format, and any other specific criteria you require for leads. This will help data brokers assist you effectively. 6. Inquire about pricing and terms: Ask the data brokers about their pricing structure, payment options, minimum order quantities, and any other relevant terms and conditions. Clarify the usage rights, compliance with regulations (e.g., data privacy laws), and whether they adhere to ethical data practices. 7. Evaluate and compare: Reach out to multiple data brokers to compare the services, prices, and data quality they offer. This will help you make an informed decision on which data broker to engage with for lead generation. Remember to approach data brokers ethically, respecting privacy and data protection regulations. Ensure that you comply with applicable laws and guidelines regarding data acquisition, usage, and commercial communication in your jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么问题或者需要帮助的地方吗？我在这里帮你。"},{"instruction":"生成的客户链接http://10.52.1.4:8766/public/khxx?acceptanceCustomerIds=sr5P8MFupYRFf+6aW/yOIw==&acceptanceCustomerIds=w/aJcklX9jwzYwGu6FRCOA==这个是我的请求连接，为什么后端接收到的sr5P8MFupYRFf+6aW/yOIw==就变成了sr5P8MFupYRFf 6aW/yOIw==","output":"在你提供的链接中，存在一个编码问题。URL（统一资源定位符）有一套自己的编码规则，其中某些特殊字符有特殊的含义，比如 \`+\` 表示空格。当你的链接被解析时，\`+\` 被错误地解读成了空格，这就是为什么 \`sr5P8MFupYRFf+6aW/yOIw==\` 变成了 \`sr5P8MFupYRFf 6aW/yOIw==\`。 要解决这个问题，你需要对 URL 中的参数部分进行编码。你应该使用一种叫做URL编码（或百分比编码）的方法来替换掉特殊字符。在 URL 编码中，\`+\` 被编码为 \`%2B\`。所以，在生成URL的时候，应该把 \`+\` 替换为 \`%2B\`。 编码后，你的链接应该是这样的： \`\`\` http://10.52.1.4:8766/public/khxx?acceptanceCustomerIds=sr5P8MFupYRFf%2B6aW%2FyOIw%3D%3D&acceptanceCustomerIds=w%2FaJcklX9jwzYwGu6FRCOA%3D%3D \`\`\` 注意\`+\`变成了\`%2B\`，\`/\`变成了\`%2F\`，因为\`/\`也是一个需要经过URL编码的特殊字符。而且，\`=\`在一些情况下也可能需要编码（\`=\`编码为\`%3D\`）。 服务端接收到编码过的URL后，会进行自动解码，因此最终会得到正确的值 \`sr5P8MFupYRFf+6aW/yOIw==\`。确保在客户端生成URL时正确编码，以及服务端正确解码，就可以避免这种问题。"},{"instruction":"public String generateLink(List<String> idList) { StringBuilder linkBuilder = new StringBuilder(); linkBuilder.append(\\"http://\\").append(IP_ADDRESS).append(\\":8766/public/khxx?\\"); for (String id : idList) { // String encryptedId = encrypt(id, this.SECRET_KEY); String encryptedId = encrypt(id, secretKey); linkBuilder.append(\\"acceptanceCustomerIds=\\").append(encryptedId).append(\\"&\\"); } // 去除最后一个多余的\\"&\\"符号 linkBuilder.deleteCharAt(linkBuilder.length() - 1); return linkBuilder.toString(); } 那意思是我这个生成链接的方法，需要更改对么","output":"是的，你提供的 \`generateLink\` 方法中在拼接 query 参数时未对参数值进行 URL 编码，这可能造成某些特殊字符（比如 \`+\`）在传输过程中被错误解释。你应该在将加密后的ID拼接到URL之前，对每个 \`encryptedId\` 进行URL编码。 Java 中可以使用 \`URLEncoder\` 这个类来对字符串进行URL编码，一般使用UTF-8字符集来进行编码。以下是你的代码示例进行了一点修改来完成这个工作。 \`\`\`java import java.net.URLEncoder; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException; public String generateLink(List<String> idList) { StringBuilder linkBuilder = new StringBuilder(); linkBuilder.append(\\"http://\\").append(IP_ADDRESS).append(\\":8766/public/khxx?\\"); for (String id : idList) { // String encryptedId = encrypt(id, this.SECRET_KEY); String encryptedId = encrypt(id, secretKey); // 对加密后的ID进行URL编码 try { String encodedId = URLEncoder.encode(encryptedId, StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString()); linkBuilder.append(\\"acceptanceCustomerIds=\\").append(encodedId).append(\\"&\\"); } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) { // 这里你可以处理编码错误，UTF-8不支持的情况极其罕见 e.printStackTrace(); } } // 去除最后一个多余的\\"&\\"符号 if (linkBuilder.length() > 0 && linkBuilder.charAt(linkBuilder.length() - 1) == '&') { linkBuilder.deleteCharAt(linkBuilder.length() - 1); } return linkBuilder.toString(); } \`\`\` 在上面的代码中，\`try-catch\` 用来捕捉可能的 \`UnsupportedEncodingException\`。虽然使用UTF-8编码时通常不会遇到这个异常，但是最好还是处理一下异常。另外，我对最后一个 \`&\` 符号的检查做了一点改进，确保只在字符串的末尾才去除最后一个 \`&\` 符号。 使用这种方式编码后，你应该能获取一个正确编码的URL，服务端接收后也能正确解析参数。"},{"instruction":"2023-12-18 14:28:47 ERROR http-nio-8766-exec-2 cc.mrbird.febs.common.handler.GlobalExceptionHandler 系统内部异常，异常信息 org.mybatis.spring.MyBatisSystemException: nested exception is org.apache.ibatis.type.TypeException: Could not set parameters for mapping: ParameterMapping{property='acceptanceCustomerId', mode=IN, javaType=class java.lang.String, jdbcType=null, numericScale=null, resultMapId='null', jdbcTypeName='null', expression='null'}.

} \`\`\` 确认以下几点以避免错误： - Mapper XML 文件中 \`<update>\` 标签内的 SQL 语句应该和数据库中的列名精确匹配。比如，如果数据库中的列名是 \`acceptance_customer_id\` 而不是 \`acceptance_Customer_Id\`，SQL 语句中也应该是前者。 - 数据库表列名通常是大小写不敏感的，但在某些数据库配置中（特别是在 Unix 和 Linux 系统中，如果启用了大小写敏感选项），列名可能是大小写敏感的。请根据需要进行调整。 - 你的 Java 方法 \`updateStatus\` 调用正确传入 \`Long\` 和 \`String\` 类型的参数，如之前你提到的代码示例所做的。 只要上述所有的点都正确无误，MyBatis 应该能够处理好对应的类型并执行更新操作。"},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\" xmlns:th=\\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Customer Information</title> <style> body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

Типичная формула для расчета пробега до КЗ: d_КЗ = (R_КЗ * L) / (2 * sqrt(GMT)) Где: d_КЗ - допустимый пробег линии до границы КЗ (в метрах), R_КЗ - сопротивление, связанное с коротким замыканием (в Омах), L - индуктивность линии (в Гн/м), G - проводимость линии (в См/м), MT - взаимная индуктивность двух проводов на единицу длины линии (в Гн/м). Однако, для точного расчета допустимого пробега линии до границы КЗ необходимо учитывать еще множество других параметров и факторов, таких как электрические свойства проводников и изоляции, конструкция линии, рабочая частота и т.д."},{"instruction":"74.251940 25 50,8 47,6 1,066667 23,4375 70 111.398337 25 51 46,9 1,366667 18,29268 70 148.571378 25 51,3 46,7 1,533333 16,30435 70 259.948955 25 51,4 45,1 2,1 11,90476 70 334.103325 25 50,8 44,5 2,1 11,90476 70 371.192352 25 51,1 43,7 2,466667 10,13514 70 408.392352 25 51,5 43,3 2,733333 9,146341 70 445.579383 25 50,7 43,1 2,533333 9,868421 70 482.591687 25 51,3 42,7 2,866667 8,72093 70 484.595345 25 51 42,5 2,833333 8,823529 70 494.794015 25 51,4 42,5 2,966667 8,426966 70 511.506983 25 50,8 41,5 3,1 8,064516 70 519.801663 25 51,1 40 3,7 6,756757 70 528.096675 25 51 39 4 6,25 70 556.891687 25 50,7 38,9 3,933333 6,355932 70 593.892352 25 51,4 38,5 4,3 5,813953 70 631.208313 25 51,6 37,5 4,7 5,319149 70 668.293350 25 50,9 34 5,633333 4,43787 70 705.507315 25 51,3 33,5 5,933333 4,213483 70 742.722220 25 51,4 33,4 6 4,166667 70 779.594015 25 51,5 33 6,166667 4,054054 70 816.703990 25 50,7 32,8 5,966667 4,189944 70 853.897340 25 50,7 32,6 6,033333 4,143646 70 891.293405 25 51,1 31 6,7 3,731343 70 928.103325 25 50,9 30,9 6,666667 3,75 70 965.296342 25 51,2 30,7 6,833333 3,658537 70 1002.401330 25 50 30 6,666667 3,75 70 1150.905320 25 48,8 28,7 6,7 3,731343 70 1188.203990 25 47,7 26,5 7,066667 3,537736 70 1225.199667 25 46,4 26,4 6,666667 3,75 70 1262.202328 25 45 22,6 7,466667 3,348214 70 1447.895677 25 42 16,6 8,466667 2,952756 70 74.251940 25 50,8 47,6 1,066667 23,4375 70 111.398337 25 51 46,9 1,366667 18,29268 70 148.571378 25 51,3 46,7 1,533333 16,30435 70 259.948955 25 51,4 45,1 2,1 11,90476 70 334.103325 25 50,8 44,5 2,1 11,90476 70 371.192352 25 51,1 43,7 2,466667 10,13514 70 408.392352 25 51,5 43,3 2,733333 9,146341 70 445.579383 25 50,7 43,1 2,533333 9,868421 70 482.591687 25 51,3 42,7 2,866667 8,72093 70 484.595345 25 51 42,5 2,833333 8,823529 70 494.794015 25 51,4 42,5 2,966667 8,426966 70 511.506983 25 50,8 41,5 3,1 8,064516 70 519.801663 25 51,1 40 3,7 6,756757 70 528.096675 25 51 39 4 6,25 70 556.891687 25 50,7 38,9 3,933333 6,355932 70 593.892352 25 51,4 38,5 4,3 5,813953 70 631.208313 25 51,6 37,5 4,7 5,319149 70 668.293350 25 50,9 34 5,633333 4,43787 70 705.507315 25 51,3 33,5 5,933333 4,213483 70 742.722220 25 51,4 33,4 6 4,166667 70 779.594015 25 51,5 33 6,166667 4,054054 70 816.703990 25 50,7 32,8 5,966667 4,189944 70 853.897340 25 50,7 32,6 6,033333 4,143646 70 891.293405 25 51,1 31 6,7 3,731343 70 928.103325 25 50,9 30,9 6,666667 3,75 70 965.296342 25 51,2 30,7 6,833333 3,658537 70 1002.401330 25 50 30 6,666667 3,75 70 1150.905320 25 48,8 28,7 6,7 3,731343 70 1188.203990 25 47,7 26,5 7,066667 3,537736 70 1225.199667 25 46,4 26,4 6,666667 3,75 70 1262.202328 25 45 22,6 7,466667 3,348214 70 1447.895677 25 42 16,6 8,466667 2,952756 70 заполни таблицу случайными, но похожими по зависимости цифрами","output":"К сожалению, я не могу создать случайные числа, но я могу помочь вам заполнить таблицу зависимостями, которые будут выглядеть реалистично.

This baryon has a total charmness of +2, as each charm quark has a charmness of +1, and the strange quark has a charmness of 0. It also has a strangeness of -1, since the strange quark has a strangeness of -1 and the charm quarks have a strangeness of 0. The Ξccs baryon has a strong interaction and is therefore a stable particle. Its mass is approximately 3.6 GeV/c², making it much heavier than a proton or a neutron. The presence of the two charm quarks makes the Ξccs baryon an interesting particle to study in particle physics. Its existence was only confirmed in 2017 by the LHCb experiment at CERN, and it provides important insights into the behavior and properties of quarks and the strong nuclear force."},{"instruction":"Describe planet made of ccs baryons and muons","output":"A hypothetical planet made entirely of doubly charmed strange (ccs) baryons and muons would be an extremely exotic and unusual celestial body. Let's explore some of its characteristics. 1. Composition: The planet would consist mainly of Ξccs baryons, which are made up of two charm quarks and one strange quark. These baryons would form the planet's solid structure. Muons, which are elementary particles similar to electrons but much heavier, would also be present on the planet. 2. Mass and Density: The presence of ccs baryons and muons would make the planet incredibly dense and heavy. The mass of a Ξccs baryon is around 3.6 GeV/c², much larger than the mass of a proton or neutron. Muons have a mass of about 106 MeV/c². The combined mass and high density would result in a strong gravitational pull. 3. Magnetic Fields: Muons have a magnetic moment, which means they interact with magnetic fields. The presence of muons on the planet would likely result in the generation of strong magnetic fields, which could have interesting effects on the planet's environment and interactions with other celestial bodies. 4. Stability: The Ξccs baryons are stable particles due to the strong interaction. However, muons have a relatively short lifetime before decaying into other particles. The planet would need a continuous source of muons to maintain their population over time. 5. Radiation: Muons are highly penetrating particles that can traverse matter easily. The presence of muons on the planet would result in a significant background radiation level, which could pose challenges for any potential life forms. It's important to note that the existence of such a planet is purely speculative and goes beyond current understanding and knowledge of particle physics. As of now, no such planet has been observed or detected. However, considering the unique and fascinating properties of these particles, further exploration and research into their behavior could lead to exciting discoveries in the future."},{"instruction":"74.251940 25 50,8 47,6 1,066667 23,4375 70 111.398337 25 51 46,9 1,366667 18,29268 70 148.571378 25 51,3 46,7 1,533333 16,30435 70 259.948955 25 51,4 45,1 2,1 11,90476 70 334.103325 25 50,8 44,5 2,1 11,90476 70 371.192352 25 51,1 43,7 2,466667 10,13514 70 408.392352 25 51,5 43,3 2,733333 9,146341 70 445.579383 25 50,7 43,1 2,533333 9,868421 70 482.591687 25 51,3 42,7 2,866667 8,72093 70 484.595345 25 51 42,5 2,833333 8,823529 70 494.794015 25 51,4 42,5 2,966667 8,426966 70 511.506983 25 50,8 41,5 3,1 8,064516 70 519.801663 25 51,1 40 3,7 6,756757 70 528.096675 25 51 39 4 6,25 70 556.891687 25 50,7 38,9 3,933333 6,355932 70 593.892352 25 51,4 38,5 4,3 5,813953 70 631.208313 25 51,6 37,5 4,7 5,319149 70 668.293350 25 50,9 34 5,633333 4,43787 70 705.507315 25 51,3 33,5 5,933333 4,213483 70 742.722220 25 51,4 33,4 6 4,166667 70 779.594015 25 51,5 33 6,166667 4,054054 70 816.703990 25 50,7 32,8 5,966667 4,189944 70 853.897340 25 50,7 32,6 6,033333 4,143646 70 891.293405 25 51,1 31 6,7 3,731343 70 928.103325 25 50,9 30,9 6,666667 3,75 70 965.296342 25 51,2 30,7 6,833333 3,658537 70 1002.401330 25 50 30 6,666667 3,75 70 1150.905320 25 48,8 28,7 6,7 3,731343 70 1188.203990 25 47,7 26,5 7,066667 3,537736 70 1225.199667 25 46,4 26,4 6,666667 3,75 70 1262.202328 25 45 22,6 7,466667 3,348214 70 1447.895677 25 42 16,6 8,466667 2,952756 70 74.251940 25 50,8 47,6 1,066667 23,4375 70 111.398337 25 51 46,9 1,366667 18,29268 70 148.571378 25 51,3 46,7 1,533333 16,30435 70 259.948955 25 51,4 45,1 2,1 11,90476 70 334.103325 25 50,8 44,5 2,1 11,90476 70 371.192352 25 51,1 43,7 2,466667 10,13514 70 408.392352 25 51,5 43,3 2,733333 9,146341 70 445.579383 25 50,7 43,1 2,533333 9,868421 70 482.591687 25 51,3 42,7 2,866667 8,72093 70 484.595345 25 51 42,5 2,833333 8,823529 70 494.794015 25 51,4 42,5 2,966667 8,426966 70 511.506983 25 50,8 41,5 3,1 8,064516 70 519.801663 25 51,1 40 3,7 6,756757 70 528.096675 25 51 39 4 6,25 70 556.891687 25 50,7 38,9 3,933333 6,355932 70 593.892352 25 51,4 38,5 4,3 5,813953 70 631.208313 25 51,6 37,5 4,7 5,319149 70 668.293350 25 50,9 34 5,633333 4,43787 70 705.507315 25 51,3 33,5 5,933333 4,213483 70 742.722220 25 51,4 33,4 6 4,166667 70 779.594015 25 51,5 33 6,166667 4,054054 70 816.703990 25 50,7 32,8 5,966667 4,189944 70 853.897340 25 50,7 32,6 6,033333 4,143646 70 891.293405 25 51,1 31 6,7 3,731343 70 928.103325 25 50,9 30,9 6,666667 3,75 70 965.296342 25 51,2 30,7 6,833333 3,658537 70 1002.401330 25 50 30 6,666667 3,75 70 1150.905320 25 48,8 28,7 6,7 3,731343 70 1188.203990 25 47,7 26,5 7,066667 3,537736 70 1225.199667 25 46,4 26,4 6,666667 3,75 70 1262.202328 25 45 22,6 7,466667 3,348214 70 1447.895677 25 42 16,6 8,466667 2,952756 70 Заполни цифрами, которые будут выглядеть реалистично","output":"74.251940 25 50.8 47.6 1.066667 23.4375 70 111.398337 25 51 46.9 1.366667 18.29268 70 148.571378 25 51.3 46.7 1.533333 16.30435 70 259.948955 25 51.4 45.1 2.1 11.90476 70 334.103325 25 50.8 44.5 2.1 11.90476 70 371.192352 25 51.1 43.7 2.466667 10.13514 70 408.392352 25 51.5 43.3 2.733333 9.146341 70 445.579383 25 50.7 43.1 2.533333 9.868421 70 482.591687 25 51.3 42.7 2.866667 8.72093 70 484.595345 25 51 42.5 2.833333 8.823529 70 494.794015 25 51.4 42.5 2.966667 8.426966 70 511.506983 25 50.8 41.5 3.1 8.064516 70 519.801663 25 51.1 40 3.7 6.756757 70 528.096675 25 51 39 4 6.25 70 556.891687 25 50.7 38.9 3.933333 6.355932 70 593.892352 25 51.4 38.5 4.3 5.813953 70 631.208313 25 51.6 37.5 4.7 5.319149 70 668.293350 25 50.9 34 5.633333 4.43787 70 705.507315 25 51.3 33.5 5.933333 4.213483 70 742.722220 25 51.4 33.4 6 4.166667 70 779.594015 25 51.5 33 6.166667 4.054054 70 816.703990 25 50.7 32.8 5.966667 4.189944 70 853.897340 25 50.7 32.6 6.033333 4.143646 70 891.293405 25 51.1 31 6.7 3.731343 70 928.103325 25 50.9 30.9 6.666667 3.75 70 965.296342 25 51.2 30.7 6.833333 3.658537 70 1002.401330 25 50 30 6.666667 3.75 70 1150.905320 25 48.8 28.7 6.7 3.731343 70 1188.203990 25 47.7 26.5 7.066667 3.537736 70 1225.199667 25 46.4 26.4 6.666667 3.75 70 1262.202328 25 45 22.6 7.466667 3.348214 70 1447.895677 25 42 16.6 8.466667 2.952756 70"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

With a sleek, grey plumage adorned with deep black streaks, it almost seems as if the Edgegull has walked straight out of the shadows onto the shore. One of the defining characteristics of the Edgegull is its brooding and mysterious air, which earns it the name \\"Edgelord's Seagull.\\" It carries an aura of cool detachment, much like an edgelord, never fully engaging with the rest of its seagull counterparts. The bird often perches on isolated spots, keeping a watchful eye on its surroundings, as if always ready for the opportunity to showcase its edginess. The Edgegull possesses a sharp beak that matches its edgy persona. Unlike other seagulls that may scavenge for food scraps, it prefers to go after more unconventional prey, seeking out fish or small crustaceans that reside in the depths of the ocean. It is a skilled hunter, capable of swift dives and precise strikes, reflecting its dark and calculated nature. In addition to its physical attributes, the Edgegull's call sets it apart from its seagull counterparts. Instead of the usual raucous squawking associated with seagulls, the Edgegull emits a low, haunting cry. It pierces through the air with an almost melancholic quality, echoing its enigmatic and brooding personality. Despite its edgy exterior, the Edgegull is not entirely aloof. It forms complex social structures among its kind, often congregating in secretive groups along the coastline. These gatherings are characterized by silent contemplation and occasional disagreements, highlighting the internal turmoil that lies beneath the surface. The Edgegull serves as a reminder that there is always a hint of mystery lurking in even the most ordinary creatures. Its enigmatic nature and striking appearance have captured the imagination of observers, making it a captivating subject of study and an emblem of the edgy and mysterious avian world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Each type of communication serves different purposes and can be used in various settings. Let's briefly discuss each type: 1. Verbal Communication: This is communication that involves speaking or using words. It can be face-to-face or over the phone, and can be formal or informal. Verbal communication allows for immediate feedback and clarification, and it involves the use of spoken language to convey messages, ideas, or instructions. 2. Nonverbal Communication: This refers to communication that occurs without the use of words. It includes facial expressions, body language, gestures, eye contact, and even the tone of voice. Nonverbal communication can often convey more meaning than verbal communication and is important in understanding emotions, attitudes, and intentions. 3. Written Communication: This type of communication involves using written words to convey information. It includes emails, letters, reports, memos, text messages, and so on. Written communication provides a permanent record of information and allows for more careful and precise expression of ideas. However, it lacks immediate feedback and clarification that verbal communication provides. These types of communication are all essential for effective interaction and understanding in personal, professional, and social contexts. The choice of communication method depends on the situation, the message being conveyed, and the preferences of the individuals involved."},{"instruction":"write a code for discord bot to automatically send a message in eevery 3 hrs and 5 mins in a specific channel of a guild","output":"To create a Discord bot that sends a message in a specific channel every 3 hours and 5 minutes, you'll need to use a Discord API library for your programming language of choice (like discord.py for Python, discord.js for JavaScript, etc.). Below, I'll provide an example using discord.py, a popular Python library for Discord bot development. Keep in mind that this code is just a basic template and may need to be adapted based on your specific use case and environment. First, ensure you have discord.py library installed. You can install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install -U discord.py \`\`\` Here's the Python bot code: \`\`\`python import discord import asyncio from datetime import timedelta # The ID of the channel you want to send messages to CHANNEL_ID = 123456789012345678 # Replace with your channel ID # The interval for sending the message (3 hours and 5 minutes) MESSAGE_INTERVAL = timedelta(hours=3, minutes=5).total_seconds() class MyClient(discord.Client): async def on_ready(self): print('Logged on as', self.user) await self.send_message_periodically() async def send_message_periodically(self): await self.wait_until_ready() channel = self.get_channel(CHANNEL_ID) if not channel: print(f\\"Could not find channel with ID {CHANNEL_ID}\\") return while not self.is_closed(): try: # Your message content here message_content = \\"This is an automated message sent every 3 hours and 5 minutes!\\" await channel.send(message_content) print(f\\"Sent message to {channel.name} in {channel.guild.name}\\") except discord.Forbidden: print(f\\"Do not have permission to send messages in {channel.name} in {channel.guild.name}\\") except discord.HTTPException as e: print(f\\"Failed to send message due to HTTPException: {e}\\") # Wait for next interval await asyncio.sleep(MESSAGE_INTERVAL) # Your bot token TOKEN = 'your-bot-token' # Replace with your bot's token intents = discord.Intents.default() intents.messages = True client = MyClient(intents=intents) client.run(TOKEN) \`\`\` Replace \`CHANNEL_ID\` with the ID of the channel you want the bot to send messages to, and \`TOKEN\` with the Discord bot token that you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal. This code sets up a Discord client that sends an automated message every 3 hours and 5 minutes. Be sure to handle proper permissions and exception handling (such as reconnection on disconnects) depending on the requirements of your bot and Discord's rate limits. To obtain a token: 1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers). 2. Create a new Application. 3. Under the \\"Bot\\" section of your application settings, create a new bot. 4. Reveal and copy your bot's token but make sure to keep it secret. To invite the bot to your guild: 1. In the Discord Developer Portal, navigate to the \\"OAuth2\\" section of your application settings. 2. Under \\"SCOPES,\\" select \\"bot.\\" 3. Choose the appropriate permissions for your bot under \\"BOT PERMISSIONS.\\" 4. Use the generated invite link to invite your bot to your Discord guild. Remember, the provided code is a simple example, and creating a Discord bot that interacts with the Discord API over an extended period can require more complex error handling and abiding by Discord's terms of service and rate limits."},{"instruction":"Do spammers use the cards they get from phishing to fund their operation ir do they just sell it?

Ultimately, it depends on the specific methods and motivations of the individual spammers."},{"instruction":"If they dont use tbe cards, how do they fund it appart from the money of selling the cards?","output":"Aside from the money obtained from selling stolen credit card information, spammers have several other ways to fund their operations. Some common methods include: 1. Affiliate programs: Spammers might participate in affiliate programs where they earn a commission for every sale or lead generated through their spamming efforts. These programs can be based on promoting various products or services. 2. Advertisements and click fraud: Spammers may earn money by displaying ads on their websites or in their emails. They might also engage in click fraud, where they manipulate or artificially generate clicks on advertisements to increase revenue. 3. Illegal activities: Spammers might be involved in other illegal activities, such as distributing malware, running scams, or engaging in fraud. These activities can generate illicit funds that can be used to finance their spamming operations. 4. Botnets and cybercrime: Spammers may operate botnets, which are networks of infected computers controlled remotely. They can use these botnets to conduct various cybercrimes, including distributing spam, launching DDoS attacks, or engaging in identity theft. The profits from such activities can be used to fund their spamming operations. 5. Cashing out: Spammers may also cash out their illicit earnings by converting them into cryptocurrencies or using other methods to launder money, making it harder to trace the funds back to their spamming activities. It's important to remember that spamming and related activities are illegal, and these methods are utilized by individuals involved in criminal operations."},{"instruction":"// Wrap the entire content inside an async function (async () => { // Function to initialize the contract async function initializeContract() { try { if (window.ethereum) { const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts', }); userAddress = accounts[0]; console.log('MetaMask is activated'); console.log('Wallet Address:', userAddress); // Initialize the contractInstance contractInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress); console.log('Contract initialized:', contractInstance); const addr = web3.utils.toChecksumAddress(userAddress); getAllAvailableChickens(); // Call the function to set the prices updateChickenPrices(); // NEW: Load and display the user's current state loadAndDisplayUserState(userAddress); // Display prices for each chicken during initialization displayAllChickenPrices(); // NEW: Start automatic refresh for golden eggs and chickens // refreshAllData(); return true; // Indicates successful initialization } else { console.error('MetaMask is not installed.'); throw new Error('MetaMask is not installed.'); } } catch (error) { console.error('Error during contract initialization:', error); throw error; } } // Call initializeContract in your document ready event document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function () { try { const isInitialized = await initializeContract(); if (isInitialized) { // Access elements and perform actions dependent on contract initialization const displayElement = document.getElementById('displayVIPInfo'); console.log('Display Element:', displayElement); if (displayElement) { // Await the completion of recognizeUserVIPs before proceeding await recognizeUserVIPs(userAddress, 'displayVIPInfo'); // Call the function to handle button click or content generation handleButtonClick(); // Debugging: Check if the element exists before updating console.log('Before getElementById'); const totalEggsElement = document.getElementById('totalGoldenEggs'); console.log('After getElementById'); if (totalEggsElement) { console.log('Element found:', totalEggsElement); totalEggsElement.textContent = \`Total Golden Eggs: {allGoldenEggInfo}\`; } else { console.error('Total golden eggs element not found.'); } } else { console.error('Display element is null.

The code seems to have been extracted from a larger application; it includes functions for initializing the contract, updating displays, and handling user interactions, among other things. However, at the end of the post, two main error messages are logged to the console: 1. \`Error in recognizeUserVIPs (inner try block): Error: One or both elements not found.\` - This error indicates that the function \`recognizeUserVIPs\` is trying to access one or both HTML elements (\`goldencuteChickenQtyElement\` and \`goldencuteEggsQtyElement\`) that do not exist in the DOM at the time of execution. This could be due to those elements not being present or perhaps their IDs have been misspelled. 2. \`Error during initialization: ReferenceError: handleButtonClick is not defined\` - This error is thrown because the function \`handleButtonClick\` is called, but it has not been defined anywhere in the provided code. This is likely a placeholder for a function you intended to write but did not include in the code snippet. To resolve these issues: 1. Ensure that the HTML elements are correctly spelled and exist on the page before they are accessed in your JavaScript code. 2. Define the \`handleButtonClick\` function, or remove the call to it if it's not supposed to be there. Also, remember to closely check your code for additional syntax errors or logical issues that might prevent it from executing as intended, as the provided snippet seems to be a part of a larger application and relies on multiple functions and elements that may or may not exist in the full context of the application."},{"instruction":"what is today's date","output":"I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have access to current real-time data, including the current date.

While Locke is famous for his defense of individual rights and the concept of government based on the consent of the governed, it is documented that he had investments in the English slave trade, particularly through his involvement in the Royal African Company, which was involved in the transatlantic slave trade. Some historians suggest Locke's involvement with slavery stemmed from the prevailing views of his time, in which slavery was a widely accepted institution, particularly in the context of colonial expansion and economic growth. Locke's theoretical approach to slavery was somewhat complex and not entirely free from contradictions: 1. Locke's investments: Locke held shares in companies involved in the slave trade, thereby profiting from it. 2. Political roles and policies: As part of his role in the English government, Locke contributed to or complied with policies that supported the slave trade and colonial expansion. For example, as a secretary to the Lords Proprietors of the Carolinas, Locke helped draft the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, which included provisions for the establishment of slavery as a legal institution. 3. Philosophical contradictions: In his writings, particularly in the \\"Two Treatises of Government,\\" Locke argued that all humans have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. However, these views were not entirely consistent with his involvement in or lack of explicit condemnation of the slave trade. The contrast between Locke's philosophical principles and his acceptance or facilitation of slavery can be seen as a reflection of the broader inconsistencies present in Enlightenment thought, where the rhetoric of universal rights often coexisted with discriminatory practices based on race, class, and gender. It is important to note that many historical figures are complex and can hold conflicting beliefs and actions. The moral and ethical lens through which we view historical figures often evolves over time, and the full legacy of individuals such as John Locke includes recognition of their contributions to philosophy and political thought, as well as critical examination of their complicity in or active involvement in unjust practices like slavery."},{"instruction":"siemano","output":"Witaj! Jak mogę Ci pomóc?"},{"instruction":"napiš příběh o sestrách které se spolu polbí francouzský polbek","output":"Na kraji starobylého městečka Plouescat ve francouzské Bretani stála dřevěná chaloupka obklopená rozkvetlým zahradou. V této chaloupce žily dvě sestry, jménem Amélie a Sophie. Obě byly známé daleko široko pro svou krásu, ale ještě více pro svou nerozlučnou sesterskou lásku, která byla opravdová a bezmezná. Jednoho jarního dne, když růže rozkvetly a celá krajina plynula v tónech zlaté a růžové, se Amélie a Sophie vydaly na piknik do nedalekého lesa. Usadily se na zelený samet trávy pod rozložitým dubem a rozložily své pochutiny: čerstvý baget, sýr camembert a jahody tak sladké, jako by byly polibkem samotného slunce. Pikniku vládla radost a smích, dokud Sophie neošklivě pokousala včela. Začala plakat, malý pupínek se rychle objevil na jejím červenajícím se líčku. Amélie, srdce plné starostí, vzala Sophii do náručí a snažila se ji utěšit. \\"Neboj se, Sophie,\\" řekla tiše Amélie. \\"Já ti pomohu.\\" Amélie vzala Sophii za ruku a přivedla ji ke studánce, která prýskala studenou, čistou vodou. Opatrně napustila dlaně vodou a přiložila je ke Sophiemu líčku, aby uklidnila bolest. Pak, jak se těší zuby, co jemně šimraly jejich chodidla, se usmála a pohlédla své sestře do očí s čirým porozuměním a láskou. \\"Sestřičko, udělej jsem co chceš, ale prosím, nebuď smutná. Tvůj smích je pro mě jako třpytění hvězd,\\" pronesla Amélie. Sophie, její oči stále vlhké od slz, ale už se začínající usmívat, kývla. \\"Jsem v pořádku, díky tobě. Ale ráda bych něco udělala, abych ti ukázala, jak moc si tě vážím.\\" A tak se ty dvě sestry, v hlubině lesa, stočily jedna kolem druhé a učinily slib. Slíbily, že nezáleží na tom, co život přinese, budou vždy jedna pro druhou jako maják v bouři, jako růže v trní. A tehdy, v ten okamžik, se Sophie otočila k Amélie a dala jí na líčko malý, jemný polibek – tak sladký a něžný, že všechna bolest od včelího štípnutí jakoby zmizela. To byl francouzský polibek, jaký byste našli jen mezi dvěma sestrami, které by pro sebe udělaly cokoli. Polibek, který byl nejenže ozdravný, ale i symbol lásky a sesterského pouta, které nemůže nikdy nic narušit."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function P(n,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
