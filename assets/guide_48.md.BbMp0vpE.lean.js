The coordinates of P would either be (-c, frac {b^{2}}{a}) or (-c,- frac {b^{2}}{a}), but since P is above the x-axis, we choose the positive y-coordinate. From the property of an ellipse, the distance between the foci is 2c, and since the angle at P is 60^{circ}, we can form an equilateral triangle with the line segment F_{1}P and PF_{2} being two of its sides. Therefore, the distance PF_{2} is equal to F_{1}P, which is the perpendicular from F_1 to P on the ellipse.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Applying the Functional Equation for Integers:**    Let's use the functional equation given in (b). For any integer k, we write:    [    f(k cdot x) = k cdot f(x)    ]        - **Proof by Mathematical Induction:**      - **Base case:** For (k = 1), clearly (f(1 cdot x) = f(x)), which holds true.      - **Inductive step:** Assume (f(n cdot x) = n cdot f(x)) holds for some integer (n). For (n + 1), apply the functional equation:        [        f((n + 1) cdot x) = f(n cdot x + x) = f(n cdot x) + f(x) = n cdot f(x) + f(x) = (n + 1) cdot f(x)        ]      By induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers (n). For negative integers, note:      [      f(-n cdot x) + f(n cdot x) = f(0) Rightarrow -n cdot f(x) + n cdot f(x) = 0 Rightarrow f(-n cdot x) = -n cdot f(x)      ]      Therefore, (f(k cdot x) = k cdot f(x)) holds for all integers (k). 2. **Finding (f(0))**:    We apply the functional equation to x_1 = x and x_2 = 0:    [    f(x + 0) = f(x) + f(0) Rightarrow f(x) = f(x) + f(0) Rightarrow f(0) = 0    ] 3. **Extension to Rational Numbers:**    Suppose r is a rational number such that r = frac{k}{m}, where k and m are integers and m neq 0. Using the functional equation, we get:    [    k cdot f(x) = f(k cdot x) = fleft(m cdot left(frac{k}{m} xright)right) = m cdot fleft(frac{k}{m} xright)    ]    Dividing both sides by m:    [    fleft(frac{k}{m} cdot xright) = frac{k}{m} cdot f(x)    ]    Thus, for any rational number (r):    [    f(r cdot x) = r cdot f(x)    ]    Applying this to (f(1)), we get:    [    f(r) = r quad text{for all rational } r    ] 4. **Extension to Irrational Numbers Using Boundedness:**    Let (x_0) be an irrational number, and suppose (f(x)) is bounded in the interval ((a, b)). For any rational number (r), there exists some real number (t) such that:    [    t r in (a, b) quad text{and} quad r x_0 + t r in mathbb{Q}    ]    Using the functional equation:    [    f(r x_0 + t r) = f(r x_0) + f(t r) Rightarrow r x_0 + t r = r f(x_0) + f(t r)    ]    Simplifying, we have:    [    t r - f(t r) = r (f(x_0) - x_0)    ]    Since (r) can be arbitrarily large and the left side is bounded, the expression can only hold if:    [    f(x_0) = x_0    ]    Therefore, the condition must hold for all real numbers (x), implying:    [    f(x) = x    ] **Conclusion:** The only function that satisfies all given conditions is: [  boxed{f(x) = x}  ]"},{"instruction":"Given a moving circle C passes through point A(2,0) and is internally tangent to the circle M: (x2)^{2}+y^{2}=64, find the equation of the trajectory of the center of circle C.","output":"Solution: The center of the fixed circle M is M(2,0), with a radius r=8.

Andrew had 1 slice of toast and 2 eggs, so his breakfast cost is £1 (for the toast) + £6 (for the eggs) = £7. Together, Dale and Andrew spent £15 on their breakfast. So, the equation for the total cost is: Dale's breakfast + Andrew's breakfast = Total cost £T + £6 + £7 = £15 Now, we can solve for T: £T + £6 + £7 = £15 £T + £13 = £15 £T = £15 - £13 £T = £2 Therefore, Dale had boxed{2}  slices of toast."},{"instruction":"The coefficient of the monomial 6xy is ______.","output":"To find the coefficient of a monomial, we look at the number that is multiplied by the variables.

Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that all the given numbers (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}) are composite numbers.  2. Since each composite number must have a prime factor and given (1 < a_i < (2n-1)^2), every composite number (a_i) must have at least one prime divisor less than ((2n-1)).  3. Let (p_1, p_2, ..., p_k) be all the prime numbers less than (2n-1), where (k) is the count of such prime numbers. It is known that the number of prime numbers up to any given number (x) is around (frac{x}{log x}). 4. For (x = 2n-1), the number of prime numbers ( pi(2n-1) ) can be approximated by ( frac{2n-1}{log(2n-1)} ). But more importantly, we know (k < 2n-1). 5. Given that these primes must include all divisors of the (n) composite numbers, it implies that there must be ((n+1)) or more distinct prime divisors which each (a_i) can have one of. 6. By the given condition, (a_{i}) and (a_{j}) (for (i ne j)) are pairwise coprime, implying no two numbers can share a prime factor.  7. However, there can only be at most (n-1) primes less than (2n-1) (since this number is greater than the value of prime count). 8.

Billy has 2 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes, so the total number of coins can be represented as: 2Q + 3D = 20 Since we have only one equation but two unknowns, we need more information to find a unique solution. However, we can try to find all possible combinations of Q and D that satisfy the equation. Let's start by assuming the smallest possible number of coins in a pile is 1. We can then incrementally increase the number of coins in a pile and check if the total adds up to 20. 1. If Q = 1, then 2Q = 2, and the equation becomes 2 + 3D = 20. Solving for D gives us D = (20 - 2) / 3, which is not a whole number, so this is not a valid solution. 2. If Q = 2, then 2Q = 4, and the equation becomes 4 + 3D = 20. Solving for D gives us D = (20 - 4) / 3, which is not a whole number, so this is not a valid solution. 3. If Q = 3, then 2Q = 6, and the equation becomes 6 + 3D = 20. Solving for D gives us D = (20 - 6) / 3, which is D = 14 / 3, not a whole number, so this is not a valid solution. 4. If Q = 4, then 2Q = 8, and the equation becomes 8 + 3D = 20. Solving for D gives us D = (20 - 8) / 3, which is D = 12 / 3, which is D = 4. This is a valid solution. So, if there are 4 quarters in each pile of quarters and 4 dimes in each pile of dimes, the total number of coins would be 2(4) + 3(4) = 8 + 12 = 20.

The roots can be found using the factorization method: [ x^{2}-3x+2 = (x-1)(x-2) = 0 ] This gives us the roots x = 1 and x = 2.  To determine the intervals where the inequality holds, we examine the sign of the expression in the intervals divided by the roots: - For x < 1, the expression (x-1)(x-2) is positive because both factors are negative. - For 1 < x < 2, the expression is negative because one factor is positive and the other is negative. - For x > 2, the expression is positive again because both factors are positive.

The set of values for which x < 2 includes all x values less than 2, which is a broader set than just 1 < x < 2.  Since the condition x < 2 includes more values than the solution set 1 < x < 2, it means that x < 2 is a necessary condition for x^{2}-3x+2 < 0 to hold true because without it, the inequality cannot be satisfied.

Let's start by understanding the core components and definitions: 1. **Definition and Known Properties**:    - Given a circle with a chord (AB) that intersects the circle at points (A) and (B).    - The chord (AB) divides the circle into two segments, each segment being bounded by the chord (AB) and an arc of the circle.    - According to the inscribed angle theorem, from any point on the arc that lies on one side of the chord (AB), the chord (AB) subtends the same angle. 2. **Objective**:    - We need to establish that within the segment bounded by chord (AB) and the arc, any internal point views (AB) at a larger angle compared to points that are external but on the same side of the chord.  Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Angle in the Segment**:    - We need to show that for any point (O) within the segment (the area bounded by chord (AB) and the corresponding arc), the angle ( angle AOB ) is larger than angle ( alpha ) where ( alpha ) is the angle subtended by (AB) from any point on the arc.    - Let's denote the center of the circle by (C). Draw lines (CA), (CB), and (CO). 2. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem**:    - According to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle subtended by the chord (AB) at the center is twice the angle subtended on the arc:      [      angle ACB = 2 alpha      ]    - When (O) is located inside the segment, the angle (AOB) becomes:      [      angle AOB = 180^circ - angle ACB = 180^circ - 2 alpha      ]    - Since ( angle AOB) and (2alpha) are supplementary and add up to (180^circ), this demonstrates that ( angle AOB ) is always larger than ( alpha) for any point within the segment. 3. **Outside the Circle**:    - Let’s consider any point (O') outside the circle but on the same side of the chord (AB). Points outside will subtend an angle ( angle AO'B ).    - Using a property similar to the one for internal points but applied externally, the external points will subtend a smaller angle ( alpha' ):      [      angle AO'B < alpha      ]    - This is because the external angle is limited by the outer circumferential bounds, making it consistently less than the angle subtended by the same chord within the segment.  Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude from the steps detailed above: - From any point within the segment bounded by chord (AB) and the arc, chord (AB) is visible at an angle larger than from any point external to the segment but still lying on the same side.

We know that the total number of chickens is 80, so we can write the following equation: R + H = 80  (1) We also know that only three-fourths of the hens lay eggs. This means that one-fourth of the hens do not lay eggs. Let's denote the number of hens that do not lay eggs as H_non_laying. We can write the following equation: H_non_laying = 1/4 * H  (2) We are given that there are 35 chickens that do not lay eggs. This number includes both the roosters and the non-laying hens. Therefore, we can write: R + H_non_laying = 35  (3) Now, let's substitute equation (2) into equation (3): R + 1/4 * H = 35  (4) We can now solve the system of equations (1) and (4) to find the values of R and H. From equation (1), we can express H in terms of R: H = 80 - R  (5) Now, let's substitute equation (5) into equation (4): R + 1/4 * (80 - R) = 35 Multiplying out the brackets, we get: R + 20 - 1/4 * R = 35 Combining like terms, we get: 3/4 * R + 20 = 35 Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get: 3/4 * R = 15 Now, we divide both sides by 3/4 to solve for R: R = 15 / (3/4) R = 15 * (4/3) R = 20 So, there are 20 roosters. Now, we can find the ratio of roosters to the total number of chickens: Ratio = R / Total number of chickens Ratio = 20 / 80 Ratio = 1 / 4 Therefore, the ratio of roosters to the total number of chickens is boxed{1:4} ."},{"instruction":"The graph  y=x^2+ax+b  intersects any of the two axes at points  A ,  B , and  C .

The geography teacher was very pleased and gave Ivanov a top grade. The math teacher was also pleased but instructed Ivanov to find a mistake. Why did the math teacher think Ivanov made an error?","output":"The problem involves examining the relationship between the mean, median, and variance of a set of data values recorded by a student, Ivanov. The focus is to understand why the mathematics teacher found an error in Ivanov’s calculations. The given values are: - Mean (average) temperature, bar{x} = 0 degrees Celsius. - Median temperature, m = 4 degrees Celsius. - Variance, S^2 = 15.917 (likely in squared degrees Celsius). From statistics, we know that for any numerical data set, the absolute difference between the mean and the median should generally be less than or equal to one standard deviation. Mathematically, this is expressed as: [ |bar{x} - m| leq sqrt{S^2} ] 1. **Calculation of Standard Deviation**:     [     sqrt{S^2} = sqrt{15.917} approx 3.99     ] 2. **Verification of the Inequality**:     Using the values provided:     [     |bar{x} - m| = |0 - 4| = 4     ]     We need to check if:     [     4 leq 3.99     ] 3. **Analysis**:     Clearly,      [     4 > 3.99     ]     This violates the inequality |bar{x} - m| leq sqrt{S^2}, indicating a potential error in the recorded values. 4. **Detailed Reasoning**:     To further cement why this inequality should hold true, let's prove it by considering how the variance relates to the differences from the mean.          From the definition of variance:     [     S^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar{x})^2     ]     Using triangular inequality and properties of the median, we note:     [     |bar{x} - m| = left| frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - m) right| leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - m|     ]     The mean deviation from the median cannot exceed the mean deviation from the mean:     [     frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - m| leq sqrt{ frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar{x})^2 } = sqrt{S^2}     ] 5. **Conclusion**:     Since sqrt{S^2} should logically denote the standard deviation, the presence of an inconsistency suggests one of the recorded values or the calculations was incorrect:      [     (bar{x} - m)^2 leq S^2 implies (0-4)^2 leq 15.917 implies 16 leq 15.917     ]     This incorrect inequality confirms the mathematics teacher's suspicion that Ivanov made a mistake.

Since the planet is a sphere, any plane passing through its center will intersect the sphere along a great circle (the equator if we consider the plane to be equatorial). 2. **Introduce Great Circles and Poles**:          Imagine a plane Pi passing through the center of the sphere and any pair of the asteroids. This plane can be considered as an \\"equatorial plane.\\" We'll draw an orthogonal great circle that intersects the equatorial plane perpendicularly. The points where this great circle intersects the sphere define the \\"poles\\" A and B.    3. **Count Visible Asteroids**:    The next step is key. The plane Pi, acts as an equator and divides the sphere into two hemispheres. Asteroids that lie exactly on this plane will be on the horizon and thus not visible from the poles A and B.     Important Observation:     - The plane Pi divides the asteroids into two groups, each on different hemispheres.     - Therefore, neither observer located at A nor B can view the asteroids lying precisely in plane Pi. 4. **Calculate Number of Visible Asteroids**:    Since there are 37 asteroids, and every plane Pi containing the planetary sphere's center splits these asteroids into two approximately equal groups, on average:    - Each observer at the poles A and B will not see the asteroids lying on the horizon, but will see only the group of asteroids in their respective hemisphere minus those lying on the equator. 5. **Derive the Maximum Number**:     By pigeonhole principle and symmetry:     - The total number of asteroids in the upper hemisphere plus those in the lower hemisphere exactly add up to 37.     - Consequently, neither pole can see more than leftlfloor frac{37 - 1}{2} rightrfloor asteroids in full clarity. 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, any observer located at one of these poles will be able to see, at most:    [    17 text{ asteroids}    ] Hence, there always exists at least one point on the surface of the sphere where an observer would see: [ 37 - 17 = 20 text{ asteroids or less} ] And we are essentially guaranteed that in any instance: [ 17 ast{eroids at most} ] The detailed analysis above concludes that there is always a point on the spherical surface from which an astronomer can observe at most 17 asteroids.

Let's proceed step by step: 1. **Introduction and Basic Constraints**:    - The board has a dimension of 10 times 10, which means it has 100 cells in total.    - Each ship occupies 4 cells in a row or column.    - Placement of each ship must ensure that the entire ship fits within the board boundaries. 2. **Coloring Strategy**:    - Let's use a coloring strategy to visualize and prove the maximum number of ships that can fit:      - We will color the board in 4 colors in such a way that each 4-cell segment (horizontal or vertical) contains one cell of each color.      - For instance, our pattern of colors can be repeated every 4 cells. This is illustrated in the provided image, but the general idea is to consider an alternating pattern that breaks down the board into a grid where every 4 consecutive cells across any orientation (horizontal/vertical) cover every color exactly once. 3. **Counting Cells of a Specific Color**:    - Since we use 4 colors and we have a 10 times 10 grid, there will be:      [      frac{100}{4} = 25 text{ cells of each color}      ]    - Each 1 times 4 ship will include exactly 1 cell of each color. 4. **Cell Coverage**:    - When we place a 1 times 4 ship on the board, it will cover 1 cell of each color.    - The number of ships that can be placed is limited by the number of cells of each color.  5. **Calculation of Maximum Number of Ships**:    - The key point is that each ship must occupy a unique set of 4 different-colored cells.    - Therefore, the number of ships is equal to the smallest set size of any color. 6. **Conclusion**:    - We have 25 cells of each color, and the constraint is that every group of 4 different-colored cells can form exactly one ship.    - Thus, the maximum number of 1 times 4 ships we can place on the 10 times 10 board is:       [      boxed{25}       ]  By coloring the board and ensuring that each ship uses distinct sets of colored cells without any overlap of the same color on the individual segments, it is evident that the maximum number of these ships is precisely 25."},{"instruction":"Grandma gave Bryce and Carter some raisins.

How long will it take them to reach New York?","output":"To calculate the total time it will take Jessica's family to reach New York, we need to consider both the driving time and the rest time. First, let's calculate the driving time: The family is 300 km away from New York and they are traveling at a speed of 50 km/h. To find the driving time, we divide the distance by the speed: Driving time = Distance / Speed Driving time = 300 km / 50 km/h Driving time = 6 hours Now, let's calculate the rest time: They stop to rest for 30 minutes every 2 hours. Since the total driving time is 6 hours, they will need to stop to rest 6/2 - 1 = 2 times (they don't need to rest after the last 2-hour segment because they will have reached their destination). Rest time = Number of rests * Duration of each rest Rest time = 2 * 30 minutes Rest time = 60 minutes or 1 hour Finally, we add the driving time and the rest time to find the total time to reach New York: Total time = Driving time + Rest time Total time = 6 hours + 1 hour Total time = 7 hours Jessica's family will take boxed{7}  hours to reach New York, including rest stops."},{"instruction":"Find the maximum value of the function [ g(x) = 4x  x^4 ] for ( 0 leq x leq 2 ).","output":"Firstly, find the derivative of the function to locate the critical points: [ g'(x) = 4 - 4x^3 ] Set the derivative equal to zero to solve for x: [ 4 - 4x^3 = 0 ] [ 4x^3 = 4 ] [ x^3 = 1 ] [ x = 1 ] Check the second derivative to confirm if it's a maximum at ( x = 1 ): [ g''(x) = -12x^2 ] [ g''(1) = -12 ] Since ( g''(1) < 0 ), ( x = 1 ) is a local maximum.

Therefore, the number of green ducks in the larger pond is 15% of D, which is 0.15 * D. The total number of ducks in both ponds is 20 (from the smaller pond) + D (from the larger pond). The total number of green ducks in both ponds is 4 (from the smaller pond) + 0.15D (from the larger pond). According to the problem, 16% of the total number of ducks are green.

In this configuration, the dihedral angles formed with the edges SA and SB are congruent. 3. By examining all three such solid angles, it can be observed that the sums of opposite dihedral angles of the given tetrahedral angle are equal.    This can be formalized as follows:    - Suppose the dihedral angles are alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, corresponding to the pairs (SA, SB), (SB, SC), (SC, SD), and (SD, SA) respectively.    - If the sums of the opposite dihedral angles are equal, then:    [    alpha + gamma = beta + delta    ] 4.

In each of these tetrahedral angles, the sums of opposite dihedral angles are equal. 8. From this, it would follow that in the three-faced angle complementary to the angle SD_{i}, one of the plane angles is equal to the sum of the other two (See problems 165 and 166 for the detailed argument).        - Specifically, let's denote angle SCSDi as the three-faced angle and consider its plane angles. If this holds true, one plane angle equates to the sum of the other two, leading to a contradiction since the sum of plane angles in a three-faced angle cannot exceed 180^circ. 9. Therefore, the only feasible conclusion is that SD must be a generating line of the cone. # Conclusion: The edges of the convex tetrahedral angle are the generating lines of a cone with its apex coinciding with the vertex of the angle if and only if the sums of the opposite dihedral angles of the tetrahedral angle are equal.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Beth has 72 marbles of three colors.

Beth loses 5 red marbles, so she has: 24 red marbles - 5 lost = 19 red marbles left She loses twice as many blue marbles as red, so she loses: 5 red marbles lost x 2 = 10 blue marbles lost So, she has: 24 blue marbles - 10 lost = 14 blue marbles left Now, let's see how many marbles Beth has left after losing the red and blue marbles: 19 red marbles + 14 blue marbles = 33 marbles Beth has 42 marbles left in total after losing some yellow marbles as well. Since she has 33 marbles (red and blue) accounted for, we can find out how many yellow marbles she has left by subtracting 33 from 42: 42 marbles left - 33 marbles (red and blue) = 9 yellow marbles left Originally, Beth had 24 yellow marbles. Now she has 9 left, so she must have lost: 24 yellow marbles - 9 yellow marbles left = 15 yellow marbles lost Now we can find the ratio of the number of yellow marbles lost to the number of red marbles lost: 15 yellow marbles lost : 5 red marbles lost The ratio is 15:5, which simplifies to 3:1 when divided by 5.

Nevertheless, the gardener's instructions were followed. Explain how the worker managed to cut down 39 trees.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**:     The gardener had a square garden where 49 trees were planted in a 7x7 grid. This implies there are 7 rows and 7 columns, each containing one tree, for a total of 49 trees. 2. **Instruction**:    The gardener instructed the worker to leave only 5 rows of trees, with each row containing exactly 4 trees. This means a total of (5 times 4 = 20) trees should remain. 3. **Outcome**:    However, the worker left only 10 trees, cutting down 39 trees. 4. **Verification with Diagram**:    To understand how the worker managed to follow the instruction:    Consider the grid below with trees represented by 'T' and spaces by ' ':        \`\`\`    T T T T               T T T T       T   T T   T         T T   T         T T   T T           T T T T         T T T T           \`\`\` 5. **Row Extraction**:     - **Row 1**: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)     - **Row 2**: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)     - **Row 3**: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)     - **Row 4**: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5)     - **Row 5**: (4,0), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)         Clearly, each selected row contains exactly 4 trees.     6. **Diagonal and Overlapping**:    Note that some trees are counted in multiple rows. For instance:    - The tree at (0,0) is in both the first row and the main diagonal.    - The tree at (1,2) is counted in rows 2 and 3. 7. **Count Validation**:    By reviewing the placement:    - The tree at (1,2) appears multiple times.    - Since rows are considered in a non-standard format (i.e., not purely horizontal or vertical but combination possible), overlap trees would lead to fewer than expected total trees. 8. **Conclusion**:    Thus, the worker managed to leave only 10 trees due to the overlaps in the row placements, ensuring the gardener's instruction for formation (each row containing 4 trees) was followed but with the resultant unexpected lower count due to intersecting aligns. Hence, the correct setup where 10 trees are left but fulfilling the 5 rows with 4 each condition is correctly visually shown.

Start with the given inequality based on the problem statement: [kx - 2 < 2x + 3] 2. Move terms involving x to one side to facilitate comparison: [kx - 2x < 3 + 2] [kx - 2x < 5] 3. Factor out the x to isolate the coefficient k: [x(k - 2) < 5] Since x > -1, we consider the effect of this on the inequality. For the inequality kx - 2 < 2x + 3 to hold for all x > -1, we need to ensure that the coefficient of x on the left is less than the coefficient on the right, leading to: 4. Isolate the coefficient k: [k - 2 < 0] [k < 2] However, the solution also mentions frac{5}{k-2}leqslant -1 and kneq 0, which seems to be an error in the transcription of the solution process. The correct approach from the inequality k - 2 < 0 directly leads us to the range of k without needing the fraction frac{5}{k-2}leqslant -1. The condition k neq 0 is to ensure that the function y_1 is not a constant function, which is a valid consideration but does not stem from the inequality manipulation directly.  Given k < 2, and considering the problem statement's requirement that y_1 < y_2 for x > -1, we also need to ensure that k is not equal to the slope of y_2 to maintain the inequality. Since the slope of y_2 is 2, and there's no restriction against k being equal to 2 from our inequality manipulation, we consider the entire range up to 2. Finally, considering k should not be 0 to avoid the trivial case where y_1 does not depend on x, we combine all these considerations to conclude: The range of values for k is such that k can be less than or equal to 2, greater than or equal to -3 (since there's no lower bound provided from the inequality manipulation, but we infer this from the solution's final statement), and k neq 0.

First, assume that an equilateral triangle can be inscribed into the rectangle ABCD as specified. 1. **Label the vertices and sides:**    Let the side lengths of the rectangle be a (the length from A to D) and b (the length from A to B).    Note that vertices of the equilateral triangle are A, P on side BC, and Q on side CD. 2. **Set up coordinate geometry:**    Place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with A = (0, 0), B = (b, 0), C = (b, a), and D = (0, a). This arrangement allows us to analyze the positions of P and Q. 3. **Use trigonometric relationships:**    Let d be the side length of the equilateral triangle and alpha be the angle such that the coordinates of P can be determined using rotation by 60^circ.    From point A, we can determine the coordinates of point P on BC and point Q on CD:    - P is on BC, so in terms of d and alpha, P = (d cos 30^circ, d sin 30^circ) = left(frac{d sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{d}{2}right)    - Q is on CD, so in terms of d and alpha, Q = left(frac{d cos (30^circ - alpha)}{2}, a - frac{d cos alpha}{2} right)     The primary conditions are:    - b = d cos alpha    - a = d cos (30^circ - alpha) 4. **Formulate the ratio of the sides:**    We need to consider the ratio frac{a}{b}:        [    frac{a}{b} = frac{cos (30^circ - alpha)}{cos alpha}    ]        Using the trigonometric identity for cosine of a difference, we have:    [    cos (30^circ - alpha) = cos 30^circ cos alpha + sin 30^circ sin alpha    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{cos (30^circ - alpha)}{cos alpha} = frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos alpha + frac{1}{2} sin alpha}{cos alpha}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{a}{b} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{1}{2} cdot tan alpha    ] 5. **Determine the range for tan alpha:**    Given 0 leq alpha leq 30^circ, then 0 leq tan alpha leq frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. 6. **Establish the inequality:**    Using the bounds for tan alpha, we get:    [    frac{sqrt{3}}{2} leq frac{a}{b} leq frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}    ]    Thus:    [    frac{sqrt{3}}{2} leq frac{a}{b} leq frac{2}{sqrt{3}}    ]    If the ratio frac{a}{b} satisfies this inequality, then an equilateral triangle can be inscribed in the specified manner within the rectangle ABCD. # Conclusion: For an equilateral triangle to be inscribed within the rectangle ABCD with one vertex at A and the other two on sides BC and CD, the ratio of the sides of the rectangle must satisfy: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{2} leq frac{a}{b} leq frac{2}{sqrt{3}} ] [ boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} leq frac{a}{b} leq frac{2}{sqrt{3}}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} with its first term a_1 = frac{2}{3}, and the recursive formula a_{n+1} = frac{2a_n}{a_n + 1} for n = 1, 2, 3, ldots   (1) Prove that the sequence left{frac{1}{a_n}  1right} is a geometric sequence;     (2) Find the general formula for {a_n}.","output":"(1) To prove that the sequence left{frac{1}{a_n} - 1right} is a geometric sequence, consider the given recursive formula:  a_{n+1} = frac{2a_n}{a_n + 1}  Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives us:  frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{a_n + 1}{2a_n}  This simplifies to:  frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2a_n}  Subtracting 1 from both sides results in the following equation:  frac{1}{a_{n+1}} - 1 = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{a_n} - 1 right)  Since the first term of the sequence a_1 = frac{2}{3}, it follows that:  frac{1}{a_1} - 1 = frac{1}{2}  This shows that the sequence left{frac{1}{a_n} - 1right} has a common ratio of frac{1}{2} and a first term of frac{1}{2}.

Each sector corresponding to a corner of the square will have 38 rays, making 39 triangles per sector. The grid of points that are 150-ray partitional forms by moving X by frac{1}{38} of the side length. This sets up a grid of 37 times 37 points as X can range from frac{1}{38} to frac{37}{38} from each side, thus there are 37 times 37 = 1369 points. For X to be 90-ray partitional, using the same rationale, X will divide each side into 90/4 = 22.5 segments. Adjusting for practicality and symmetry, it becomes 23 segments per side, totaling 92 rays (92 is close to 90, divisible by 4). Each sector will have 23 rays, forming 24 triangles per sector. The grid of 90-ray partitional points will move X by frac{1}{23} of the side length, creating a 22 times 22 grid of points, hence 22 times 22 = 484 points.

Hence, the range of f(x) is indeed {0}, making proposition (1) true. For proposition (2), if the function f(x) is even, by definition we have f(-x) = f(x). Taking into account that |x| is either x or -x, the outcome for either scenario must be the same since f(x) is even. Therefore, f(|x|) = f(x) holds true, meaning proposition (2) is correct. Proposition (3) states that if the function f(x) is not monotonic within its domain, then f(x) does not have an inverse function. This is incorrect; being non-monotonic does not automatically imply the absence of an inverse function. The existence of an inverse function requires the function to be one-to-one (injective), but a function can be non-monotonic and still have an inverse if it is injective in its domain. For example, the function f(x) = dfrac{1}{x} is not monotonic over its entire domain (it is decreasing in the positive part and increasing in the negative part) but still has an inverse given by f^{-1}(x) = dfrac{1}{x}. Therefore, proposition (3) is false. Proposition (4) suggests that if f(x) has a non-identical inverse function f^{-1}(x), the intersection points of their graphs must lie on the line y = x. While it's true that the points of intersection between a function and its inverse are symmetrically located with respect to the line y = x, it does not mean that they necessarily lie on it. For instance, the function y = -sqrt{x+1} and its inverse y = x^2 - 1 (for x leq 0) intersect at the points (-1,0) and (0,1), which do not lie on the line y = x. Therefore, proposition (4) is false.

Speed of train in m/s = 54 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed of train in m/s = 54 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of train in m/s = 54 * (10 / 36) Speed of train in m/s = 54 * (5 / 18) Speed of train in m/s = 15 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train in meters per second, we can calculate the total distance covered while crossing the platform.

If -1 < lambda < 0, then lambda^2 + lambda = (lambda + frac{1}{2})^2 - frac{1}{4} in (-frac{1}{4}, 0), so f_1(m) = m + lambda^2 = frac{1}{2} + lambda + lambda^2 in (frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}).

Therefore, frac{d}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{5} times frac{3ac}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{5} times frac{3ac}{a^2 + c^2 + frac{(a + c)^2}{4}} = frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{5} times frac{12ac}{5a^2 + 2ac + 5c^2}. Since frac{12ac}{5a^2 + 2ac + 5c^2} = frac{12}{5(frac{a}{c})^2 + 2 + 5(frac{c}{a})^2} in (0, 1), we have y = frac{d}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{5} times frac{12ac}{5a^2 + 2ac + 5c^2} in (0, frac{1}{5}). Therefore, boxed{lambda_{min} = frac{1}{5}}. (ii) If a - b geq b - c, i.e., a geq 2b - c, then d = (b - c)^2, and at this time, 5d - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 5(b - c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) leq 5(b - c)^2 - (2b - c)^2 - b^2 - c^2 = -6bc + 3c^2 < 0. Therefore, frac{d}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < frac{1}{5}. (iii) If a - b leq b - c, i.e., 0 < a < 2b - c < 2b, then d = (a - b)^2, and at this time, 5d - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 5(a - b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 4a^2 - 10ab + 4b^2 - c^2 = 2(a - 2b)(2a - b) - c^2 < 0. Therefore, frac{d}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < frac{1}{5}. In summary, 0 < y < frac{1}{5}, so there exists lambda = boxed{frac{1}{5}}, making lambda an upper bound of the bounded set C = {y | frac{d}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}, a, b, c text{ are all positive numbers}}."},{"instruction":"f for a real number x, we have a_{n}=x^{n}, then the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_{n}} is S_{n}=_________.","output":"**Analysis** This problem primarily tests the application of sequence summation, and it is of moderate difficulty. **Step-by-Step Solution** 1.

Define the circle's center as the origin of a complex plane, and position the points such that point (A) lies on the positive real axis. 2. Given that (AB = CD = EF = r), it follows that (angle AOB = angle COD = angle EOF = frac{pi}{3}).

We need to show that the triangle must be equilateral. 2. **Properties of the Incircle and Medians**:    - Let (O) be the center of the incircle (k) of the triangle.    - Consider an internal point (P) (different from (O)) inside (k). Through (P), at most two chords of equal length can be drawn. This is because the locus of the midpoints of equal-length chords in (k) is another circle (k'), concentric with (k).    - From any external point, at most two tangent lines can be drawn to a circle. 3. **Application to the Given Triangle**:    - In our triangle, three equal-length chords within the incircle (k) intersect at a common point (S), the centroid (or center of mass) of the triangle.    - This implies that (S) coincides with the incenter (O) of the triangle (since (S) is the only point of intersection).    - The incenter (O) is where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. Hence, the centroids being the same as the incenter implies that the medians ( =  ) angle bisectors. 4. **Implication for the Triangle**:    - Since the angle bisectors also act as medians, they bisect the opposite sides.    - This indicates symmetry such that each median bisects the triangle into two equal parts.    - Therefore, for all three medians to also be angle bisectors, the triangle must be isosceles. 5. **Conclusion**:    - All three angle bisectors being the same as medians further means each angle bisector also bisects the opposite angle into two equal parts.    - Hence, the triangle possesses three congruent sides, making it an equilateral triangle.

When a = 1, we consider the inequality f(x) < |x-2|, that is, x|x-1|-2 < |x-2|.    - For x geq 2, the inequality becomes x(x-1)-2 < x-2, which simplifies to 0 < x < 2. However, since x geq 2, this interval is empty, and thus no solutions exist, so we have x in emptyset.    - For 1 leq x < 2, the inequality simplifies to x(x-1)-2 < 2-x. Solving this gives -2 < x < 2. Since 1 leq x < 2, we have x in [1, 2).    - For the case of x < 1, the inequality simplifies to x(1-x)-2 < 2-x. Solving this does not impose any new restrictions on x, as all real numbers would satisfy the inequality, thus x in mathbb{R}. Considering the domain x < 1, we have x in (-infty, 1).    Combining all three cases, the solution set for the inequality is x in (-infty, 2). 2. For x in (0,1], we consider the inequality f(x) < x^2 - 1, which is equivalent to the inequality x|x-a|-2 < x^2 - 1. This inequality can be divided into two cases based on the definition of the absolute value:    - For x geq a, the inequality becomes x(x-a) - 2 < x^2 - 1, which simplifies to -2 < -a, leading to a < 2.    - For x < a, the inequality becomes x(a-x) - 2 < x^2 - 1, which simplifies to x^2 - ax + 2 < x^2 -1, leading to a > 1 - 2/x. Since we are constrained to the domain (0,1], the minimum value of 1 - 2/x over this interval is obtained when x = 1, hence a > -1.    Combining both constraints, we find the values of a must satisfy a > -1 and a < 2, so the range of a is (-1, 2).

These are the values of the neighboring points at ((x+1, y)), ((x-1, y)), ((x, y+1)), and ((x, y-1)) respectively. 3. **Hypothesis Application**: According to the problem, the value at each point is the average of its four neighbors. Thus, we write the equation:    [    m = frac{a + b + c + d}{4}    ] 4. **Minimal Value Property**: Given that ( m ) is the smallest of the assigned values and that all values are non-negative integers, it must be less than or equal to each of its neighbors:    [    m leq a, quad m leq b, quad m leq c, quad m leq d    ] 5. **Assumption for Contradiction**: Suppose one of the neighbors, say ( a ), is strictly greater than ( m ).

It follows that DE = frac{s}{1 + frac{2}{sqrt{3}}} = frac{ssqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3}}, so AE = DE = frac{ssqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3}} and AD = 2AE = frac{2ssqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3}}. Since triangles ADB and CDB share the same height, it follows that the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases, namely AD/CD. Since CD = s - AD, then frac{AD}{CD} = frac{AD}{s - AD} = frac{frac{2ssqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3}}}{s - frac{2ssqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3}}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3} - 2sqrt{3}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{2 - sqrt{3}}. Using the conjugate to simplify, frac{2sqrt{3}}{2 - sqrt{3}} cdot frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2 + sqrt{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3} + 6}{1} = 4sqrt{3} + 6.

Therefore, including 1 as a factor in combinations of two numbers from the set {2,3,5,11} adds 4 possibilities. These possibilities are essentially the products of each of the other numbers in the set with 1, which are the numbers themselves. However, since we are focusing on multiplying two or more distinct numbers and 1 does not alter the product, we consider the combinations without 1 first and then add the scenarios where 1 could be a factor. 2. **Combinations without 1**: Now, we consider combinations from the set {2,3,5,11} without including 1.    - **Choosing two numbers**: There are binom{4}{2} = 6 ways to choose two numbers from the set, which gives us the combinations 2 cdot 3, 2 cdot 5, 2 cdot 11, 3 cdot 5, 3 cdot 11, and 5 cdot 11.        - **Choosing three numbers**: There are binom{4}{3} = 4 ways to choose three numbers from the set, resulting in the combinations 2 cdot 3 cdot 5, 2 cdot 3 cdot 11, 2 cdot 5 cdot 11, and 3 cdot 5 cdot 11.        - **Choosing all four numbers**: Finally, there is binom{4}{4} = 1 way to choose all four numbers, leading to the combination 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 11. 3. **Total Possibilities**: Adding all these possibilities together, we get the total number of distinct products as 4 (from multiplying by 1) + 6 (choosing two numbers) + 4 (choosing three numbers) + 1 (choosing all four numbers) = 15.

We need to show that the common point of the circumcircles of triangles PA A_1 and PB B_1 is the center of the rotational homothety, mapping point A to A_1 and point B to B_1. Moreover, this rotational homothety is unique. 1. Assume O is the center of the rotational homothety that maps segment A B to A_1 B_1. 2. This means point O satisfies the following angle conditions: [ angle(P A, A O) = angle(P A_1, A_1 O) ] [ angle(P B, B O) = angle(P B_1, B_1 O) ] 3. The above angle conditions imply that point O is a point of intersection of the circumcircles of triangle PA A_1 and triangle PB B_1 since the circumcircles are defined by the points such that these angle conditions are respected. 4. If these circumcircles have exactly one common point, say P, then obviously: [ O = P ] In this special case, segment AB is mapped to A_1 B_1 by a homothety centered at P. 5. Consider the more generic case where these circumcircles intersect at two points, P and O. Since: [ angle(P A, A O) = angle(P A_1, A_1 O) quad text{and} quad angle(P B, B O) = angle(P B_1, B_1 O) ] it is evident that  triangle O A B sim triangle O A_1 B_1 by angle-angle similarity, implying that transformation from AB to A_1 B_1 is a rotational homothety centered at O. 6. Hence, such point O must be the unique center of the rotational homothety that maps A to A_1 and B to B_1. **Conclusion:** [ blacksquare ]  Part (b): Here, we need to prove that the center of rotational homothety which maps the segment AB to segment BC is the intersection point of the circle passing through point A and tangent to line BC at point B, and the circle passing through point C and tangent to line AB at point B. 1. Let O be the center of the rotational homothety mapping segment AB to segment BC. 2. Considering the characteristics of the circumcircles, we focus on points angle(B A, A O) and angle(C B, B O): [ angle(B A, A O) = angle(C B, B O) ] [ angle(A B, B O) = angle(B C, C O) ] 3. Here, angle(B A, A O) is the angle subtended by chord BA at point O. Similarly, angle(C B, B O) is subtended by chord BC. For O being the center, these angles must match the tangency condition provided by the respectives tangency points. 4. The points that satisfy these angles are those on the intersection of the circles described:     - The circle passing through A tangent to BC at B.     - The circle passing through C tangent to AB at B. 5. Therefore, the intersection point of these two circles provides the exact center O for the rotational homothety transforming segment AB into BC. **Conclusion:** [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"The library has 305 fairy tale books.

Prove that there must be one rectangle whose four corner squares have the same color. We will go through the solution step-by-step with detailed explanations: # Step 1: Analyze the First Row 1. Consider the first row, which contains 7 small squares. 2. By the pigeonhole principle, among the 7 squares, there must be at least 4 squares of the same color. Assume these 4 squares are all white. # Step 2: Analyze the Second Row 1. Look at the first four squares of the second row. 2. There are two possible cases:    - Case 1: If there are at least two white squares among these four squares (in the second row), we can pair them with the corresponding white squares in the first row. This forms the desired rectangle with the same color.    - Case 2: If there are fewer than two white squares, then at least three squares in these four must be black. Assume the first three squares in the second row are black. # Step 3: Analyze the Third Row 1. Examine the first three squares of the third row. 2. Again, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these three squares must be of the same color.    - Whether these two squares are white or black, they will align with squares in the first and second rows, forming a rectangle with four corners of the same color. # Conclusion from the Rows: - Regardless of the coloring configuration in the grid, the aligning squares from the rows considered ensure the formation of at least one rectangle whose four corners are the same color. # Alternative Proof Method: 1. Consider the 7 columns and each column having 3 possible squares. 2. By the pigeonhole principle, each column will have at least two squares of the same color. 3. Among the 7 columns, there must be at least 4 columns where any two have the same configuration (either both are white or both are black).    - Assume the first four columns each have two squares of the same color, say white. 4. The positions of these two white squares in each column can be paired in three possible ways: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).    - By the pigeonhole principle, among the four columns, there must be at least two columns with the same pairing configuration. 5. Therefore, the two columns will create a rectangle with four corners of the same color. # Alternative Argument: 1. Assume all 7 columns must be differently colored. 2. Each column has 3 squares that could be either black or white, providing 8 possible combinations (2^3 = 8).    - Since there are only 7 columns, not all configurations can be unique; hence, at least two columns will have the same configuration, forming the desired rectangle. 3. Even if all columns are uniquely colored, the initial argument remains valid, forcing at least one desired rectangle. # Conclusion: Thus, regardless of the chosen configuration within the 9 cdot 70 grid, there must be at least one rectangle whose four corners are of the same color.

For ( p = 2 ), we have:    [    nu_2left(binom{2^{i+1}}{2^i}right) = 1 quad text{for all } i.    ]    This is because there is exactly one carry when adding ( 2^i ) and ( 2^i ) in binary. 3. **Simplify the expression**: We need to show that the ( nu_2 ) (2-adic valuation) of the expression    [    binom{2^{k+1}}{2^k} - binom{2^k}{2^{k-1}}    ]    is ( 3k ) and not ( 3k+1 ). 4. **Express binomial coefficients in terms of factorials**:    [    binom{2^{k+1}}{2^k} = frac{(2^{k+1})!}{(2^k)!

For simplicity, let's assume we color all vertices blue initially. 2. **Identify Monochromatic Edges**: After the initial coloring, identify any monochromatic edges. An edge is monochromatic if all its vertices are of the same color. In this case, since all vertices are initially blue, all edges are monochromatic. 3. **Recoloring Process**: To eliminate monochromatic edges, we will recolor vertices. Assume we have a monochromatic edge ( e ) that is entirely blue.  4. **Recolor a Vertex**: Select any vertex ( v ) in the edge ( e ) and recolor it red. This action will reduce the number of monochromatic edges by at least one because ( e ) is no longer monochromatic. 5. **Effect on Other Edges**: Consider any other edge ( f ) that shares vertices with ( e ). Since no two edges have exactly one vertex in common, ( f ) must share at least two vertices with ( e ). Therefore, after recoloring ( v ) in ( e ), ( f ) will still have at least one blue vertex, ensuring ( f ) does not become monochromatic red. 6. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process of identifying a monochromatic edge and recoloring one of its vertices until no monochromatic edges remain. Each step reduces the number of monochromatic edges, and since the number of edges is finite, this process will eventually terminate. 7. **Conclusion**: At the end of this process, every edge will contain at least one vertex of each color (blue and red), satisfying the condition that every edge contains both colors of vertices.

First Approach: 1. **Mod 7 Analysis:**     - The key fact here is that among any 6 consecutive integers, at most one is divisible by 7. This is because the integers modulo 7 cycle every 7 numbers.     - If one of the integers in the set ( {n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5} ) is divisible by 7, say ( n+k equiv 0 pmod{7} ), then ( k in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). The product of one subset will be divisible by 7 while the other subset will not, implying their products can't be equal. Hence, no element can be divisible by 7.     2. **Possible Set Structure:**     - Given the restriction on divisibility by 7, the sequence ( {n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5} ) mod 7 must wrap around without containing 0. Hence, the residues must be ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) modulo 7.      3. **Product Analysis:**     - The product of these numbers is:         [         (7k+1)(7k+2)(7k+3)(7k+4)(7k+5)(7k+6) = 7K + 720 = N^2         ]     where ( K ) is a product of integers. Therefore, ( N^2 equiv 6 pmod{7} ). 4. **Square Modulo 7:**     - The squares modulo 7 can only be ( 0, 1, 2, text{or } 4 ), indicating that no perfect square modulo 7 is congruent to 6. This implies it is impossible for ( N^2 equiv 6 pmod{7} ). Conclusively, no integer ( n ) can satisfy this required condition.

If we choose a square at position ((i, j)), the squares affected are ((i-1, j)), ((i+1, j)), ((i, j-1)), and ((i, j+1)), provided these indices are within the grid boundaries.    - Each operation changes the signs of exactly four squares (or fewer if the square is on the boundary or corner). 3. **Parity Consideration:**    - Let's consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of ( 1 )'s in the grid.    - Initially, the grid has ( n^2 ) entries, all of which are ( 1 ). Thus, the number of ( 1 )'s is ( n^2 ), which is even if ( n ) is even and odd if ( n ) is odd. 4. **Effect of Operations on Parity:**    - Each operation changes the signs of an even number of squares (either 2 or 4). Therefore, each operation preserves the parity of the number of ( 1 )'s in the grid.    - If ( n ) is odd, ( n^2 ) is odd, and the number of ( 1 )'s remains odd after any number of operations.    - If ( n ) is even, ( n^2 ) is even, and the number of ( 1 )'s remains even after any number of operations. 5. **Reaching the All (-1) Grid:**    - To reach a grid where all entries are ( -1 ), the number of ( 1 )'s must be zero.    - For ( n ) odd, it is impossible to reach zero ( 1 )'s because the number of ( 1 )'s is always odd.    - For ( n ) even, it is possible to reach zero ( 1 )'s because the number of ( 1 )'s can be reduced to zero, maintaining even parity throughout.

However, since each game is counted twice from the perspective of both players, the actual total number of games is   frac{n(n-1)}{2}  Since each game contributes a total of 2 points to the score, the total score for all players is 2 times frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n(n-1).  It is clear that (n-1) and n are consecutive natural numbers. It is easy to verify that the product of two consecutive natural numbers can only end in 0, 2, or 6.  Therefore, the total score cannot be 1979, 1984, or 1985.  Thus, the total score can only be 1980.  From the equation n(n-1) = 1980, we find n^2 - n - 1980 = 0.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:    [    S cdot 10^k leq N^2 < (S+1) cdot 10^k    ]    for some natural numbers ( k ) and ( N ). 3. **Transform the inequality:**    - Taking the square root of the inequality, we get:    [    sqrt{S cdot 10^k} leq N < sqrt{(S+1) cdot 10^k}    ]    This implies ( N ) lies in the interval ([ sqrt{S cdot 10^k}, sqrt{(S+1) cdot 10^k} )). 4. **Find the length of the interval:**    - The length of this interval can be computed as:    begin{align*}    sqrt{(S+1) cdot 10^k} - sqrt{S cdot 10^k} &= left( sqrt{S+1} cdot sqrt{10^k} - sqrt{S} cdot sqrt{10^k}right)     &= sqrt{10^k} left( sqrt{S+1} - sqrt{S} right)    end{align*} 5. **Sufficiency condition for interval length:**    - To ensure the existence of ( N ) within this interval, the length should be greater than 1:    [    sqrt{10^k} left( sqrt{S+1} - sqrt{S} right) > 1    ] 6. **Simplify the expression:**    - Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:    [    sqrt{S+1} - sqrt{S} = frac{(sqrt{S+1} - sqrt{S})(sqrt{S+1} + sqrt{S})}{sqrt{S+1} + sqrt{S}} = frac{1}{sqrt{S+1} + sqrt{S}}    ]    Therefore,    [    sqrt{10^k} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{S+1} + sqrt{S}} > 1 implies sqrt{10^k} > sqrt{S+1} + sqrt{S}    ] 7. **Express as an inequality in ( k ):**    - Squaring both sides to remove the square roots,    [    10^k > (sqrt{S+1} + sqrt{S})^2    ]    Expanding the square on the right,    [    10^k > S + 1 + 2sqrt{S(S+1)}    ] 8. **Choosing ( k ):**    - Since ( S ) is fixed, we can always choose a sufficiently large ( k ) such that:    [    10^k > S + 1 + 2sqrt{S(S+1)}    ] 9. **Conclusion:**    - With an appropriate choice of ( k ), the interval length is greater than 1, and thus there exists an ( N ) such that ( N^2 ) starts with the digit sequence ( S ).

Rewriting the equation, we get:    [    3^n = a^2 - 1 = (a-1)(a+1)    ]    Therefore, (3^n) is expressed as a product of two integers: (a-1) and (a+1). 3.

The problem involves distributing candies to children standing in a circle numbered from 0 to 72. We start by noting that there are 73 children in total (numbered from 0 to 72, inclusive). 2. The evil Ded Moroz begins by giving a candy to child number 1, skips 1 child to give the next candy, and continues this pattern, incrementing the number skipped by 1 each time and giving out a total of 2020 candies. 3. Now, consider the sequence of numbers representing the positions at which candies are given. This sequence can be described by the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers. For the ( n )-th candy, Ded Moroz stops at position:     [     a_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}     ] 4. Ded Moroz distributes candies and moves in such a way that the ( n )-th candy is given to the child at position ( a_n mod 73 ). 5. We need to count how many different positions (i.e., different remainders when divided by 73) these positions cover after 2020 distributions. 6.

In one move, Inna can blindly take a ball from any box and either throw it away or transfer it to the other box. Inna wants to make it so that both boxes have the same contents. What is the minimum number of moves Inna can guaranteedly achieve this?","output":"Let's summarize the initial conditions and goal first: - Innа has a square box and a round box. - The round box contains 3 white and 10 black balls. - The square box contains 8 black balls. - Innа can perform one of the following actions in each step:   1. Draw a ball from either box and discard it,   2. Draw a ball from either box and place it in the other box. - The goal is to make the contents of the two boxes identical in terms of ball color. # Step-by-step solution: 1. **Initial State**:    - Round box: 3 white, 10 black.    - Square box: 8 black. 2. Innа needs to either eliminate all balls of one color or redistribute them so both boxes have the same number of black and white balls. 3. **Strategy for Elimination**:    - Consider removing all black balls first:      - Total black balls = 10 (in round) + 8 (in square) = 18 black balls.      - Minimum actions needed to remove all black balls = 18 actions (1 per ball).    - Consider removing all white balls first:      - Total white balls = 3 (all in round box).      - Minimum actions needed to remove all white balls = 3 actions (1 per ball). 4. **Redistribution to achieve identical contents with fewer steps**:    - First, move all balls from one box to the other:      - This takes fewer steps as we end not needing to align colors but only ensure equal count per box.    - Innа could choose to eliminate fewer despite color:       - Removing all whites is indeed simpler.      - Transition phase: fewest configurations to total moves inclusive reset. 5. Perform Action Example:    - Remove all white balls (3 total).      - This requires all 3 white ball discard actions.    - Left: 10 black (round) + 8 black (square):      - Next move: All possible discards or redistribute to either box; average via actual pooling if required. 6. **Final State**:    - Effort to convert all remaining simple exclusion and finalize counts (past primary discard).

Given that the distance from the right focus to the short axis endpoint is 2, we can write this condition as c^2 + b^2 = 4 because c is the distance from the center to the focus and b is the semi-minor axis. However, recognizing an error in transcription and correctly applying the ellipse properties, we see that b = 2 directly due to the given distance to the short axis endpoint. This doesn't immediately lead to c^2 + b^2 = 4; instead, it defines b directly. Given the distance from the right focus to the left vertex is 3, we express this as a + c = 3. This is because a is the semi-major axis, and c is the distance from the center to a focus, so their sum gives the distance from a focus to a vertex along the major axis. From a + c = 3, and knowing the relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse, which is a^2 = b^2 + c^2, we can solve for a and c.

Base Case For (n = 1): - (A_1 = 1), which is clearly divisible by (3^0 = 1) but not by (3^1 = 3).  Inductive Step Assume the statement is true for (n), i.e., (A_n) is divisible by (3^n) but not by (3^{n+1}).  We need to prove it for (n+1). Consider (A_{n+1}). By definition, (A_{n+1}) is a number composed of (3^{n+1}) ones. This can be represented as: [ A_{n+1} = underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{3^{n+1} text{ ones}} ] One useful mathematical property of such numbers is that: [ A_{n+1} = frac{10^{3^{n+1}} - 1}{9} ] Now, consider the fact that: [ (10^{3^n} - 1) ] is a factor of (10^{3^{n+1}} - 1). More specifically, we have: [ 10^{3^{n+1}} - 1 = (10^{3^n} - 1)(10^{2 cdot 3^n} + 10^{3^n} + 1) ] Since by inductive hypothesis: [ A_n = frac{10^{3^n} - 1}{9} ] we can express (10^{3^n} - 1) as (9A_n). Thus, we have: [ 10^{3^{n+1}} - 1 = 9A_n times (10^{2 cdot 3^n} + 10^{3^n} + 1) ] Therefore, [ A_{n+1} = frac{10^{3^{n+1}} - 1}{9} = A_n times (10^{2 cdot 3^n} + 10^{3^n} + 1) ] From the hypothesis, (A_n) is divisible by (3^n) but not by (3^{n+1}). So (A_n = 3^n k) for some integer (k) that is not divisible by 3.

We aim to show that in terms of algebraic lengths, we have:    [    overline{PA} cdot overline{PB} = OP^{2} - R^{2}.    ] 2. **Intersecting line (CD):**    Consider another line (CD) passing through point P and intersecting mathcal{C} at points C and D.          By the Power of a Point Theorem, we know that:    [    PA cdot PB = PC cdot PD    ]    This theorem states that the product of the lengths of the segments from P to the intersection points of two chords passing through P is constant. 3. **Special case of a diameter:**    Next, consider the special case where (CD) is a diameter of mathcal{C}. Note that C and D are on mathcal{C}, making overline{OC} = overline{OD} = R.        Therefore, PC cdot PD can be related to the power of point P with respect to circle mathcal{C}. The power of a point P with respect to mathcal{C} is given by:    [    PC cdot PD = left|PO^2 - R^2right|    ]    This follows from considering the lengths where P is either inside or outside the circle mathcal{C}. The absolute value ensures we handle both cases properly.     4. **Relating back to the product overline{PA} cdot overline{PB}:**    We have established earlier that PA cdot PB = PC cdot PD. Therefore, it follows that:    [    PA cdot PB = left|PO^2 - R^2right|    ] 5. **Sign consideration:**    Recognize the algebraic length consideration:    - If P lies inside the circle mathcal{C}, then overline{PA} cdot overline{PB} leq 0 because one distance will be negative and the other positive.    - This corresponds to OP leq R, so PO^2 - R^2 leq 0.        Conversely, if P is outside of mathcal{C}, both overline{PA} and overline{PB} would be positive or negative, giving a non-negative product.        This consideration maintains consistency with our formula:    [    overline{PA} cdot overline{PB} = OP^2 - R^2.    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    We have shown with proper intersection logic and power consideration that:    [    overline{PA} cdot overline{PB} = OP^{2} - R^{2}.    ] Thus, the derived relationship is indeed valid for a point P on the line segment (AB) in relation to a circle with radius R and center O.

The statement that overrightarrow{a} > overrightarrow{b} because |overrightarrow{a}| > |overrightarrow{b}| and they are in the same direction is incorrect due to the nature of vector quantities. Thus, **Option A is incorrect**. **Option B:** The triangle inequality theorem in vector addition states that the magnitude of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of their magnitudes. This can be expressed as |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}| leq |overrightarrow{a}| + |overrightarrow{b}|. This inequality holds true for all vectors, regardless of their direction relative to each other. When overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are in the same direction, the equality holds because the vectors add up linearly.

Completing the square involves expressing the quadratic equation in a form that makes it easy to see the vertex of the parabola represented by the equation. The vertex form of a parabola is given by a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola.  First, factor out the coefficient of t^2: s = -6(t^2 - frac{15}{6}t). Next, to complete the square, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of t inside the parentheses. The coefficient of t is frac{15}{6}, so half of this value is frac{15}{12} = frac{5}{4}. Squaring this gives left(frac{5}{4}right)^2 = frac{25}{16}. s = -6left(t^2 - frac{15}{6}t + frac{25}{16} - frac{25}{16}right).

We have two sets representing the same numbers: {a, frac{b}{a}, 1} and {a^2, a + b, 0}. # Step 1: Analyzing a = a^2 Given that the sets must represent the same numbers, one approach is to equate a from the first set to a^2 from the second set.

If a = 0, then frac{b}{a} is undefined, which is not acceptable. If a = 1, then a^2 = a, which doesn't satisfy the requirement of having distinct elements in each set. Therefore, the assumption that a = a^2 does not lead to a valid solution under the given constraints. # Step 3: Considering a = a + b Given that using a = a^2 didn't work, we look at another possibility where a from the first set matches a + b from the second set: [a = a + b] This simplifies to: [b = 0] # Step 4: Finding the Value of a With b = 0, the equation a^2 = a + b simplifies to a^2 = a. We already established that a cannot be 0 for the sets to contain distinct numbers. Thus, we are left with the solution where a = 1. However, considering the distinctiveness of the elements and the initial reasoning, we realize that a = 1 does not satisfy the original conditions provided by both sets. Re-evaluating our approach, we correct our earlier oversight: The solution a = 1 was indeed dismissed incorrectly. Instead, we should consider the implications of b = 0 more carefully, leading us to re-examine the possible values of a.

Hence,     [ q = 1 ]    becomes an evident candidate since it is a simple positive real number that fits the requirements.     6. **Example to Validate ( q = 1 ):**    If we consider ( q = 1 ), the ants can meet again at the origin if, for instance, one ant moves alternately east and west, and the other moves alternately north and south. At any odd number of minutes, both ants can be back at the origin. # Conclusion: Thus, the only possible value of ( q ) that satisfies the given conditions is: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"instruction":"The base  AD  of a trapezoid  ABCD  is twice greater than the base  BC , and the angle  C  equals one and a half of the angle  A .

For this set, the only non-empty subset whose sum of elements is divisible by ( n ) is ( S ) itself. This implies that ( d < n ). 2. **Claim**:    We claim that ( d = n-1 ). To support this claim, we will use two well-known results (lemmas). 3. **Lemma 1**:    Given a set of (at least) ( N ) distinct integers, there exists a non-empty subset having its sum of elements divisible by ( N ). This is an old result by Erdős. 4. **Lemma 2**:    The only sets of ( N-1 ) distinct integers, with no non-empty subset having its sum of elements divisible by ( N ), are those where all integers are congruent to the same residue modulo ( N ), and this residue is coprime with ( N ). 5. **Application of Lemma 1**:    By Lemma 1, there exists a subset ( emptyset neq A subseteq S ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ). Take an arbitrary ( a in A ). 6. **Finding Second Subset**:    Again by Lemma 1, there exists a subset ( emptyset neq B subseteq S setminus {a} ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ), and clearly ( B neq A ). Take an arbitrary ( b in B ), thus ( b neq a ). 7. **Finding Third Subset**:    If there exists a subset ( emptyset neq C subseteq S setminus {a, b} ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ), we are done. Otherwise, by Lemma 2, there exists some ( r ) coprime with ( n-1 ) such that ( x equiv r pmod{n-1} ) for all ( x in S setminus {a, b} ). 8. **Special Cases**:    If ( a equiv 0 pmod{n-1} ) or ( b equiv 0 pmod{n-1} ), we can easily fulfill the requirements. So, assume otherwise. This remark also solves the case ( n = 3 ), so we may assume ( n > 3 ). 9. **Interchangeability of Elements**:    The subset ( B ) is therefore made of ( b ) and some number of elements from ( S setminus {a, b} ). As these are interchangeable, if not all of them are used, then we can easily find another subset ( B' ) (different from ( B ) and ( A )) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ). 10. **Final Case**:     We are left with the case ( B = S setminus {a} ), which forces ( b equiv r pmod{n-1} ). The subset ( A ) is therefore made of ( a ) and some number of the other ( n-1 ) elements, congruent with ( r ) modulo ( n-1 ). As these are interchangeable, and not all of them could have been used, then we can easily find other subsets ( A' ) and ( A'' ) (different from ( A )) having their sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ). Thus, we have shown that for any set ( S ) of ( n ) integers, we can always find three different non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements of each subset is divisible by ( n-1 ).

The speed required to cover the first two-thirds of the distance in one-third of the total time can be calculated using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Let's denote the initial speed as S.

So we have: 35 kmph = (D/3) / (2T/3) Again, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3: 35 kmph = (D/3) * (3/(2T)) 35 kmph = D/(2T) Now we have two equations: 1) S = 2D/T 2) 35 kmph = D/(2T) We can equate the two expressions for D/T: 2D/T = D/(2T) Now, we can solve for S: S = 2 * 35 kmph S = 70 kmph So, the initial speed of the person was boxed{70}  kmph."},{"instruction":"The necessary and sufficient condition for the product of the complex numbers a+bi and c+di to be real is (　　) A: ad+bc=0 B: ac+bd=0 C: ac=bd D: ad=bc","output":"Given: (a+bi) cdot (c+di) = ac-bd+(ad+bc)i   For the product of the complex numbers a+bi and c+di to be real,   the imaginary part of the product must be zero,   therefore, ad+bc=0.

Select an element ( z in S ) such that ( z neq 0 ). 4. Consider the elements ( z a_1, z a_2, ldots, z a_n ). 5. Since ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) are distinct and ( z neq 0 ), the elements ( z a_1, z a_2, ldots, z a_n ) are also distinct. 6. According to the problem's condition, the set { ( z a_1, z a_2, ldots, z a_n ) } should be a permutation of the set { ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) }. 7. Since ( S ) is closed under multiplication, the product of the elements must also be in ( S ). Therefore, we have     [    a_1 a_2 cdots a_n = (z a_1)(z a_2) cdots (z a_n).    ] 8.

This is because the reflection across the x-axis affects the vertical position of the point, not its horizontal position. 2. **Applying Symmetry to Point P(-2,1)**:     - The abscissa of P is -2. Since reflection across the x-axis does not change the abscissa, the abscissa of the reflected point is also -2.    - The ordinate of P is 1.

We are asked to find the solution set of the inequality f(x+2) < 5. Step 1: Utilize the property of even functions. Since f(x) is an even function, it holds that f(x) = f(-x) for all x in its domain. Therefore, for any x, f(x+2) = f(|x+2|) because the absolute value ensures that the argument of f is non-negative, which aligns with the definition of f(x) for x geq 0. Step 2: Substitute f(x+2) with its equivalent expression. Given f(x+2) < 5, and knowing f(x+2) = f(|x+2|), we can rewrite the inequality as f(|x+2|) < 5. Step 3: Apply the definition of f(x) for x geq 0. For x geq 0, f(x) = x^2 - 4x. Thus, f(|x+2|) = |x+2|^2 - 4|x+2|. Substituting this into our inequality gives |x+2|^2 - 4|x+2| < 5. Step 4: Solve the inequality. To solve |x+2|^2 - 4|x+2| < 5, we rearrange it to left(|x+2|+1right)left(|x+2|-5right) < 0. This inequality holds when the expression inside the absolute value, |x+2|, is between the roots of the quadratic equation, which are -1 and 5. Therefore, we have -1 < |x+2| < 5. Step 5: Interpret the absolute value inequality. The inequality -1 < |x+2| < 5 simplifies to |x+2| < 5 since |x+2| is always non-negative and thus always greater than -1. This leads to two cases based on the definition of absolute value: 1. x+2 < 5 which simplifies to x < 3, 2. x+2 > -5 which simplifies to x > -7. Combining these two cases gives the solution -7 < x < 3.

We can divide the quarter-section into two distinct parts, A and B:     - **Part A:**         - The outermost line in the nth belt includes 2n + 1 squares.         - Each end of this line contains a square marked with n.         - Therefore, for the nth belt, the number of n-marked squares is the following sequence for outer and inner rows for both nth and (n-1)th belts:             - (n+1)             - n             - (n-1)             - (n-2)         - Summing these, we get:             [             (n+1) + n + (n-1) + (n-2) = 4n - 2             ]         - Thus, part A contains 4n - 2 squares marked with n. 5. **Part B:**         - In this part, within the nth and (n-1)th belts, the n-marked squares align along three parallel diagonals.         - For the nth belt, the middle diagonal has n squares, and each of the two outer diagonals has (n-1) squares.         - Thus, within part B, the number of n-marked squares is:             [             3(n-1)             ] 6. Summing up the n-marked squares in parts A and B:     [     4n - 2 + 3(n-1) = 4n - 2 + 3n - 3 = 7n - 5     ] 7. Multiplying by 4 (to cover all four quadrants of the chessboard), we find the total number of squares reachable in exactly n knight moves:     [     S_n = 4(7n - 5) = 28n - 20     ] 8. For n < 5, the number of reachable squares is determined through direct enumeration. The results are:     [     begin{align*}     S_1 &= 8,      S_2 &= 32,      S_3 &= 68,      S_4 &= 96     end{align*}     ] Conclusion: [  S_n =  begin{cases}  8 & text{if } n = 1  32 & text{if } n = 2  68 & text{if } n = 3  96 & text{if } n = 4  28n - 20 & text{if } n geq 5 end{cases}  ] boxed{}"},{"instruction":"(1) Solve the equation with respect to x: frac{1}{{x+1}}frac{1}{{x+2}}=frac{1}{{x+3}}frac{1}{{x+4}};<br/>(2) Find the solution set of the inequality with respect to x: x^{2}left(a+1right)x+aleqslant 0.","output":"# Solution:  Part (1) **(Method 1) Step-by-Step:** 1.

This gives: (x+2)(x+3)(x+4)-(x+1)(x+3)(x+4)=(x+1)(x+2)(x+4)-(x+1)(x+2)(x+3). 3. Simplifying, we find (x+3)(x+4)=(x+1)(x+2). 4. Expanding both sides, we get 7x+12=3x+2. 5. Solving for x, we find x=-frac{5}{2}. Hence, the solution set is boxed{left{-frac{5}{2}right}}. **(Method 2) Step-by-Step:** 1. Rewrite the original equation as frac{1}{{x+1}}+frac{1}{{x+4}}=frac{1}{{x+2}}+frac{1}{{x+3}}. 2. This simplifies to frac{{2x+5}}{{(x+1)(x+4)}}=frac{{2x+5}}{{(x+2)(x+3)}}. 3.

We start by expressing f(x) in the form f(x) = x^{alpha}, where alpha is a constant we need to determine. **Step 1: Finding the value of alpha.** Given that f(9) = 9^{alpha} = 3, we solve for alpha: [9^{alpha} = 3] Since 9 = 3^2, we can write this as (3^2)^{alpha} = 3^1. Therefore, by equating the exponents, we get 2alpha = 1, leading to alpha = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the function is given by f(x) = x^{frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{x}. **Step 2: Analyzing the function f(x) = sqrt{x}.** - The domain of f(x) is [0, +infty), meaning it includes all non-negative real numbers. Hence, **Option A** claims that f(x) is a decreasing function, which is incorrect because as x increases, sqrt{x} also increases. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing. - An even function is symmetric about the y-axis, which means f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the domain. Since the domain of sqrt{x} does not include negative numbers, it cannot be an even function. Thus, **Option B** is incorrect. **Step 3: Considering when x geqslant 4.** Since f(x) is monotonically increasing, for any x geqslant 4, f(x) geqslant f(4) = sqrt{4} = 2. This confirms **Option C** as correct, showing that f(x) geqslant 2 for x geqslant 4. **Step 4: Comparing averages with the function value at the average of inputs.** For x_2 > x_1 > 0, we examine frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2} and f(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}). Calculating the square of the difference between these two expressions, we have: [left(frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2}right)^2 - left(fleft(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}right)right)^2 = frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + 2sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}}}{4} - frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}] This simplifies to  [frac{2sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} - x_{1} - x_{2}}{4} = -frac{(sqrt{x_{1}} - sqrt{x_{2}})^2}{4} < 0] Given that f(x) geqslant 0, this implies frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2} < f(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}).

Find all *interesting* ordered pairs of numbers.","output":"1. **Define the valuation function**: For any positive integer ( n ), let ( v(n) ) be the largest integer such that ( 2^{v(n)} mid n ). 2. **Lemma**: If ( b equiv 1 pmod{2^{v(a-1)}} ), then there exists ( k in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a^k equiv b pmod{2^n} ) for any ( n in mathbb{N} ). 3. **Proof of Lemma**:     - Let ( v(a-1) = p ), ( a = 2^p l + 1 ) where ( l ) is odd, and ( b = 2^p m + 1 ).     - For ( n le p ), the statement is obvious (just take ( k = 1 )).     - Suppose ( n > p ). Note that:       [       a^{2^{n-p}} - 1 = sum_{i=1}^{2^{n-p}} (2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p}}{i}       ]     - Note that ( v((2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p}}{i}) ge pi + n - p - v(i) > n ). So ( a^{2^{n-p}} equiv 1 pmod{2^n} ).     - If ( a, a^2, ldots, a^{2^{n-p}} ) have distinct values modulo ( 2^n ), then they take all values of the form ( 2^p m + 1 ), so ( a^k equiv b pmod{2^n} ) for some ( k ).     - Otherwise, the order of ( a ) modulo ( 2^n ) is less than ( 2^{n-p} ), thus we must have ( a^{2^{n-p-1}} equiv 1 pmod{2^n} ).     - But we have:       [       a^{2^{n-p-1}} - 1 = sum_{i=1}^{2^{n-p-1}} (2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p-1}}{i}       ]     - For ( i ge 2 ), we have ( v((2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p-1}}{i}) = pi + n - p - 1 - v(i) ge n ), and for ( i = 1 ), we have ( v((2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p-1}}{i}) = v(2^p l 2^{n-p-1}) = n - 1 ). So ( 2^n nmid a^{2^{n-p-1}} - 1 ), a contradiction. Our lemma is proved. 4. **Parity Consideration**:     - Since ( a^k + b ) is even, then ( a ) and ( b ) have the same parity.     - Suppose they are both even. For ( n > v(b) ), we have ( a^k equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). So we must have ( k v(a) = v(b) ), or ( k = frac{v(a)}{v(b)} ). Thus ( a^{frac{v(a)}{v(b)}} + b ) is divisible by ( 2^n ) for all ( n > v(b) ), which is impossible. Therefore ( a ) and ( b ) are both odd. 5. **Divisibility Consideration**:     - For ( n = v(a^2 - 1) ), we have ( a^k equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). Note that either ( a^2 - 1 mid a^k - 1 ) or ( a^2 - 1 mid a^k - a ). Thus ( -b - 1 ) or ( -b - a ) is divisible by ( 2^{v(a^2 - 1)} ), equivalently, ( 2^{v(a^2 - 1)} ) divides ( b + 1 ) or ( a + b ). 6. **Case Analysis**:     - **Case (i)**: ( a equiv 1 pmod{4} )         - Let ( a = 2^k l + 1 ) where ( k ge 2 ) and ( l ) is odd. Then ( a^2 - 1 = 4^k l^2 + 2^{k+1} l ), so ( v(a^2 - 1) = k + 1 ).         - So ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 1 ) or ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 2^k l - 1 = 2^k (2m - l) - 1 = 2^k p - 1 ). Either way, we have ( b = 2^k q - 1 ) for some positive integer ( q ).         - From our lemma, we know that there exists ( x in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a^x equiv -b pmod{2^n} ), so ( (2^k l + 1, 2^k q - 1) ) is an interesting pair for any ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l ).     - **Case (ii)**: ( a equiv -1 pmod{4} )         - Let ( a = 2^k l - 1 ) where ( k ge 2 ) and ( l ) is odd. Then ( a^2 - 1 = 4^k l^2 - 2^{k+1} l ), so ( v(a^2 - 1) = k + 1 ).         - Then ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 1 ) or ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 2^k l + 1 = 2^k q + 1 ) where ( q ) is odd.         - **Subcase (ii.i)**: ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 1 )             - Note that ( v(a^2 - 1) = v(4^k l^2 - 2^{k+1} l) = k + 1 ). Since ( -b equiv 1 pmod{2^{k+1}} ), then it follows from our lemma that there exists ( x ) such that ( (a^2)^x equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). So ( (2^k l - 1, 2^{k+1} m - 1) ) is interesting for ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l ).         - **Subcase (ii.ii)**: ( b = 2^k q + 1 )             - Consider a sufficiently large ( n ). It is easy to see that the inverse of ( a ) modulo ( 2^n ) is of the form ( a^* equiv 2^k r - 1 ) for odd ( r ). Since ( -b a^* equiv 1 pmod{2^{k+1}} ), from our lemma we know that there exists ( x ) such that ( (a^2)^x equiv -b a^* pmod{2^n} ), which gives ( a^{2x+1} equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). Therefore ( (2^k l - 1, 2^k q + 1) ) is interesting for ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l, q ). The final answer is ( boxed{ (2^k l + 1, 2^k q - 1) } ) and ((2^k l - 1, 2^k q + 1)) for ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l, q )."},{"instruction":"Ninety fair sixsided dice were rolled (each side of the dice is numbered from 1 to 6, and each side has the same probability of landing face up) and the sum of the rolled numbers was calculated.

The area of the field is given as 680 square feet, so we have: L * W = 680 The total amount of fencing required is 146 feet, which will be used for the two sides of length W and one side of length L. Therefore, we have: 2W + L = 146 We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of L and W. From the first equation, we can express W in terms of L: W = 680 / L Now, we substitute this expression for W into the second equation: 2(680 / L) + L = 146 Multiply through by L to clear the fraction: 2 * 680 + L^2 = 146L 1360 + L^2 = 146L Rearrange the equation to set it to zero: L^2 - 146L + 1360 = 0 This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

Let P be the apex of the tetrahedron, and O be the foot of the altitude from P to triangle ABC. We aim to prove that O is the orthocenter of triangle ABC. **Step 2: Prove the Lemma** To prove that O is the orthocenter, we use the following lemma: [OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2] - The first equality, OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2, follows from the Pythagorean Theorem. - The second equality, PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2, is true because AF = FP and AE = EP. By the Perpendicularity Lemma, since OF^2 - OE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2, AO is perpendicular to FE and hence to BC. Similarly, O lies on the B-altitude and C-altitude of triangle ABC, confirming that O is the orthocenter of triangle ABC. **Step 3: Find the Coordinates of O** To find O, we look for the intersection of altitudes BE and AD. The equation for BE is x=16. Since AD is perpendicular to BC, and the slope of BC is frac{24-0}{16-34} = -frac{4}{3}, the slope of AD is the negative reciprocal, frac{3}{4}. Thus, AD has the equation y = frac{3}{4}x. The intersection of BE and AD is at (16,12), which is the base of the height of the tetrahedron. **Step 4: Calculate the Height and Volume** Let S be the foot of altitude BS in triangle BPQ. The height h of the tetrahedron is found using the Pythagorean Theorem: h = sqrt{BS^2 - SO^2}. Since S and O coincide, SO = 0 and thus h = 12. The area of the base triangle ABC is 102 square units.

Let's assume each of these R students borrowed exactly 3 books (since we are looking for the minimum number of students, we'll use the minimum number of books for this group): Total books = 40 + 3 * R Now we can set up the equation based on the average number of books per student: 2 * S = 40 + 3 * R We also know that the total number of students is the sum of the students who borrowed 0, 1, 2, and at least 3 books: S = 2 + 12 + 14 + R S = 28 + R Now we can substitute S from the second equation into the first equation: 2 * (28 + R) = 40 + 3 * R 56 + 2R = 40 + 3R 56 - 40 = 3R - 2R 16 = R Now that we have the value of R, we can find the total number of students, S: S = 28 + R S = 28 + 16 S = 44 Therefore, the total number of students in the class is boxed{44} ."},{"instruction":"Prove that for any integer  n>1  there exist infinitely many pairs  (x,y)  of integers  1<x<y , such that  x^n+y mid x+y^n .

Nussbaum's discussion in the first chapter of \\"From Disgust to Humanity,\\" she constructs 'projective disgust' as a mechanism through which dominant social groups delineate what is considered morally right and socially desirable by projecting feelings of disgust onto marginalized or subordinate groups. This projection is not a reflection of any inherent moral failings in the behaviors or identities of these marginalized groups but rather a manifestation of the dominant group's biases and interests in maintaining societal norms and hierarchies that favor them. Nussbaum explains that 'projective disgust' works as a tool to enforce conformity and suppress deviations from the established norms by associating them with visceral, negative reactions. This association between the elicitation of disgust and non-conformity serves to other and exclude those who differ from normative standards, marking them as undesirable or morally reprehensible. Essentially, projective disgust becomes a mechanism to shape and control social morals and values, suggesting that what is often deemed disgusting, and by extension immoral or socially unacceptable, is largely a product of social construction rather than an objective condition. By projecting disgust onto certain individuals or groups, dominant social narratives reinforce the idea that these individuals or their behaviors are inherently wrong or undesirable, justifying their exclusion or marginalization. This process serves not only to uphold existing power structures but also to define communal boundaries and identities, dictating the terms of social cohesion and belonging. In doing so, 'projective disgust' functions as an indicator of what is considered morally right and socially desirable within a given cultural context, establishing a clear divide between acceptable and unacceptable social entities based on subjective emotional reactions rather than equitable or universal principles."},{"instruction":"Menjívar C、Gómez Cervantes A、Alvord D.

(2018)的定义，通常情况下，“犯罪移民”这一术语可能包含以下内容： - **法律定义**：依据移民法或刑事法律，因违反相关法律（如非法入境、偷渡或其他与移民身份相关的犯罪行为）而被认定为犯罪的移民。 - **社会和政策构造**：这一术语不仅是法律上的分类，也是一个通过政策制定和公共话语构造出来的社会类别，反映了对移民群体的特定看法和处理方式，强调了安全和管制的需要，而不是人道或庇护的考量。 在移民研究中，批评“犯罪移民”概念的学者们通常指出，这种类别化和极化的言论可能会混淆法律违规行为与刑事犯罪行为，导致对移民群体的广泛污名化和边缘化，增加了社会不公和政策中的不平等。"},{"instruction":"я отправляю пост запрос на данный url http://localhost:8080/acq-company-rest/sbp-payments/?id=1, я должен попасть сюда, но попадаю в другой метод @POST @Path(\\"sbp-payments/{id}\\") @Produces(value = APPLICATION_JSON) @Consumes(value = APPLICATION_JSON) public SbpOperation getPaymentsInfo(@HeaderParam(\\"token\\") String token, @QueryParam(\\"id\\") Long id) { а попадаю сюда @POST @Path(\\"sbp-payments\\") @Consumes(value = APPLICATION_JSON) @Produces(value = APPLICATION_JSON) public Page<SbpOperation> getPayments(@HeaderParam(\\"token\\") String token) {","output":"Вероятно, проблема заключается в том, что в вашем URL используется параметр id, который передается как Query Parameter, а в методе getPaymentsInfo() вы пытаетесь получить его как Path Parameter.

Twenty-two thousand were sent to France (Grundlingh 1987, pp. 57; 97). Because the South African Union, which was founded in 1910 by uniting the four British Cape colonies, was under the reign of the British Crown, its government could not refuse to support the British troops. To make recruitment easier, the Union government turned to the South African National Congress in 1915. But in contrast to the hopes of its representatives, the government wanted their help without granting them any co-determination. Thus, the recruitment campaign was for the most part a failure. One official reported from the Transkei that he was unable to find a single man for work in South West Africa, since workers assumed that Britain had been defeated and only wanted to send the labourers to the foremost front (quoted in Grundlingh 1987, p. 12). Many preferred to continue the hard work in the mines which they knew to being sent to South West Africa. This led the administrations to revert to earlier practices. Chiefs were threatened with dismissal if they did not provide enough labourers and labourers were put under pressure. Many workers building railroads were simply transferred to German South West Africa to carry out similar tasks without having been asked their consent. At their new workplace, they were just as likely to be beaten by overseers as at their previous one. When reports of cruel treatment and torture spread, Africans not only feared the wretched conditions of forced labour which they already knew but also being taken prisoner by the Germans (Grundlingh 1987, pp. 87Q. But labourers were not just requisitioned for the war in South West Africa and East Africa, but from 1916 onwards also for the support of British troops in France. Although administrative personnel, chiefs, merchants and not least of all missionaries and clerics of the major religions made efforts to recruit, the number of those people who were successfully recruited remained very low. But there were also serious reservations among whites about this deployment of indigenous black Africans. They were worried that South African blacks would be subject to ‘bad influences’ in France (Willan 1978, p. 64). And indeed, members of the educated indigenous elite hoped that fighting in the other people’s wars would win them political concessions in their own country. If the costs of this transfer of labourers had not been borne by the government in London, the president would have had to obtain the approval of the South African parliament. Such approval would not have been certain at all. The government resorted to systematic advertisement. Mine workers were told that in six months in France they could learn more than in ten months in Kimberley. This job posting was presented as the equivalent of a free education (quoted in Grundlingh 1987, p. 63). When this did not do the job, workers who were already in France were asked to write letters home describing how sweet life was. Finally, individual returnees were sent on a recruitment tour. They described a real idyll, ‘a happy, lazy life’. One had to load and unload ships and trains, but got food and periods of rest, could go out with ‘ladies of high standard’ and receive wages of 3 pounds a month (Grundlingh 1987, p. 64). And if it is true that many members of the South African Labour Con-tingent (SALC) were in one way or another strongly urged to volunteer for France. There were also teachers, translators, employees and other Africans with school education who volunteered, either because they supported the war goal or because they were looking for new experiences. In order to prevent the latter, the South African SALC leadership exported the compounds system practised in the Kimberley diamond fields to Europe. According to instructions from management, these compounds were to be equipped with a fence or wall that could not be climbed over. In more densely populated areas, an electrically charged fence was also considered useful. The Africans should not be allowed to leave the compound other than for work, and then only accompanied by a non-commissioned officer (quoted in Willan 1978, p. 6). In the beginning, compounds were also erected at the front. When riots broke out because the imprisoned labourers could not protect themselves against the shelling, they were moved further back. Most of them, however, only in 1917. But even then, the inhabitants were still not protected from air raids. Racist controls were imposed on members of the work contingent even during non-working hours. There were some training opportunities, but more prevalent was the organising of sports as well as ‘African dances’ to be performed for European spectators (quoted in Willan 1978, p. 109). In the compounds, the Allies disproved all the arguments with which they had campaigned for the support of their war against Germany. Nevertheless, as much as the South African officers who had been sent with the indigenous Africans were anxious to ensure that racial barriers were maintained, they could not oppose military requirements. These repeatedly made it necessary for South African workers to be deployed in smaller groups together with European workers, for example for port work near the front. It was not always possible to avoid having labourers imported from South Africa work under the command of a British overseer who was more interested in the efficiency of the operation than in racial segregation. Despite all the precautions taken by management, some labourers also seem to have succeeded in making friends with French citizens. In the course of 1917 labourers in the compounds increasingly frequently complained about the food.14 When the South African Native Labour Contingent was dissolved in January 1918, the government’s official reason was that there were no longer enough ships to send further workers to Europe. But what was probably decisive was that an increased resistance on the part of de facto imprisoned labourers in France created fears of uprisings. What is more, the sinking of the ss Mendi on 21 February 1917 that cost the lives of 615 black Africans who were being sent to France increased criticisms of the use of African lives for their colonial masters. In later narratives, the s s Mendi disaster became a symbol of the waste of African lives by colonial masters. The experiences of men from the colonies in the Great War were by no means uniform. While South African workers in Europe found it impossible to escape the racist controls there as well, most soldiers from the Punjab seem to have reacted positively to their new experiences (Ellinwood 1978, p. 207). In all the theatres of the war, the indigenous experienced new technology. Porters got used to carrying radios on missions and possibly assisting in their use. In some situations, such as the long marches in Africa, European officers and the indigenous seem to have met and, at least for the time being, come to appreciate each other. And all the soldiers and auxiliaries saw that Europeans could also be defeated. The white man lost some of his aura when Ascaris were told to kill white men (Hodges 1986, p. 149). The argument that colonial rule was good for civilising the colonised population lost even more of its legitimacy through close acquaintance with the barbarism of the civilised. No wonder, then, that many people in the mother countries feared that after the end of the war demobilised soldiers would lead uprisings against colonial rule. On the whole, this did not transpire, notwithstanding the fact that the colonial states were not prepared to abolish previous restrictions. Despite fierce protests, passport laws were maintained in South Africa. Promises previously made to participants in the war were also not kept. For example, French soldiers from overseas had been promised that they would no longer be subject to the ‘indigénaf, which meant that the poll tax on and the special control and disciplinary structures set up against the indigenous would be abolished. Local colonial officials cared little about these promises. Like many of the colonists, they probably assumed that the former conditions of ‘eternal Africa’ would be restored after the war (Michel 2009, p. 341). And they were supported by many chiefs, who quite rightly feared that those who returned home would no longer follow their orders (Michel 1982, p. 202). In many colonies, independence movements emerged or became stronger after the war. In leading circles of the colonial powers, there was widespread fear that the soldiers returning from the war would become leaders in the independence movements. According to Frank Furedi, this fear was fuelled by the fact that colonial rule was no longer able to defend its previously asserted ‘moral authority’ during the First World War and then even more so during the Second World War. Even though it was not the demobilised soldiers from the colonies who drove the fight for independence (1999, passim), the deployment of indigenous soldiers for the benefit of their colonial rulers did affect developments in the post-colonial colonies. For when the military became new masters in many post-colonial states, they applied the knowledge and practices they had acquired in colonial armies. When more and more former colonies gained their independence after the end of the Second World War, many European settlers and entrepreneurs were hit hard, but on the whole it did not lead to any major economic losses in the mother countries, thus proving that everyone who had always labelled colonial rule as a bad business had been right. CHAPTER 6 The Domestication of Industrial Capitalism in the Metropolitan Capitalist States To sum up the development of capitalism in the last hundred years, Robert Castel has used the expression, the ‘civilization’ of capitalism (1996/2000, p. 401),1 while Etienne Balibar describes the process as ‘normalization’ (2009, p. 111). I prefer the expression, ‘domestication’.2 The choice of terms has not been left to chance. When using the expression, the ‘civilization’ of capitalism, Castel primarily means the development of social policy, whereas ‘normalization’ and ‘domestication’ emphasise that the violence of exploitation has become an everyday phenomenon of capitalist labour relations over time and thus, in a sense, an institution of the political and social system - whereby ‘domestication’ further suggests that even once that state has been achieved it may still remain in peril. What will be described here as ‘domestication’ began in a historical phase in which capitalist appropriation was clearly oriented around the structures of the nation. The central feature of domestication was the achievement and practice of the right to belong to a trade union and to engage in trade union struggles and industrial action.3”翻译为中文","output":"“他人之战 总的来说，在第一次世界大战期间，大约有53,000名工人在南非被招募，被雇用为劳工在德国南西非和东非，这些地区之前曾处于德国的统治之下。其中22,000人被送往法国（Grundlingh 1987，第57页；97页）。由于南非联邦是在1910年通过联合四个英国开普殖民地成立的，处于英国王冠的统治之下，其政府无法拒绝支持英国军队。为了使招募更加容易，联邦政府在1915年求助于南非国民大会。但与其代表们的希望相反，政府希望得到他们的帮助却不授予他们任何共同决策权。因此，招募活动在很大程度上是失败的。一位官员从Transkei报告说，他找不到一个人去南西非工作，因为工人们认为英国已经被打败，只想将劳工送到最前线（引用自Grundlingh 1987，第12页）。许多人宁愿继续在他们熟悉的矿山里做艰苦的工作，也不愿被送往南西非。这导致了行政当局恢复到以前的做法。如果酋长们不提供足够的劳动力，就会受到解职的威胁，劳工们也被施加压力。许多建设铁路的工人被直接转移到德国南西非进行类似的任务，而事先没有征得他们的同意。在他们的新工作场所，他们同样可能会被监工殴打，就如同在他们之前的那个地方一样。当有关残酷对待和折磨的报告传开时，非洲人不仅害怕他们已经知道的强迫劳动的悲惨条件，也害怕被德国人俘虏（Grundlingh 1987，第87页）。 但是，劳工不仅仅是为了在南西非和东非的战争中被征召，而且从1916年开始，也被征召去支援法国的英国军队。尽管行政人员、酋长、商人以及最重要的宗教传教士和神职人员都努力招募，但成功招募的人数仍然非常低。但是，关于派遣本土黑非洲人去法国，白人社会也存在严重的保留意见。他们担心南非黑人在法国会受到“坏的影响”（Willan 1978，第64页）。 的确，受过教育的本土精英成员希望通过参与他人的战争赢得本国政治上的让步。如果这种劳工转移的费用没有由伦敦政府承担，总统就必须得到南非议会的批准。这种批准根本无法保证。政府诉诸于系统性的广告。矿工们被告知，在法国的六个月里，他们可以学到比在金伯利十个月还要多的东西。这份工作机会被宣传为免费教育的同等物（引用自Grundlingh 1987，第63页）。当这种办法不起作用时，已经在法国的工人被要求写信回家，描述生活有多么美好。最后，一些个别的回国者被派遣去进行招募巡回。他们描述了一种真正的田园诗般的生活，“一个幸福懒散的生活”。人们不得不装卸船只和火车，但可以得到食物和休息时间，可以与“高标准的女士”外出，还可以每月获得3英镑的工资（Grundlingh 1987，第64页）。如果是真的，许多南非劳工连队（SALC）的成员在某种程度上都是被强烈要求自愿去法国。也有一些教师、翻译、雇员和其他有学校教育的非洲人自愿参加，要么是因为他们支持战争目标，要么是因为他们在寻求新的经历。为了防止后者发生，南非SALC领导将在金伯利钻石田采用的围栏系统输送到欧洲。根据管理层的指示，这些围栏应该配备不能翻越的围栏或墙。在人口密集的地区，还考虑使用带电的围栏。非洲人除工作外不得离开围栏，且只能在一名士官的陪同下离开（引用自Willan 1978，第6页）。最初，围栏也在前线建立。当因为被囚禁的劳工无法保护自己免受炮击而爆发骚乱时，他们被迁移到更后方。但这大多数是在1917年之后的事情。但即便如此，居民们仍然无法免受空袭的威胁。即使在非工作时间，对工作队成员也实行种族控制。存在一些培训机会，但更普遍的是组织体育活动以及为欧洲观众表演的“非洲舞蹈”（引用自Willan 1978，第109页）。在围栏内，盟军推翻了他们为支持对德国战争而进行竞选的所有论点。 尽管如此，被派遣的南非官员们急切地确保种族隔离得到维护，但他们不能反对军事需求。这些需求反复使得必须将南非工人与欧洲工人一起部署在较小的群体中，例如在前线附近的港口工作。不总是能够避免让从南非进口的劳工在一个对操作效率比种族隔离更感兴趣的英国监工指挥下工作。尽管管理层采取了所有预防措施，一些劳工似乎还是成功地与法国公民建立了友谊。 到了1917年，围栏内的劳工越来越频繁地抱怨食物。当南非土著劳工连队在1918年1月解散时，政府的官方理由是没有足够的船只将进一步的工人送往欧洲。但决定性的可能是，在法国被实际监禁的劳工日益增加的抵抗引发了对起义的恐惧。此外，1917年2月21日ss Mendi号沉没，导致被送往法国的615名黑非洲人丧生，这增加了对利用非洲人的生命为他们的殖民主人服务的批评。在后来的叙述中，ss Mendi号灾难成为殖民主人浪费非洲生命的象征。 殖民地男子在大战中的经历绝非一成不变。虽然在欧洲的南非工人发现他们无法逃避那里的种族控制，但大多数来自旁遮普的士兵似乎对他们的新经历做出了积极反应（Ellinwood 1978，第207页）。在战争的所有战场上，土著人都体验到了新技术。携带收音机执行任务的搬运工渐渐习惯了携带收音机和可能协助使用它们。在一些情况下，例如非洲的长途行军，欧洲官员和土著人似乎相遇了，至少暂时地开始相互欣赏。所有的士兵和辅助人员都看到欧洲人也可以被打败。当阿斯卡里被告知杀死白人时，白人失去了一些他的光环（Hodges 1986，第149页）。通过与文明的野蛮行为的亲密接触，认为殖民统治对于文明化被殖民人口是有益的这一论点失去了更多的合法性。因此，难怪许多在母国的人担心，战争结束后，被解散的士兵会领导起反对殖民统治的起义。总的来说，尽管殖民地国家并未准备废除之前的限制，这种情况并没有发生，尽管遇到了激烈的抗议。护照法仍在南非得到维护。此前向参战者做出的承诺也未能兑现。例如，海外的法国士兵曾被承诺，他们将不再受到“土著法律”的约束，这意味着民意税和针对土著人设置的特殊控制和纪律结构将被废除。当地的殖民官员对这些承诺不甚关心。像许多殖民者一样，他们可能认为战后将恢复“永恒的非洲”以前的状况（Michel 2009，第341页）。而且他们得到了许多酋长的支持，这些酋长非常正确地担心那些回国的人将不再听从他们的命令（Michel 1982，第202页）。 在许多殖民地，独立运动在战后出现或变得更加强大。在殖民大国的领导圈子里，普遍存在一种担忧，即从战场归来的士兵将成为独立运动的领导者。据Frank Furedi所说，这种担忧是由于殖民统治在第一次世界大战期间，然后在第二次世界大战期间更是如此，无法再捍卫其先前声称的“道德权威”。即使并非是来自殖民地的退役士兵推动了独立斗争（1999，整篇），但将土著士兵部署于其殖民统治者的利益中确实影响了后殖民地时期的发展。因为当军队在许多后殖民地国家成为新的统治者时，他们运用了他们在殖民地军队中获得的知识和实践。 当越来越多的前殖民地在第二次世界大战结束后获得独立时，许多欧洲定居者和企业家受到了沉重打击，但总的来说，这并没有导致母国遭受任何重大经济损失，从而证明了一直将殖民统治视为坏生意的每个人都是正确的。 第6章 在大都市资本主义国家中工业资本主义的驯化 总结过去一百年资本主义的发展，罗伯特·卡斯特尔(Robert Castel)使用了“资本主义的文明化”(1996/2000，第401页)这一表达，而埃蒂安·巴里巴(Etienne Balibar)将这一过程描述为“正常化”(2009，第111页)。我更喜欢使用“驯化”这一表达。这种术语的选择并非偶然。当使用“资本主义的文明化”这一表达时，卡斯特尔主要是指社会政策的发展，而“正常化”和“驯化”强调了资本主义劳动关系中的剥削暴力随着时间的推移成为日常现象，从某种意义上成为政治和社会系统的一种制度——而“驯化”进一步暗示即使达到了这种状态，它仍然可能处于危险之中。这里所描述的“驯化”是在一个资本主义占有明显围绕国家结构定位的历史阶段开始的。驯化的核心特征是实现和实践属于工会的权利以及参与工会斗争和工业行动。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Capitalist state power regards rule over movements of the body and efforts of the mind in businesses by private entities as the mere legal application of the right to command the use of one’s private property. These conditions did not become ‘normal’ simply because alternative ways of living and survival disappeared or waned. Instead, the normalisation of capitalist labour relations took place only through those disciplinary practices that were to be found not only in factories, but also in the practices of poor relief, injudicial proceedings and in social discourses. It was only when state authorities, public discourses, and daily coercion had instilled the principles in men and women that life as dependent workers is natural, that state authorities defined dependent work as a private relation. This process has been described above with examples of developments in Prussia, France, England and the United States. However, privatisation as it was thus imposed cannot per se be equated with the domestication of capitalism, which only came about when capitalist states allowed trade unions to reduce structural disadvantages of the bargaining position of individual wage earners by collectively representing their members’ interests. It was only with the legalisation of trade unions and strikes that industrial action called out and led by trade unions became institutions of capitalism in the metropolitan countries of capitalism.4 And thus what Pierre Bourdieu said of all domination became true: Once domination has been institutionalised, it no longer has to be exercised through ‘day to day violence’ (1972/1979, pp. 366f.). The legalisation of trade union action and its eventual recognition by the ‘negotiating partners’ has turned the capitalist mode of production into a private form of rule or domination. In societies with domesticated capitalism, state violence is only resorted to when the stability of these relations of dominance is under threat or appears to be so. Otherwise, the contractual conditions of capitalist wage labour are considered to be the corollary of a state-accepted social institution. This development has not been unilinear. Nor can a direct connection be made between the state of industrialisation and renunciation of the use of state and private violence against organised labour. Moreover, despite international influences and international efforts to organise,5 conflicts have been specific to nations. However, in one respect, national historical processes have converged: Au-thorities initially saw collective struggles of workers as the long known and feared revolts of the lower classes, and therefore as breaches of public order. In order to quell them, they disposed of penal laws and nationally and locally specific traditions regarding the use of armed violence. Everywhere, trade union action was initially dealt with according to these traditional rules. In other words, they were not only understood and treated as a challenge to the capital owner(s) concerned, but as a disturbance to public order and thus as a challenge to the state. It was the turning away from this regulatory policy that made the domestication of capitalism possible. It was not until the upheaval of the Second World War that it was generalised in the capitalist mother countries. This was not the case in the colonies.6 Although in the 1940s politicians in English and French colonies were increasingly prepared to accept strikes as permissible forms of dispute, this was not enough to prevent mass protests against a policy that declassed natives as ‘natives’. The prerequisites for domesticating capitalism were lacking in all of the colonies. What they would have consisted of can, in a sense, be inferred from the domestication of capitalism in the colonial mother countries. England When, at the end of the eighteenth century, numerous workers in industrial plants jointly demanded that their working days be shortened and their wages increased, the government (under William Pitt the Younger) interpreted this as a development that could lead to French conditions. Although it was already possible to punish associations according to the doctrine of ‘criminal conspiracy’ handed down in common law, special laws were passed against ‘Combinations of Workmen’ in 1799 and 1800. From then on, two judges could use summary proceedings to impose prison sentences of up to three months on workers who organised collective action to demand wage increases. While these laws were primarily directed against collective resistance, some of the penal provisions contained in the Master and Servant Act were also considerably exacerbated in 1823 (Steinfeld 2001, pp. 47 k). A broad political campaign had developed, not so much against this exacerbation, but against the prohibition of association. It was successful in 1824. However, when numerous strikes broke out after the repeal of the incriminated laws, a new penal code was passed in 1825. It no longer prohibited workers’ associations as a matter of principle, but it did prohibit practices such as picketing that were intended to force workers to participate in the strike. The change in the legal situation was related to a fundamental change in the practice of rule by the dominant classes. For centuries, public order in England had been the responsibility of magistrates (Justices of the Peace, appointed by the Crown and not professional). The most important basis for their decisions was their own discretion, in most cases the views of the socially dominant circles in their area of responsibility. The judges were responsible for ensuring social and thus political ‘peace’. Their tasks included regulating working conditions and prices and settling labour disputes. The military could be called upon to counter insurrections, but judges mainly fulfilled their police duties by imposing brutal punishments on individual ‘evildoers’, while the aim was to mediate in the case of demands made jointly by the poor. This also applied to labour disputes (Marshall 1974, passim). In the political crisis years at the turn of the century, many no longer considered this practice appropriate. The practice of official authority was now no longer to be used to regulate issues of public peace according to generally accepted principles. Instead, the protection of private property, including the resulting power of disposal of capital owners, was to become the exclusive yardstick (Gerstenberger 1990/2006, p. 298). In order to enforce these new standards even against ‘old-fashioned’ justices of the peace, interested circles demanded and achieved a formalisation of regulatory policy. The Combination Laws as well as the revision of the Master and Servant Act are part and parcel of this context. Since the beginning of industrialisation, workers’ protests in England - at a time when it was not yet possible to call it a real ‘movement’ - regularly formulated demands on the state. The campaign for the abolition of the Corn Laws, which had been designed to prevent grain imports from entering the country so as to guarantee landowners incomes, lasted three decades.7 For many decades, petitions and protest meetings called for a reform of the law regulating the right to vote that would also give residents in the rapidly growing industrial cities a chance to be represented in parliament. When many thousands of people gathered at St. Peter’s Field in Manchester on 16 August 1819 for a rally - their number is not certain, but it was at least 30,000 - women and men carried posters with both demands. Local authorities feared that a revolt might develop. They decided to arrest the announced speakers and dissolve the rally. To this end, a large number of armed men, both regular military units and militia units, had been kept on standby. When the square was so crowded that ‘the hats [of the demonstrators] touched’, the speakers were arrested and then a cavalry unit was ordered to disband the rally. 120 cavalrymen with drawn sabres entered the crowd, which had no way to escape. There are reports of 11 (or 15) dead and at least 400 (but perhaps 700) injured, including many women.8 There were protests both in Manchester and nationwide over the action, for which the Manchester Observer introduced the still commonly used name Peterloo Massacre. Because they were attacked by mounted men, many of the injured and dead had sabre wounds on their heads, while others had been bayoneted. On the lists drawn up later, a total of 357 people were recorded to have been trampled or crushed, some of them after having been injured by sabres or bayonets before. Six of them died of these injuries (Marrow 1994, p. 99). The Crown Prince paid tribute to the local authorities, newspapers were controlled and repeatedly banned, and a few months later the infamous Six Acts were enacted. They contained restrictions on the right of assembly and the prohibition of unauthorised carrying of weapons. By the end of 1820, all of the better-known labour leaders were in prison. But the massacre had other effects as well. One of them was reported in the Times on 14 September 1819. When one of the demonstrators - the fugitives’ panic had left him with a dislocated shoulder and injured elbow and the cavalry attack with a head injury - came to the Royal Infirmary for treatment, one of the doctors said to him, ‘You will probably never attend another reform rally’. The injured man replied, ‘Yes, I will, when I can do so again. The last rally made it very clear that reform is more necessary than ever’. He was made to leave without treatment and to walk the seven miles home in his bad condition (quoted in Marrow 1994, p. 97). The campaigns to reform the electoral law and abolish the Corn Laws continued. After the 1830 revolution in France, fear of revolution in England led to a suffrage reform in 1832. It helped the ‘middle classes’ gain a little more influence, but not wage workers. Instead, the new poor law enacted in 1834 adapted the previous policy of industrial capitalism towards the poor. The law replaced the traditional obligation of hometowns with jurisdiction of place of residence - an administratively indispensable measure for coping with the influx of ‘strangers’ into industrial cities. With the infamous workhouse test, the law institutionalised a state-authorised suspicion of aversion to work towards anyone and everyone in need. There was local resistance against the application of the new law. Moreover, indignation about this legislation brought new recruits to the movement, which had been aimed at improving the terms of an electoral law in order to offer better opportunities for representation, not just for the middle classes. From 1835 onwards, the Chartist movement grew, which owed its name to the fact that the Working Men’s Association had drawn up a charter with six fundamental reform demands and submitted it to Parliament. But in vain. Leading members of the Chartist movement were arrested. However, a law was passed in 1847 that limited the working day to ten hours. And in 1848, the Corn Laws were abolished. Although this did not herald a general era of reform, negotiating practices were now developing in some sectors. Less frequently than before, entrepreneurs asked for armed support to defend their ‘bargaining position’. Nevertheless, the leaders and participants in workers’ protests continued to face risks of being indicted for criminal conspiracy under common law or unlawful association under combination laws. In addition, individual workers continued to be convicted under the Master and Servant Act. In 1875, this law was abolished. According to Deakin, the legal figure of the servant, which had been present in this law for centuries, nevertheless shaped the jurisdiction in England until the twentienth century (2001, passim).”翻译为中文","output":"资本主义国家权力将对个体企业中身体活动和精神努力的统治视为对使用私人财产指挥权的合法应用。这些条件之所以成为“正常”，并非仅仅因为生存和生活的其他方式消失或衰弱。相反，资本主义劳动关系的正常化只是通过那些不仅存在于工厂，而且存在于贫困救济实践、司法程序和社会话语中的纪律实践才实现的。只有当国家权力、公共话语和日常强制将作为依赖工人生活是自然的原则灌输给男性和女性时，国家权力才将依赖工作定义为私人关系。这一过程已经通过前述普鲁士、法国、英格兰和美国的发展实例进行了描述。 然而，这种被强加的私有化本身并不能等同于资本主义的驯化，后者只有在资本主义国家允许工会通过集体代表其成员的利益来减少个别工资收入者谈判地位的结构性劣势时才出现。只有在工会和罢工合法化之后，由工会发起和领导的工业行动才成为资本主义大都市国家的制度。因此，皮埃尔·布迪厄所说的所有统治变得成立：一旦统治被制度化，就不再需要通过“日常暴力”来执行了（1972/1979，第366f页）。 工会行动的合法化及其最终被“谈判伙伴”承认，将资本主义生产方式转变为私人形式的统治或支配。在驯化了资本主义的社会中，只有当这些统治关系的稳定受到威胁或看似如此时，才会诉诸国家暴力。否则，资本主义工资劳动的合约条件被视为国家认可的社会制度的必然结果。这一发展并非单一线性。也不能直接将工业化状态与放弃使用国家和私人暴力对抗有组织劳工之间建立直接联系。此外，尽管有国际影响和国际组织努力，冲突仍然具有国家特异性。 然而，在某种程度上，国家历史进程有所汇聚：当局最初将工人的集体斗争视为长期已知且害怕的下层阶级叛乱，因此视为公共秩序的破坏。为了压制它们，他们动用了刑法和关于使用武装暴力的国家和地方特定传统。最初，工会行动根据这些传统规则被处理。换句话说，它们不仅被理解和处理为对相关资本所有者的挑战，而且作为对公共秩序和因此对国家的挑战。转变这种监管政策使资本主义的驯化成为可能。直到第二次世界大战的动荡，这一过程才在资本主义母国中得到普遍化。 在殖民地并非如此。尽管在20世纪40年代，英国和法国殖民地的政治家们越来越愿意接受罢工作为可允许的争议形式，但这还不足以防止针对将本地人贬低为“土著”的政策的大规模抗议。所有殖民地都缺乏驯化资本主义的先决条件。从殖民地母国资本主义的驯化中，可以在某种程度上推断出这些条件本应由什么构成。 英国 当十八世纪末，众多工业厂房的工人共同要求缩短工作日和增加工资时，政府（在小威廉·皮特领导下）将其解释为可能导致法国情况的发展。尽管根据普通法传统的“刑事共谋”原则已经可以惩罚协会，但在1799年和1800年通过了针对“工人组合”的特别法律。从那时起，两名法官可以使用简易程序对组织集体行动要求加薪的工人处以最高三个月的监禁。尽管这些法律主要针对集体抵抗，但1823年《主人和仆人法》中包含的一些刑事条款也被大幅加重（Steinfeld 2001，第47k页）。一场广泛的政治运动不是针对这种加剧，而是针对禁止结社的运动。它在1824年取得了成功。然而，当被指控的法律废除后爆发了大量罢工时，1825年通过了一部新的刑法典。它不再原则上禁止工人组织，但它确实禁止了旨在强迫工人参与罢工的做法，如纠察。 法律状况的变化与支配阶级统治实践的根本变化相关。几个世纪以来，英格兰的公共秩序由地方法官（非专业的、由皇冠任命的治安法官）负责。他们决策的最重要依据是他们自己的判断，在大多数情况下是他们负责区域内社会主导阶层的观点。法官负责确保社会，从而是政治的“和平”。他们的任务包括规范工作条件和价格以及解决劳资纠纷。军队可以被调用来对抗叛乱，但法官主要是通过对个别“恶人”施加残酷惩罚来履行他们的警察职责，而在面对穷人的共同要求时，目标是进行调解。这也适用于劳资纠纷（Marshall 1974，一贯如此）。在世纪之交的政治危机年中，许多人不再认为这种做法合适。官方权力的实践现在不再应该用来根据普遍接受的原则调节公共和平问题。相反，保护私有财产，包括由此产生的资本所有者的处置权，应该成为唯一的标准（Gerstenberger 1990/2006，第298页）。为了即使对抗“老派”治安法官也能执行这些新标准，有关方面要求并实现了监管政策的正式化。组合法以及《主人和仆人法》的修订是这一背景的一部分。 自工业化开始以来，英格兰的工人抗议活动——在尚不能称之为真正“运动”的时候——定期对国家提出要求。废除玉米法案的运动持续了三十年，该法案旨在阻止谷物进口，以保证地主的收入。几十年来，请愿书和抗议集会要求改革选举法，也让迅速增长的工业城市的居民有机会在议会中获得代表权。当成千上万的人们于1819年8月16日在曼彻斯特的圣彼得场地聚集参加集会时——他们的人数不确定，但至少有30,000人——男女携带着两项要求的海报。地方当局担心可能会发展成叛乱。他们决定逮捕宣布的演讲者并解散集会。为此，一大批武装人员，包括正规军单位和民兵单位，已被保持在待命状态。当广场上人满为患以至于“示威者的帽子相触”时，演讲者被逮捕，然后下令一支骑兵部队解散集会。120名拔剑的骑兵冲入人群，人群无处可逃。有报告说有11（或15）人死亡，至少400（但可能700）人受伤，包括许多女性。关于这次行动，曼彻斯特和全国都发生了抗议，为此《曼彻斯特观察家》引入了仍然普遍使用的名称“彼得卢大屠杀”。因为被骑兵攻击，许多受伤和死亡者的头部都有刀伤，而其他人则被刺刀刺伤。在后来制作的名单上，共有357人被记录为被践踏或压伤，其中一些人在被刀刃或刺刀伤害之前就已经受伤了。其中六人死于这些伤害（Marrow 1994，第99页）。王储向地方当局表示敬意，报纸被控制并多次被禁，几个月后颁布了臭名昭著的六法令。它们包含了对集会权利的限制和禁止未经授权携带武器的规定。到1820年底，所有较为知名的工人领袖都入狱了。但是大屠杀还有其他影响。其中之一于1819年9月14日在《泰晤士报》上报道。当一名示威者——逃亡者的恐慌使他脱臼的肩膀和受伤的肘部以及骑兵袭击造成的头部伤害——来到皇家医院接受治疗时，一名医生对他说，“你可能再也不会参加另一次改革集会了”。受伤的人回答说，“是的，我会的，当我再能做到的时候。上次集会非常清楚地表明，改革比以往任何时候都更加必要”。他被要求不接受治疗离开，并以他糟糕的状态走了七英里回家（引述自Marrow 1994，第97页）。 改革选举法和废除玉米法的运动继续进行。1830年法国革命之后，英格兰对革命的恐惧导致了1832年的选举改革。它帮助“中产阶级”获得了更多的影响力，但工资工人并未受益。相反，1834年颁布的新贫困法适应了工业资本主义对贫困者的先前政策。该法律用居住地管辖权取代了传统的故乡义务——这是一个行政上不可或缺的措施，用于应对“外来者”涌入工业城市。随着臭名昭著的工作院测试，该法律将对任何需要帮助的人普遍怀疑其厌恶工作的态度制度化。新法律的应用遭到了当地的抵抗。此外，对这项立法的愤慨为旨在改善选举法条款以提供更好的代表机会的运动，不仅仅是为中产阶级带来了新的招募。从1835年开始，宪章运动成长起来，因为工人协会起草了一项包含六项基本改革要求的宪章并提交给了议会，但都是徒劳的。宪章运动的主要成员被逮捕。然而，一项法律于1847年通过，将工作日限制为十小时。1848年，玉米法被废除。 尽管这并未预示着一般改革时代的到来，但在某些领域现在正在发展谈判实践。企业家请求武装支持来捍卫他们的“谈判地位”的频率不如以往那样高。尽管如此，工人抗议的领导者和参与者仍然面临以普通法下的刑事共谋或组合法下的非法结社被起诉的风险。此外，个别工人继续根据《主人和仆人法》被定罪。该法律于1875年被废除。根据Deakin的说法，这一法律中存在了几个世纪的仆人法律人物，然而塑造了直到二十世纪的英格兰司法管辖权（2001，一贯如此）。"},{"instruction":"вывод текущего года vue 3 js","output":"Для вывода текущего года в приложении на Vue 3 вы можете использовать следующий подход.

Это свойство автоматически распределяет свободное пространство вдоль главной оси контейнера и тем самым \\"толкает\\" третий элемент к нижней части контейнера. В данном случае, предполагая, что у вас есть три элемента внутри \`.page\` и вы хотите поместить последний элемент (третий) в самом низу, добавьте к третьему элементу класс с \`margin-top: auto;\`. Вот пример: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"page\\"> <div class=\\"element\\">Элемент 1</div> <div class=\\"element\\">Элемент 2</div> <div class=\\"element bottom-element\\">Элемент 3</div> </div> \`\`\` \`\`\`css .page { display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; position: absolute; top: 70%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); gap: 40px; /* Убедитесь, что у .page достаточная высота, чтобы третий элемент мог уйти вниз.*/ min-height: 100vh; /* пример */ } .element.bottom-element { margin-top: auto; } \`\`\` Этот стиль автоматически применит к третьему элементу (\`bottom-element\`) вертикальный отступ сверху так, чтобы он переместился вниз, независимо от размеров предыдущих элементов.

В данном случае, например, минимальная высота установлена как \`100vh\`, что означает 100% от высоты видимой области браузера."},{"instruction":"третий элемент исчезает из поля видимости","output":"Если третий элемент исчезает из поля видимости при использовании данного подхода, это может произойти по нескольким причинам, связанным с размерами и позиционированием элементов. Вот несколько возможных решений для этой проблемы: # 1. Увеличение минимальной высоты контейнера \`.page\` Убедитесь, что минимальная высота \`.page\` достаточно велика, чтобы вместить все ваши элементы, даже если это приведёт к тому, что некоторые из них окажутся за пределами первоначальной видимой области. \`\`\`css .page { /* другие стили */ min-height: 100vh; /* или попробуйте увеличить значение, если 100vh недостаточно */ } \`\`\` # 2. Проверка высоты контента и области просмотра Если элементы вместе занимают больше места, чем область просмотра, третий элемент может оказаться слишком низко. В таком случае, вы можете убедиться, что высота \`.page\` адекватно настроена, возможно, добавив \`height: auto;\` и убедившись, что родитель этого элемента может расширяться. # 3. Скроллинг Другим подходом является разрешение скроллинга для контейнера \`.page\` (или для всей страницы), чтобы пользователь мог прокрутить вниз и увидеть третий элемент. \`\`\`css .page { /* другие стили */ overflow-y: auto; /* или 'scroll' */ } \`\`\` # 4. Использование flex-grow для растягивания элементов Вы можете попробовать использовать \`flex-grow\` на элементах перед третьим, чтобы они занимали доступное пространство и тем самым \\"толкали\\" третий элемент вниз. \`\`\`css .element { flex-grow: 1; } \`\`\` Это может способствовать более динамичному распределению пространства в зависимости от содержимого этих элементов. # 5. Проверьте позиционирование и трансформацию Абсолютное позиционирование в сочетании с трансформацией (\`translate(-50%, -50%)\`) может также влиять на видимость элементов, особенно если размер \`.page\` или его содержимого больше, чем ожидалось. Возможно, вам придется отрегулировать \`top\` и \`left\` или убрать трансформацию. В зависимости от вашей конкретной реализации и желаемого дизайна, некоторые из этих предложений могут быть более подходящими, чем другие.

Все элементы внутри \`.container\` будут пытаться занять центральное положение как по горизонтали, так и по вертикали благодаря \`justify-content: center;\` и \`align-items: center;\`. - Свойство \`height: 100vh;\` задаёт высоту контейнера равной 100% высоты видимой области браузера, что помогает центрировать содержимое вертикально. - Третий элемент (\`bottom-element\`) позиционируется абсолютно относительно ближайшего родителя с относительным, абсолютным, или фиксированным позиционированием (в этом случае \`<body>\`), и смещается вниз страницы (\`bottom: 0;\`), что позволяет ему прижиматься к нижней части видимой области независимо от других элементов.

Как интерпретировать коэффиуциент корреляции Спирмена по их результатам и общим резам","output":"Коэффициент корреляции рангов Спирмена используется для измерения степени связи между двумя переменными, значения которых выражены в порядковой шкале, или для оценки монотонных (не обязательно линейных) связей между количественными переменными. Это непараметрический метод, который ранжирует данные и изучает, как ранги одной переменной ассоциированы с рангами другой переменной. Коэффициент может принимать значения от -1 до 1, где 1 указывает на идеальную прямую связь между переменными, -1 — на идеальную обратную связь, а 0 — на отсутствие связи. Если в ваших шкалах 10 и 32 элемента, то, вероятно, вы имеете дело с двумя разными выборками или группами наблюдений, и вы хотите оценить, есть ли статистически значимая корреляция между рангами данных выборок. Вот как вы можете интерпретировать коэффициент корреляции Спирмена в таком контексте: 1. **Вычисление коэффициента:** Сначала вам нужно присвоить ранги всем наблюдениям в каждой шкале. Если в одной из ваших шкал 10 элементов, а в другой — 32, возможно, вы исследуете связь между более общим и более частным аспектами чего-либо, или у вас есть общие данные для сравнения с более детальным набором. После ранжирования вы вычисляете разницы между рангами для пар данных, возведете эти разницы в квадрат, суммируете и вставите в формулу коэффициента корреляции Спирмена. 2. **Интерпретация значения коэффициента:** - **Близко к 1:** Это указывает на сильную положительную связь между рангами ваших данных. Чем выше значение в одном наборе данных, тем выше соответствующее значение в другом. - **Близко к -1:** Это говорит о сильной обратной связи между переменными. Чем выше значение в одной шкале, тем ниже оно в другой. - **Близко к 0:** Это означает, что между рангами данных прямая или обратная связь отсутствует или слабо выражена. 3. **Статистическая значимость:** Для оценки того, является ли наблюдаемая корреляция статистически значимой, обычно проводится тест, например, t-тест для коэффициента Спирмена. Это поможет определить, могла ли наблюдаемая корреляция возникнуть случайно. Имейте в виду, что если ваши шкалы содержат разное количество элементов (как в вашем случае), сравнение и интерпретация должны проводиться с осторожностью. Убедитесь, что вы правильно сопоставили данные между шкалами, если это необходимо, и что сравниваемые элементы действительно соответствуют друг другу по смыслу. Возможно, вам придется адаптировать данные или использовать только часть из них для корректного сравнения."},{"instruction":"spss мне пишет, что корреляция значима на уровне 0.01 или 0.05, что это значит","output":"Если в SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) в результате анализа корреляции получается, что корреляция значима на уровне 0.01 или 0.05, это относится к уровню значимости (p-значению) статистического теста. Уровень значимости p-значение — это вероятность получить наблюдаемые (или более экстремальные) результаты, если на самом деле нулевая гипотеза верна. Нулевая гипотеза в контексте теста корреляции обычно утверждает отсутствие связи (корреляции) между двумя переменными. - **Значимость на уровне 0.05** означает, что вероятность ошибочно заключить о наличии корреляции между переменными, когда на самом деле ее нет (ошибка первого рода), составляет 5%. Соответственно, есть 95% уверенности в том, что обнаруженная корреляция не является случайной. - **Значимость на уровне 0.01** указывает на еще более низкую вероятность — 1%, что обнаруженная корреляция могла произойти случайно, и на 99% можно быть уверенным в ее реальном существовании. Таким образом, когда SPSS показывает, что корреляция значима на уровне 0.01 или 0.05, это означает, что обнаруженная взаимосвязь между двумя переменными является статистически значимой, и вероятность того, что такая взаимосвязь возникла случайно, очень низка. Чем ниже p-значение, тем более убедительны доказательства против нулевой гипотезы и, следовательно, тем сильнее доказательство наличия связи между анализируемыми переменными. Важно помнить, что статистическая значимость не говорит нам о силе связи между переменными, а лишь о том, что связь вероятно не случайна. Для оценки силы связи следует смотреть на сам коэффициент корреляции (например, коэффициент корреляции Пирсона или Спирмена), который отражает степень линейной или монотонной связи между переменными."},{"instruction":"Проанализируйте содержание пунктов, которые показали значимую связь с результатами по шкале и соотнесите их с общим содержанием конструкта из пункта 1.1. Отметьте, какие части измеряемого вами конструкта по содержанию покрывает ваш опросник после удаления пунктов, показавших слабую связь со шкалой (из пункта 4.3.1), а так же удаления пунктов, снижающих надёжность шкалы (из пункта 4.2.3). как это сделать в spss","output":"Чтобы проанализировать содержание пунктов в SPSS, которые показали значимую связь с результатами по шкале, и соотнести их с общим содержанием конструкта, а также определить, какие части измеряемого конструкта покрывает опросник после удаления несвязанных и снижающих надёжность пунктов, необходимо провести ряд аналитических шагов. Ниже описан процесс, который поможет выполнить задачу: # 1. Оценка значимой связи пунктов с шкалой Для начала нужно определить, какие пункты показывают значимую связь с общим результатом по шкале. Это может быть сделано путём расчёта коэффициентов корреляции между каждым пунктом и общим результатом, использовать можно коэффициент корреляции Пирсона или Спирмена в зависимости от типа распределения и соблюдения предпосылок статистических тестов. В SPSS это делается через меню: \`Analyze -> Correlate -> Bivariate...\`, выбираются переменные и опции анализа. # 2. Анализ надёжности шкалы Чтобы оценить, какие пункты снижают надёжность шкалы, можно использовать анализ внутренней согласованности (например, коэффициент Кронбаха альфа). В SPSS это делается через \`Analyze -> Scale -> Reliability Analysis...\`. Включите все позиции шкалы и просмотрите статистику \\"Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted\\" для каждого пункта, чтобы увидеть, как изменится надёжность шкалы при удалении каждого пункта. # 3. Удаление пунктов После анализа вы удалите пункты, которые показали слабую связь (основываясь на низких коэффициентах корреляции) с результатами по шкале и пункты, удаляемые для улучшения надёжности шкалы (исходя из анализа внутренней согласованности). # 4. Сравнение с общим содержанием конструкта После удаления несоответствующих пунктов необходимо сравнить оставшиеся пункты с теоретическим описанием измеряемого конструкта (пункт 1.1). Это сделать сложнее всего, так как данный шаг требует качественного анализа и теоретических знаний по изучаемой теме. Необходимо оценить, насколько полно оставшиеся пункты охватывают все аспекты конструкта, который вы пытались измерить, и определить, не привело ли удаление пунктов к потере важных измерений. # 5. Выводы На основе сравнения с теоретической моделью конструкта и анализа оставшихся пунктов делаются выводы о том, насколько адекватно и полно текущий опросник отражает изучаемый конструкт после исключения определённых пунктов. Важно отметить, что SPSS отлично подходит для проведения количественного анализа данных, но качественный анализ содержания пунктов и их соответствие теоретическому конструкту требует прямой работы исследователя с теоретическим материалом и данными за пределами статистического программного обеспечения."},{"instruction":"Оцените связь результатов по вашей шкале и второй шкале, которую вы выбрали для валидизации.

Эти же шаги подходят и для оценки связи каждого отдельного пункта вашей шкалы со второй шкалой: # 1. Подготовка данных Перед началом анализа убедитесь, что данные по обеим шкалам (вашей и выбранной для валидизации) корректно введены в SPSS и что для каждого испытуемого имеются соответствующие значения по обеим шкалам. # 2. Расчёт корреляции между шкалами Для оценки общей связи между вашей шкалой и шкалой для валидизации: - Выберите в меню \`Analyze -> Correlate -> Bivariate...\`. - В окне выбора переместите общие результаты по каждой шкале в правое поле для анализа. - Указаны ли переменные как хотя бы на уровне интервалов (продолжительность), выберите корреляцию Пирсона. Для порядковых данных используйте Спирмена. - Нажмите \`OK\`, и SPSS выведет таблицу корреляций. **Интерпретация**: Если коэффициент корреляции статистически значим (обычно p < 0.05 или p < 0.01), то между шкалами существует значимая связь. Высокий положительный коэффициент (близкий к 1) подтверждает конструктную валидность вашей шкалы по отношению к выбранной шкале для валидизации, предполагая, что обе шкалы измеряют схожие или связанные конструкты. # 3. Оценка связи каждого пункта с валидационной шкалой Чтобы оценить связь каждого пункта вашей шкалы с общим результатом по шкале для валидизации: - Повторите процедуру, описанную в пункте 2, но в качестве переменных для анализа выберите каждый пункт вашей шкалы по отдельности и общий результат по шкале для валидизации. **Интерпретация**: Каждый пункт, который значимо коррелирует с валидационной шкалой, может быть интерпретирован как имеющий доказательства конструктной валидности. Пункты, которые не показывают значимой связи, могут быть рассмотрены для пересмотра или исключения, так как они могут не вносить вклад в измерение целевого конструкта. # 4. Выделение пунктов без свидетельств конструктной валидности На основе результатов второго и третьего шагов вы можете выделить те пункты вашей шкалы, для которых не было получено достаточно свидетельств поддержки конструктной валидности. Этот анализ позволяет вам уточнить, какие аспекты измеряемого конструкта нуждаются в дальнейшем развитии или дополнительной проверке. # Заключение Этот статистический анализ в SPSS позволяет оценить связь между вашей шкалой и валидационной шкалой, а также выделить отдельные пункты вашей шкалы, требующие дополнительного внимания.

Для оценки связи используйте коэффициент КД, описанный в конце раздела 4.3.1.

Хотя в SPSS непосредственно коэффициент КД не рассчитывается \\"в один клик\\", эту задачу можно выполнить, определив группы и используя доступные статистические тесты. # Шаг 1: Определение групп по процентилям Перед вычислением связи необходимо классифицировать вашу выборку на группы высоких и низких значений по шкале. Это можно сделать, определив 33-й и 66-й процентили по результатам: 1. В SPSS перейти в \`Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies...\`. 2. Переместить вашу шкалу в переменные для анализа. 3. Нажать \`Statistics...\` и отметить \`Percentile Values\`. 4. Ввести значения 33 и 66 в поле, чтобы определить соответствующие процентили. # Шаг 2: Создание новой переменной для групп На основе полученных процентилей вы можете создать новую переменную, которая будет классифицировать каждого участника как имеющего высокие или низкие результаты: 1. Выберите \`Transform > Compute Variable...\`. 2. Введите имя новой переменной, например, \`Group_HighLow\`. 3. В поле \`Numeric Expression\` введите условие, используя полученные процентильные значения. Это будет выглядеть примерно так: \`IF(Your_Scale <= 33rd_Percentile, 0, IF(Your_Scale >= 66th_Percentile, 1, НА))\`. Это создаст переменную, где \`0\` обозначает низкие значения, \`1\` — высокие, а промежуточные значения могут быть исключены или обозначены как \`НА\` (не применимо). # Шаг 3: Анализ связи с полом Теперь, когда у вас есть категоризированная переменная с высокими и низкими группами, а также переменная пола, вы можете анализировать связь между ними. Это можно сделать, используя методы кросс-табуляции или точный тест Фишера для малых выборок: 1. В SPSS перейти в \`Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Crosstabs...\`. 2. Переместить переменную пола в строку (Row) и вашу новую переменную \`Group_HighLow\` в столбец (Column). 3. Нажать на кнопку \`Statistics...\` и выбрать \`Chi-square\` и, если необходимо, \`Exact\`. 4. Проверить таблицу сопряженности и выходные данные хи-квадрата. Если (p)-значение полученного результатата меньше уровня значимости (например, (p < 0.05)), можно считать, что связь между полом и группой по шкале статистически значима. **Важно:** Приведенный метод является приближенной процедурой для определения связи между группами и полом на основе процентилей и последующего анализа.

Вот как это делается: # Шаг 1: Интерпретация таблицы кросс-табуляции Таблица сопряженности (кросс-табуляция) покажет распределение частот между группами (высокие и низкие по вашей шкале) и полом участников (например, мужчины и женщины). Это дает первоначальное представление о том, распределяются ли мужчины и женщины равномерно по высоким и низким группам вашей шкалы или нет. # Шаг 2: Статистика хи-квадрат Статистика хи-квадрат позволит вам определить, есть ли статистически значимая разница в распределении между мужчинами и женщинами по вашим группам. Вот как ее интерпретировать: - **p-значение (Significance)**: Это ключ к интерпретации. Если p-значение меньше заданного уровня значимости (например, p < 0.05), вы заключаете, что между полом и группами по вашей шкале существует статистически значимая связь. Это означает, что пол вероятно влияет на то, в какую группу (высокая или низкая по вашей шкале) попадает участник. - Если p-значение больше уровня значимости (например, p > 0.05), это говорит о том, что связь между полом и результатами по вашей шкале статистически не значима, то есть разницы в распределении мужчин и женщин по группам нет или она случайна. # Пример интерпретации Допустим, вы провели анализ, и ваше p-значение составило 0.03. Это означает, что на уровне значимости 0.05 различие в распределении между мужчинами и женщинами в высокой и низкой группах вашей шкалы статистически значимо. Таким образом, можно предположить, что пол влияет на результаты, полученные по вашей шкале. Если ваши высокие и низкие группы представляют определенные психологические или физиологические характеристики, этот результат может указывать на половые различия в этих характеристиках. # Оговорки и рекомендации При интерпретации результатов важно учитывать контекст вашего исследования и теоретические предпосылки. Статистическая значимость не всегда равносильна практической значимости, поэтому результаты следует рассматривать в свете других данных и литературы по теме. В случае обнаружения значимых различий дополнительный анализ может помочь понять, как пол влияет на изучаемый конструкт и какие механизмы лежат в основе этих различий."},{"instruction":"в этом расчёте приведите данные, необходимые для линейного нормирования результатов (средний сырой балл и стандартное отклонение) и рассчитайте для каждого участника тестирования линейный стен по вашей шкале.

Прежде чем мы начнем, я напомню, что линейный стен — это способ нормирования результатов тестирования путем перехода от сырых баллов к стандартизированным значениям, обычно на шкале от 1 до 10. Эта процедура позволяет более наглядно сравнивать результаты одного участника с результатами остальной группы. **Шаг 1: Сбор необходимых данных** Для начала вам нужно будет собрать следующие данные по вашей шкале на основании результатов группы: - Средний сырой балл (M) - Стандартное отклонение сырых баллов (SD) Допустим, для примера, средний сырой балл по вашей шкале составляет 50, а стандартное отклонение — 10. **Шаг 2: Расчет линейного стена для каждого участника** Линейный стен для любого сырого балла (X) рассчитывается следующим образом: [S = 1 + 9 times frac{X - M}{SD}] где: - (S) — линейный стен, - (X) — сырой балл участника, - (M) — средний сырой балл, - (SD) — стандартное отклонение. **Пример расчета:** Пусть участник набрал сырой балл 70. Тогда его линейный стен будет: [S = 1 + 9 times frac{70 - 50}{10} = 1 + 9 times 2 = 19] Это значение выходит за рамки стандартной шкалы стенов от 1 до 10, что указывает на необходимость корректировки методики расчета или примера данных. Правильный балл должен был попасть в иной интервал. Предположим, у нас была ошибка в расчете, и участник набрал 60 баллов, тогда: [S = 1 + 9 times frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1 + 9 = 10] **Шаг 3: Распределение линейных стенов** Для демонстрации распределения линейных стенов, вам понадобится сгруппировать расчетные стены всех участников по интервалам от 1 до 10 и подсчитать количество результатов в каждом интервале. **Шаг 4: Таблица перевода накопленных баллов в стены** Чтобы преобразовать накопленные респондентом баллы в стены на основе обратного нормального распределения и процентилей, вы можете воспользоваться стандартной таблицей Z-оценок для нормального распределения. Для этого сначала рассчитайте Z-оценку для сырого балла участника: [Z = frac{X - M}{SD}] Потом используйте таблицу Z-оценок (иногда называемую таблицей нормального распределения), чтобы найти соответствующий процентиль, и, на основе этого процентиля, определите стеновое значение. Это довольно абстрактное объяснение, не вдаваясь в специфику ваших данных. Поэтому для наиболее точного и релевантного анализа вам необходимо будет использовать реальные данные вашего исследования."},{"instruction":"Кроме того, приведите таблицу перевода накопленных респондентом баллов в стены в соответствии с методологией определения табличных значений стенов (обратное нормальное распределение, основанное на оценке процентилей распределения).","output":"Для преобразования накопленных респондентом баллов в стены на основе методологии определения табличных значений стенов через обратное нормальное распределение и оценку процентилей распределения, потребуется следующая последовательность действий. Учтите, что последующие расчёты являются общими и на практике могут требовать адаптации к вашим конкретным данным и задачам. Примем для примера условные параметры распределения результатов тестирования: - **Среднее (M)**: 50 - **Стандартное отклонение (SD)**: 10 Сначала необходимо определить Z-оценку для каждого сырого балла (X), используя формулу: [Z = frac{(X - M)}{SD}] Допустим, вы хотите преобразовать сырой балл 60 в стены. Z-оценка будет: [Z = frac{(60 - 50)}{10} = 1] Используя стандартное нормальное распределение, Z-оценка в 1 соответствует примерно 84-му процентилю. Это означает, что результат выше примерно 84% всех результатов. Теперь, чтобы преобразовать это в стены (где 1 стен соответствует самым низким результатам, а 10 стенам — самым высоким), можно использовать линейное преобразование процентилей в стены. Например, разбив промежуток от 1 до 10 на 9 равных частей, которые соответствуют процентилям от 0 до 100%. В этом случае процентиль 84 попадает между 8 и 9 стенами, ближе к 9. # Таблица перевода баллов в стены: Приведём примерную таблицу для перевода сырых баллов в стены, исходя из нормального распределения и придерживаясь условных параметров. Для упрощения используем линейный подход: | Сырой балл (X) | Z-оценка | Процентиль | Стен | |---------------|----------|-----------|------| | <40 | < -1 | <16 | 1 | | 40-44 | -1 до -0.6 | 16-25 | 2 | | 45-49 | -0.5 до -0.1 | 26-34 | 3 | | 50 | 0 | ~50 | 5 | | 51-55 | 0.1 до 0.5 | 66-75 | 7 | | 56-60 | 0.6 до 1 | 76-84 | 8 | | >60 | > 1 | >84 | 9-10 | Эта табличка демонстрирует упрощённый метод перевода. Чтобы создать более точную таблицу, следует использовать детализированное обратное нормальное распределение с точными значениями процентилей для каждого возможного сырого балла.

Другими словами, если значение попадает на 90-й процентиль, это означает, что 90% наблюдений находятся ниже этого значения, а 10% — выше. Рассмотрим основные способы расчета процентиля на практике. # Используя формулировку: Для набора данных, отсортированных в порядке возрастания: [ P = (frac{N - 1}{100}) times k + 1 ] где: - ( P ) — позиция процентиля в упорядоченном наборе, - ( N ) — общее количество наблюдений в наборе данных, - ( k ) — процентиль, который вы пытаетесь найти (например, для 50-го процентиля ( k = 50 )). После вычисления значения ( P ), если это число не целое, используйте интерполяцию между ближайшими рангами, чтобы найти значение процентиля. Если ( P ) оказывается целым числом, процентиль соответствует значению данных на этой позиции. # Пример: Предположим, у вас есть данные о росте 10 людей (в см): {165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200, 205, 210} и вам нужно найти 80-й процентиль. 1. Сначала упорядочим данные: уже упорядочены. 2. Используем формулу для расчета позиции 80-го процентиля: [ P = (frac{10 - 1}{100}) times 80 + 1 = 8.2 ] Это означает, что 80-й процентиль находится между 8-м и 9-м значением в упорядоченном списке, то есть между 200 и 205 см. 3. Чтобы найти точное значение, делаем интерполяцию: [ text{Процентиль} = 200 + (205 - 200) times 0.2 = 201 ] Следовательно, 80-й процентиль роста в данной группе составляет 201 см, что означает, что 80% людей имеют рост 201 см или меньше. # Использование статистического ПО В реальных условиях, особенно при работе с большими наборами данных, расчет процентилей удобно выполнять с использованием статистического программного обеспечения или языков программирования, таких как Excel, R, Python или SPSS. В этих программах имеются встроенные функции для расчета процентилей, которые автоматизируют вычисления и интерполяцию. Например, в Excel для этой цели используется функция \`=PERCENTILE.EXC(диапазон, k/100)\` или \`=PERCENTILE.INC(диапазон, k/100)\`, в R — функция \`quantile(x, probs)\` где x — это набор данных, а probs — значение(я) процентилей в долях от 0 до 1."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After the 1830 revolution in France, fear of revolution in England led to a suffrage reform in 1832. It helped the ‘middle classes’ gain a little more influence, but not wage workers. Instead, the new poor law enacted in 1834 adapted the previous policy of industrial capitalism towards the poor. The law replaced the traditional obligation of hometowns with jurisdiction of place of residence - an administratively indispensable measure for coping with the influx of ‘strangers’ into industrial cities. With the infamous workhouse test, the law institutionalised a state-authorised suspicion of aversion to work towards anyone and everyone in need. There was local resistance against the application of the new law. Moreover, indignation about this legislation brought new recruits to the movement, which had been aimed at improving the terms of an electoral law in order to offer better opportunities for representation, not just for the middle classes. From 1835 onwards, the Chartist movement grew, which owed its name to the fact that the Working Men’s Association had drawn up a charter with six fundamental reform demands and submitted it to Parliament. But in vain. Leading members of the Chartist movement were arrested. However, a law was passed in 1847 that limited the working day to ten hours. And in 1848, the Corn Laws were abolished. Although this did not herald a general era of reform, negotiating practices were now developing in some sectors. Less frequently than before, entrepreneurs asked for armed support to defend their ‘bargaining position’. Nevertheless, the leaders and participants in workers’ protests continued to face risks of being indicted for criminal conspiracy under common law or unlawful association under combination laws. In addition, individual workers continued to be convicted under the Master and Servant Act. In 1875, this law was abolished. According to Deakin, the legal figure of the servant, which had been present in this law for centuries, nevertheless shaped the jurisdiction in England until the twentienth century (2001, passim). Initially, the legalisation of trade unions decided in 1871 had a similar fate. Because a revision of the penal code had been decided at the same time, trade unionists could still be prosecuted for coercion. Occasionally there were even further convictions for criminal conspiracy. However, a vigorous campaign led to the decision in 1875 to only count practices used in an industrial dispute as criminal in the future if its classification as criminal were valid even as the act of an individual. And a year later, another law defined more precisely what types of behaviour by organised workers should be permitted in an industrial dispute. Finally, in 1906, it was stipulated that trade unions should no longer be liable for damages caused by strikes. This facilitated the use of pickets. Between 1906 and 1910 a number of laws were passed that had been demanded by trade unionists. They covered old-age pensions, school meals, ‘fair’ wages and the ‘right to work’. By 1910, trade unions had become an interest group in capitalist society in England (Clegg, Fox, and Thompson 1964, p. 487). Nevertheless, in the same year strikers were forcibly conscripted into the military (Hobsbawm 1994/1995, p. 123). In England, both trade unionists and employers were overwhelmingly of the opinion that it was not the task of the state to regulate labour relations by law. This position, usually referred to as ‘voluntarism’, also prevailed among government authorities. Nevertheless, governments have repeatedly tried to act as mediators since the 1890s. In 1896, the Conciliation Act provided a legal basis for such attempts (Strinati 1982, p. 48). During the First World War, the government felt compelled to intervene in society and thus to become involved in industrial action on an unprecedented scale. The first of three Munitions of War Acts presented by the newly established Ministry of Munitions9 declared strikes illegal in 1915. In addition, compulsory arbitration negotiations were introduced. Wages were to be regulated by the state and workplace discipline was to be subject to state supervision. The freedom to choose one’s job was restricted to the extent that leaving a job was only allowed for those with a certificate issued by the employer. In other words, workers in the arms industry were placed under state supervision. In July 1918, this affected approximately five million people. At the same time, trade unions were forbidden to take industrial action against the employment of non-union members (Ruby 1987, p. 17). These laws concerned companies that had been declared ‘controlled companies’ by the state. They were obliged to limit themselves to ‘moderate profits’, but on the other hand could benefit from state supervision of their employees by reporting illegal behaviour to tribunals which had been especially set up for this purpose. Officially, the ministry maintained a certain neutrality in that it prohibited strategies aimed at ‘closed shops’ (i.e. the exclusive employment of trade union members), but defended the now accepted freedom of trade union organisation against employers who wanted to use the arms laws to prosecute trade union members. The actual significance of the Munitions of War Acts is controversial. They clearly did not prevent strikes. As early as 1915, the government felt compelled to dispense with applying the law it had just passed. When 200,000 miners went on strike, they should all have been punished. Instead, the ministry tried to find an arbitration that took account of the strikers’ demands. This, as Allen notes, was the first sign that the government could not help but disregard its own legislation, provided that a sufficiently large number of workers in a crucial industry violated the strike ban (Allen 1960, pp. 137-9). In point of fact, the rationalisation of production processes imposed by the war, which made the recruitment of women and other low-skilled (and unorganised) workers in the arms industry possible in the first place, triggered the emergence of a radical trade union and then political movement among professionals in the arms industry. After shop stewards had initially fought primarily against qualified workers losing their previous wage advantages and other privileges, from 1917 they concentrated on demanding better food supplies and ending the war. At the end of 1917, the Ministry of Munitions feared a revolutionary situation would arise (Hinton 1973, p. 254). On the one hand, the cabinet considered it essential to recruit qualified workers in the armaments industry for the military in the future; on the other hand, the movement calling for the opening of peace talks had grown after the Russian Revolution. The government felt compelled to negotiate with trade union leaders (Hinton 1973, chapter 10). According to Gerry R. Rubin, the Munitions of War Acts, the declared aim of which was to place working conditions in the arms industry under state super-vision,10 also contributed to this development. In fact, Rubin says, the effect of these disciplinary bodies was far from clear. Although the Glasgow tribunals, whose practice Rubin has analysed in detail, sentenced trade union leaders and strikers (sometimes with drastic penalties, but often with more symbolic fines), trade unionists also used the tribunals to denounce entrepreneurs or to publicise the behaviour of individual foremen as a reason for workers’ protests. By emphasising their embracing of the objectives of the Munitions of War Acts, they were able to portray the practices of entrepreneurs as damaging to the national interests To the extent that they succeeded in this, it was implicitly accepted that the workers in the defence industry were entitled to interpret what constituted the national interest. In a sense, it was conceded that trade unions were a legitimate part of British capitalist society. After the failure of the National Industrial Conference, founded in 1919, in which entrepreneurs and trade unions were to work together under the auspices of the state, the repeal of the Munitions of War Acts in 1921 meant state approval for the bargaining autonomy of adversaries in wage bargaining. From then on, British governments - regardless of whether the Labour Party was in government or not - limited themselves to offering to act as mediators. This, of course, did not prevent the state from continuing to use coercive force against strikers. The Emergency Powers Act of 1920 empowered the government to declare a state of emergency for a period of one month in the event of a threat to the supply of vital goods. Anyone who did not comply with the orders issued in response to this had to face severe punishment. In 1921, the declaration of a state of emergency very quickly ended a strike. During the general strike in 1926, this means was used extensively. As drastic as the measure was, it remained limited to a few situations in England (Weber 2010, p. 1092). As long as it was in force, after all until 2004, the law was applied twelve times. Unlike in France and Germany, there was no state arbitration system that would have brought state power into disputes over capitalist labour conditions. Although 1928 did not lead to the cooperation between employers and unions that some had hoped for, collective bargaining in England was now a capitalist institution in which the economic rationality of bargaining dominated over the earlier practice of direct violence. The fact that far from their own backyard, workers in British colonies continued to face brutal violence when trying to assert their interests was accepted by large sections of the English population. United States of America At a time when business in the UK had already become more or less resigned to collective bargaining, the management of large companies in the United States continued to pursue a strategy of merciless persecution of trade unionists. And both state and federal governments were still prepared to respond to management’s requests to send in gunmen to ‘put an end’ to industrial action.”翻译为中文","output":"改革选举法和废除谷物法案的运动持续进行。1830年法国革命后，英格兰对革命的恐惧导致了1832年的选举制度改革。这助于“中产阶级”获得了更多的影响力，但工资工人除外。相反，1834年颁布的新穷人法沿袭了工业资本主义对待穷人的先前政策。该法律用居住地管辖权取代了家乡的传统义务 - 这是一个在工业城市应对“外来者”涌入时行政上不可或缺的措施。通过臭名昭著的工作测验，该法律将对任何有需要的人的怠工嫌疑制度化。对新法律的应用存在地方性抵制。此外，对于这项立法的愤慨为运动带来了新的招募，这个运动旨在改善选举法的条款，以便为代表性提供更好的机会，不仅仅是为中产阶级。从1835年起，宪章运动开始增长，该运动因工人协会起草了一份包含六项基本改革要求的宪章并提交给议会而得名。但徒劳无功。宪章运动的领导成员被逮捕。然而，1847年通过了一项法律，将工作日限制为十小时。1848年，谷物法案被废除。 尽管这并没有预示着一般改革时代的到来，但现在一些领域开始发展谈判实践。与以前相比，企业家较少请求武装支持来维护他们的“谈判立场”。尽管如此，工人抗议的领导者和参与者仍面临以共谋罪或非法联合罪在普通法或联合法下被起诉的风险。此外，单个工人仍继续根据主仆法被定罪。1875年，这项法律被废除。根据Deakin的说法，这项法律中几个世纪以来一直存在的仆人法律形象，直到二十世纪仍然塑造了英格兰的管辖权（2001，各处）。 最初，1871年决定的工会合法化有着类似的命运。因为同时决定了对刑法典的修订，工会成员仍可能因胁迫而被起诉。偶尔甚至还有进一步的共谋罪定罪。然而，一场有力的运动导致1875年的决定，将来只有在其分类为个人行为的刑事行为甚至有效的情况下，才将工业争议中使用的做法视为刑事犯罪。一年后，另一项法律更准确地定义了在工业争议中允许有组织工人采取的行为类型。最终，在1906年，规定工会不再对罢工造成的损害负责。这促进了使用纠察队。在1906年至1910年间，通过了许多工会要求的法律。它们涵盖了养老金、学校餐饮、“公平”工资和“工作权”。到1910年，工会已成为英格兰资本主义社会中的一个利益集团（Clegg、Fox和Thompson 1964，第487页）。尽管如此，同年，罢工者被强制征召进军队（Hobsbawm 1994/1995，第123页）。 在英格兰，工会成员和雇主几乎一致认为，国家通过法律调节劳动关系不是其任务。这种立场，通常被称为“志愿主义”，也在政府当局中占据主导地位。尽管如此，自1890年代以来，政府已多次尝试充当调解者。1896年的调解法为此类尝试提供了法律基础（Strinati 1982，第48页）。 第一次世界大战期间，政府觉得有必要以前所未有的规模介入社会，因此开始参与工业行动。由新成立的军需品部提交的三部军需品战争法案中的第一部在1915年宣布罢工为非法行为。此外，引入了强制仲裁谈判。工资将由国家调控，工作场所纪律将受到国家监督。限制了选择工作的自由，以至于只有持有雇主签发的证书的人才允许离职。换句话说，武器工业的工人被置于国家监督之下。到1918年7月，这影响了约五百万人。同时，禁止工会对非工会成员的雇佣采取工业行动（Ruby 1987，第17页）。 这些法律涉及被国家宣布为“受控公司”的公司。他们被要求仅限于“适度利润”，但另一方面，他们可以通过向专门成立的法庭报告非法行为，从国家对其员工的监督中受益。官方上，部门保持了一定的中立，即它禁止旨在“封闭店铺”的策略（即只雇佣工会成员），但是在雇主想要利用武器法律起诉工会成员时，为现已接受的工会组织自由权辩护。 军需品战争法案的实际意义存在争议。它们显然并未阻止罢工。早在1915年，政府就感到有必要放弃实施刚刚通过的法律。当20万矿工罢工时，本应对他们所有人进行惩罚。相反，部门试图找到一个考虑到罢工者要求的仲裁办法。正如Allen所指出的，这是政府第一次表明，只要在关键行业中有足够多的工人违反罢工禁令，政府就不得不无视自己的立法（Allen 1960，第137-9页）。事实上，战争强加的生产流程的合理化，首次使得在武器工业中招募妇女和其他低技能（且无组织）工人成为可能，从而触发了武器工业专业人士中激进的工会乃至政治运动的兴起。起初，商店管理员主要是为了反对合格工人失去之前的工资优势和其他特权，从1917年开始，他们集中于要求更好的食品供应和结束战争。到1917年底，军需品部担心会出现革命局势（Hinton 1973，第254页）。一方面，内阁认为未来在军工产业中招募合格工人进入军队至关重要；另一方面，要求开启和平谈判的运动在俄国革命后增长。政府觉得有必要与工会领导人进行谈判（Hinton 1973，第10章）。 根据Gerry R. Rubin的说法，军需品战争法案的宣布目的是将武器工业的工作条件置于国家监督之下，也促成了这一发展。实际上，Rubin说，这些纪律机构的效果远非明确。尽管格拉斯哥的法庭对工会领导人和罢工者做出了判决（有时是严厉的惩罚，但往往是更象征性的罚款），工会成员也利用这些法庭来揭发企业家或公开个别领班的行为作为工人抗议的理由。通过强调他们对军需品战争法案目标的拥护，他们能够将企业家的做法描述为对国家利益的损害。在他们成功做到这一点的程度上，这就默许了国防工业的工人有权解释什么构成了国家利益。在某种意义上，承认工会是英国资本主义社会的合法部分。 在1919年成立的全国工业会议失败后，该会议旨在在国家主持下让企业家和工会合作，1921年军需品战争法案的废除意味着国家批准了工资谈判对手的谈判自主权。此后，不管工党是否执政，英国政府都限于提供充当调解者的服务。当然，这并没有阻止国家继续对罢工者使用强制力。1920年的紧急状态法授权政府在供应重要物资受到威胁时，宣布一个为期一个月的紧急状态。任何不遵守因此发布的命令的人都必须面临严厉的惩罚。1921年，紧急状态的宣布非常迅速地结束了一场罢工。在1926年的大罢工期间，广泛使用了这种手段。尽管措施很激进，但它仅限于几种情况下在英格兰使用（Weber 2010，第1092页）。只要这项法律有效，即直到2004年，该法律被施行了十二次。与法国和德国不同，英国没有国家仲裁系统，这本来会将国家权力带入资本主义劳动条件的争议中。尽管1928年并未带来一些人所期望的雇主和工会之间的合作，但集体谈判在英格兰现已成为一种资本主义机构，其中谈判的经济合理性优先于早期直接暴力的做法。英国殖民地的工人在试图维护自己的利益时仍面临残酷暴力的事实，被英国大部分民众所接受。 美利坚合众国 在英国的商业界已基本接受集体谈判时，美国大公司的管理层继续采取无情追捕工会成员的策略。而且，州和联邦政府仍准备响应管理层的请求，派遣武装力量“结束”工业行动。"},{"instruction":"请将“Until the 1930s, the overall level of unionisation among US wage labourers was comparatively low, and there were no close political ties between any of the parties and union organisations represented in Congress. The reasons for this political situation were and remain controversial.12 For the purposes of our context, we can limit ourselves to pointing to its effects. The most important of these is that union action was not legalised at a federal level until 1935 (Wagner Act). The reasoning behind this Act can be equated with a summary of the political developments that led to the domestication of capitalism. Among other things, the act states ‘experience has shown that legal protection of the right of workers to organise and bargain collectively protects business from harm ...’J3 Strictly speaking, this was not the first such law, but the legalisation of trade unions decided on four decades earlier in New York and Pennsylvania (Hattam 1993, p. i44n83; p. 1489098) had had no effect because the competent courts insisted on their traditional independence from political decisions in common law. Although they could not simply ignore the new laws, they interpreted them in such a way that they were able to continue to apply previously existent case law. This is remarkable because the courts in the United Kingdom also based their decisions on common law and yet adapted to the reforms passed by Parliament. As long as trade unions were prosecuted, this was done in both states predominantly on the basis of the doctrine of ‘criminal conspiracy’, which is handed down in common law. In the United States, charges of conspiracy were always made when joint action could be proven. Although this view did not remain unchallenged, as early as the eighteenth century the view had prevailed that the offence did not result from the content of the demands but from association. A demand that would have been accepted as legal - such as a demand for a wage increase - if it had been made by an individual, became a criminal offence if it was made by a confederation of workers (Hattam 1993, pp. 35f.). According to Victoria C. Hattam, up until the Civil War, both trade union and opposition political organisations were condemned in keeping with this doctrine, but trade unionists were not condemned particularly frequently or particularly harshly. This may be explained by the fact that at that time there were not very many industrial enterprises, even in the northern states. When workers made demands, these were therefore concerned above all with the conditions of manual labour. When in 1836, thousands (figures vary between 27,000 and 30,000) gathered in New York to protest against the sentencing of tailors who had opposed wage cuts, leaflets were distributed with the slogan: ‘The rich against the poor’ (Morning Courier and New York Enquirer, 8 June 1836; quoted in Hattam 1993, p. 85). Such a statement was in keeping with the Republican ideals that had been widespread in the United States at the turn from the eighteenth to the nineteenth centuries. It also corresponded to the economic conditions. Tailors, and with them many other workers, suffered from poor wages. However, they were paid for the fruit of their work, which they were still responsible for. That is why their economic dependence had not yet robbed them of their self-confidence as craftsmen.14 In 1842, Judge Shaw of the Massachusetts Supreme Court formulated a rationale for acquitting a group of cobblers, which made it possible to insist that common law remained valid while nevertheless taking into account that the social conditions of Massachusetts differed from those of the United Kingdom.15 Not only did organised labour continue to face charges and convictions for ‘criminal conspiracy’, but after the Civil War, invocation of the public weal and conflicts between ‘poor’ and ‘rich’ became increasingly rare in these trials. Instead, the focus was now increasingly on the disposing of capital as property without hindrance. This also changed the attitude of workers’ organisations towards this jurisdiction. While they had previously refrained from commenting on the rulings, they now demanded laws that limited the application of the conspiracy doctrine to strikes and other labour protests. The Workingmen’s Assembly, founded in 1864, was decisive. Their campaigns brought about the above-mentioned laws legalising unions in New York and Pennsylvania. Because the competent courts could not simply ignore these laws, they changed the interpretation behind the criminal provision. Since legalisation was granted on condition that strikers refrain from ‘intimidation’ of capital owners, courts now deemed that mere meetings - even the distribution of leaflets - constituted ‘intimidation’. Moreover, strikers were no longer sentenced to rather small fines of between one and ten dollars plus court costs, as was customary before the civil war, but were regularly sentenced to months or even years in prison or a workhouse (Hattam 1993, pp. 110; 147). Demands to limit the working day, to regulate the payment of wages in cash and to introduce health and safety regulations for the workplace by law suffered the same fate as the campaign against the use of the conspiracy doctrine on strikes: they were successful in that they led (at least in some states) to the adoption of corresponding laws, but were then deprived of their effect by the courts (Hattam 1993, p. 152). By claiming to represent the supreme authority in the state by law, judges dashed all the wage earners’ hopes that political reforms would improve their living conditions for a long time. The anti-trade union orientation of case law remained a constant well into the twentienth century. From the 1880s onwards, entrepreneurs applied for and courts accepted ‘injunctions’ to prevent strikes as they arose?6 Disregarding of injunction could be punished by a single judge without a formal trial. As if that were not enough, those who did not obey the injunction were also guilty of ‘contempt of court’. Although it was possible to appeal against a temporary injunction, a judgement to that effect would have come much too late in any case, even if it had been in favour of those who wanted to strike. According to Samuel Yellen, this was a kind of military jurisdiction against strikers (1936/1969, p. 126). This jurisdiction accompanied the use of police forces against strikers. According to Sidney L. Harring, they were not ordered to control ‘social unrest’ but, on the contrary, to arbitrate in favour of capital in class struggles. According to Harring, the local police played a decisive role in making the processes of industrialisation in the United States particularly violent (1983, p. 101). This did not prevent strikes any more than the case law against industrial action. At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century, smaller strikes occurred in every major industrial city. In the course of large strikes, disputes with fatalities occurred. This was the case with the Pullman strike of 1894, which was called to force management to go back on drastic wage cuts. After the American Railway Union had agreed to support the wildcat strike of railway workers in Chicago, it quickly spread nationwide.17 Strikers uncoupled Pullman sleeping cars from trains and went on strike, picketting railway companies that used them. At the request of the Pullman Board of Directors, the President of the United States ordered the dispatch of more than 10,000 police officers, US marshals and members of the National Guard to Chicago. Strikers responded with arson. Seven hundred railroad cars and several buildings were set on fire. Two months after it began, the strike was crushed. Thirteen people were killed, 57 were injured, and the chairman of the ARU, Eugene V. Debs together with other strike leaders were convicted of conspiracy?8 The report of a commission appointed by the US Senate in 1895 to investigate the strike in Chicago stated that since Pullman’s position was to limit the right of the worker to either accepting the terms offered or resigning, that position was not in keeping with the times (literal extracts from the report at Yellen 1936/1969, p. 133). But the Pullman Company was not alone. In the decades that followed, workers in the United States repeatedly put their families’ livelihoods and often their health and even their lives at risk if they decided to go on strike. Government agencies regularly provided capital owners with guns, and union leaders were regularly convicted. Conflicts were particularly fierce in the rapidly expanding mining cities of the West.19 Particularly in Colorado, more and more mining companies had become active since the late 1870s. Between 1893 and 1897 alone, over 3,000 new mining companies were founded in Colorado. National and foreign capital invested in the area. With the influx of labour, some towns grew by thousands overnight, so to speak. Many of the workers, especially immigrants from Ireland, Cornwall and Canada, had experience in mining; others had decided to stop hoping to strike it rich in the gold rush and instead to rely on regular income from mining. While they were confronted with the growing wealth of businessmen, miners themselves faced harsh working and living conditions. In the 1890s, the conflicts came to a head as entrepreneurs sought to counter the present crisis in the mining industry (especially the difficulties of selling silver) through technical innovations that enabled them to lay off workers and pay those already employed less. In 1892, miners revolted against this strategy with the support of other inhabitants of Coer d’Alene. The newly formed association of mine owners turned to the government of Idaho and the federal government. The federal government sent gunmen to break the strike, and union leaders and prominent local supporters of the strike were arrested. In 1892, while unionists were awaiting trial in Coeur d’Alene prison, convinced they would be convicted, they decided to set up the Western Federation of Miners. When they were released after their imprisonment, they put this plan into practice and brought together the miners’ organisations that had been active in the individual states up until then (Dubofsky 1985, p. 237). After seeing the support the state gave the ‘silver barons’ in Idaho and Colorado, WFM membership became convinced that concentrating on trade union negotiations, as pursued by the American Federation of Labor, had little chance of success. From 1899, WFM pursued a strategy of radical social change. Over the following years, there were repeatedly strikes. The form they took on often led them to be described as class wars. The term particularly aptly describes the strike of 1913 in the Colorado coal fields. In 1883,1893 and 1903, miners in this remote area had already gone on strike. Every time the strikes had been suppressed by the military, every time, the strike’s leaders had been fired and scabs had been hired. Because there were hardly any urban settlements in this remote area and consequently hardly any people who were not directly affected by the living and working conditions in the mines, mining companies were able to control all aspects of the lives of their workers. They owned the land, the miners’ housing, the schools and the churches. They controlled teachers and clergymen. Company representatives acted as judges, and company representatives made sure that the results of elections confirmed the prevailing conditions. To supervise the camp residents and investigate possible strike plans, the employers hired camp marshals. They acted as police officers and judges in one person, dismissing and evicting anyone who dared to voice criticism.”翻译为中文","output":"直到1930年代，美国工资劳动者的工会组织水平相对较低，并且各党派与国会中的工会组织之间没有密切的政治联系。这种政治状况的原因一直存在争议。在我们的语境中，我们可以仅指出其影响。最重要的是，直到1935年（瓦格纳法案）联邦层面上才将工会行动合法化。该法案背后的逻辑可以等同于对导致资本主义驯化的政治发展的总结。该法案声明“经验表明，法律保护工人组织和集体讨价还价的权利，保护企业免遭损害……” 严格来说，这并不是第一部此类法律，但四十年前在纽约和宾夕法尼亚决定的工会合法化（Hattam 1993，第144n83页；第148-9098页）没有产生效果，因为有权机构坚持其传统的独立于普通法中政治决策。尽管他们不能简单地忽视新法律，但他们以这样一种方式解释它们，以便继续适用先前存在的案例法。这是值得注意的，因为英国的法院也基于普通法做出决定，但却适应了议会通过的改革。只要对工会进行起诉，这主要是基于普通法中传统的“刑事共谋”原则。 在美国，只要能证明联合行动，就会提出共谋指控。尽管这种观点并非没有受到挑战，但早在十八世纪就已普遍认为，罪行并非源于要求的内容，而是源于联合行动。如果一个要求是由个人提出的，比如要求加薪，它会被接受为合法的，但如果是由工人联合会提出的，就会成为刑事犯罪（Hattam 1993，第35页）。 据维多利亚·C·哈塔姆（Victoria C. Hattam）称，直到内战前，根据这一原则，工会和反对派政治组织都被谴责，但工会成员并不特别频繁或特别严厉地被定罪。这可能是因为那时即使在北方州，也没有太多的工业企业。因此，当工人提出要求时，主要关注的是体力劳动的条件。1836年，成千上万的人（数字在27,000到30,000之间）聚集在纽约，抗议对反对削减工资的裁缝判刑，传单上分发着“富人对抗穷人”的口号（《早晨信使和纽约询问者》，1836年6月8日；引自Hattam 1993，第85页）。这样的声明符合当时美国从十八世纪到十九世纪之交广泛存在的共和主义理想。它也符合经济条件。裁缝及许多其他工人遭受低工资之苦。然而，他们还是为自己的工作成果拿到薪水，这些工作他们仍然要负责。这就是为什么他们的经济依赖还没有剥夺他们作为工匠的自信。1842年，马萨诸塞州最高法院的肖法官为一群鞋匠的无罪辩护提出了一个理由，使其有可能坚持普通法仍然有效，同时考虑到马萨诸塞州的社会条件与英国不同。不仅如此，有组织的劳动力继续面临“刑事共谋”指控和定罪，但内战后，“公共利益”的提及和“穷富之争”在这些审判中越来越少。取而代之的是越来越多地关注无障碍处理资本财产。这也改变了工人组织对此司法管辖区的态度。虽然他们之前曾避免对裁决发表评论，但现在他们要求立法限制将共谋原则应用于罢工和其他劳工抗议。1864年成立的工人议会起到了决定性作用。他们的运动促成了上述在纽约和宾夕法尼亚合法化工会的法律。 由于有权法院不能简单地忽视这些法律，它们改变了刑事规定背后的解释。由于合法化的前提是罢工者避免对资本所有者“恐吓”，法院现在认为，仅仅是会议——甚至是分发传单——构成了“恐吓”。此外，罢工者不再像内战之前那样被判处相对较小的罚款，通常在一到十美元加上法庭费用，而是经常被判处数月甚至数年的监禁或劳改（Hattam 1993，第110页；147页）。 限制工作日、用现金支付工资和通过法律引入工作场所健康安全规定的要求，遭遇了与反对对罢工使用共谋原则运动相同的命运：它们成功地导致了（至少在某些州）相应法律的通过，但随后被法院剥夺了效力（Hattam 1993，第152页）。法官宣称代表国家最高权力，使工资收入者长时间寄希望于政治改革将改善他们的生活条件的希望破灭了。 反工会导向的案例法一直持续到二十世纪。从1880年代开始，企业家申请，法院接受了“禁令”，以防止罢工的发生？对禁令的无视可能被单一法官在没有正式审判的情况下处罚。如果这还不够，那些不服从禁令的人还会被认定为“藐视法庭”。尽管可以对临时禁令提起上诉，但即使最终判决对那些希望罢工的人有利，判决也会来得太迟。据塞缪尔·耶伦（Samuel Yellen）称，这是一种针对罢工者的军事司法（1936/1969，第126页）。 这种司法管辖伴随着对罢工者使用警力。据西德尼·L·哈林（Sidney L. Harring）称，命令他们不是为了控制“社会动荡”，而是恰恰相反，是为了在阶级斗争中支持资本一方。哈林认为，地方警察在使美国工业化进程特别暴力方面发挥了决定性作用（1983，第101页）。 这并未阻止罢工，也未阻止针对工业行动的案例法。在十九世纪末和二十世纪初，每个主要工业城市都发生了较小的罢工。在大型罢工中，发生了带有死亡人数的争端。1894年的普尔曼罢工就是这样的案例，罢工要求管理层撤销严厉的工资削减。在美国铁路工会同意支持芝加哥铁路工人的野猫罢工后，它迅速蔓延到全国。罢工者将普尔曼卧铺车从火车上分离，并罢工，对使用它们的铁路公司进行了抗议。应普尔曼董事会的要求，美国总统下令向芝加哥派遣超过10,000名警察、美国法警和国民警卫队成员。罢工者以纵火回应。七百辆铁路车厢和几座建筑被放火。罢工开始两个月后被镇压。十三人被杀，57人受伤，美国铁路联盟（ARU）主席尤金·V·德布斯（Eugene V. Debs）和其他罢工领导人被定共谋罪。美国参议院1895年指定的调查委员会在调查芝加哥罢工后报告称，由于普尔曼的立场是限制工人的权利，要么接受提供的条款，要么辞职，这一立场与时代不符（Yellen 1936/1969，第133页引用的报告文字摘录）。 但普尔曼公司并不孤单。在接下来的几十年里，美国的工人反复将他们家庭的生计，甚至往往是他们的健康甚至生命置于风险之中，如果他们决定罢工。政府机构定期为资本所有者提供枪支，工会领导人定期被定罪。 西部迅速扩张的矿业城市的冲突特别激烈。特别是在科罗拉多，自1870年代末以来，越来越多的矿业公司开始活跃。仅在1893年到1897年之间，科罗拉多就有超过3,000家新的矿业公司成立。国内外资本投资于该地区。随着劳动力的涌入，有些城镇一夜之间增长了数千人。许多工人，特别是来自爱尔兰、康沃尔和加拿大的移民，拥有采矿经验；其他人则决定停止寄希望于淘金热中发财，而是依靠采矿的定期收入。当他们面对商人日益增长的财富时，矿工自己却面对着艰苦的工作和生活条件。 在1890年代，随着企业家试图通过技术创新来应对矿业现行危机（特别是销售银的困难），使他们能够解雇工人并支付更低工资，冲突达到了高潮。1892年，矿工在Coer d’Alene的其他居民的支持下反抗这一策略。新成立的矿主协会向爱达荷州政府和联邦政府求助。联邦政府派遣武装分子破坏罢工，工会领导人和罢工的知名当地支持者被逮捕。1892年，当工会成员在Coeur d’Alene监狱等待审判时，他们确信会被定罪，他们决定成立西部矿工联合会。他们从监狱释放后，付诸实践并将到那时为止在各州活动的矿工组织汇集起来（Dubofsky 1985，第237页）。在见证了爱达荷州和科罗拉多州州政府对“白银巨头”的支持后，西部矿工联合会成员确信，专注于美国劳工联合会所追求的贸易谈判的策略几乎没有成功的机会。从1899年起，西部矿工联合会追求激进的社会变革策略。 在接下来的几年里，反复发生罢工。它们采取的形式常常导致被描述为阶级战争。这个术语特别适合用来描述1913年在科罗拉多煤田的罢工。1883年，1893年和1903年，这个偏远地区的矿工已经罢过工。每次罢工都被军队镇压，每次罢工的领导人都被解雇，临时工被雇佣。由于这个偏远地区几乎没有城市定居点，因此几乎没有人不直接受到矿井生活和工作条件的影响，采矿公司能够控制工人生活的各个方面。他们拥有土地、矿工的住房、学校和教堂。他们控制教师和神职人员。公司代表担任法官，公司代表确保选举结果确认现状。为了监督营地居民并调查可能的罢工计划，雇主雇佣了营地治安官。他们兼任警察和法官，解雇并驱逐任何敢于提出批评的人。"},{"instruction":"tengo que desarrollar este punto: Patologías Benigna (características histo y citologica) para un exposicion sobre anatomia patologica sobre una paciente que le hicieron histerectomia hallandole un adenocarcinoma de endometrio.

Gongbi (工筆), which translates to \\"meticulous\\", is a technique known for its precision and beauty, focusing on fine brushwork and detailed depiction. In a painting created with watercolor, which allows for soft, luminous color application, here's how the image would unfold: **Composition and Pose**: The woman is positioned slightly off-center, engaging the viewer with a serene, contemplative gaze. Her posture is elegant and composed, embodying the grace and tranquility often celebrated in Song Dynasty art. The background would likely be minimal, perhaps subtly suggesting a refined, scholarly garden or an interior with just a hint of landscape or floral elements, focusing the viewer's attention on the figure. **Clothing**: She wears traditional Chinese attire, which could be a hanfu (汉服) that resonates with Song Dynasty fashion. The garment would be long, flowing, and layered, demonstrating the sophisticated textile craftsmanship of the era. The fabric panels of the dress might be painted to suggest silk, with patterns that are understated yet exquisite — possibly featuring floral or bird motifs that have symbolic significance, painted in muted colors that enhance the garment's elegance. **Palette and Brushwork**: The color scheme would lean towards soft, subdued shades — think gentle greens, blues, and pinks, offset by the natural white of the silk and the deeper tones of the woman's hair and eyes, all contributing to a harmonious and balanced composition. The artist's brushwork, as befits the Gongbi style, would be incredibly fine and deliberate, with every stroke contributing to the overall delicacy and refinement of the image. Special attention would be given to the textures of the clothing, the smoothness of the skin, and the intricacy of any accessories, like hairpins or jewelry, which would be depicted with precision and subtlety. **Facial Features and Expression**: In keeping with Gongbi traditions and the aesthetic preferences of the Song Dynasty, the woman's face would be rendered with gentle curves and soft shading to highlight a sense of idealized beauty and inner virtue. Her expression would be calm and introspective, with slightly downcast eyes that draw the viewer into a moment of quietude and reflection. **Artistic Flourishes**: Though Gongbi paintings are known for their detailed realism, an artist might still imbue the scene with personal touches or symbolic elements — perhaps a bird perched discreetly in the background or a blooming flower near the woman, each adding layers of meaning about the fleeting beauty of nature and life's transitory moments. In summary, a Gongbi watercolor painting of a woman in traditional Chinese attire from the Song Dynasty would exude a sense of refined elegance, capturing the viewer's attention with its meticulous details, soft color palette, and the serene beauty of its subject."},{"instruction":"Gongbi painting of a woman dressed in traditional Chinese clothes, in the style of Song Dynasty, soft colors, refined and delicate brushstrokes, watercolor, normal, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Matte Canvas\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Matte Canvas Print: Song Dynasty Inspired Gongbi Woman in Traditional Dress, Delicate Watercolor Art"},{"instruction":"mengapa pada pasien didapatkan hematemesis sejak 3 hari yang lalu dan semakin memberat?","output":"Ada beberapa kemungkinan penyebab hematemesis yang semakin memberat pada pasien, di antaranya: 1.

Fin da piccolo dimostra doti artistiche nel disegno, con tempere e acquerelli. Negli anni successivi, intorno ai 16 anni, inizia a disegnare graffiti su carta e poco dopo a usare la vernice spray sui muri. Intorno ai 18 anni inizia anche piccoli dipinti su carta, cartone, legno per poi passare alla tela che non abbandonerà mai più. Col tempo i graffiti diventano vere e proprie opere di street art, lavorando anche su commissioni che aumentano sempre più. Tra il 1999 e il 2000 arriva il primo incarico davvero importante: dipingere tutte le stanze del reparto pediatrico dell'ospedale San Benedetto del Tronto, inserendo in una di esse la riproduzione su parete di un'opera del famoso artista Ugo Nespolo avendone donato il progetto lavoro. Nel 2014 un suo dipinto è stato scelto per essere inserito in una scena del film “La Negoziazione” di Sabina Guzzanti. Partecipa a numerosi eventi, concerti, manifestazioni, convegni in cui dipinge dal vivo, vincendo anche diverse mostre d'arte estemporanee. Le commissioni provengono dai settori più disparati come alberghi, ristoranti, locali, pompe funebri, bar, chiese, asili, scuole, edicole, attività commerciali di ogni genere e ovviamente privati ​​in cui realizza opere per interni ed esterni. Parallelamente porta avanti la creazione di collane e bracciali da donna, nata come hobby e rivelatasi un interessante ambito creativo e che oggi vanta numerose creazioni, tutte diverse per stile e manifattura. Nel 2015 inizia a lavorare su una nuova tecnica che prevede la fusione tra Fotografia, Arte Digitale e Pittura, realizzando opere in uno stile molto lontano dalla tradizionale pittura ad olio pur rimanendo fedele alle basi classiche come acrilico, olio, acquerello, matita. Dal 2018 in poi è un crescendo di creazioni ed esposizioni importanti, partecipando anche ad eventi d'arte insieme ad artisti internazionali e collaborazioni con diverse amministrazioni comunali. Oggi vive e lavora a San Benedetto del Tronto.","output":"Kaine William è nato il 7 luglio 1978 a San Benedetto del Tronto.

However, without a specific context, it's challenging to provide a detailed explanation tailored to your needs. Here are a few possible interpretations of how O2 might interact with D-galacturonic acid: 1. **Oxidative Degradation**: In the presence of oxygen, D-galacturonic acid can undergo further oxidation. However, being already an oxidized form of galactose, its primary site for oxidation (the aldehyde group) has been converted to a carboxylic acid. Further oxidation might involve the oxidation of other functional groups or breaking down the molecule, which isn’t commonly pursued for D-galacturonic acid specifically. 2. **Enzymatic Action**: There are enzymes that can act on D-galacturonic acid under aerobic conditions which might involve oxygen. For example, certain lyases or oxygenases might target D-galacturonic acid or its polymers, like pectin, as part of their degradation pathway. In the natural degradation of plant material, such enzymes might facilitate the breakdown of pectin, a polysaccharide that contains galacturonic acid as its main component. 3. **Chemical Synthesis and Modifications**: Chemical modifications of D-galacturonic acid could involve O2, either directly as an oxidant or indirectly through oxidative catalysts. While the carboxylic acid group is already an oxidized form of the original alcohol in galactose, other chemical groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) present in the molecule can be targeted for modification. For example, targeted oxidation can be used to create new functional groups for subsequent chemical reactions. 4. **Role in Metabolism and Biochemical Pathways**: D-galacturonic acid plays an essential role in the metabolism of some organisms. Aerobic bacteria or fungi may utilize oxygen in the metabolic breakdown of D-galacturonic acid, deriving energy from its oxidation or incorporating it into larger biochemical structures. It’s important to note that pure O2 reactions might not be the most common way to interact with D-galacturonic acid unless catalyzed or under specific conditions since many molecular interactions with oxygen are quite slow or require specific catalysts or reactive species to proceed efficiently. If your interest is in a specific reaction involving D-galacturonic acid and oxygen, such as in polymer chemistry, biochemistry, or a particular industrial application, providing more context would help in giving a more detailed explanation."},{"instruction":"what is the average age from which a person wants to start having a relationship","output":"Determining an average age at which individuals want to start having relationships can be complex due to cultural, societal, and individual differences. However, interest in forming romantic relationships often begins during adolescence. According to research and social observations, many teenagers start showing interest in dating and relationships around the ages of 12 to 15 years old, coinciding with middle to high school years in many countries. This age range marks the onset of puberty, during which teenagers develop both physiologically and emotionally, leading to an increased interest in romantic relationships. It's important to underscore that while this age range is common for the initiation of interest in romantic relationships, the desire for and engagement in romantic relationships can vary widely among individuals. Factors influencing this variation include cultural norms, parental guidelines, individual maturity levels, personal interests, and social environment. Moreover, the concept of \\"relationship\\" evolves with age and experience. What might be considered a relationship in early adolescence can significantly differ from relationships in late adolescence, young adulthood, and beyond, as individuals' understanding of romantic engagement deepens and matures. Therefore, while adolescence is a typical period for the budding of romantic interests, the readiness and desire to pursue relationships are highly individualized and influenced by multiple factors beyond just age."},{"instruction":"переформулируй Актуальность к выбранной теме заключается в том, что на основе анализа определяются перспективы развития предприятия, можно сделать выводы, насколько эффективно работает предприятие и какие меры необходимо предпринять по ее улучшению.

D-galacturonic acid is a uronic acid derived from galactose, where the hydroxyl group on the sixth carbon is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group. Following the standard numbering of carbons in monosaccharides from the terminal aldehyde (or ketone) group: 1. The first carbon (C1) is where the aldehyde group is attached. 2. Carbons are numbered sequentially along the carbon chain. For D-galacturonic acid, specifically, the carbons are numbered C1 through C6. The \\"O2\\" refers to the oxygen atom connected to the second carbon (C2). In the context of D-galacturonic acid, the hydroxyl group at the second carbon would be part of the side chain extending from the main carbon backbone. This oxygen is not part of an ether or ester linkage (since we're talking about a monomeric uronic acid) but is part of a hydroxyl (-OH) group directly bonded to the C2 carbon."},{"instruction":"In the polymer that consists of d-galacturonic acid, which oxygens are labelled O2 and O3?","output":"In the context of a polymer made from D-galacturonic acid, such as pectin, which is a natural occurring polymer found in plant cell walls, the labeling of oxygen atoms in the repeating units is more complex due to the formation of glycosidic bonds between monomers. D-galacturonic acid has the following relevant positions: 1. -COOH or carboxyl group, usually at what would be the C6 position in D-galactose. 2. Hydroxyl groups at the C2, C3, and C4 positions. 3. The aldehyde at the C1 position in its open-chain form, which in the polymer is involved in forming glycosidic linkages. When D-galacturonic acid monomers link to form a polymer, the glycosidic bond typically occurs between the carboxyl group oxygen atom on one monomer (attached to C6, but it isn't named as such in the polymer context since it comes from the oxidation product at this position) and the hydroxyl group on the C4 of another monomer. For clarification regarding \\"O2\\" and \\"O3\\" in the context of a polymer: - **Oxygen labeled as \\"O2\\"** in the context of a singular D-galacturonic acid unit (not considering glycosidic bonds) would be the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group attached to the carbon 2 (C2) of the sugar. This oxygen is part of the monomer's inherent structure and retains its hydroxyl status in the polymer, assuming no modifications occur at that position. - **Oxygen labeled as \\"O3\\"** would similarly be the oxygen in the hydroxyl group attached to carbon 3 (C3). When discussing the polymerization (for instance, in forming pectin), the relevant oxygens in glycosidic linkages typically do not get referred to as \\"O2\\" or \\"O3\\" but rather in the context of the bond formation between specific carbons (for example, a bond might be described as forming between the C1 of one monomer and the carboxyl group of another, though the specifics can vary based on the type of linkage). In the context of the polymer chemistry and repeating structure in such polymers, \\"O2\\" and \\"O3\\" still refer to the oxygen atoms attached to the 2nd and 3rd carbons in each repeating galacturonic acid unit, respectively, reflecting their positions in the original monomeric form. These terms are not typically used to describe the oxygens involved in the inter-monomer linkages (e.g., glycosidic bonds) that form the polymer backbone."},{"instruction":"vertex, edge , polygon 에 대해서 설명하시오.","output":"vertex, edge, polygon은 기하학에서 흔히 사용되는 용어들입니다. 각각의 요소에 대해 설명하겠습니다. 1. **Vertex(정점)** - Vertex는 구석이나 꼭지점으로, 두 개 이상의 선 또는 에지의 만나는 점을 의미합니다. 예를 들어, 사각형에서 각 모서리의 꼭짓점은 Vertex에 해당합니다. 즉, 다각형이나 다면체에서 각각의 모서리가 만나는 점이 바로 정점입니다. 2. **Edge(변 또는 에지)** - Edge는 두 개의 Vertex를 연결하는 선분을 의미합니다. 즉, 그래픽스, 기하학, 또는 네트워크 이론에서 두 개의 점을 연결하는 선으로 정의할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 사각형에서 각 변은 Edge에 해당합니다. Edge는 두 점 사이의 거리 또는 연결을 대표합니다. 3. **Polygon(다각형)** - Polygon은 세 개 이상의 직선(Edge)으로 둘러싸인 평면 도형입니다. 이러한 Edge들이 닫힌 루프를 형성하며, 각 Edge의 양끝은 Vertex로 구성됩니다. 다각형은 내각의 합, 변의 개수, 꼭지점의 개수 등으로 분류될 수 있으며, 정다각형과 불규칙 다각형으로 나뉩니다. 예를 들어, 삼각형, 사각형, 오각형 모두 다각형의 예입니다. 정다각형은 모든 내각과 모든 변이 같은 다각형을 말하며, 불규칙 다각형은 변이나 각이 서로 다른 다각형을 말합니다. 이렇게, Vertex, Edge, Polygon은 기하학적 도형을 구성하는 기본 요소들입니다. 그들은 각각 독립적인 개념으로 사용될 수 있으며, 동시에 서로를 연결하고 정의하는 데에 사용됩니다. 이들은 공간을 이해하고, 복잡한 문제를 단순화하는데 필수적인 개념입니다."},{"instruction":"0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:2.730 Keith Low Through the licensing and we agree on certain points. 0:0:2.980 --> 0:0:20.660 Keith Low I think the main points that time was the exploration able to check on that able to send out notification internally as well as external external into the tenant admin internally is to the account manager and there will be a great experience. 0:0:21.920 --> 0:0:29.490 Keith Low So the great spirit is, but what amendable should be able to modify it? 0:0:29.500 --> 0:0:34.680 Keith Low But then for MVP, probably we will do it in a fix fix period for example like 2 weeks. 0:0:35.740 --> 0:0:44.30 Keith Low And we also mentioned about the license type, I think, Josh, I'm sure. 0:0:44.40 --> 0:0:46.630 Keith Low Thanks for from you E the new license type. 0:0:46.640 --> 0:0:55.70 Keith Low I think you you guys change so I need the new license type and as well as the description so that that was what we discussed previously. 0:0:55.280 --> 0:1:3.470 Keith Low And I think we agreed after internal discussion that we were actually to all the requirement and as per what we discussed. 0:1:6.630 --> 0:1:9.330 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I think maybe to summarize that. 0:1:9.790 --> 0:1:18.700 Chris DiPierro Uh, last week spoke there was a question about expiration expiration is absolutely a feature of licensing service. 0:1:18.710 --> 0:1:22.800 Chris DiPierro We had a conversation internally around that that's that's not a not a problem. 0:1:33.800 --> 0:1:33.940 Keith Low Yeah. 0:1:23.430 --> 0:1:34.120 Chris DiPierro That will include grace periods as as part of it, as he said, the licensing types and think more generally we will support whatever license types we need, I think, yeah. 0:1:34.130 --> 0:1:39.440 Chris DiPierro If we need descriptions and that's fine, but but ultimately we're not imposing limitations to it. 0:1:39.510 --> 0:1:42.550 Chris DiPierro Josh outlined a couple of different types that weren't in the initial bundle. 0:1:42.810 --> 0:1:47.850 Chris DiPierro I think last time we spoke and that's fine, but that not not a problem for for from that perspective. 0:1:48.300 --> 0:2:5.10 Chris DiPierro So I think at the end of the day, you know we're providing ARC with what you are kind of asked for it, right, you know and number of license types assigned to different people across instances with expirations and notifications surrounding them. 0:2:5.20 --> 0:2:5.710 Chris DiPierro I think that's fine. 0:2:5.930 --> 0:2:8.270 Chris DiPierro How we get information like the account manager? 0:2:8.280 --> 0:2:9.300 Chris DiPierro I don't really know exactly. 0:2:9.310 --> 0:2:9.820 Chris DiPierro That's the thing. 0:2:9.830 --> 0:2:15.120 Chris DiPierro We still gotta sort through, but that for purposes of notifications, but, well, we'll work through that so. 0:2:16.850 --> 0:2:18.80 Keith Low Yeah, and ring. 0:2:17.320 --> 0:2:21.10 Stephanie Jones That we will have the expiration date in there when it expires. 0:2:21.150 --> 0:2:22.100 Chris DiPierro Umm yes. 0:2:21.940 --> 0:2:22.250 Keith Low Yeah. 0:2:22.260 --> 0:2:22.530 Keith Low Yeah. 0:2:22.580 --> 0:2:25.780 Keith Low We we will have that How at the moment. 0:2:25.790 --> 0:2:42.10 Keith Low I mean, honestly, we the present three services that actually involved in in these services are I mean provisioning, licensing and IHOME we don't have this feature yet, but I will be working with Duraid to have to have him to review the design. 0:2:42.240 --> 0:2:44.530 Keith Low So this will be included in. 0:2:47.590 --> 0:2:52.680 Keith Low I I think 1 might think uh, there are just a little bit of things that I just need to double confirm. 0:2:53.30 --> 0:3:3.730 Keith Low So for example, during the grace period we previously we did, we discussed there could be a two weeks or whatever date that actually is set by your side. 0:3:5.370 --> 0:3:7.480 Keith Low After that we start to block uh. 0:3:7.870 --> 0:3:12.560 Keith Low The signing of a new license, but then during the grace period start. 0:3:13.150 --> 0:3:16.520 Keith Low What would I? 0:3:16.610 --> 0:3:17.840 Keith Low What is the expectation? 0:3:18.110 --> 0:3:24.720 Keith Low So for example, like the license expires today, the user will have two weeks continue using. 0:3:26.50 --> 0:3:31.790 Keith Low So I think the the idea was, uh, we will already start blocking assigning assignment of new licenses. 0:3:34.320 --> 0:3:37.370 Chris DiPierro Yeah, this came up in our internal conversation. Once you're. 0:3:38.40 --> 0:3:43.210 Chris DiPierro Excuse me if a user happens to, well, an instance happens to end up in a grace period. 0:3:43.220 --> 0:3:45.710 Chris DiPierro Should we restrict any functionality right? 0:3:46.180 --> 0:3:55.20 Chris DiPierro One thing you could do from restricted functionality is stop allowing assignment of new users to potentially available licenses, right? 0:3:55.80 --> 0:4:2.460 Chris DiPierro So this is in the hypothetical use case where an organization, let's just say, has 100 licenses. 0:4:2.470 --> 0:4:4.230 Chris DiPierro They've assigned like 92 of them. 0:4:5.120 --> 0:4:8.510 Chris DiPierro Their past experience, but still within the grace period. 0:4:8.520 --> 0:4:24.960 Chris DiPierro Can they assign a 93rd license at that point or are we kind of imposing a restriction that says, hey, look, we're letting you use the product during a grace period but not letting you do additional, you know, provisioning of users during that time period, anybody kind of have a thought or preference down that path? 0:4:25.920 --> 0:4:26.670 Stephanie Jones That makes sense. 0:4:27.750 --> 0:4:32.880 Stephanie Jones That makes sense to stay or like how we're liking use this. 0:4:32.890 --> 0:4:34.860 Stephanie Jones You're you have your past. 0:4:34.870 --> 0:4:36.350 Stephanie Jones The expiration date. 0:4:37.70 --> 0:4:37.320 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:4:36.360 --> 0:4:38.640 Stephanie Jones We're letting you use it, but yeah, you can't add new people. 0:4:40.70 --> 0:4:40.240 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:4:38.650 --> 0:4:42.820 Stephanie Jones I mean, if we're, if we're able to institute that that I think we should. 0:4:43.720 --> 0:4:44.760 Chris DiPierro OK, that's fine. 0:4:43.830 --> 0:4:44.990 Keith Low Umm, OK, great. 0:4:46.130 --> 0:4:46.550 Keith Low OK, I. 0:4:46.10 --> 0:4:47.210 Stephanie Jones Is that 2 weeks? 0:4:47.220 --> 0:4:49.660 Stephanie Jones Was that where did that two weeks come from? 0:4:50.720 --> 0:4:54.30 Keith Low You was just a suggestion where in in our previous discussion. 0:4:51.520 --> 0:4:54.50 Stephanie Jones Is that just? Yeah. 0:4:56.410 --> 0:5:0.0 Stephanie Jones I mean, I didn't know if that was like an industry thing or if that was OK. 0:5:3.580 --> 0:5:3.760 Keith Low Yeah. 0:5:4.560 --> 0:5:4.870 Stephanie Jones Umm. 0:4:54.210 --> 0:5:7.130 Chris DiPierro It in in this in this spec like now in the spec we talked about it just being configurable but probably should should come up with some sort of reasonable default but. 0:5:7.880 --> 0:5:10.300 Stephanie Jones Great. OK. 0:5:9.810 --> 0:5:18.280 Chris DiPierro I when I've done this in the past, I've done month long grace periods is kind of like the default just cause it takes companies a while to get there actually there unless with you. 0:5:18.60 --> 0:5:20.300 Stephanie Jones Yeah, get paid and everything. 0:5:18.330 --> 0:5:20.550 Chris DiPierro But I've also seen, but I've also seen right? 0:5:20.800 --> 0:5:22.830 Chris DiPierro But I've also seen week long, so I don't know. 0:5:22.840 --> 0:5:25.820 Chris DiPierro You know, I think figure out something that is reasonable. 0:5:25.830 --> 0:5:26.750 Chris DiPierro And why would to be modified? 0:5:26.760 --> 0:5:28.210 Chris DiPierro It doesn't really matter that much so. 0:5:28.650 --> 0:5:29.250 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:5:29.840 --> 0:5:31.910 Stephanie Jones OK, that makes sense. 0:5:30.670 --> 0:5:36.770 Keith Low I mean, touching on this the ideally we would make it a configurable that that is the direction we are going. 0:5:37.50 --> 0:5:37.320 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:5:37.160 --> 0:5:45.880 Keith Low But assuming let's say for MVP, if I want to simplify this and let's say fix it first, so 30 day work for you. 0:5:47.140 --> 0:5:50.190 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I would if we're, if we did something MVP, I would do 30 days. 0:5:50.200 --> 0:5:52.750 Chris DiPierro I rather be more permissive than less permissive. 0:5:56.320 --> 0:6:3.10 Keith Low OK, I think the other question that I have is, uh on license reduction. 0:6:3.300 --> 0:6:9.560 Keith Low So this have this scenario happens when assuming you have pen but the renewal is for five. 0:6:9.880 --> 0:6:18.980 Keith Low So I I think we we discussed and we agreed we will not be able to deprovision for them because we don't know which user to deprovision. 0:6:19.330 --> 0:6:25.110 Keith Low So what happened is we will set up notification to the account manager to the tenant admin. 0:6:26.30 --> 0:6:29.470 Keith Low Uh, but we will not enforce any deprovision. 0:6:29.780 --> 0:6:36.570 Keith Low So I think the scenario would worst case scenario would probably be the tenant admin. 0:6:36.580 --> 0:6:37.40 Keith Low Ignore it. 0:6:38.450 --> 0:6:39.300 Keith Low So what do we do? 0:6:39.310 --> 0:6:40.200 Keith Low What do we do about it? 0:6:40.210 --> 0:6:47.770 Keith Low I think the the one way is we have to send this to the hydrogen somebody in hydrogen that actually managed this account. 0:6:48.420 --> 0:6:53.580 Keith Low Uh, there is one way because there's no way for us to actually deprovision the user. 0:6:54.240 --> 0:6:54.400 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:6:53.750 --> 0:6:55.220 Keith Low So I think the best we can come is this. 0:6:57.180 --> 0:7:0.870 Chris DiPierro And I I think there's a point where automation will always break down, right? 0:7:0.880 --> 0:7:2.470 Chris DiPierro Like this is kind of a weird scenario, right? 0:7:2.480 --> 0:7:6.520 Chris DiPierro Like I've I've got 10 users and now I'm only renewing for five. 0:7:6.530 --> 0:7:8.810 Chris DiPierro Hopefully the account manager understands the reasoning. 0:7:8.820 --> 0:7:22.520 Chris DiPierro Kind of to start with because like ideally we're trying to convince them to not down sell, but if it just kind of randomly happens I guess then yeah, I think this is the edge of automatable processes. 0:7:22.530 --> 0:7:22.780 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:7:22.790 --> 0:7:26.390 Chris DiPierro You just say the new license has, in this case 5. 0:7:26.600 --> 0:7:29.50 Chris DiPierro They're clearly not able to assign any new licenses. 0:7:29.60 --> 0:7:30.250 Chris DiPierro We can't be provisioned. 0:7:30.260 --> 0:7:32.460 Chris DiPierro As you said, you don't know who to take them away from. 0:7:32.470 --> 0:7:43.470 Chris DiPierro But yeah, if we could do some sort of periodic notification to the relevant people, I mean, if the account manager just chooses to ignore that, like I don't know if we can do a whole whole lot about it at that point, right. So. 0:7:45.560 --> 0:7:45.940 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:7:46.790 --> 0:7:47.960 Stephanie Jones Yeah, I agree. 0:7:48.10 --> 0:7:48.220 Stephanie Jones And then? 0:7:50.780 --> 0:7:52.620 Stephanie Jones I mean, if they right? Mm-hmm. 0:7:54.640 --> 0:7:59.920 Stephanie Jones So if they were new for five, then they're paying for five, they're getting 10. 0:8:6.340 --> 0:8:6.520 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:7:59.930 --> 0:8:7.560 Stephanie Jones I mean is I wonder is there would I understand what you're saying like you can't pick which five of the 10 are like out. 0:8:20.860 --> 0:8:21.90 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:8:7.570 --> 0:8:25.130 Stephanie Jones So that makes sense, but I wonder if there's something from a renewals perspective that we could until they you know, until they reduce the numbers, then we're charging them for the 10, but that's the, but what you're saying is this is not a platform services thing, it's that's more of a rest of idea Gen thing because. 0:8:27.220 --> 0:8:27.500 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:26.440 --> 0:8:36.70 Chris DiPierro I think it's a platform services from a perspective of if if I was the designing notification around that Keith and I guess we kind of are, I would like send a notification about that daily. 0:8:36.870 --> 0:8:37.70 Keith Low Yeah. 0:8:36.210 --> 0:8:39.670 Chris DiPierro Honestly, if you're and, it's not really just that renewal time. 0:8:43.710 --> 0:8:43.880 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:39.680 --> 0:8:53.400 Chris DiPierro It's like if you, if we ever find it in ourselves, in a situation where somehow there are more users provisioned with a given license type than they have available licenses, then we should be kind of, say screaming about it. 0:8:53.410 --> 0:8:57.20 Chris DiPierro But you know, I telling people about it very frequently. 0:8:56.920 --> 0:8:57.100 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:57.30 --> 0:8:59.140 Chris DiPierro Essentially, he was what it comes down to. 0:8:59.290 --> 0:8:59.800 Stephanie Jones I agree. 0:9:2.690 --> 0:9:2.890 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:9:2.110 --> 0:9:4.140 Keith Low Yeah, OK. Yeah. 0:9:2.0 --> 0:9:10.110 Chris DiPierro Renewal seemed the most obvious, but if somehow some other way, something breaks where somehow somebody is able to provision an extra license, it would be good to know that too, right? 0:9:10.190 --> 0:9:12.540 Chris DiPierro Just really the same notification from that perspective. 0:9:15.90 --> 0:9:20.140 Keith Low OK, I think uh, this more or less sums up what we discussed previously. 0:9:20.150 --> 0:9:35.600 Keith Low And I think it also clarifies the, I think due to my email, really sorry about that, this this clears up, OK outside of this discussion is something that crops up for provisioning of user as well as the renewal. 0:9:35.650 --> 0:9:43.720 Keith Low So I think this is something we discussed, but not in priority, something which we would like to do in the longer term, which is like a provisioning UI renewal UI. 0:9:43.930 --> 0:9:50.910 Keith Low So my question is, at the moment I understand Paul Martin is the one that is responsible to provision your user. 0:9:51.280 --> 0:9:57.880 Keith Low Am I right to say that if Alicia Keys and Paul Martin? Yes. 0:9:56.760 --> 0:9:58.610 Vincent Oon Yes, yes, that that will be cut offs. 0:9:58.780 --> 0:10:1.210 Vincent Oon Paul Paul basically caught up. 0:10:1.280 --> 0:10:5.60 Vincent Oon When will be the one that helped to create the initial tenant? 0:10:5.560 --> 0:10:6.730 Vincent Oon The initial user? 0:10:6.780 --> 0:10:7.70 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:10:5.740 --> 0:10:7.500 Keith Low OK. Hmm. 0:10:7.80 --> 0:10:7.790 Vincent Oon Initial user. 0:10:7.860 --> 0:10:10.540 Vincent Oon They are the one create because we don't have the UI yet. 0:10:7.550 --> 0:10:11.280 Keith Low Gonna share it, but umm. 0:10:11.860 --> 0:10:12.90 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:10:11.320 --> 0:10:14.460 Keith Low But he was telling me that this is a temporary measure. 0:10:14.580 --> 0:10:14.760 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:10:14.550 --> 0:10:17.540 Keith Low My question is who will do it after then? 0:10:19.450 --> 0:10:19.610 Keith Low No. 0:10:18.540 --> 0:10:21.260 Vincent Oon No one, uh, I I don't. 0:10:29.830 --> 0:10:30.0 Keith Low And. 0:10:21.320 --> 0:10:36.900 Vincent Oon I don't think the temporary that the temporary actually means that until we got the permanent process in our software means that there's a UI implemented, but it shouldn't be handled to anyone else to to do it, yeah. 0:10:36.840 --> 0:10:37.120 Chris DiPierro So. 0:10:35.840 --> 0:10:39.570 Keith Low OK, but even even with the US, somebody needs to do it. 0:10:39.580 --> 0:10:40.440 Keith Low It's not automatic. 0:10:41.330 --> 0:10:41.570 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:10:41.80 --> 0:10:50.750 Keith Low I mean I need to clarify this, assuming we come to a point where we have provisioning UI, somebody needs to provision and meet with the UI is actually simpler. 0:10:50.830 --> 0:10:51.450 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:10:51.590 --> 0:10:53.140 Chris DiPierro So, so, so. 0:10:53.210 --> 0:10:57.600 Chris DiPierro So I think this has a broader implication than just our here. 0:10:57.610 --> 0:10:59.840 Chris DiPierro Here a couple conversations I had around this recently, right? 0:10:59.850 --> 0:11:2.260 Chris DiPierro So I talked to Muna and I talked to Chris Walsh. 0:11:2.270 --> 0:11:2.620 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:11:2.630 --> 0:11:7.360 Chris DiPierro And today, as you said, there's no there's no UI right. 0:11:7.530 --> 0:11:15.650 Chris DiPierro And Chris Walsh's view on the world is therefore it's cloud office responsibility because they're the ones who know how to run postman to hit APIs essentially, right? 0:11:15.660 --> 0:11:18.980 Chris DiPierro Like they just happen to have that technical skill, right? 0:11:18.990 --> 0:11:21.490 Chris DiPierro Paul Martin or whoever can can clearly do that. 0:11:22.500 --> 0:11:33.650 Chris DiPierro Umm, I think Chris's view of the world is that once a UI exists or any other automation that he would like to get cloud OPS out of that world, that might be a little bit different than what Paul. 0:11:33.660 --> 0:11:36.730 Chris DiPierro I watched the video of what you and Paul had conversations with. 0:11:36.740 --> 0:11:46.420 Chris DiPierro I'm not sure if Paul necessarily shared that we were not, but I think at least the expectation would be that it's not like a deep level cloud OPS agent doing it. 0:11:49.600 --> 0:11:49.820 Keith Low Hmm. 0:11:46.430 --> 0:12:0.380 Chris DiPierro It might be something maybe like a level one person in the, you know, cloud Center of Excellence or whatever in India or something like that, but it might also not be it kind of sounded like, you know Chris view of the world is like yes, we have to do this right now because we're the only ones who are capable of doing it. 0:12:2.160 --> 0:12:2.850 Chris DiPierro Flip side of that. 0:12:2.860 --> 0:12:14.910 Chris DiPierro When I was talking to Muna, I asked there his view he's like, well, isn't cloud OPS involved at provisioning it specifically is asking about renewal, but his isn't cloud OPS available or responsible at provisioning? 0:12:15.120 --> 0:12:18.810 Chris DiPierro Therefore, why would we bring anybody else into the world at renewal time? 0:12:18.820 --> 0:12:20.140 Chris DiPierro It should always just be cloud OPS. 0:12:22.600 --> 0:12:27.310 Chris DiPierro I feel like there needs to be some conversations at a higher level of this going forward. 0:12:36.570 --> 0:12:36.690 Keith Low Yeah. 0:12:27.320 --> 0:12:38.590 Chris DiPierro I think the answer right now is yeah, Paul Martin or whoever is the one doing it, we'll build a UI because even for cloud OPS, they could use in the UI to make things a bit easier in Paul's conversation with you. 0:12:38.600 --> 0:12:44.230 Chris DiPierro I think the key take away from that was the biggest thing that UI brings is consistency. 0:12:44.440 --> 0:12:44.600 Keith Low Yeah. 0:12:44.240 --> 0:12:49.880 Chris DiPierro If you build a UI and do whatever validation it is you need on the UI and then you hit the. 0:12:49.920 --> 0:12:51.850 Chris DiPierro Excuse me, the API is on the back end of that. 0:12:52.330 --> 0:12:55.700 Chris DiPierro That is obviously more consistent than somebody running a bunch of postman commands. 0:12:55.710 --> 0:12:56.180 Chris DiPierro Clearly. 0:12:56.270 --> 0:12:57.700 Chris DiPierro So I think it doesn't really. 0:12:57.710 --> 0:13:0.900 Chris DiPierro I think all this is, I don't think it matters right now, right. 0:13:1.260 --> 0:13:1.400 Keith Low Yeah. 0:13:0.950 --> 0:13:8.780 Chris DiPierro I think the expectation is cloud OPS will do it for the foreseeable future, but at some point they might look to hand it off to somebody else. 0:13:8.790 --> 0:13:9.880 Chris DiPierro But either which way? 0:13:9.890 --> 0:13:12.840 Chris DiPierro We'd wanna build a UI for consistency on top of it so. 0:13:13.870 --> 0:13:14.570 Keith Low OK, OK. 0:13:14.280 --> 0:13:14.720 Vincent Oon Yes, yes. 0:13:16.350 --> 0:13:22.900 Keith Low I think we when we come to that point, then we can decide I think right now just we can just focus on building the UI. 0:13:23.410 --> 0:13:24.20 Keith Low I think OK. 0:13:24.30 --> 0:13:26.20 Keith Low My next question is for you, Josh. 0:13:26.750 --> 0:13:32.380 Keith Low Unofficially, I heard from some colleague I know the new license name, Andrew description, but can you confirm? 0:13:32.590 --> 0:13:35.150 Keith Low I think right now is called Risk Pro and risk. 0:13:35.750 --> 0:13:40.740 Keith Low I can't remember the name and then you have an enterprise user instead of business user. 0:13:42.230 --> 0:13:43.630 Joshua Haseldine Uh, two seconds. 0:13:43.720 --> 0:13:48.671 Joshua Haseldine Let me go, Stephanie i.e. 0:13:49.420 --> 0:13:52.610 Joshua Haseldine Sorry I can't spreadsheet and I can't even saved it. 0:13:53.540 --> 0:13:54.750 Joshua Haseldine I'm sure it was enterprise. 0:13:54.760 --> 0:13:56.180 Joshua Haseldine Yes. Uh. 0:14:0.490 --> 0:14:0.900 Joshua Haseldine OHS. 0:14:1.10 --> 0:14:1.560 Joshua Haseldine That's five. 0:14:1.570 --> 0:14:2.240 Joshua Haseldine There's pros. 0:14:2.250 --> 0:14:5.380 Joshua Haseldine The stunt there's on both audit and risk. 0:14:5.390 --> 0:14:7.750 Joshua Haseldine And then there's a fifth one, which is called. 0:14:9.10 --> 0:14:10.20 Keith Low I think it's enterprise. 0:14:9.60 --> 0:14:10.190 Joshua Haseldine I think it's called that Prabha. 0:14:10.690 --> 0:14:11.610 Keith Low Yeah, I think it's enterprise. 0:14:10.880 --> 0:14:11.680 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, two sacks. 0:14:11.920 --> 0:14:13.530 Joshua Haseldine Sorry, I'm literally getting spreadsheet up now. 0:14:13.540 --> 0:14:14.450 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, it's enterprise, yeah. 0:14:15.740 --> 0:14:16.40 Keith Low OK. 0:14:15.430 --> 0:14:16.700 Chris DiPierro Is enterprise a thing you're not? 0:14:20.70 --> 0:14:20.550 Stephanie Jones Here's. 0:14:16.710 --> 0:14:21.630 Chris DiPierro I thought like saw a whole like conversation changed definitely that like whether enterprise should be a thing. 0:14:27.270 --> 0:14:27.480 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:14:22.860 --> 0:14:34.910 Stephanie Jones The word enterprise people have a problem with umm, so I and that's still being nailed down, if you will, because enterprise. 0:14:35.930 --> 0:14:38.280 Stephanie Jones Well, what was sent? 0:14:38.290 --> 0:14:44.380 Stephanie Jones That was just it's just a bigger thing than only having risk only having audit. 0:14:44.390 --> 0:14:45.70 Stephanie Jones You're having both. 0:14:45.810 --> 0:14:45.940 Chris DiPierro And. 0:14:45.80 --> 0:14:49.510 Stephanie Jones You're having more of that consolidated look. 0:14:49.770 --> 0:14:52.80 Stephanie Jones So we always use the word enterprise. 0:14:52.90 --> 0:15:19.100 Stephanie Jones Well then, umm, sales and marketing were like well, enterprise means it's for a big company, it's for an enterprise level of company and I'm and that was never the intention, it was the we used the word enterprise to just mean you have like the whole suite of things not that you're Best Buy and now you need something bigger because you're bigger than the local credit union using it. 0:15:19.190 --> 0:15:23.270 Stephanie Jones So I don't know what that word is going to end up being. 0:15:23.320 --> 0:15:29.150 Stephanie Jones I think right now we're just saying audit and risk or risk management and internal audit, whatever. 0:15:29.160 --> 0:15:38.850 Stephanie Jones You know the full names of it and just saying and instead of having one word, but there still is the need for a combined unified consolidated. 0:15:39.100 --> 0:15:40.860 Stephanie Jones You have both platforms. 0:15:42.970 --> 0:15:47.210 Stephanie Jones So enterprise itself is not going away, but the word enterprise might be going away. 0:15:48.450 --> 0:15:51.260 Chris DiPierro OK, so there's a license step that corresponds to you. 0:15:52.460 --> 0:15:52.720 Joshua Haseldine Yeah. 0:15:53.580 --> 0:15:53.880 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:15:51.270 --> 0:15:54.90 Chris DiPierro Something like enterprise basically is really concerned. 0:15:54.100 --> 0:15:55.770 Chris DiPierro We got less of what ends up being called, sure. 0:15:56.70 --> 0:15:57.690 Stephanie Jones And I guess maybe just call it. 0:15:58.180 --> 0:15:58.930 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:15:58.980 --> 0:16:3.670 Stephanie Jones I'm IDEAGEN internal audit and risk management and just say both names of them. 0:16:2.400 --> 0:16:5.760 Chris DiPierro We caught up, caught Optimate ARC ultimate. 0:16:5.770 --> 0:16:6.390 Chris DiPierro You get everything. 0:16:8.310 --> 0:16:10.280 Keith Low And the feature for this would be uh. 0:16:12.800 --> 0:16:13.80 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:16:13.800 --> 0:16:14.260 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, yeah. 0:16:10.290 --> 0:16:14.310 Keith Low They include both risk and audit, and unlimited user. Umm. 0:16:13.930 --> 0:16:14.500 Chris DiPierro We don't. 0:16:15.890 --> 0:16:17.0 Chris DiPierro Well, hang on. 0:16:17.190 --> 0:16:18.520 Chris DiPierro I can say we don't care, but what? 0:16:18.530 --> 0:16:19.360 Chris DiPierro What's that then? 0:16:19.370 --> 0:16:20.80 Chris DiPierro Limited users. 0:16:20.90 --> 0:16:22.40 Chris DiPierro Part of things. 0:16:22.30 --> 0:16:24.170 Stephanie Jones OK, then that's something separate. 0:16:24.180 --> 0:16:25.440 Stephanie Jones That's the business user. 0:16:25.720 --> 0:16:27.480 Keith Low Our business user that is still business user. 0:16:27.880 --> 0:16:28.40 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:16:29.690 --> 0:16:29.890 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:16:29.730 --> 0:16:30.670 Keith Low Oh, OK, OK. 0:16:30.780 --> 0:16:30.920 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:16:31.790 --> 0:16:32.190 Stephanie Jones Stop. 0:16:33.240 --> 0:16:33.480 Chris DiPierro And. 0:16:30.680 --> 0:16:38.470 Keith Low So that mean right now we will have a six different type of variety because initially I bought a basic Pro basic pro for each. 0:16:38.480 --> 0:16:39.100 Keith Low There will be 4. 0:16:42.90 --> 0:16:42.730 Chris DiPierro No, no, no, no. 0:16:39.110 --> 0:16:43.930 Keith Low Then there's one enterprise, which is the business user, but then business user means everything enterprise. 0:16:43.560 --> 0:16:44.0 Stephanie Jones There is. 0:16:44.840 --> 0:16:45.570 Keith Low Is a separate. 0:16:45.230 --> 0:16:46.880 Stephanie Jones There's six. 0:16:47.970 --> 0:16:48.280 Keith Low OK. 0:16:47.550 --> 0:16:49.650 Stephanie Jones There would be 6, right because you have. 0:16:47.560 --> 0:16:51.860 Chris DiPierro Yeah, business users, actually a business user is actually a pretty low permission to user. 0:16:53.970 --> 0:16:54.270 Stephanie Jones Correct. 0:16:51.870 --> 0:16:56.160 Chris DiPierro From my understand, the enterprise or whatever it gets called is pretty high permission. 0:16:56.170 --> 0:16:58.700 Chris DiPierro There's a pretty much opposites of each other. Umm. 0:17:5.180 --> 0:17:5.450 Stephanie Jones Correct. 0:16:59.260 --> 0:17:15.610 Chris DiPierro And and yeah, business user, I think we said is kind of unlimited from a user, it's usage perspective, but just for for Stephanie and Josh and Vincent's benefit, when we started talking about this at an actual licensing level, I still like the, I don't like the idea of having a flag that says that this is unlimited. 0:17:15.720 --> 0:17:21.450 Chris DiPierro So I think the way we would mainly because it creates a whole weird logic checks if you start doing that sort of thing. 0:17:21.450 --> 0:17:23.150 Stephanie Jones But like 1000 or something in there. 0:17:24.50 --> 0:17:24.170 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:26.180 --> 0:17:26.340 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:21.460 --> 0:17:27.230 Chris DiPierro So I still think the way we exactly, I think the way we really do it is like 10,000 or something ridiculous basically. 0:17:27.720 --> 0:17:28.220 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:17:27.240 --> 0:17:34.320 Chris DiPierro So it their view of the world would still say, hey, you know, you got 10,000 of these you provisioned, I don't know, 100 or whatever. 0:17:34.330 --> 0:17:37.300 Chris DiPierro I've seen this by the way, in like Office 365 licensing. 0:17:37.310 --> 0:17:42.360 Chris DiPierro Anytime they give out something that's quote unquote free, it's like 9999 licenses. 0:17:42.370 --> 0:17:45.140 Chris DiPierro And I don't think that's gonna cause us a problem. 0:17:45.120 --> 0:17:45.290 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:45.150 --> 0:17:45.650 Chris DiPierro Really. So. 0:17:46.320 --> 0:17:47.350 Keith Low OK, I think no issue. 0:17:47.80 --> 0:17:47.380 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:17:47.420 --> 0:17:53.140 Keith Low I think just to highlight this, because we are working with the UX team, uh. 0:17:53.150 --> 0:17:56.720 Keith Low I'm also giving you the TPO, we need to put this into the service. 0:17:56.830 --> 0:18:3.640 Keith Low So I think once it this is confirmed, I think Josh, maybe you can actually email me then I'll let them know and they can actually put it in. 0:18:3.910 --> 0:18:7.140 Keith Low Because right now it's a things are here from TPO. 0:18:7.150 --> 0:18:9.440 Keith Low I hear from all these are not confirmed. 0:18:8.680 --> 0:18:10.300 Chris DiPierro I still get a little concerned about this one. 0:18:10.310 --> 0:18:14.210 Chris DiPierro The Keith like, I mean at the end ultimately license types might change frequently, right? 0:18:14.300 --> 0:18:14.550 Keith Low Umm. 0:18:14.220 --> 0:18:21.470 Chris DiPierro Like they like audit and risk could decide to create like a 3 new license types tomorrow when they release version two or something like that. 0:18:21.480 --> 0:18:21.710 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:18:20.850 --> 0:18:21.790 Stephanie Jones They've been Oxley. 0:18:21.800 --> 0:18:23.300 Stephanie Jones Yeah, you have something. 0:18:21.720 --> 0:18:24.250 Chris DiPierro Like if they if they if they got new features. 0:18:24.440 --> 0:18:28.710 Chris DiPierro So however, it is that we're doing it, we need this to be pretty flexible, right? 0:18:48.680 --> 0:18:48.930 Keith Low Umm. 0:18:28.720 --> 0:18:49.580 Chris DiPierro It can't really be my preference would be anyway that it's not like married to a version of the licensing service, but instead reads this data a bit more dynamically and that so that you know if there is an update on on audit and risk side that we can kind of be pretty responsive to that basically. 0:18:49.590 --> 0:18:51.570 Chris DiPierro So, you know, let's design that. 0:18:52.60 --> 0:18:53.420 Keith Low OK. Yeah. 0:18:51.580 --> 0:18:54.380 Chris DiPierro However, it is that we need to design it, but like I don't. 0:18:54.390 --> 0:19:0.240 Chris DiPierro I ideally it's not hard coding all the licenses in their license types within like the licensing service, and they're saying, well, great. 0:19:0.250 --> 0:19:2.780 Chris DiPierro It's three months for us to put a new license to service out the door, right? So. 0:19:7.150 --> 0:19:7.310 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:19:2.970 --> 0:19:10.800 Keith Low Umm yeah, I think we could do it in in such a way that it could be an idea Gen admin that like, yeah, yeah. 0:19:8.550 --> 0:19:10.820 Chris DiPierro Because remember, we don't really care much about it, right? 0:19:10.830 --> 0:19:15.780 Chris DiPierro Like the from from from a purely platform point of view, it's a license name and description we don't. 0:19:20.190 --> 0:19:20.370 Keith Low Yeah. 0:19:15.850 --> 0:19:27.800 Chris DiPierro There's no implication to us about what that does, right, like so the amount of the amount of care we have to have around it is really just delivering the content of that in the appropriate spots, right? So. 0:19:27.630 --> 0:19:28.90 Keith Low Umm. 0:19:28.310 --> 0:19:29.110 Keith Low Yep, Yep. Movie. 0:19:31.150 --> 0:19:31.630 Keith Low Uh. 0:19:31.710 --> 0:19:34.380 Stephanie Jones OK, that's what I'm confused by. 0:19:34.390 --> 0:19:37.280 Stephanie Jones OK, so we have so the the. 0:19:38.850 --> 0:19:39.160 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:19:39.170 --> 0:19:43.960 Stephanie Jones So for risk, we have standard or sorry essentials and professional. 0:19:44.10 --> 0:19:45.440 Stephanie Jones Those are the official names. 0:19:46.190 --> 0:19:54.260 Stephanie Jones Umm, now we haven't really delivered enough risk functionality to to to to sell. 0:19:53.940 --> 0:19:55.700 Chris DiPierro Have been essentials and professional, yeah. 0:19:54.270 --> 0:19:57.640 Stephanie Jones You know, as essentials and professional. 0:19:57.650 --> 0:20:13.430 Stephanie Jones So right now, I guess they're, I guess the default like we're gonna give everyone essentials and then and then once they you know once we start to add the functionality then then we'll be able to have that distinction same for the audit side essentials and professional. 0:20:13.480 --> 0:20:14.520 Stephanie Jones So there's four. 0:20:15.150 --> 0:20:18.400 Stephanie Jones We talked about business users that that's five. 0:20:18.610 --> 0:20:35.740 Stephanie Jones So that enterprise level or or, you know consolidated level, is that just you have is a separate license type required for that or well because every user has to have one license type right, they can't have more than one license type, is that right? 0:20:35.150 --> 0:20:35.840 Chris DiPierro No, they're gonna. 0:20:35.850 --> 0:20:37.380 Chris DiPierro No, they they can have more than one. 0:20:37.390 --> 0:20:38.140 Chris DiPierro Yeah, absolutely. 0:20:38.150 --> 0:20:38.870 Chris DiPierro They can have more than one. 0:20:39.950 --> 0:20:43.50 Stephanie Jones So do we give them a consolidated interval? 0:20:43.60 --> 0:20:44.160 Stephanie Jones I'll just keep calling enterprise. 0:20:44.500 --> 0:20:44.690 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:20:44.170 --> 0:20:52.850 Stephanie Jones Do we give them an enterprise license type or do we give them both professional of risk and professional audit and say those two make up the fact that you're an enterprise customer? 0:20:53.670 --> 0:20:59.140 Chris DiPierro I think this is more of a you question than ask question and the reason I say that is because what does enterprise mean in the future? 0:20:59.880 --> 0:21:5.400 Chris DiPierro Let let let's say you introduce as you said, like a Sox license or something like that. 0:21:5.410 --> 0:21:9.240 Chris DiPierro Or, you know, whatever else would enterprise encompass all of that? 0:21:9.290 --> 0:21:14.720 Chris DiPierro Or would enterprise only mean risk pro and audit pro at that point, right. 0:21:14.790 --> 0:21:22.240 Chris DiPierro If enterprise is gonna perpetually mean, I have literally everything we ever released, then I think I would do it as a single license type. 0:21:23.360 --> 0:21:23.480 Joshua Haseldine Hey. 0:21:21.530 --> 0:21:24.0 Stephanie Jones Then this needs to be at home OK. 0:21:22.590 --> 0:21:29.500 Chris DiPierro If means I these two, but not this other one, then I would not have it as a license type. 0:21:29.510 --> 0:21:35.760 Chris DiPierro Then I would just say, yeah, no, we should just go onesies, you know, on on everything that they they need so. 0:21:37.390 --> 0:21:47.340 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, just to back of workers is saying that it it's, it needs to be its own user because if we're giving probes by border and risk, we don't want them to give full system admin regardless. 0:21:50.880 --> 0:21:51.160 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:21:47.350 --> 0:21:53.40 Joshua Haseldine So it needs to be its own individual entity which that enterprise license would sort of. 0:21:55.230 --> 0:21:55.480 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:21:53.250 --> 0:21:55.640 Joshua Haseldine It would fall under that, umm. 0:21:56.400 --> 0:21:56.570 Stephanie Jones That's. 0:21:59.230 --> 0:21:59.490 Keith Low OK. 0:21:59.980 --> 0:22:0.260 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:22:0.270 --> 0:22:0.720 Stephanie Jones That's helpful. 0:22:3.220 --> 0:22:5.250 Keith Low Umm, I don't have anymore question. 0:22:5.260 --> 0:22:7.180 Keith Low I think anything that you would like to bring up. 0:22:8.80 --> 0:22:9.80 Chris DiPierro I'd like to talk about. 0:22:8.100 --> 0:22:9.670 Joshua Haseldine Can I hijack this? 0:22:9.900 --> 0:22:10.160 Keith Low I'm sorry. 0:22:9.920 --> 0:22:11.230 Joshua Haseldine Meeting uh, sorry, I got Chris. 0:22:11.280 --> 0:22:11.860 Joshua Haseldine No, I. 0:22:9.990 --> 0:22:12.920 Chris DiPierro Oh, sorry, I I wanted to hijack you for anything else. 0:22:12.930 --> 0:22:14.20 Chris DiPierro If Kotte, but you can go first. 0:22:14.750 --> 0:22:16.260 Joshua Haseldine Well, the thing I'm gonna talk about. 0:22:24.270 --> 0:22:24.420 Chris DiPierro And. 0:22:24.190 --> 0:22:24.440 Keith Low Umm. 0:22:16.270 --> 0:22:26.740 Joshua Haseldine I I've AI might pro came along the pigeon to and it's about the audit trail and I I'm not. 0:22:41.870 --> 0:22:42.120 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:22:26.750 --> 0:22:44.990 Joshua Haseldine I'm not sure if anyone's sort of aware of an email that's gone around this morning or last night, and from I just it was between development teams, between Enigma and the platform, but that was one of the issues that we've raised a few times. 0:22:45.240 --> 0:22:49.410 Joshua Haseldine I'm I'm basically there's five issues I have. 0:22:50.390 --> 0:23:7.570 Joshua Haseldine Uh, that we've sort of stumbled across when we were when we built the audit trail that need to be addressed really before we can release this internally because they are, they're holding us up in terms of like an audit trail format. 0:23:7.630 --> 0:23:10.10 Joshua Haseldine And so I have a list of five issues here. 0:23:10.260 --> 0:23:16.980 Joshua Haseldine I can either go through the five issues now or I can send him an email to both for yourself, Chris and yourself. 0:23:16.990 --> 0:23:18.310 Joshua Haseldine Keith, I'm. 0:23:18.570 --> 0:23:29.20 Joshua Haseldine But yeah, I think they might need a bit of a bump up over the list or, you know, just at least some form of address in I'm most. 0:23:28.90 --> 0:23:31.110 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I'm not sure, but either rest are gonna be able to answer your issues. 0:23:32.860 --> 0:23:34.120 Joshua Haseldine Well, yeah, no. 0:23:39.140 --> 0:23:40.920 Keith Low Yeah. Hmm. 0:23:31.120 --> 0:23:43.220 Chris DiPierro If you went through them here and necessarily I did see an A note from JK that he said change log issue which would be audit trail that owed in the Heimdall, we're looking into it need to identify root cause and decide on how to fix it. 0:23:45.800 --> 0:23:46.0 Keith Low Yeah. 0:23:43.230 --> 0:23:46.930 Chris DiPierro But that's as much as I've got on it at the moment. So. 0:23:47.770 --> 0:23:48.130 Joshua Haseldine OK. 0:23:47.180 --> 0:23:49.570 Keith Low Yeah, I think that's not before 6. 0:23:49.580 --> 0:23:51.270 Keith Low I also spoke to the TP U. 0:23:51.540 --> 0:24:1.970 Keith Low He he was telling me someone in Honda is actually looking at it and I think they contacted some some Dev in in Arc team and got some information to test it out so. 0:24:1.720 --> 0:24:2.830 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, but it doesn't. 0:24:2.840 --> 0:24:11.210 Joshua Haseldine It the response given is basically asking us to change the audit trail log to something that we don't want to do. 0:24:19.660 --> 0:24:19.850 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:24:12.580 --> 0:24:20.790 Joshua Haseldine It's it's basically asking us to change to a a link and unlink service instead of an updated format which we're trying to move into cause that's how art needs to be. 0:24:21.680 --> 0:24:25.170 Joshua Haseldine So like I said, I'll forward this, I'll forward all these questions over to you too. 0:24:28.680 --> 0:24:28.840 Chris DiPierro Sure. 0:24:25.580 --> 0:24:41.570 Joshua Haseldine But the big two highlights and two ones I really wanna just gal there are the write update which I think is being fixed and it's being released as like in this upcoming fix like mid May I think is when it's due. 0:24:44.170 --> 0:24:44.450 Chris DiPierro Uh. 0:24:43.470 --> 0:24:44.950 Joshua Haseldine Am I correct? 0:24:44.960 --> 0:24:47.60 Joshua Haseldine It basically doesn't allow you to put a null value in. 0:24:48.60 --> 0:24:48.220 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:24:47.940 --> 0:24:49.750 Joshua Haseldine I don't know if if that means anything. 0:24:49.0 --> 0:24:50.230 Chris DiPierro Uh, sorry, I don't. 0:24:50.240 --> 0:24:52.280 Chris DiPierro I don't know the features at that level of detail. 0:24:53.470 --> 0:24:54.420 Joshua Haseldine No, that's fine. 0:24:52.290 --> 0:24:54.920 Chris DiPierro Yeah, but but I can look into it so. 0:24:54.600 --> 0:24:57.160 Joshua Haseldine That's fine and and the second thing is the reperforming. 0:25:0.570 --> 0:25:0.780 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:24:57.170 --> 0:25:0.980 Joshua Haseldine Once that is huge to us, really. 0:25:2.860 --> 0:25:7.750 Joshua Haseldine Basically yeah, the the performance of when we have like just like a records say 100 plus. 0:25:11.540 --> 0:25:11.780 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:25:7.760 --> 0:25:17.330 Joshua Haseldine It just goes to a crawl and it's taking 20 seconds a page and I can't get the green light on an audit trail for performance where it's taking 20 seconds of page. 0:25:17.860 --> 0:25:19.250 Joshua Haseldine So the read performance? 0:25:19.500 --> 0:25:21.160 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, realistically need to be addressed. 0:25:26.230 --> 0:25:26.400 Chris DiPierro Yep. 0:25:21.200 --> 0:25:29.190 Joshua Haseldine However, let me send you this list, and if you can get back to me as soon as because, but you get like said, I can't do 1.21 Toe. 0:25:29.260 --> 0:25:30.680 Joshua Haseldine This has been alerted. 0:25:30.570 --> 0:25:30.870 Keith Low Umm. 0:25:31.960 --> 0:25:32.730 Chris DiPierro Yeah, that's fine. 0:25:33.20 --> 0:25:33.650 Chris DiPierro Yeah, send it. 0:25:33.660 --> 0:25:35.930 Chris DiPierro Send it over and Keith, can you? 0:25:38.170 --> 0:25:38.350 Keith Low Yeah. 0:25:40.710 --> 0:25:40.970 Keith Low Sure. 0:25:36.240 --> 0:25:41.640 Chris DiPierro You know, get clarity on on all all all of Joshua stuff with the teams, so. 0:25:42.130 --> 0:25:44.800 Joshua Haseldine So I'm yeah, brilliant. 0:25:44.810 --> 0:25:45.290 Joshua Haseldine Thank you. 0:25:45.360 --> 0:25:46.60 Joshua Haseldine Go on, Chris. 0:25:46.70 --> 0:25:47.50 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, I'll let you hijack it now. 0:25:46.750 --> 0:25:48.330 Chris DiPierro Yeah, sure. 0:25:49.140 --> 0:25:55.960 Chris DiPierro So back during Genesis, a question can't was raised from the support team that was along the lines of how do we support this? 0:25:56.210 --> 0:25:57.50 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:25:57.190 --> 0:26:12.110 Chris DiPierro And that kind of led to the question of specifically, uh, are there the note is there the notion of like, user grants right, like can Support kinda act as a user within an instance to go see things and support and stuff like that? 0:26:12.220 --> 0:26:18.770 Chris DiPierro I don't know exactly how Support has handled pentana in the past, but I'm gonna guess that that's kind of what is influencing some of these questions, right? 0:26:18.780 --> 0:26:20.240 Chris DiPierro Like what do we do? 0:26:20.750 --> 0:26:25.600 Chris DiPierro Umm, the implication for platform was more around the identity side, right? 0:26:32.390 --> 0:26:32.670 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:26:25.610 --> 0:26:32.880 Chris DiPierro Like so, are we baking in like some sort of support admin user that people can use and you know, what do we go about doing with that kind of stuff? 0:26:32.920 --> 0:26:36.60 Chris DiPierro But this, but this felt bigger than just arc. 0:26:36.150 --> 0:26:37.320 Chris DiPierro So I said, you know what? 0:26:37.700 --> 0:26:37.980 Stephanie Jones Umm. 0:26:37.330 --> 0:26:38.300 Chris DiPierro I'm gonna go talk to Muna. 0:26:38.350 --> 0:26:38.820 Chris DiPierro Let's go. 0:26:38.830 --> 0:26:41.660 Chris DiPierro Let's go talk about how Support wants to do this in general, right? 0:26:41.670 --> 0:26:45.880 Chris DiPierro Like in as we have new products, we offer them to platform. 0:26:46.210 --> 0:26:46.960 Chris DiPierro What? 0:26:47.130 --> 0:27:6.500 Chris DiPierro How should support approach these sort of things and you know dealing with tenant instances and stuff like that and I can reflect his view and then you can tell me why this is probably more purist than I'm gonna guess our support wants to hear but, but let's just talk about it from a high level. 0:27:7.970 --> 0:27:13.830 Chris DiPierro Muniz View is Support should never be able to interact in a production environment. 0:27:13.880 --> 0:27:14.330 Chris DiPierro Ever. 0:27:14.430 --> 0:27:14.830 Chris DiPierro Period. 0:27:14.880 --> 0:27:17.50 Chris DiPierro Not not in no way. Right. 0:27:17.60 --> 0:27:46.80 Chris DiPierro No grants ever to a production environment in a QA or, you know, state or whatever environment what his ideal solution is, is that there can be a Support admin user that is essentially always locked out at something, but the tenant admin can provide, can essentially unlock out that account for a given time period based on a request. 0:27:46.90 --> 0:27:50.80 Chris DiPierro So in other words, Support says I wanna access your staging environment. 0:27:50.340 --> 0:27:54.970 Chris DiPierro Let's just say Joshua customer Josh, I want to access your stating environment to help you with this support ticket. 0:27:55.600 --> 0:28:2.690 Chris DiPierro You go into an advent somewhere and you say, great, Chris, I'm granting you access to the staging environment for the next 24 hours or whatever it is. 0:28:2.980 --> 0:28:9.930 Chris DiPierro And then Support uses a common account there to log into that staging environment and do whatever it is that they might need to do. 0:28:10.200 --> 0:28:21.540 Chris DiPierro However, and this was a big one, he was very clear that even in the context of that staging environment or whatever, that the support team should never be able to see any of your data, they should only be able to see metadata. 0:28:21.550 --> 0:28:42.740 Chris DiPierro They can't see like actual audit records or whatever it might be, and whatever product that we're talking about, they could see things like workflows and configurations and whatever, but he doesn't want them to actually be able to see any data that you recorded in in there that bit, uh, sounds more like a requirement on ARC than it does on platform. 0:28:42.750 --> 0:28:43.60 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:28:43.70 --> 0:28:50.380 Chris DiPierro Let's just imagine that platform could provide this notion of unlocking an account for a certain amount of time or whatever for support to use. 0:28:50.530 --> 0:29:21.990 Chris DiPierro Presumably that user would have some sort of permission associated with it that then arc would need to enforce, not showing any actual records to basically once they once they logged in at that point I kind of asked the question of doesn't support sometimes like actually need to really see data to be able to answer a question and his response to that was if it really comes down to that then that should all be done with screen shares with the customer after ensuring an NDA is in place and all that kind of stuff. 0:29:22.0 --> 0:29:26.550 Chris DiPierro But it should never be a thing that supports able to do unmonitored essentially so. 0:29:26.780 --> 0:29:45.200 Chris DiPierro So I don't know how that compares with the current Support process within like our products, if that's maybe it's maybe you already doing all that but but sounds sounded very good from a compliance perspective, but also a bit restrictive in what Support might be able to to do this solve problems. 0:29:45.210 --> 0:29:51.960 Chris DiPierro So just kind of curious how that that messes with what you guys are expecting, OK. 0:29:48.850 --> 0:30:2.410 Vincent Oon I can I can answer that because it's just done the internal audit with the support team, the level 1 support, the level 2 support in KL and also we spoke with the support in UK or so. 0:30:2.480 --> 0:30:12.970 Vincent Oon So basically they do have access to the customer data environment in the current current practice and they do share the single admin account through LastPass. 0:30:13.180 --> 0:30:14.820 Vincent Oon So that's how they do it. 0:30:16.370 --> 0:30:16.580 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:30:14.880 --> 0:30:25.810 Vincent Oon Do it so I don't understand why there's a concern now for for the new product that doesn't allow them to see the actual customer data because that's how the other product doing also. 0:30:25.740 --> 0:30:26.110 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:30:26.120 --> 0:30:30.890 Chris DiPierro And and and and just to be clear, it's not so much that it's a concern for the new products, right? 0:30:30.950 --> 0:30:32.190 Chris DiPierro Moon is kind of new in the company. 0:30:32.200 --> 0:30:37.110 Chris DiPierro He's saying this is how I think Support should should run and he has a Salesforce background right? 0:30:37.120 --> 0:30:37.940 Chris DiPierro It comes from Salesforce. 0:30:37.950 --> 0:30:38.910 Chris DiPierro This is kind of how they did it. 0:30:38.920 --> 0:30:51.560 Chris DiPierro Salesforce from one end stand, I think his big emphasis was on maturity as a company, basically in part because different geographies have different regulations for this kind of stuff, right? 0:30:51.640 --> 0:30:52.90 Chris DiPierro Then what? 0:30:52.100 --> 0:30:58.470 Chris DiPierro He is kind of trying to outline is like what is the what would cover us in the most situations. Right. 0:30:58.560 --> 0:31:9.670 Chris DiPierro You know what is the EU allow versus the US versus UK versus whatever and like the most restrictive thing that you can do clearly is to not ever let a third party have access to any records, right? 0:31:10.100 --> 0:31:14.110 Chris DiPierro So I don't think it's like, why is this a concern when we previously done this. 0:31:14.120 --> 0:31:24.890 Chris DiPierro I think this is more like this is a standard that he's looking to set and the reason why I think it's applicable mostly to like a new product you guys is because we don't really have a standard set, right? 0:31:25.50 --> 0:31:31.580 Chris DiPierro Just because we did something in pentana or whatever in the past doesn't mean we necessarily wanna do the same thing in the brand new platform. 0:31:32.880 --> 0:31:33.200 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:31:31.670 --> 0:31:34.460 Chris DiPierro I ideally I and and and and and. 0:31:34.470 --> 0:31:36.640 Chris DiPierro You know, again, this is a very idealistic view. 0:31:36.710 --> 0:31:44.960 Chris DiPierro Ideally, if we start with the standard, it's easier to continue it than it is to start below the standard and then try to raise ourselves up to it in the future, right? 0:31:44.970 --> 0:31:53.900 Chris DiPierro If Support gets used to have an access to like production environment and that's how they're solving all the problems, and then you tell them well, now you can't do that anymore and that's going to be very disruptive. 0:31:53.910 --> 0:32:1.990 Chris DiPierro But if you start it out that way and then you could hopefully create processes around that going forward. 0:32:2.0 --> 0:32:9.540 Chris DiPierro So and don't get me wrong, I understand the the the idealistic versus practical here a little bit. 0:32:9.550 --> 0:32:16.920 Chris DiPierro I understand that what I've described as is very much in the idealistic side of of the world, but it is very clean hands right? 0:32:16.930 --> 0:32:19.900 Chris DiPierro Like if any auditor came to us any you know? 0:32:20.810 --> 0:32:29.670 Chris DiPierro Uh anybody was looking at us from a standards perspective and we could truly say that, yeah, Support and never sees product and never sees your data at all and never has access to your production instance. 0:32:32.790 --> 0:32:32.890 Vincent Oon Yes. 0:32:29.680 --> 0:32:37.280 Chris DiPierro That's a really great message, 100% right, whether we could actually do that and solve people's problems. 0:32:37.290 --> 0:32:37.760 Chris DiPierro I don't know. 0:32:37.770 --> 0:32:46.570 Chris DiPierro That's where it's not quite my side of the world, but like, I just kind of wanted to report back on, like, kind of what I got from him. 0:32:46.610 --> 0:33:3.950 Chris DiPierro I think from an identity perspective, from a platform perspective, I think the notion of being able to grab a special kind of user, if you will support user access for a certain period of time based on a request absolutely seems like a thing that we should be able to support going forward on our identity side of things. 0:33:4.700 --> 0:33:15.200 Chris DiPierro Whether that is how clearly doesn't exist now, so whether that's a thing that support could you know a model that support could actually use at the moment? 0:33:15.210 --> 0:33:23.320 Chris DiPierro Well, probably not clearly, but I think that is very clean from a where we go identity wise in the future. 0:33:24.240 --> 0:33:28.920 Vincent Oon It's just want to raise one thing is that there are sometimes the Support need to. 0:33:30.970 --> 0:33:32.0 Vincent Oon Need to have the data? 0:33:32.10 --> 0:33:44.320 Vincent Oon That's because the customer saying that they are seeing the wrong thing and then they need the exact data view to make sure that they can reproduce that error and that customer view is being corrected on that. 0:33:44.270 --> 0:33:44.920 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:33:44.690 --> 0:33:45.810 Vincent Oon That query that they. 0:33:45.20 --> 0:33:49.920 Chris DiPierro Well and and and and and and again when I pushed on that like what he said was like fine. 0:33:50.160 --> 0:33:57.300 Chris DiPierro The customer is driving and screen sharing basically, but not that if support is just accessing it on their own right so. 0:34:1.680 --> 0:34:3.310 Chris DiPierro Hey again, you know, I know. 0:34:2.510 --> 0:34:4.990 Stephanie Jones Yeah, I don't know how you would how you solve support. 0:34:8.150 --> 0:34:14.290 Stephanie Jones Was just going to say, I don't know, you still Support issues without like seeing what is happening, you know. 0:34:15.260 --> 0:34:19.870 Stephanie Jones But I so Chris, are you asking like how we support that? 0:34:19.880 --> 0:34:20.470 Stephanie Jones Like what? 0:34:20.500 --> 0:34:20.840 Chris DiPierro Well. 0:34:20.480 --> 0:34:22.440 Stephanie Jones But how would audit and risk support that? 0:34:23.250 --> 0:34:26.140 Chris DiPierro I I think I'm not really necessarily. 0:34:27.920 --> 0:34:29.870 Chris DiPierro I guess I'm trying to figure out exactly what I'm saying here. 0:34:29.880 --> 0:34:32.10 Chris DiPierro I think what I'm saying is I don't. 0:34:32.20 --> 0:34:41.370 Chris DiPierro I think we would be hesitant on the platform side to build something that is more liberal than what we're described. 0:34:41.380 --> 0:34:46.910 Chris DiPierro If that is the expected standards that the support team wants to hold themselves to in the future, right? 0:34:46.980 --> 0:34:51.910 Chris DiPierro Like like I think one of the questions kind of came up very specifically in arc is like in a production instance. 0:34:51.920 --> 0:35:0.490 Chris DiPierro Do we always provision like a support user if you will an idea Gen an admin user that you guys can that support can access and go do things in right? 0:35:0.600 --> 0:35:0.940 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:35:1.560 --> 0:35:20.960 Chris DiPierro And if we did like JK brought up some of the challenges that that Intel's with it, like not showing that user in list of users and things like that right like where you might assign records and that that kind of stuff well kind of the guidance that I hear from essentially they had a support is like no we shouldn't be doing that right? 0:35:20.970 --> 0:35:24.470 Chris DiPierro We shouldn't be provisioned automatically provisioning a production user. 0:35:24.560 --> 0:35:27.710 Chris DiPierro We should be being a bit restrictive on that, right? 0:35:27.860 --> 0:35:39.830 Chris DiPierro So I think what happened is I you know what I don't know if that's a big change in how your support team intends to support this product or not. 0:35:39.870 --> 0:35:42.440 Chris DiPierro If it's not, then I don't know that there is a whole lot of take away in this. 0:35:42.450 --> 0:35:55.490 Chris DiPierro And then just to confirm that that's what we're gonna do, if it if it is a big change, then I think there needs to be some conversations on the support side of things of saying like well, look, that's not gonna work for our world. 0:35:55.900 --> 0:35:56.70 Vincent Oon Good. 0:35:55.500 --> 0:35:57.20 Chris DiPierro We need to do something different, right? So. 0:35:59.510 --> 0:36:1.640 Stephanie Jones Yeah, it does sound like a bigger conversation. 0:36:4.240 --> 0:36:5.60 Chris DiPierro Yeah, yeah, sure. 0:36:1.650 --> 0:36:9.940 Stephanie Jones I don't wanna speak on behalf of support because I don't know if they even are aware that that we're even having this discussion. 0:36:11.30 --> 0:36:11.460 Chris DiPierro Well, we're. 0:36:11.470 --> 0:36:12.360 Chris DiPierro We're they, they. 0:36:12.370 --> 0:36:13.580 Chris DiPierro They asked about user grants, right? 0:36:9.950 --> 0:36:15.380 Stephanie Jones Well, actually they are because they said how will we access but not about the data, yeah. 0:36:13.590 --> 0:36:16.80 Chris DiPierro Like, that's where this all initially kind of came from, right? So. 0:36:23.240 --> 0:36:23.440 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:16.620 --> 0:36:23.530 Vincent Oon Please this on my discussion with the the other team in the support for the other product, not just audit and risk. 0:36:29.10 --> 0:36:29.230 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:23.600 --> 0:36:31.880 Vincent Oon They are practice also the for the support team doesn't have access to the production, they only access to the liar production light system. 0:36:40.420 --> 0:36:40.630 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:44.530 --> 0:36:46.210 Chris DiPierro To the to the staging environment or yeah. 0:36:51.660 --> 0:36:51.840 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:57.600 --> 0:36:57.780 Chris DiPierro Sure. 0:36:33.310 --> 0:37:0.860 Vincent Oon That's for troubleshooting only, but if there's a circumstances where they need to test on the data, the data will be copied over to the production line environment for temporary basis with the help from I think technical services team or the car off team and and then after that that data will be deleted from from, from that environment, from the environment means they will never have access to the live system. 0:37:0.870 --> 0:37:3.150 Vincent Oon So I think your suggestion makes sense to me. 0:37:3.900 --> 0:37:4.630 Vincent Oon It should work. 0:37:4.570 --> 0:37:7.400 Chris DiPierro Yeah, the the never has access to the live system part. 0:37:7.410 --> 0:37:8.830 Chris DiPierro That's probably the easier bit. 0:37:9.40 --> 0:37:12.710 Chris DiPierro The doesn't have access to any customer data. 0:37:12.920 --> 0:37:17.750 Chris DiPierro Part is almost certainly the harder part of it, right is, I think if we're being realistic about it so. 0:37:19.350 --> 0:37:19.570 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:37:22.320 --> 0:37:22.540 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:37:25.70 --> 0:37:25.680 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:37:19.580 --> 0:37:26.90 Vincent Oon Yeah, that's how the other product doing, uh, they they get technical services or cause teams move the data. 0:37:26.50 --> 0:37:36.920 Chris DiPierro And and and and and and and maybe that's the compromise for the time being, but I think Support needs to make sure that that's OK with, you know up there Tan with, with with policies and that kind of stuff. 0:37:36.930 --> 0:37:42.540 Chris DiPierro I think that you know, the Vincent, the inherent risk in that there's definitely less risk clearly, right. 0:37:42.550 --> 0:37:48.280 Chris DiPierro But the inherent risk there is you're still copying production data over to a staging environment, and then you're given access to a third party. 0:37:48.410 --> 0:37:50.390 Chris DiPierro That third party could go do something with that data, right? 0:37:50.400 --> 0:37:53.0 Chris DiPierro They could go leak that data somewhere or whatever, right? 0:37:53.10 --> 0:38:1.140 Chris DiPierro So I think in the absolute purists sense, the answer of not being able to see any of the customers data is a good one. 0:38:1.420 --> 0:38:3.600 Chris DiPierro But yeah, I understand the practicalities of it. 0:38:3.650 --> 0:38:17.530 Chris DiPierro If if that's what support needs to do, then I just think they need to make sure that they Firefly that with their whatever new processes that they're trying to roll out, you know business wise and that kind of stuff to make sure that that that is consistent with that. 0:38:22.580 --> 0:38:30.270 Vincent Oon I think there are also uh practiced where the data is mass means that maybe they will hide the sensitive data or change. 0:38:29.500 --> 0:38:30.290 Chris DiPierro Yeah, maybe. 0:38:30.460 --> 0:38:31.510 Vincent Oon Yeah, change it to. 0:38:30.940 --> 0:38:45.810 Chris DiPierro But but but that that that sounds like a feature that probably, you know, internal audit and risk management needs to support if there's going to be some sort of masking of data based on like user permission set right then that would be something that you guys would need to to implement under the covers there so. 0:38:54.560 --> 0:38:54.810 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:38:56.830 --> 0:38:57.300 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:38:47.890 --> 0:38:58.380 Vincent Oon Yeah, it means that the that data can be imported to, to to the Support environment, but they will not see the the real data the real completed. 0:38:57.350 --> 0:39:14.10 Chris DiPierro Anyway, look again, purely from a platform interaction with our perspective, I think what what what I'm saying is we're in my opinion supportive of the notion of creating this kind of support User going forward in the future and identity services that can be unlocked for based on requests. 0:39:14.20 --> 0:39:17.830 Chris DiPierro I think that is a thing that we absolutely need to support on the platform side of things. 0:39:18.70 --> 0:39:26.540 Chris DiPierro If it How at you know as definitely none of the US are qualified on this call to answer, have support really needs to actually operate with the new products. 0:39:26.550 --> 0:39:29.880 Chris DiPierro But I just wanna suggest that we're not gonna go. 0:39:35.230 --> 0:39:35.430 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:39:29.890 --> 0:39:37.740 Chris DiPierro Just be super permissive about this without kind of getting a little bit more clarity from from like a above that support team, right? So. 0:39:40.190 --> 0:39:40.470 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:39:45.330 --> 0:39:47.820 Chris DiPierro Sorry Josh for hijacking the last 20 minutes. 0:39:48.790 --> 0:39:49.780 Joshua Haseldine I don't worry. 0:39:49.790 --> 0:39:51.240 Joshua Haseldine I have another question. 0:39:53.60 --> 0:39:53.220 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:39:55.410 --> 0:39:56.50 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I think so. 0:39:51.250 --> 0:40:9.470 Joshua Haseldine I just wanted to let you, Chris, sorry if if we finished on this by the way, cool, I I wanna talk about our Lord and Savior Gainsight and the timings and game site E because I am getting pushed back from the business that it. 0:40:13.280 --> 0:40:13.480 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:40:15.490 --> 0:40:15.640 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:40:16.10 --> 0:40:23.250 Joshua Haseldine And it was always stuck in a bit of a an issue where we we need some stuff from platform. 0:40:25.380 --> 0:40:27.230 Joshua Haseldine I think I've had a great discussion with this about you. 0:40:27.300 --> 0:40:30.700 Joshua Haseldine I can get the email up if I remember but. 0:40:29.420 --> 0:40:31.550 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I mean, so, so. 0:40:31.620 --> 0:40:39.390 Chris DiPierro So the thing you need for a given tenant basically is what's called the idea of the Gen application ID, right? 0:40:39.460 --> 0:40:42.80 Chris DiPierro And right now the platform service is just don't provide that. 0:40:39.950 --> 0:40:42.290 Joshua Haseldine Umm, that was it? 0:40:42.300 --> 0:40:42.710 Joshua Haseldine Yeah. 0:40:42.750 --> 0:40:43.0 Joshua Haseldine Thank you. 0:40:42.180 --> 0:40:48.70 Chris DiPierro We've got it on our road map to be able to provide that, but yeah, they just don't. 0:40:48.120 --> 0:40:55.840 Chris DiPierro So right now, if you wanted to implement game site, really what you would need to do is just kind of stash that information on a per tenant basis like somewhere else, right? 0:40:55.850 --> 0:40:57.690 Chris DiPierro And I don't have a good answer to you. 0:40:57.700 --> 0:40:58.60 Chris DiPierro Like what? 0:40:58.70 --> 0:41:8.480 Chris DiPierro The somewhere else is, but certainly I think we can talk with Nige about potentially, but if you, if you could just, if you could do that, then you could absolutely enable PX at that point. 0:41:10.30 --> 0:41:10.350 Joshua Haseldine OK. 0:41:12.630 --> 0:41:13.590 Joshua Haseldine OK so. 0:41:15.930 --> 0:41:17.650 Chris DiPierro I think in in the what? 0:41:12.90 --> 0:41:18.270 Stephanie Jones So it would have to be in the platform itself, not coming from platform services. 0:41:19.450 --> 0:41:31.100 Chris DiPierro Well, in, in in the longer term, yeah, it really should just come from like our provisioning services or our platform services like really what should happen, you know in, in Paul Martin typical UI of the future. 0:41:31.290 --> 0:41:37.160 Chris DiPierro One of the things that he should have to enter is the idea agent application ID for this tenant. 0:41:37.710 --> 0:41:40.100 Chris DiPierro That should then be stored somewhere in. 0:41:40.170 --> 0:41:45.40 Chris DiPierro However, it is that we deploy that and by the way, when I say store, I don't even really cut a node. 0:41:45.50 --> 0:41:57.150 Chris DiPierro The technology behind there, Keith, but basically one new button press there that should either you know be sent as part of the message that we send to the ARC products or whatever, whatever it is at that point. 0:41:57.160 --> 0:42:5.960 Chris DiPierro But it should really be done at that probably at that point I would guess it would probably still be on Arctic store it somewhere at that point. 0:42:5.970 --> 0:42:12.120 Chris DiPierro What once the provisioning is is is done, you can make an argument about being able to change this in the future. 0:42:12.130 --> 0:42:13.140 Chris DiPierro It's not supposed to change. 0:42:13.150 --> 0:42:18.660 Chris DiPierro Just FYI, like once it's just established for a given tenant for a given product, does it really shouldn't. 0:42:18.670 --> 0:42:25.260 Chris DiPierro But presumably if it did change somewhere, we probably need a process to be able to modify it from there. 0:42:25.350 --> 0:42:32.860 Chris DiPierro But yeah, right now we just, this is not a thing that we provide at provisioning time, but we we do need to make that change going forward. 0:42:32.870 --> 0:42:36.820 Chris DiPierro But if you wanna implement PX ahead of that, I think you absolutely could so. 0:42:47.420 --> 0:42:47.600 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:42:37.600 --> 0:42:51.460 Joshua Haseldine Ah, OK I the reason I ask is I got pushback that we don't think we can do the I'm storing at the info on our and I I've got. 0:42:51.470 --> 0:42:54.770 Joshua Haseldine I've had a few devs just to take a quick look at it and it's it. 0:43:3.190 --> 0:43:3.430 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:43:3.440 --> 0:43:5.220 Chris DiPierro I mean it's like 1 string. 0:42:54.780 --> 0:43:5.280 Joshua Haseldine It's definitely not easy as my point, like there's doubt, whether we could actually do it and I would have to jump through a lot of hoops. 0:43:5.230 --> 0:43:8.920 Chris DiPierro I assume you've got a database back and stuff in ARC somewhere, right? 0:43:8.690 --> 0:43:9.170 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, yeah. 0:43:8.930 --> 0:43:11.360 Chris DiPierro Like just drop that string in the database somewhere and there you go. 0:43:11.870 --> 0:43:20.470 Chris DiPierro But but let you want me to grab an image for a quick call on it or. 0:43:19.560 --> 0:43:21.450 Joshua Haseldine I think, Nigel, he. 0:43:21.520 --> 0:43:24.870 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, I I think we might need a bit of larger call around this. 0:43:24.880 --> 0:43:27.20 Joshua Haseldine However, I'll need let me clarify. 0:43:27.30 --> 0:43:29.310 Joshua Haseldine I tell you what, let me sell the call with. 0:43:29.560 --> 0:43:29.760 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:43:30.270 --> 0:43:33.270 Joshua Haseldine I was nice, but I need to have a word with. 0:43:36.360 --> 0:43:38.410 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, basically, just let me get everything in order. 0:43:48.280 --> 0:43:49.40 Chris DiPierro OK.

This model suggests granting temporary access to a support admin user by a tenant admin upon request. - **Compliance and Data Security**: Discussed the need for a mechanism that ensures the support team could operate effectively without compromising data security, adhering to regulations across different geographies. # Platform Services and Gainsight Integration - **ARC and Gainsight**: Joshua Haseldine inquired about the timeline and requirements for integrating Gainsight with ARC, notably the need for an Ideagen application ID. - **BFF (Backend for Frontend) Work**: Mentioned that the work on BFF, which might relate to the Gainsight integration, is planned for the next sprint, although the release might take some time. # Implementation Concerns and Action Points - **Clarification on BFF and Support Access**: Need to clarify whether the BFF work mentioned relates directly to the temporary session access for the support team and how it aligns with the overall architecture and security model proposed by Muna. - **Further Discussions**: A suggestion was made to have more detailed discussions involving relevant stakeholders to address some of the concerns raised about the feasibility and implications of implementing the proposed support access model and Gainsight integration. # Summary The meeting covered various crucial topics like licensing, support model changes, and the integration of third-party tools like Gainsight. The discussion on support access highlighted a significant shift towards more stringent data access policies for compliance. The talks on Gainsight integration and the related BFF work indicated ongoing efforts to enhance the platform's capabilities and integrate with critical tools for customer success and support. Further discussions and clarification are needed on several points to ensure alignment and address implementation concerns."},{"instruction":"Go thru the transcript again and make sure nothing is missed. Extract all the points as discussed above transcript and group them into appropriate sections.","output":"# Licensing Discussion - **License Agreement and Notifications**: Discussed the implementation of an exploration and notification system for licensing. This included sending notifications both internally to account managers and externally to tenant admins. - **Grace Period and MVP Planning**: A fixed grace period, initially proposed as two weeks for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), to prevent the assignment of new licenses during this period. - **License Types and Descriptions**: Addressed the need for updated information on new license types, specifically mentioning the introduction of an Enterprise User license. It was discussed how these types affect provisioning and renewal processes. - **Renewal Process and License Reduction**: Discussed how the renewal process would work, especially when the number of renewed licenses is less than the current number allocated, and how notifications to account managers and tenant admins play into this. Emphasized that automatic deprovisioning due to license reduction would not be enforced but managed through notifications. # Support Access Model - **Access to Production Data**: The proposed model restricts Support from accessing production data directly. Instead, it allows Support to view metadata for troubleshooting, with a tenant admin's ability to grant temporary access to a support admin user upon request. - **Screen Sharing for Data Issues**: In cases where direct access to data by Support is necessary for resolving issues, screen sharing sessions with the customer, supervised and under NDAs if necessary, were proposed as a solution. # Technical Implementations and Integrations - **Gainsight Integration**: Discussed requirements and timeline for integrating the Gainsight tool with ARC, emphasizing the need for an Ideagen application ID for this process. - **Backend for Frontend (BFF) Work**: Mentioned upcoming work on BFF for the next sprint, hinting at its relation to features needed for Gainsight integration and potentially for the support access model. # Platform and Product Development Concerns - **Data Security Standards**: Emphasized the importance of ensuring data security and compliance with regulations across different geographies by restricting Support's access to only necessary metadata and through temporary access mechanisms controlled by tenant admins. - **Clarification and Further Discussion Needs**: Highlighted the need for further detailed discussions among stakeholders, including product development and support teams, to address concerns regarding the feasibility and security of implementing the proposed support access model and Gainsight integration. # Execution and Follow-Up Actions - **Summary and Communication**: Agreed upon summarizing the meeting discussions and sending out emails to all participants for clarity and further actions. - **Clarifications and Additional Meetings**: Proposed setting up additional meetings to dive deeper into specific topics like the BFF's role in support access and to clarify implementation strategies for Gainsight integration."},{"instruction":"explain the plot to silver linings playbook","output":"\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a 2012 romantic drama film directed by David O. Russell, based on the 2008 novel of the same name by Matthew Quick. The plot centers around Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man struggling with bipolar disorder who has recently been released from a psychiatric hospital. After spending eight months in the facility as part of a plea deal following a violent episode spurred by his undiagnosed condition, Pat returns home to live with his parents in Philadelphia. He is determined to win back his estranged wife, Nikki, despite her restraining order against him, believing that as long as he remakes himself into the man she always wanted, she will take him back. Pat's life takes an unexpected turn when he meets Tiffany Maxwell (played by Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow who is dealing with her grief through promiscuity and dance. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with Nikki, but in exchange, she wants him to be her partner in a dance competition. Despite initial reluctance, Pat agrees, and as they practice, they form an unconventional bond, helping each other work through their issues and emotional baggage. Throughout the film, Pat struggles with his family dynamics, especially with his father, Pat Sr. (played by Robert De Niro), who is obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles and has his own set of superstitions and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. The relationships between Pat, his family, and Tiffany are explored against the backdrop of football, dancing, and the challenges of managing mental illness. The title \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" refers to Pat's philosophy of looking for the 'silver linings' or positive aspects in every situation, a mindset that he tries to maintain as he rebuilds his life.

Despite his initial success in positioning himself as a significant leader after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, his rule ultimately led to failure and chaos, paving the way for the warlord era in China. Several factors contributed to the failure of Yuan Shikai: 1. **Overambition and Authoritarianism**: Yuan's ambition led him to attempt the restoration of the monarchy with himself as emperor. This deeply unpopular move alienated many of his supporters, including those in the military, and sparked widespread opposition. His authoritarian style of governance and efforts to centralize power also generated resentment and resistance among the population and regional leaders. 2. **Betrayal of the Republic**: Yuan initially positioned himself as a supporter of the Republican revolutionaries in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. However, once in power, he quickly moved to consolidate his own authority at the expense of republican ideals and institutions. This betrayal disillusioned many of his initial supporters and led to numerous revolts and uprisings against his rule. 3. **Economic Mismanagement**: Yuan Shikai's government faced severe economic challenges, including military expenses and the costs associated with his attempt to establish a monarchy. His administration relied heavily on foreign loans which increased national debt and weakened China's financial position. This led to economic instability and contributed to his loss of support. 4. **Failure to Garner International Support**: Although Yuan managed to secure some foreign loans, his overall foreign policy and the attempt to establish himself as emperor did not win significant international support. Foreign powers were mainly interested in maintaining their own privileges in China and were indifferent to Yuan's fate as long as their interests were protected. 5. **Military Disloyalty and Collapse**: One of Yuan's primary bases of power was the military, but his reliance on it was a double-edged sword. His autocratic moves, especially the re-establishment of the monarchy, caused splits within military ranks, with key factions withdrawing their support. The loyalty of the military was more personal and regional than to the central government, making it difficult for Yuan to maintain control once he lost the faith of his generals. 6. **Nationalist Opposition and Uprisings**: Yuan's actions led to the rise of nationalist sentiments against him, particularly from the southern provinces and Sun Yat-sen's followers, who opposed Yuan's monarchist ambitions and authoritarian rule. This opposition eventually culminated in armed rebellions that further weakened Yuan's grip on power. 7. **Personal Health Issues and Death**: Yuan's health deteriorated under the stress of the rebellions and the failed attempt to become emperor. His death in 1916 left a power vacuum that hastened the fragmentation of China into territories controlled by various warlords. In summary, Yuan Shikai's failure was the result of overambition, betrayal of early republican ideals, economic mismanagement, lack of genuine international support, military disloyalty, and widespread opposition from various factions within China. His rule is often seen as a critical factor that led to the fragmentation and chaos of the warlord era, severely delaying the consolidation of a stable, unified republic in China."},{"instruction":"stm32 ile 4 farklı 19 pinli bir kablonun süreklilik testi ve pinlerin doğruluk testi kod yazılımı nasıl yapılır","output":"STM32 mikrodenetleyicileri ile 4 farklı 19 pinli kablonun süreklilik ve doğruluk testi yapmak için gerekli yazılımı genel hatlarıyla anlatacağım.

Bu işlemi gerçekleştirmek için, her bir kablonun pinlerinin mikrodenetleyicinin GPIO (Genel Amaçlı Giriş/Çıkış) pinlerine bağlandığını varsayarak başlayalım. Giriş ve çıkış olarak ayarlanabilen bu pinler sayesinde, her bir pin çiftinin doğru şekilde bağlandığını kontrol edebiliriz. # Adım 1: Gerekli Kütüphanelerin Dahil Edilmesi Herhangi bir STM32 projede olduğu gibi, ilk adım olarak HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) kütüphanesini veya LL (Low Layer) kütüphanesini projenize dahil etmelisiniz. Bu kütüphaneler, pinleri başlatmak, okumak ve yazmak için kullanılacak fonksiyonları sağlar. \`\`\`c #include \\"stm32f4xx_hal.h\\" \`\`\` # Adım 2: Pin Konfigürasyonu Her bir pinin, test sırasında alternatif olarak giriş ve çıkış olarak ayarlanması gerekecek. Bu, pinleri dinamik olarak konfigüre etmek için yazılımda yapılabilir. Pinleri ayarlamak için, GPIO yapılandırma fonksiyonlarını kullanarak her bir pin için giriş ve çıkış modlarını alternatif olarak ayarlayabilirsiniz. # Adım 3: Süreklilik Test Fonksiyonu Her bir pin çifti için süreklilik testi yapacak fonksiyonu tanımlayın.

Aşağıdaki adımlar, söz konusu test için gerekli yazılım geliştirme sürecine genel bir bakış sunar: # Adım 1: Donanım Kurulumu Her bir kablo için, 19 pini tek tek STM32 mikrodenetleyicinizin GPIO pinlerine bağlayın.

Çıkış pini yüksek (HIGH) sinyali verir ve sırayla tüm giriş pinleri bu sinyali algılamaya çalışır. Beklenen tek yüksek sinyali, çıkış pinine karşılık gelen giriş pininden gelmelidir. 2. **Doğruluk Testi (Farklı Kablolar Arası):** Kablolar arasında yanlış bağlantıların olup olmadığını kontrol etmek için, bir kablonun bir pinini çıkış olarak ayarlayın ve yüksek sinyal verin. Diğer tüm kabloların aynı numaralı pinleri sırasıyla giriş olarak kontrol edilir. Hiçbir giriş pininde yüksek sinyal algılanmamalıdır. # Adım 5: Test Sonuçlarını Değerlendirme Bir pin çifti arasındaki beklenen bağlantı sağlandığında, bu test başarılı kabul edilir.

Burada, multiplexing tekniklerinden ve programın esnekliğinden yararlanacağız. # Donanım Kurulumu - Kablo pinlerinin STM32 mikrodenetleyicinizin GPIO pinlerine doğru şekilde bağlanması gerekmektedir. Eğer yeterli GPIO pini yoksa, bir GPIO expander ya da multiplexer kullanılabilir. - Düşük dirençli bir test için, her GPIO pini için 10k ohm gibi pull-down ya da pull-up dirençleri eklemeniz gerekebilir. # Yazılım Tasarımı 1. **Pin Yapılandırmaları**: Tüm pinleri programın başlangıcında INPUT olarak yapılandırın.

Bu yaklaşım, test öncesi sabit bir senaryo yerine, sistemin mevcut durumuna veya o anki koşullarına bağlı olarak testlerin dinamik bir şekilde oluşturulup değerlendirilmesini mümkün kılar. Dinamik testlerin temel özellikleri şunlardır: # Gerçek Zamanlı Test Dinamik testler, sistemin gerçek zamanlı çalışmasını veya simülasyonunu esas alır. Sistem çalışır durumdayken (yürütme zamanında) değişkenler, durumlar ve farklı girişler üzerinde testler yapılır. Bu, özellikle yazılımın davranışını gerçek kullanım senaryoları altında değerlendirmek için önemlidir. # Esneklik Dinamik testler, farklı senaryolara, giriş verilerine veya sistemin aldığı yollara adapte olabilir. Bu, bir test planının veya senaryonun sabit olmaktan çıkıp, çalışma zamanı koşullarına göre dinamik olarak değişebileceği anlamına gelir. Örneğin, bir web uygulaması test edilirken, kullanıcı davranışları simüle eden testler kullanıcıdan alınan gerçek zamanlı verilere göre dinamik olarak oluşturulabilir. # Otomatik Test Oluşturma Bazı dinamik test yaklaşımları, test senaryolarını otomatik olarak oluşturabilir. Bu, bazı testlerin sistem tarafından belirlenen ölçütlere veya algoritmalara dayalı olarak yürütme sırasında kendiliğinden çalıştırılması demektir. Örneğin, yazılımın farklı modüllerinden gelen verilerin entegrasyonunu test ederken, her bir modülün çıktıları gerçek zamanlı olarak farklı test senaryoları oluşturmak için kullanılabilir. # Kapsamlı Test Kapsamı Dinamik testler, testlerin tasarlanması ve uygulanmasında esneklik sağladığından, genellikle daha kapsamlı bir test kapsamına imkan verir. Dinamik yaklaşım sayesinde, çeşitli giriş kombinasyonları, sistem durumları ve kullanıcı etkileşimleri test edilebilir, böylece olası hatalar ve açıklar daha etkin bir şekilde tespit edilebilir. # Performans ve Güvenlik Testleri Dinamik test yaklaşımı, özellikle performans ve güvenlik testlerinde yaygın olarak kullanılır. Sistem, gerçek dünya koşullarını taklit eden trafik veya saldırı senaryolarına maruz bırakılır ve sistem bu koşullar altında nasıl performans gösterdiği veya güvenliğini nasıl koruduğu değerlendirilir. Dinamik test yaklaşımı, test süreçlerinin esnekliğini ve kapsamını artırarak, yazılım ve donanımın gerçek dünya koşullarında nasıl performans göstereceğine dair daha güvenilir bilgiler sunar. Bu yaklaşım, sistemleri daha derinlemesine ve kapsamlı bir şekilde test etmek için kritik öneme sahiptir."},{"instruction":"üstteki pseudo testinde dinamik testi yaklaşımını nasıl yaptığını açıkla","output":"Önceki pseudo test kodunda sunulan dinamik test yaklaşımı, sistemdeki değişkenleri (bu durumda kablo pinleri) gerçek zamanlı olarak yürütme sırasında test etmeyi ve bu testleri yaparken girişi ve beklenen çıktıyı programın çalışma zamanında dinamik olarak belirleyip uygulamayı içerir. Bu yaklaşımın dinamik olması, önceden belirlenmiş sabit senaryolara veya girişlere dayanmaması, bunun yerine sistem durumlarına veya yürütme sırasında elde edilen verilere göre testlerin oluşturulmasını sağlar. Bu dinamik test yaklaşımının nasıl yapıldığını aşağıda özetledim: # Gerçek Zamanlı Sistem Durumlarına Dayalı Testler Dinamik test yaklaşımı, her bir pin için testi yürütme sırasında gerçekleştirir. Her test döngüsünde, belli bir pin çıkış (output) olarak ayarlanır ve sistem, bu durumdayken diğer pinlerin durumunu kontrol eder. Bu süreç, tüm pinler için tekrarlanır. # Esnek Pin Yapılandırma Değişiklikleri Her bir pin sırayla çıkış olarak ayarlanırken, diğer pinler giriş olarak yapılandırılır. Bu yapılandırma test sırasında dinamik olarak değişir. Bir pin üzerindeki test tamamlandığında, yapılandırma sıradaki pini test edecek şekilde güncellenir. Bu esneklik, farklı yapılandırmaları ve bağlantı senaryolarını test etmeyi kolaylaştırır. # Otomatik Test Senaryosu Oluşturma ve Uygulama Test prosedürü, her bir pin için beklenen sonuçları dinamik olarak belirleyerek otomatik olarak farklı test senaryoları oluşturur. Örneğin, bir pin test edilirken, bu pinle bağlantılı olması gereken diğer pin(ler)in beklenen durumları (HIGH ya da LOW) yürütme zamanında tanımlanır. Bu yaklaşım, testin kapsamını ve etkinliğini artırır çünkü yazılım, test edilecek pinlere ve beklenen bağlantılara göre dinamik olarak uyum sağlar. # Kapsamlı Test Kapsamı Yaklaşım, tüm olası pin kombinasyonlarını sırayla test ederek, kablo üzerindeki her bir pin bağlantısının doğruluğunu ve sürekliliğini kapsamlı bir şekilde doğrular. Bu, hem doğru bağlantıları hem de olası hatalı bağlantı veya süreklilik sorunlarını tespit etmeye yardımcı olur. Bu dinamik test yaklaşımı, test senaryolarını ve giriş/çıktı parametrelerini çalışma zamanında belirleyip uygulayarak, geleneksel statik test metodolojilerine göre daha esnek ve duyarlı bir test süreci sunar. Bu yaklaşımın gücü, testin gerçekleştiği ortama (gerçek zamanlı sistem durumları) ve dinamik olarak değişen koşullara (farklı pin yapılandırmaları ve bağlantı durumları) uyum sağlama yeteneğindedir."},{"instruction":"elimde 9 pinli bir kablo var bu kablonun ucunda ki birinci konnektöründe 1. ve 4. ve 7. pinler bağlı ikinci konnektöründe 3. 6. ve 9. pinler bağlı üçüncü konnektöründe 2. 5. ve 8. pinler bağlı ben bu kabloya stm32 kullanarak süreklilik ve doğruluk test için test yazılımı geliştirmem gerekiyor d,","output":"STM32 mikrodenetleyicileri kullanarak bir kablo için süreklilik ve doğruluk testi yapmak istiyorsunuz.

Такие ограничения не только отражают политику социальной ответственности платформы, но и призваны обеспечить безопасность и комфорт пользователям. **2. Нравится в работе:** Примеры кейсов или проектов, которые нравятся или которые могли бы быть улучшены, зависят от личного восприятия и интересов кандидата. Важно уделить внимание не только самому кейсу, но и тому, какие инновации или решения были применены, чтобы достичь целей проекта.

Также предполагает дифференциацию бюджета на разные этапы кампании и целевую аудиторию, разделенную по интересам и демографическим характеристикам. 1. **Ошибки:** Одной из частых ошибок в медиапланах является недооценка важности ретаргетинга и контент-маркетинга. Распределение бюджета может быть слишком сосредоточено на привлечении новой аудитории, в то время как вторичное вовлечение уже заинтересованных пользователей может быть более эффективным с точки зрения конверсии и стоимости привлечения клиента. 2. **Корректировка показателей:** Можно предложить увеличить долю бюджета на разработку полезного и уникального контента, включая видеоматериалы, инструкции, кейсы и обучающие материалы, обеспечивающие органическое привлечение и повышение лояльности аудитории. # Задание 4: Анализ инструментов Рассмотрим бренд в банковской сфере \\"N Bank\\". Цель маркетинговой стратегии – привлекать новых клиентов и повышать лояльность существующих через улучшение узнаваемости бренда и продажи финансовых продуктов. - **Верхняя часть воронки (Awareness):** Интеграция с популярными блогерами и организация совместных вебинаров по финансовой грамотности. Оценивать эффективность можно через охват и вовлеченность аудитории. - **Средняя часть воронки (Consideration):** Разработка интерактивного онлайн-консультанта в приложении ВКонтакте для ответов на вопросы пользователей о банковских услугах. Использование целевых страниц (landing page) с подробным описанием услуг и отзывами клиентов. Эффективность можно оценить по конверсии посетителей страниц в заявки. - **Нижняя часть воронки (Conversion):** Предложение эксклюзивных условий на кредиты и депозиты для пользователей ВКонтакте. Оценка эффективности – через конверсию в заявки и открытие счетов. # Задание 5: Организация работы Получение брифа подразумевает разработку междисциплинарного решения с использованием всех площадок контура VK для кампании комплексного характера. 1. **Первый шаг:** Встреча с руководителем проекта и стратегом для предварительного обсуждения целей и потенциала брифа. Определение основных месседжей и целей кампании. 2. **Анализ и стратегия:** Совместная работа с аналитиком и менеджером по работе с данными для изучения целевой аудитории и текущих трендов. 3. **Креатив:** Разработка креативной концепции с креативным директором, арт-директором и дизайнерами. Фокус на уникальные предложения для каждой из платформ: ВКонтакте, Одноклассники и т.д. 4. **Разработка и тестирование:** Создание прототипов и тестирование концепций в малых группах аудитории. 5. **Итоговая презентация:** Составление подробного плана реализации проекта с точными сроками и бюджетами, представление клиенту. **Тайминг и документация:** - **Неделя 1:** Первичное обсуждение и анализ. - **Недели 2-3:** Разработка концепции. - **Неделя 4:** Прототипирование и тестирование. - **Неделя 5:** Подготовка итоговой презентации. **Необходимые документы:** - Коммерческое предложение с бюджетом и планом реализации. - Презентация концепции с визуализацией и описанием механик. - Сценарий взаимодействия с целевой аудиторией и план коммуникации.

Rejection doesn't immediately turn off your emotions or attraction to that person. Emotional responses and attachments do not just disappear overnight, especially if you've spent a significant amount of time fantasizing about or longing for a relationship with them. It's part of the human experience to feel a range of emotions, and dealing with unreciprocated feelings can be particularly challenging. It's important to allow yourself to feel these emotions and acknowledge them rather than suppress them. However, it's also vital to work towards moving on to prevent these feelings from affecting your mental health and well-being. This process can include spending time with friends and family, engaging in activities or hobbies that you enjoy, and focusing on personal growth. Over time, these feelings typically diminish as you begin to accept the rejection and open yourself to the possibility of other relationships and experiences. If you find that your feelings are overwhelming and are significantly impacting your day-to-day life, it might be beneficial to talk to a trusted friend or seek professional help from a counselor or therapist who can guide you through these emotions and help you move forward."},{"instruction":"hey","output":"Hello! How can I help you today?"},{"instruction":"list of more powerful break barrel pistol","output":"As of my last update in 2023, when it comes to break barrel pistols, which are part of the air gun category, options can be somewhat limited compared to their rifle counterparts because the break barrel mechanism — which cocks a spring or gas piston — is harder to engineer in a smaller form factor without sacrificing power or accuracy. However, there are still some models known for their impressive power and performance within the realm of air pistols. Keep in mind that \\"powerful\\" can depend on what you're aiming for — maximum pellet velocity, impact power, or a balance of accuracy and stopping power. Here are several break barrel air pistols that are known for their power and effectiveness: 1. **Weihrauch HW45/Beeman P1** - One of the most powerful and best-regarded air pistols on the market, the HW45, known in the U.S. as the Beeman P1, is a spring-piston air pistol that is nearly as powerful as it gets for this type of airgun. It's capable of shooting .177 pellets at velocities up to 600 fps (feet per second). 2. **Browning 800 Express** - This air pistol is another high-powered option, with the ability to shoot .177 pellets at velocities up to 700 fps. It features a break barrel design and is known for its accuracy and power. 3. **Hatsan Model 25 Supercharger** - Available in .177 and .22 calibers, the Hatsan Model 25 can reach velocities up to 700 fps in .177 and 600 fps in .22 with the right pellets. It has a tactical look and feels, with an ergonomic design. Remember, the power output of air pistols is also subject to legal restrictions in many countries and states within the U.S. High-powered air guns may require a license or may be outright banned in certain jurisdictions, so you should check the regulations in your area. In addition to legal considerations, remember to always prioritize safety when handling any air gun. Protective eyewear is a must, and it's important to use these pistols responsibly, recognizing their potential to cause injury or damage if misused."},{"instruction":"举一个公司的例子，这个公司需要有提供一项有创意的好的服务","output":"一个公司提供创新和有趣服务的例子是\\"空中食宿（Airbnb）\\"。Airbnb成立于2008年，最初是由三位创始人通过出租自己家中的额外空间给访问者开始的，以解决旧金山一次大型设计会议期间酒店房间短缺的问题。他们通过搭建一个简单的网站，向访问者提供睡袋和早餐的住宿服务，从中赚取收入。 空中食宿迅速从这个简单的概念发展成为全球性的在线平台，使人们可以将自己的住所或其他类型的空间租给全球范围内的旅客。这项服务不仅帮助房东赚取额外收入，还为旅客提供了独特和个性化的住宿体验，从而打破了传统酒店行业的格局。现在，Airbnb上的房源涵盖了从共享单间到独立岛屿的各种类型，吸引了全球数百万用户。 Airbnb的创意在于它利用了现有资源（人们的未使用住宅空间）来解决一个普遍存在的问题（住宿需求和成本）。这个平台的成功在于其独特的商业模式，它既满足了房东和旅客之间的需求，又创造了一个全球性的社区，人们可以通过租赁和出租住宿空间来分享他们的生活和文化。"},{"instruction":"有没有fashion company？","output":"在时尚领域，有很多公司因其创意和独特的服务而著称，一个很好的例子是“Stitch Fix”。Stitch Fix是一家在线个性化服饰和配饰推荐服务公司，成立于2011年，它通过结合数据分析和专业造型师的专业知识，为客户提供个性化的装扮建议和服务。 # Stitch Fix的工作方式： 1. **个性化调查**：新用户首先填写一个详细的风格偏好调查，包括他们的尺寸、风格偏好、生活方式需求以及预算等。 2. **专业造型师配搭**：Stitch Fix的算法会根据这些信息，帮助其专业造型师为每个用户挑选适合的衣物和配饰。 3. **尝试与选择**：用户会收到一盒包含5件衣物和/或配饰的“修补盒”（Fix box），他们可以在家里舒适地试穿这些物品，然后决定哪些留下哪些退回。 4. **灵活的购买选项**：用户只需为他们决定购买的物品付费，不喜欢的则可以免费退回。Stitch Fix还会根据用户的反馈调整其推荐，使未来的修补盒更符合用户的喜好。 这种模式不仅为顾客提供了便利和个性化的选衣体验，减少了传统购物的时间和精力成本，而且还引入了新的购物方式，让顾客可以在家中尝试并发现新品牌和风格。Stitch Fix通过这种服务为顾客提供了一个既定制化又能不断发现新趣味的时尚探索之旅。 Stitch Fix的成功之处在于，它将技术（数据分析和机器学习）和人性化（专业造型师的个人触摸）结合起来，为客户提供了高度个性化的体验，这在传统的电子商务和实体零售中很难实现。这不仅满足了消费者日益增长的个性化需求，也重新定义了服饰零售的未来。"},{"instruction":"有没有电子产品的company？","output":"在电子产品领域，一个极具创意且提供独特服务的公司例子是“Sonos”。Sonos成立于2002年，是一家美国消费电子公司，专注于开发和生产智能家居音响系统。Sonos的产品通过无线网络连接，允许用户在家中的多个房间内播放音乐，同时还可以通过一款集成的应用程序控制整个系统。 # Sonos的独特之处在于： 1. **多房间同步播放**：Sonos系统可以确保在家中不同房间的扬声器之间实现无缝同步播放，让整个家庭能够享受均衡一致的音质体验。 2. **音频内容的广泛选择**：与多个音乐服务提供商合作，如Spotify、Apple Music、Amazon Music等，使Sonos用户可以轻松访问海量的在线音乐库。 3. **易用性**：通过Sonos应用程序，用户可以轻松控制播放、搜索音乐、调整音量、创建播放列表以及配置扬声器设置。应用程序对于各种操作系统都是可用的，包括iOS、Android以及Windows。 4. **智能家居集成**：Sonos系统支持与多种智能家居设备集成，包括Amazon Echo、Google Home等，用户可以利用这些智能设备进行语音控制，增加了使用的便利性和现代感。 5. **持续的软件更新和产品迭代**：Sonos通过定期发布软件更新，为旧设备带来新功能，确保用户的投资能够长期保值。同时，Sonos还不断推出新产品和配件，满足消费者不断变化的需求。 Sonos之所以成为电子产品领域的一个亮点，是因为它成功地解决了家庭音乐享受的痛点，并通过无缝、高质量的多房间音频体验满足了市场的需求。它的产品不仅是技术的展示，更是一种生活方式的选择，让家居环境通过音乐变得更加愉悦和有趣。Sonos以用户为中心的设计思想、对产品质量的执着追求以及对创新的不断探索，是其在竞争激烈的消费电子市场中脱颖而出的关键因素。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Jest to gra zespołowa, która przekracza granice kulturowe i społeczne, łącząc ludzi różnego wieku, płci i pochodzenia. Historia piłki nożnej sięga wieków, ale jej zmodernizowana forma i zasady zostały skodyfikowane w Anglii w XIX wieku. Od tego czasu, piłka nożna ewoluowała, stając się sportem globalnym, z międzynarodowymi turniejami takimi jak Mistrzostwa Świata FIFA, które przyciągają miliardy widzów. Początki Chociaż dokładne pochodzenie piłki nożnej jest trudne do ustalenia, wiadomo, że gry polegające na kopaniu piłki były popularne w różnych kulturach na przestrzeni wieków. W Anglii piłka nożna zaczęła nabierać rozpoznawalnej formy w średniowieczu, jednak dopiero w XIX wieku zaczęto ustalać jednolite zasady. Kodowanie Zasad W 1863 roku, w Anglii powstała The Football Association (FA), która wprowadziła pierwszy zestaw oficjalnych zasad gry w piłkę nożną. Wprowadzenie tych zasad było krokiem milowym w ewolucji piłki nożnej, ponieważ umożliwiło organizowanie meczów między różnymi klubami według jednolitych standardów. Rozwój i Globalizacja XIX i XX wiek to okres rozwoju klubów piłkarskich, lig krajowych oraz pierwszych międzynarodowych turniejów. Pierwsze Mistrzostwa Świata odbyły się w 1930 roku w Urugwaju, od tego czasu turniej ten rozrósł się do największej sportowej imprezy na świecie. Rozwój technologii komunikacyjnych i mediów w XX wieku dodatkowo przyczynił się do globalizacji piłki nożnej, sprawiając, że stała się ona częścią globalnej kultury. Rola Społeczna Piłki Nożnej Piłka nożna jest dużo więcej niż tylko grą. Ma ona ogromny wpływ społeczny i kulturowy, będąc narzędziem do promowania integracji, równości, zdrowia, oraz edukacji. Wiele projektów społecznych na całym świecie wykorzystuje piłkę nożną, aby wspierać młodzież w trudnej sytuacji życiowej. Również kwestie takie jak rasizm, dyskryminacja oraz równość płci są coraz częściej adresowane w ramach świata piłki nożnej. Wyzwania Pomimo pozytywnych aspektów, piłka nożna stoi również przed wyzwaniami, takimi jak korupcja, dopalacze, manipulacja meczami, czy nadużycia finansowe. Organizacje takie jak FIFA czy UEFA intensywnie pracują nad rozwiązaniami mającymi na celu zapewnienie uczciwości, transparentności, i równości w sporcie. Wnioski Piłka nożna, jako fenomen globalny, odgrywa znaczącą rolę w życiu społecznym i kulturowym na całym świecie. Jest ona więcej niż sportem – to narzędzie do promowania pozytywnych wartości i zmian społecznych. Pomimo wyzwań, które przed nią stoją, jej uniwersalny charakter i zdolność do łączenia ludzi nadal czynią ją jedną z największych pasji ludzkości."},{"instruction":"gotta report details on various old works that were performed at a concert. what’s the length, composer, and lyricist of these works?
