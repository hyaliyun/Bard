You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  Now, I have a new situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin.  Answer this question please: Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the number of melanocytes in an individual's skin remains the same regardless of skin color, so the main factor that we can consider is UV light exposure, which increases melanin production. In the given situation, Robin starts exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, which will stimulate her melanocytes to produce more melanin. On the other hand, Samantha chooses not to expose herself to UV light and just uses lotion on her skin. As a result, her melanocytes will not receive the same UV light stimulation as Robin's. Considering these factors, Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin than Robin. It's important to note that the amount of melanin in Samantha's skin will still depend on her genetic predisposition and any inborn melanin production. Nonetheless, by not exposing her skin to UV light, Samantha is not artificially boosting her melanin levels like Robin is doing through repeated tanning sessions. Since Robin's tanning regimen is specifically designed to increase melanin production, it's clear that Samantha will have comparatively less melanin in this specific situation. However, the vitamin D production in Samantha might be reduced as well, increasing her risk of deficiency, and it is important to ensure that she obtains vitamin D through other sources like diet or supplements if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Put them together and, believe it or not, you have an art project that is judged to be worth £50,000 of taxpayers’ money. Artist Simon Faithfull bought the 24ft Brioney Victoria on eBay for £75. He lit smoke bombs to make it look as if it was on fire, then opened its valves, filling it with water. As it sank, he dived into the sea. And the point of this performance? The boat had been fitted with underwater cameras, which will film for a year as it grows into an artificial reef off the Dorset coast. Footage will be sent to a phone app so people can watch live, and will later be made into a film. Scroll down for video. Dramatic display: British artist Simon Faithfull leaps from the side of the concrete fishing boat as it begins to sink off the coast of Weymouth, Dorset. He set off smoke bombs to make it look like the vessel was on fire. The REEF project will cost £120,000, nearly half funded by the Arts Council. The rest will come from European Union grants. Mr Faithfull, 48, the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: ‘A boat that was at the end of its life is now starting a new one.’ REEF was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, groups supported by the Arts Council. It cost £80,000 to sink the boat and consult marine experts, of which £32,000 came from the Arts Council. An extra £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton and France, of which the Council will pay half. The boat has been fitted with five underwater cameras which will record the 12-month journey of the ‘dead’ boat being brought back to life in the form of an artificial reef for marine life. The footage will be streamed live and a film will eventually be made and shown at art exhibitions. But the project has been slammed by some after it emerged that nearly half of the £120,000 spent on the project has been funded by the British taxpayer through grants from the Arts Council. It was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, two arts organisations in Brighton supported by the Arts Council.The remaining cost has come through European Union arts grants. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers struggling with rising bills will be baffled that they’ve been asked to pay to sink a boat in the name of art. 'If this project was worthwhile then private investment should have been sought. This sort of wasteful spending by unaccountable quangos and local authorities has to come to an end.' Going under: The ship dips below the waves. Five underwater cameras have been attached to the vessel to document the 'dead' ship's journey over the next year as it becomes an artificial reef for marine life. The project, called REEF, has taken three years to come to fruition because of the level of planning and consultation from marine experts required. Mr Faithfull, who is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: 'The idea was to take a boat and send her on a short journey to the bottom of the sea. 'I bought the concrete hull of a disused boat on eBay then added a concrete wheelhouse so it replicated a working boat. We had very strict permissions and the boat was stripped of anything that could potentially be harmful. 'I was on board the boat and we set up pyrotechnics to look like a fire so it looked like the boat was in trouble. 'Then I opened the seacocks and let water into the boat. As it went down I dived off to symbolise abandoning ship. He explained that the boat has been rigged with five cameras that transmitted the sinking and will continue to transmit live for the next year so people can see it transform into a reef. The cameras will broadcast to a mobile app for a year and the film will eventually be shown at exhibitions in Brighton, Calais and Caen in France. Of the £120,000 that the project cost, £80,000 went into buying, building and towing the boat and consulting with marine experts. Of that money, £32,000 was funded by the Arts Council with the rest being met by grants from Interreg, a scheme funded by the European Regional Development Fund to encourage European projects to work together. A further £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton, Caen and Calais, half of which will be met by the Arts Council and half by Interreg. Creative family: Simon Faithfull, pictured left, is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, pictured right earlier this year. One of his recent art projects involved him walking through a burning plane. Laurence Hill from Fabrica, one of the main backers of the project, added: 'Eventually there will be an exhibition at Fabrica with an edited version of the film we took of the sinking. 'In was an amazing success and a real relief after all the planning that has gone into it. It was a relatively expensive project because of all the experts involved in it. Mr Faithfull’s recent art projects have involved films of him walking through a burning plane and walking across the sea bed. He also sent a chair to the edge of space beneath a weather balloon in the name of art.

Her interpersonal relationships are almost completely online and on the phone, with the exception of forgettable interactions with her neighbors and visits to her mother (Diane Baker), who is institutionalized with Alzheimer's disease and often forgets who Bennett is. Bennett's co-worker Dale sends her a floppy disk with a backdoor labeled \\"Ï\\" that permits access to a commonly used computer security system called \\"Gatekeeper\\" sold by Gregg Microsystems, a software company led by CEO Jeff Gregg. Dale and Bennett agree to meet, but Dale's private plane's navigation system malfunctions and sends the plane into a tower, killing him. Bennett travels to Cozumel, Mexico on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam). After seducing Bennett, Devlin pays a mugger to steal her purse as they walk along the beach. He chases the mugger into the foliage and roots through the purse to find the disk before shooting him. He takes Bennett out on his speedboat to kill her as well, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin's wallet, Bennett's dinghy collides with rocks, destroying the disk and hospitalizing her. She is unconscious for three days. When Bennett wakes up, she finds that all records of her life have been deleted: She was checked out of her hotel room, her car is no longer at the LAX parking lot, and her credit cards are invalid. Bennett's home is empty and listed for sale. Moreover, because none of the neighbors remember her, they cannot confirm her identity.

The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... According to the above context, answer the following question. When are supplements mainly of assistance to people? Answer:","output":"Supplements are mainly of assistance to people with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets. They can be helpful if dietary sources are lacking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Keep the berries in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\\"","output":"Title: The Art of Keeping Berries Fresh: A Guide to Proper Storage Introduction: One of the most delightful aspects of summertime is the abundance of fresh, juicy berries. From blueberries to strawberries, raspberries to blackberries, these tasty fruits are not only delicious, but they are also packed with nutrients and antioxidants. However, one common challenge faced by berry-lovers is that these delicate fruits can spoil very quickly if not stored properly. In this article, we will provide guidance on how to keep your berries fresh for up to five days using a simple and effective storage method. Step 1: Sorting the Berries The first step to ensuring that your berries stay fresh for an extended period is to sort through them and remove any moldy or overripe ones. Overripe berries will continue to deteriorate even when stored correctly, and moldy berries can spread the mold to other healthy ones. By taking the time to inspect and remove these unwanted culprits, you are effectively eliminating the factors that could negatively impact the freshness of your remaining berries. Step 2: Preparing the Container Next, choose a suitable container that can safely hold your berries without crushing them. A plastic container is an ideal choice as it is lightweight, durable, and easy to clean. To absorb excess moisture and create a healthy environment for the berries, line the bottom of the container with paper towels. This layer of absorbent material will help prevent the development of mold and prolong the freshness of your berries. Step 3: Transferring the Berries to the Container Carefully place the sorted berries into the lined container, taking care not to overcrowd them. By leaving some space between the berries, you allow air to circulate more freely around each fruit, helping to prevent moisture buildup that could lead to mold growth. Step 4: Adjusting the Lid When it comes to sealing the container, the trick is to avoid completely closing it. Instead, lay the lid on top of the container so that it is slightly ajar. By creating a small opening, airflow is improved around the berries, allowing excess moisture to escape and preventing the fruits from becoming too damp and overly ripe. Step 5: Storing the Berries Finally, after the container is prepared and the berries are safely nestled inside, place the container in your refrigerator. The optimal temperature should be between 32 to 34 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 1 degree Celsius), which maintains the cold chain without freezing the berries. By keeping the berries chilled, you are significantly slowing down the natural ripening process, allowing them to stay fresh for up to five days. Conclusion: By following these five simple steps, you can enjoy your favorite berries and prolong their freshness without worrying about waste. This effective storage method not only keeps your fruits in tip-top condition but also guarantees that their delicious taste and essential nutrients are preserved. So go ahead, indulge in your favorite berries, and savor their goodness for days to come."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: It's ellection time, and mayor George Sitkowski (Bruce Dern) is standing for re-ellection.

University of Notre Dame: Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.

I'd really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it showed up in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. I was very sadly disappointed, which in turn made me mad. I'll give any movie a chance, even if I want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop'. I watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustration. The acting was very, very good, but that was about it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind, we're never given insight to his 'downfall'. While we understand that he and Cedric break up, again, we don't see it happen or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no--nothing. We also gets the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital--but AGAIN, we don't see it. I know some movies are a 'take it as it is' basis, but this movie honestly ticked me off. When Pierre, Cedric's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble, we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end, and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different. I might even be wrong saying this, it was that confusing. The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, out-of-place and confusing pace. I can keep up with films like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other films that have flashbacks/flash-forwards left and right, but CU didn't capture and hold onto the style.

Title: The Prince and the Pauper Movie plot: In Tudor England, two boys are born on the same day in the most different circumstances imaginable. Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the title of the song that contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords?  Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

LONG ISLANDERS - 'FELT I HAD A STORY TO TELL THE WORLD' - NYTimes.com ''ROCKY and I have known each other for about 36 years,'' said Ralph Corsel as he reminisced about the former middleweight boxing champion Rocky Graziano. ''One day - this must have been about five years ago - I said, 'Rocky, it's been over 20 years since your first book' -''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' -'came out.' ''So I said, 'Why don't you do another book?' I said, 'I'll do the book for you.' So he said, 'Yeah, go ahead, you want to do it?' He didn't know how involved I'd get with it.'' Mr. Corsel became involved with it to the point that the project is now reality in the form of ''Somebody Down Here Likes Me Too,'' (12.95) by Rocky Graziano with Ralph Corsel, published by Stein & Day. ''I think I probably ran home and started that same day, doing an outline,'' said the 62-year-old Mr. Corsel, who divides his time between homes in Manhattan and East Quogue. To compose the biography - which recapitulates the fighter's troubled youth, including reformatory and prison terms, and takes him through his championship and beyond, into the realm of show business and marriage and celebrity friends and the counselling of delinquent youngsters and jail inmates - Mr. Corsel followed Mr. Graziano around with a tape recorder, interviewed his friends and conducted research in files of old newspapers. ''It's a book about a man who came up as a poor kid and made it in life regardless of all the obstacles that were thrown in his path,'' Mr. Corsel said. ''There's something electrifying about the guy.'' When it comes to colorful lives, Mr. Corsel is no slouch himself. Starting out as Raffaelo Corsalini, the Bronx-born son of Italianimmigrant parents, he was - by his own account - a thief at the age of 9, a reformatory inmate as a teen-ager, a gun moll's boyfriend who worked in a bootlegging plant, and a Depression-era hobo and panhandler who trekked cross-country to California, where he tried to become a professional singer and became instead a pickpocket and confidence man. After Army service in World War II, he came east and worked as a bartender before establishing his own business as a manufacturer's agent. ''All of a sudden,'' he said of his adoption of the salesman's life, ''the money started pouring in like mad. I realized that nothing makes a man honest like money in the bank, and I lost all desire to do anything crooked.'' After a decade, he was able to let others handle his business for him. ''In the back of my mind, ever since I was very young, I always felt I wanted to write - probably because of the life I had led, my background as a kid. I felt I had a story to tell the world.'' Mr. Corsel, whose formal education had ended in the eighth grade (he spent a good many years reading while on the road as a salesman), enrolled in writing courses at the School of General Studies of Columbia University. Within weeks, he said, a short story he had written about his colorful youth prompted his teacher to encourage him to try a novel. The result was ''Up There the Stars,'' an autobiographical novel published in 1968. Mr. Corsel, who has been married twice and has a daughter, went on from here to write columns for Italian-American publications while keeping an eye on his business, traveling and pursuing his hobby of seeing what he can find while roaming here and there with a metal detector. Right now he's at work on a sequel to ''Up There the Stars.'' As for his biography of Mr. Graziano, he said: ''I put a message in the book, to give hope to kids like ourselves who came up out of the bottom of the barrel, to make them feel that if guys like Rocky and myself could make it, then regardless of the poverty and the background, there's always the possibility of making it. ''This is the most beautiful country in the world.'' Illustrations: Photo of Ralph Corsel What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Ralph Corsel, a writer who decided to write a biography for his friend, former middleweight boxing champion Rocky Graziano. Corsel and Graziano had known each other for many years, and with Graziano's approval, Corsel went on to write the book titled \\"Somebody Down Here Likes Me Too,\\" published by Stein & Day. The book covers Graziano's life, from his troubled youth and time spent in reformatory and prison, to becoming a boxing champion, show business personality, and a counselor for delinquent youngsters and jail inmates. In the article, Corsel shares how he followed Graziano around with a tape recorder, interviewed his friends, and conducted research in old newspaper files to compose the biography. He mentions that it is a story of a man who succeeded in life despite numerous obstacles. Corsel himself has led a colorful life, having been a thief, reformatory inmate, gun moll's boyfriend, bootlegging plant worker, hobo, and eventually a successful businessman. Corsel's affinity for writing began from a desire to share his story with the world, which led him to enroll in writing courses at Columbia University's School of General Studies. He then penned an autobiographical novel titled \\"Up There the Stars,\\" published in 1968, and continued to write columns for Italian-American publications while overseeing his business. Corsel is currently working on a sequel to his first novel and believes that his biography of Graziano serves as a message of hope for disadvantaged youth, proving that anyone can succeed with determination, regardless of their background."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - The Melkite (Greek) Catholic Church (\\"\\") is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See as part of the worldwide Catholic Church. The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics of mixed Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Greek origin, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham.  - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim.  - Macarius IV Tawil ( or Taouil ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1813 to 1815 .  - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name.  - The Holy See  is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.

Brazil's Catholic Church is the latest to publicly oppose a controversial revamping of the country's \\"Forest Code,\\" which activists say would cause an environmental disaster.

Supporters say that the bill will help landowners, especially small ones -- a large number of whom currently violate existing conservation laws. By changing the way that land set aside for preservation is calculated, it would help many get back within the law.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Hippolytus of Rome (170 - 235 AD) was one of the most important 3rd-century theologians in the Christian Church in Rome, where he was probably born. Photios I of Constantinople describes him in his Bibliotheca (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful. Context: As a presbyter of the church at Rome under Pope Zephyrinus (199 - 217 AD), Hippolytus was distinguished for his learning and eloquence. It was at this time that Origen of Alexandria, then a young man, heard him preach.  He accused Pope Zephyrinus of modalism, the heresy which held that the names Father and Son are simply different names for the same subject. Hippolytus championed the Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists, most notably Justin Martyr, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\\"Word\\"). An ethical conservative, he was scandalized when Pope Callixtus I (217 - 222 AD) extended absolution to Christians who had committed grave sins, such as adultery.  Hippolytus himself advocated an excessive rigorism. At this time, he seems to have allowed himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome, and continued to attack Pope Urban I (222 - 230 AD) and Pope Pontian ( 230 - 235 AD). G. Salmon suggests that Hippolytus was the leader of the Greek-speaking Christians of Rome. Allen Brent sees the development of Roman house-churches into something akin to Greek philosophical schools gathered around a compelling teacher.  Under the persecution at the time of Emperor Maximinus Thrax, Hippolytus and Pontian were exiled together in 235 AD to Sardinia, likely dying in the mines. It is quite probable that, before his death there, he was reconciled to the other party at Rome, for, under Pope Fabian (236-250), his body and that of Pontian were brought to Rome. The so-called chronography of the year 354 (more precisely, the Catalogus Liberianus, or Liberian Catalogue) reports that on August 13, probably in 236 AD, the two bodies were interred in Rome, that of Hippolytus in a cemetery on the Via Tiburtina, his funeral being conducted by Justin the Confessor. This document indicates that, by about 255 AD, Hippolytus was considered a martyr and gives him the rank of a priest, not of a bishop, an indication that before his death the schismatic was received again into the Church. Question: Was he a good leader? Answer:","output":"Evaluating whether Hippolytus of Rome was a good leader necessitates considering various aspects of his personal and theological contributions as well as the context in which he lived. 1. Theological Knowledge and Eloquence: Hippolytus was reputed for his learning and eloquence, as noted during his time as a presbyter of the Church at Rome. His dedication to the promotion and articulation of the Christian faith demonstrates his commitment to sharing his knowledge and providing strong theological arguments. 2. Defense against Heresies: Hippolytus actively fought against theological heresies, such as modalism. In doing so, he upheld the integrity of Christian doctrines. Championing the Logos doctrine, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\\"Word\\"), further demonstrates his commitment to protecting and preserving the purity of Christian beliefs. 3. Ethical Conservatism and Rigorism: Hippolytus was an ethical conservative, upholding traditional Christian values, especially in matters of morality. However, his rigorism often led to him advocating excessively strict policies, which may have alienated some believers who sought forgiveness and reconciliation within the Church. 4. Schismatic Behavior and Rivalry: While Hippolytus showcased strong leadership qualities, his actions in allowing himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome and his persistent attacks on Popes Urban I and Pope Pontian indicate an inclination toward divisiveness rather than unity within the Christian Church. 5. Possible Reconciliation: It is believed that Hippolytus might have reconciled with the Church in Rome before his death. His burial in Rome and eventual recognition as a martyr and priest suggest that the schism might have been resolved and that Hippolytus may have been incorporated back into the Church community. In conclusion, whether Hippolytus was a good leader is a matter of interpretation. On the one hand, he displayed theological wisdom, eloquence, and the ability to provide compelling arguments against heresies. On the other hand, his rigorism and involvement in schismatic behaviors indicate a more divisive and unyielding approach to leadership. It is important to consider both the positive and negative aspects of his leadership style and the environment in which he lived to form a well-rounded opinion on his effectiveness as a leader."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I heard that Kai needed a bedtime story each night before going to sleep.  And I was wondering How would Kai feel as a result? Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, I will first assume that Kai enjoys bedtime stories. Now, let me analyze step-by-step the possible feelings Kai might experience as a result of listening to a bedtime story each night. Step 1: Setting the context The bedtime story routine creates a calming and soothing environment for Kai. Creating a specific time and place for a story can signal to their brain that it's time to wind down and get ready for sleep. Step 2: Emotional connection During the bedtime story, Kai might feel a stronger emotional connection with the person reading the story to them, such as a parent or guardian. This shared time can build trust and a sense of safety in the relationship. Step 3: Impact on imagination and creativity Bedtime stories can stimulate Kai's imagination and creativity, as they listen to various stories featuring different characters, settings, and scenarios. This can make them feel excited and intrigued by the endless possibilities within the stories. Step 4: Developing empathy and understanding As Kai listens to different stories with characters facing various challenges or displaying particular emotions, they might develop empathy and understanding for others' feelings and situations. This can make them feel more connected to the world and the people around them. Step 5: Sense of comfort and relaxation Finally, the act of listening to a bedtime story can provide a sense of comfort and relaxation, as they unwind from the day and let their mind be transported into the story they are hearing. This can result in a feeling of contentment and peace. Based on these steps, it is reasonable to conclude that Kai would feel comforted, connected, and relaxed as a result of listening to a bedtime story each night before going to sleep."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is accused of being a devil?, using the article: Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue., what would be the answer ?

Answer based on context: Coming off their hard-fought win over the Ravens, the Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for an AFC West duel with the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday Night Football. There was no scoring in the first quarter, which included cornerback David Bruton forcing a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. The Chiefs grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with Charles rushing for a 34-yard touchdown, then added to their lead, when cornerback Marcus Peters returned an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 55 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos responded with two touchdown passes by Manning &#8212; a 16-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders followed by a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by tight end Virgil Green just before halftime. The latter scoring play came after Chiefs' quarterback Alex Smith was intercepted by cornerback Aqib Talib deep in Chiefs' territory. That was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks. The two teams exchanged field goals in the third quarter &#8212; a 35-yarder by Chiefs' placekicker Cairo Santos and a 54-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus. Following an exchange of punts, the Chiefs were attempting to re-claim the lead midway through the fourth quarter, when Smith was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. at the Broncos' 10-yard line with 6:40 remaining. However, the Broncos went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. The Chiefs took a 24-17 lead six plays later, with running back Knile Davis rushing for an 8-yard touchdown with 2:27 left in the game. Manning then engineered a 10-play, 80-yard drive, culminating in a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanders with 36 seconds left. The game appeared to be headed to overtime, however, on the initial play of the Chiefs' ensuing possession, Broncos' linebacker Brandon Marshall forced a fumble off Charles deep in Chiefs' territory, and cornerback Bradley Roby returned the fumble 21 yards for a touchdown with 27 seconds in the game.

Answer the question...who was the 13th president of the united states and where was he born??","output":"The 13th President of the United States was Millard Fillmore. Born on January 7, 1800, Fillmore grew up in the Finger Lakes region of New York in a town called Summerhill. His parents, Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard, were farmers and Fillmore was the second of nine children in the family. He was raised in an environment with limited resources and very little formal education. Early in his life, Millard Fillmore worked various jobs to support his family and gained knowledge through reading, displaying traits of self-discipline, determination, and hard work. Eventually, he found his calling in law and became an apprentice in a law office. After several years of hard work and self-education, Fillmore was admitted to the New York bar in 1823. He built a successful legal practice and became active in local politics, eventually joining the anti-Masonic and anti-Jacksonian political movements that were prevalent at that time. His political career began with his election to the New York State Assembly in 1828, and later to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1832. Millard Fillmore served three successive terms from 1833 to 1839, and during his time in Congress, he focused on issues ranging from infrastructure to national fiscal policy. Fillmore became a member of the newly-formed Whig party and in 1848, he was nominated as the vice presidential candidate to run alongside the party's presidential candidate, General Zachary Taylor. In the election that year, the Whig party won the presidency, and Fillmore became the 12th Vice President of the United States. However, on July 9, 1850, only sixteen months into his term, President Zachary Taylor passed away, thrusting Fillmore into the role of the 13th President of the United States. One of the most significant events during Fillmore's tenure was the Compromise of 1850, a series of legislative measures aimed at resolving the issues of expanding slavery in the newly acquired territories as a result of the Mexican-American War. Fillmore supported the compromise, which temporarily eased the tensions between the North and South, but its provisions were seen as controversial, and its effects would later contribute to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Millard Fillmore's presidency concluded on March 4, 1853, after he failed to secure his party's nomination for a second term. He retired to his home in Buffalo, New York, where he continued to be involved in various local and national issues. He passed away on March 8, 1874, at the age of 74."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Fact 2: Basalts are volcanic, micro-crystalline rock.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in weathering?\\" with the following options:  - glass  - basalt  - calcite  - soils  - fire  - water  - air  - sand Answer:","output":"Basalt is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in the process of weathering.  To provide a comprehensive explanation, let's examine each option in the context of weathering. 1. Glass: While glass can be physically broken by external forces, it is typically a human-made material and not a natural product of geological processes. Thus, it is not relevant to the process of weathering. 2. Basalt: Basalt is a volcanic, micro-crystalline rock, formed from the rapid cooling of lava rich in minerals like plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine. Over time, basalt experiences weathering due to the exposure to elements like water, wind, and temperature fluctuations. This causes the rock to break down into smaller pieces, such as pebbles, gravel, or sand. Therefore, basalt is the correct answer. 3. Calcite: Calcite is a carbonate mineral found in many sedimentary rocks like limestone or in metamorphosed marble. While calcite indeed undergoes weathering through processes such as dissolution and carbonation, the given facts do not relate to calcite specifically as they referred to basalt and weathering in general. 4. Soils: Unlike rocks and minerals, soils are a product of the weathering process. Weathering breaks down rocks, transforming them into smaller particles that combine with organic matter to create soil. Therefore, soil is a result of weathering rather than something broken down in the process. 5. Fire: Fire is a product of combustion, a chemical reaction, and not a substance or material that undergoes weathering. It does not fit within the context of the question. 6. Water: Water is one of the primary agents of weathering that contributes to the breakdown of rocks through processes like freeze-thaw, hydration, and dissolution. While water plays a significant role in weathering, it does not break down into smaller pieces itself. 7. Air: Similar to water, air acts as an agent of weathering, primarily through wind erosion or as a facilitator of chemical reactions. However, air is not a material that is broken down during the weathering process. 8. Sand: Sand is a product of weathering and can be created through the breakdown of various rocks, including basalt. Weathering breaks down rocks into smaller particles, such as sand. Sand, therefore, results from weathering rather than undergoing the process itself. In conclusion, given the two facts provided and the available options, basalt is the correct answer to the question \\"What is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in weathering?\\" Basalt, a volcanic rock, undergoes weathering through exposure to natural elements, breaking down into smaller particles such as sand or gravel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact: For too long, many in the Christian church have stood on the wrong side of the gay/lesbian issue. Instead of standing with homosexuals, many in my tradition, and I was one of these once, have mistakenly thought we were upholding the Bible and protecting what we presumed was normal--being straight--from abnormal--being gay. But, more often, we were just hiding our anxiety, as well as our ignorance on the matter, by judging gays and lesbians and disassociating from them. But, no matter what our opinion may be, it was wrong then, and it is wrong today, to be misinformed, to judge or, worse, to disassociate from other people. Anyone with any sense of sanity grieves over the sad consequences of the recently reported bullying of gay teens that resulted in their suicides. I suppose these tragic reports have caused all of us to wake up a bit to the bullying that's been tolerated far too long on school playgrounds, in church sanctuaries and from Christian pulpits. This madness must end. What is clear to me today is this: when prejudice is in the heart, as it is in many toward the LGBT community, you can and will find the scripture to defend your position and to justify your intolerance. For centuries, Christians and churches engaged in this sort of insanity to defend slavery and oppress women. Surprisingly, there are still churches that subjugate women and vigorously defend this prejudice with scripture. They mistakenly think they are just being true to the teachings of Saint Paul regarding the roles of men and women in the world and in the church. But, using any portion of the Bible to justify prejudice of any kind is to demean the scriptures and to damage human beings in the process. It is past time for this abuse of scripture to end, as well as the fear and prejudice that motivates it. How can I claim to be following the compassionate Christ while fostering fear, bigotry, or disgust in my heart? For all I don't know, this much I do know: First, it is inconsistent, not to speak of downright dishonest, to condemn homosexuals on the grounds the Bible says it is \\"bad, wrong, or evil.\\" Rape, child abuse, promiscuity, and exploitation are a few acts described in the Bible as \\"bad, wrong, or evil.\\" And these are evils can, and are, committed by people, homosexual and heterosexual alike. What the church should be concerned about is the protection of all people from harm, including dangerous clergypersons, who rape, abuse, and exploit others. Second, gays don't \\"choose\\" to be gay any more than straight people \\"choose\\" to be straight. So, Christians should stop pretending this is a lifestyle choice. Third, sexual orientation is not a political or military issue as in this debacle that is the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" debate. It is instead a civil rights issue. How two-faced can we be to argue against human rights violations in other countries while depriving people of their civil rights in our own? One more thing. The legacy media need to stop reporting on this issue primarily from the perspective of \\"Christians\\" who are opposed to the LGBT community. Not all Christians feel that gay people are sinners for being gay. So, I'm asking the media to give an equal voice to the straight Christian community that stands in solidarity with the gay Christian community. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, \\"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter most.\\" This matters. And, if you're like me, you're ready to take your stand with all people. You're tired of the judging of others and the division it causes. You want, as I do, to practice living like Christ who said, \\"Judge not,\\" (Matt. 7:1) and \\"Do to others as you wish them to do to you,\\" (Matt. 7;12); like the Buddha who said, \\"Have compassion for all beings;\\" and, like Muhammad who said, \\"No man is a true believer unless he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.\\" Steve McSwain is the author of The Enoch Factor: The Sacred Art of Knowing God.

Dietary laws were also not applied to \\"gentile\\" Christians after the Acts 15 council. So, to describe Christians as inconsistent on this issue is to be the \\"cherry-picker\\" not the full counsel of scripture guy.

When you appeal any decrypt scripture you are out of luck. All progress is only possible when you do not appeal to scripture. Take slavery, civil rights, human rights were only possible when you made secular appeals. The innate fairness of most people will prevail. Those who do not have that will fall in place after a generation or two. Nothing tangible is achieved, without safeguarding the progress made with utmost vigil for a few generations. The secularists must launch a two pronged strategy. 1) We need to proselytize for the progressive agenda, using secular arguments only. If we have to throw a bone once in a while to the liberal religious crowd we should. But the emphasis is secular arguments of fairness. 2) We need to erode the credibility of scripture all the time, incessantly. The goal is to relegate religion to the dust heap of history. This has been done before several times and successfully too. Each and every time one religion has replaced the another. In the past it has been a religion replacing another and mostly by force. This time it has to be religion & superstition replaced by reason.

The Bible condemns sexual immorality. In fact it specifically references homosexuality and adultery (which is arguably more of a biological impulse than homosexuality).

It is equally true that they choose how they act upon their orientation. To say one is oriented toward a particular sexual behavior does not mean one should act upon it. How many would say one whose sexual orientation is toward six year olds should feel free to act upon that orientation? Unless you are willing to permit such behavior on the basis that one is oriented toward it, ask yourself how strongly you feel sexual orientation should sanction sexual behavior.

Matt 5:17-19 \\"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Pedophilia (real Greek word should be \\"pederastia,\\" sexual activity wit boys) is a mental disorder and is about control and not innate sexual orientation. The original Greek word \\"paraphilia\\" literally means NORMAL human fondness/love for boys.

Regardless of the race/creed/color/gender preference of the individual, the uniform and the duty is exactly the same. If the duties can be performed, which is in fact the case regardless of orientation, then why deprive any able-bodied volunteers the privilege of becoming cannon fodder for the American way. The arguments against gays serving openly in the military are exactly the same arguments that were made against blacks and women, yet women and blacks now serve openly and proudly in the ranks and have brought great honor to the institution.

Furthermore, when you read Paul's writings in 1 Corinthians 5:9-11: \\"9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral peopleâ 10 not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters.

So, lets stop using the word \\"marriage\\" in all laws and keep the word \\"marriage\\" exclusive to religious organizations who want to convey the blessing of their faith on a civil union. Under the law, there would only be civil unions, straight or gay couples. Our military is much more capable of behaving as adults than we seem to think they are. There have always been gays in the military, sleeping in the same barracks with straights, protecting their buddies backs in a fight, and killing the enemy. DADT is a way to perpetuate a lie - that gays are not in the military. DADT is dishonorable on its face - requiring a person to lie, or at least to deceive. How can we ask those who do us the honor of protecting us to behave dishonorably? Potaboc: I don't care and don't want to know about your sexual behavior - unless it involves a child or coercion of an adult. Why are you interested in the sexual behavior of consenting adults? There are many other Christians who agree with Dr. McSwain - Jesus loves us all. They also believe that the issue of tax breaks and other legal (civil, world of Caesar) benefits of marriage/civil union should be available to committed couples of any various combination of the sexes. The real difference we need to observe is that civil benefits of marriage exist in a civil world of freedom and equity under the law.

Article: The latest fashion in the kitchen is the food steamer.All the stores are selling them;everyone wants one.Steaming is one of the simplest and healthiest ways of cooking food.However,that cooking time is usually longer than with other methods.In case you're thinking of buying a steamer,I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best. Folding Steamer The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version. Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of  pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean. Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables. Steaming Pan This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled  steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living. Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store. Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the  pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot  see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice. For serious users of steamers,I recommend having one of each version.If you just want  to try it,get the folding stainless-steel type.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Barack Obama, Lady Gaga and Steve Jobs--what do they have in common? They are, of course, all Americans. And according to a survey by social networking site badoo. com, they all best illustrate  the word \\"cool\\". But just what does it mean to say someone is \\"cool\\"? Most would answer that it is something to do with being independent-minded and not following the crowd. Yale University art professor Robert Farris Thompson says that the term \\"cool\\" goes back to 15th century West African philosophy .  \\"Cool\\" relates to ideas of grace  under pressure. \\"In Africa, \\" he writes, \\"coolness is a positive quality which combines calmness, silence, and life. \\" The modern idea of \\"cool\\" developed largely in the US in the period after World War II.  \\"Post-war 'cool' was in part an expression of war-weariness   . . . it went against the strict social rules of the time, \\" write sociologists Dick Pountain and David Robins in Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude. But it was the American actor James Dean who became the symbol for \\"cool\\" in the hugely successful 1955 movie Rebel without a Cause. Dean plays a tough guy who disobeys his parents and the authorities . He always gets the girl, smokes cigarettes, wears a leather jacket and beats up bullies . In the movie, Dean showed what \\"cool\\" would mean to American young people for the next 60 years. Today the focus of \\"cool\\" has changed to athletics   stars. Often in movies about schools, students gain popularity on the athletics field more than in the classroom. This can be seen quite clearly in movies like Varsity Blues and John Tucker Must Die. But many teenagers also think being smart is cool. Chess and other thinking games have been becoming more popular in schools. \\"Call it the Harry Potterization of America --a time when being smart is the new cool, \\" writes journalist Joe Sunnen.

But a federal appeals court has now overturned that decision. The lawsuit was filed by a woman who claims she was drugged and raped by men who had contacted her through the website. The woman, referred to in court documents as Jane Doe, was an aspiring model who had created a profile on Model Mayhem. She claims she was contacted and invited to a casting session in 2011, but it was a sham and she was drugged and then raped on camera by two men. Two men were jailed for such a scam in 2012. The woman claims Internet Brands was aware that people were using the Model Mayhem site to target women in this way, but failed to warn its members, making it liable for negligence under California law. Internet Brands filed a motion to have the case dismissed on the grounds that it was barred by the US Communications Decency Act (CDA), which says websites cannot be held responsible for content posted by their users. \\"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,\\" the law states. At the time, online giants including eBay and Facebook told the court that the lawsuit would have a \\"chilling effect\\" on the internet. The district court dismissed the lawsuit in 2014. However, a federal appeals court in California has now revived the lawsuit because it does not concern what was posted on Model Mayhem. \\"Jane Doe does not claim to have been lured by any posting that Internet Brands failed to remove. Internet Brands is also not alleged to have learned of the predators' activity from any monitoring of postings on the website,\\" the court wrote. \\"Instead, Jane Doe attempts to hold Internet Brands liable for failing to warn her about information it obtained from an outside source about how third parties targeted and lured victims through Model Mayhem. \\"Internet Brands could have given a warning to Model Mayhem users, perhaps by posting a notice on the website or by informing users by email what it knew about the activities.\\" A trial court must now decide whether the \\"failure to warn\\" lawsuit can go ahead. \\"We express no opinion on the viability of the failure to warn allegations,\\" the federal court wrote. \\"We hold only that the CDA is not a valid basis to dismiss Jane Doe's complaint.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article talks about a court case involving a website called Model Mayhem.

Q:Mike was visiting the African Savannah. One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C.  In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B?  Hint: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided and the concept of the dilution effect, it is important to understand that animals living in larger groups tend to dilute their risk of attack, leading to increased safety for each individual. In the case of the African Buffalo, the dilution effect would play a significant role in defining the benefits to individuals depending on the size of the group. In case A, when buffaloes live in a large herd often exceeding hundreds, the dilution effect is more pronounced, providing increased safety from predators and other potential threats. This increased safety benefits each individual buffalo, as the risk of being attacked is spread across a larger number of individuals. This is similar to the examples provided in the hint, where larger groups of Camargue horses and water striders experienced decreased attack rates per individual. In case B, when buffaloes live in a small herd, the dilution effect is less pronounced, which means that the benefits from the group living are not as strong as in case A. Under these circumstances, each individual buffalo is relatively more exposed to potential threats as compared to case A, and the risk of attack is not as effectively spread across the smaller number of individuals. Considering the dilution effect and its benefits to individual animals within a group, the African Buffalo would experience greater benefits as a whole in case A when living in a large herd. In this scenario, the risk of attack is more effectively spread across the numerous individuals in the group, providing increased safety for each buffalo. On the contrary, case B, with smaller herds, would provide less benefit to the group as a whole due to a weaker dilution effect. Thus, the African Buffalo group in case A is better off in terms of safety and overall benefits as compared to case B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of hanging mugs from a pole, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials First, I would gather the necessary materials such as a sturdy pole, preferably made of metal or wood, strong hooks or mug holders, and the mugs to be hung. The pole should be long enough to accommodate the desired number of mugs and the hooks must be able to securely hold the weight of the mugs. Step 2: Determine the desired height and location Next, I would choose an appropriate location for the pole, considering factors such as accessibility and aesthetics. I would also decide on the height of the pole, ensuring it is installed at a level that is both practical and comfortable for users. Step 3: Install the pole Once the location and height are determined, I would securely install the pole. If mounting on a wall, I would find the studs in the wall, mark the screws' positions, and drill holes for the screws. Next, I would insert the screws through the pole's brackets into the drilled holes and tighten until secure. If using a freestanding pole, I would assemble the pole according to the manufacturer's instructions and ensure it is stable and level on the floor. Step 4: Attach hooks or mug holders Now that the pole is in place, I would attach the hooks or mug holders to the pole. I would space them evenly apart, taking into account the size and shape of the mugs being hung. Each hook should be sturdy enough to hold the weight of the mug without bending or breaking. Step 5: Hang the mugs With the hooks or mug holders in place, I would carefully hang each mug by its handle. I would arrange the mugs in a visually pleasing manner, considering factors such as size, color, and design. If the pole is accessible from all sides, I would hang the mugs to evenly distribute their weight all around the pole. Step 6: Inspect the setup Finally, I would inspect the entire setup to ensure its stability, security, and functionality. I would check that the pole is firmly in place, the hooks are holding the mugs securely, and the entire structure can withstand day-to-day use without any risk of falling or causing injury. Once these steps are completed, the goal of hanging mugs from a pole would be successfully accomplished."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - Warm water floats up from the ocean - A pocket of low pressure air is created near the surface of the ocean - Warm air from outside areas pushes into the low pressure area - The warm air keeps rising and forms clouds - The wind is getting fed moisture that evaporates from the ocean - This moisture causes the swirling air and clouds to grow bigger - As it gets bigger the wind rotates faster.  Question: suppose less warm water floats up from the ocean happens, how will it affect LESS POWERFUL hurricanes.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less If less warm water floats up from the ocean, the impact on hurricane formation will make them less powerful. Warm water is a critical component in the development of a hurricane as it provides energy to fuel the system. The process of hurricane formation involves a series of steps, starting with the warming of water near the ocean surface. When less warm water is available, the following consequences can be expected: 1. The formation of a pocket of low-pressure air near the ocean surface will be diminished, as the required energy from the warm water is not sufficient. Low-pressure systems are crucial in driving the circulation of a hurricane. 2. The warm air from neighboring areas will not be able to push into the low-pressure area as effectively. Warm air movement is important in supplying moisture and heat to the developing storm system, which in turn powers a hurricane's intensification. 3. The ensuing rise of warm air and the cloud formation process will not be as vigorous. This lack of intense development weakens the potential for the characteristic hurricane spiral and vertical cloud structure. Both are key factors in making a storm system powerful. 4. As there is less moisture being fed to the system from the reduced evaporation of warm ocean waters, the growth and expansion of the swirling air and clouds slow down. The wind rotation may not reach high speeds common in powerful hurricanes, effectively reducing overall storm strength. 5. Since the wind speed plays a major role in the classification of hurricane categories, a slower wind will result in a less powerful hurricane. Hurricanes with stronger winds are associated with greater potential for destruction. In conclusion, if less warm water floats up from the ocean, it will lead to less powerful hurricanes. This is due to a series of interconnected factors that play vital roles in a hurricane's formation and intensification, with the warm water acting as the powerhouse for these processes. Without an ample supply of warm water, a developing hurricane will lose much of its strength and potential to cause widespread damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously  warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter.

Since 2004, 'The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands' has fought for independence from which country?","output":"The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands, an unrecognized and symbolic micronation, declared its struggle for independence from Australia since 2004. The Coral Sea Islands are a group of uninhabited islets located east of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, and they encompass an extensive area within the Coral Sea. The establishment of this unique micronation was a direct response to the Australian government's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage as legal and legitimate. At the time, the Marriage Amendment Act 2004 had just been passed, subsequently defining marriage exclusively as the union of a man and a woman in Australia. In response, a group of LGBTQ+ activists sailed to the Coral Sea Islands, raised the flag of the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom on Cato Island, which would then serve as the capital of the new nation, and declared independence from Australia on June 14, 2004. Led by their emperor, Dale Anderson, the micronation adopted a national flag based on the pride flag commonly used by the LGBTQ+ community, the rainbow flag. The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom also chose the iconic gay anthem, \\"I Am What I Am,\\" by the late Gloria Gaynor, as their national anthem. Additionally, they adopted the slogan \\"The kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands is not a micronation for the gay and lesbian elite, but a nation for all who are gay or support gay rights.\\" While the micronation declared itself as a constitutional monarchy, it lacked any real authority, political structure, or physical territory beyond the uninhabited Coral Sea Islands. Its claim for independence from Australia has never been officially recognized by any government, and it remains largely a symbolic and political statement to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, particularly marriage equality. In December 2017, Australia finally legalized same-sex marriage through a postal survey that recorded nearly 62% of respondents voting in favor of marriage equality. As a result, the significance and symbolic resonance of the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands have shifted, and its relevance in the modern pursuit for LGBTQ+ rights continues to evolve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

The story of the mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses cunning to evade danger.The mouse goes for a walk in the forest and on his way encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intent on eating the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he is going to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal. The mouse describes the outlandish features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat them, each animal flees. The mouse gloats to himself; he knows the gruffalo is a fictional monster:Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know? there's no such thing as a gruffalo!After he has seen off the last animal, however, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real gruffalo, bearlike and hideous and with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing.

Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how everyone is afraid of him. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off, and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness.

Originally limited to researchers at a handful of universities and government departments, the Internet has quickly become a worldwide network providing users with information on a range of subjects and allowing them to purchase goods directly from companies via computer. By 1999, 84 millionU.S.citizens had access to the Internet at home or work. More and more Americans arc paying bills, shopping, ordering airline tickets, and purchasing stocks via computer over the Internet. Internet banking is also becoming increasingly popular. With lower overhead costs in terms of staffing and office space, Internet banks are able to offer higher interest rates on deposits and charge lower rates on loans than traditional banks.  \\"Brick and mortar\\" banks are increasingly offering online banking services via some special websites to enlarge their traditional services. At present, 14 percent of Internet households conduct their banking by means of the Internet, and the figure is expected to double during the next two or three years. Increasing commercial use of the Internet has heightened security and privacy concerns. With a credit card, an Internet user can order almost anything from an Internet site and have it delivered to their home or office. Companies doing business over the Internet need many security measures to protect credit card, bank account, and social security numbers from unauthorized access as they pass across the Internet. Any organization that connects its networks to the global Internet must carefully control the access point to ensure that out-siders cannot disturb the organization's internal networks or gain unauthorized access to the organization's computer systems and data.

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English:  chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity...

Possible answers: hug her mother, go to jail, maintain freedom","output":"Given the context, we need to consider a step-by-step approach to determine what Robin may want to do next. Step 1: Understand the situation Robin has killed their mother after suffering years of abuse. They were found not guilty, which means they are not going to jail for what has happened. Step 2: Analyze the potential options a) hug her mother - Since Robin's mother was abusive and has been killed, it is unlikely that Robin would want to hug her. b) go to jail - Robin was found not guilty, so they will not be required to go to jail. c) maintain freedom - With a not guilty verdict, Robin can continue living their life freely. Step 3: Consider emotional state It's reasonable to assume that Robin's emotional state after such events could be complicated, involving a mix of relief, sadness, and the need to move forward in life. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate option Taking into account the context and Robin's emotional state, it would make sense for Robin to want to maintain their freedom.

While it could be possible that they are watching an instructional video or something related to their activity on television, they could also be engaged in an entirely different activity, such as cooking, painting, playing a musical instrument, or any number of hands-on learning experiences.  In many learning scenarios involving an adult and a child, the exchange of knowledge takes place through different methodologies.

One person may admire the Clinton surrogates for their ability to seize the high ground in the context war, while another person may disapprove of their tactics or not be impressed by their success. In addition, the term \\"high ground\\" is open to interpretation. It could mean that the Clinton supporters were more successful in shaping the narrative or it could mean that they took a more morally or ethically superior stance in the debates and discussions.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years.

(Associated Press)      National Transportation Safety Board investigator Heidi Moats said Sunday that Sailor is \\"one remarkable young lady,\\" and she might be able to assist them in determining what brought the plane down. It is rare for someone to survive a small plane crash and Moats said they want to talk to Sailor about it.      \\"Having someone that is a witness (is) always helpful in the investigation, it gives us kind of a story line,\\" Moats said.      It's not clear when investigators might talk to Sailor, who despite being bloodied and suffering a broken wrist, pulled herself from the wreckage and walked to the nearest home.      She was dressed for Florida, where her family had been visiting, and was wearing shorts, a short-sleeve shirt and only one sock when she found a home about a mile from the crash site. Authorities said she walked through thick woods and briar patches in near-freezing temperatures.      \\"She absolutely went to the nearest house that she could have,\\" Kentucky State Police Lt. Brent White said. \\"But it was still a considerable feat for her to do that.\\"      The remains of the Piper PA-34 plane were moved Sunday so officials with the NTSB can inspect it. They haven't discussed any possibilities of what brought the plane down or how Sailor survived the crash.      The agency will issue a preliminary report in about 10 days, Moats said at a news conference in Eddyville.      Sailor was treated at a hospital and released to a relative Saturday.      After the Friday night crash, Sailor trekked to the home of 71-year-old Larry Wilkins, who answered her knock at the door and called police. Wilkins said the girl was crying and covered in blood.      \\"She told me that her mom and dad were dead, and she had been in a plane crash, and the plane was upside down,\\" Wilkins said.

The crash killed Sailor's parents, Marty Gutzler, 48; and his wife, Kimberly Gutzler, 46; Sailor's sister, Piper Gutzler, 9; and a cousin, Sierra Wilder, 14. All were from Nashville, Illinois.      White said the father's body was \\"the last one they pulled out because of how deep he was buried.\\"      Marty Gutzler was flying the plane, which reported engine trouble and lost contact with air traffic controllers around 5:55 p.m. CST, authorities said. Controllers tried to direct the pilot to an airport 5 to 7 miles from the crash scene.      About 40 minutes later, 911 dispatchers received the call from Wilkins.      The Gutzlers had been visiting family in Key West, Florida, and stopped in Tallahassee, Florida, on the way back to Mount Vernon, Illinois.      Gutzler was a licensed commercial pilot and flight instructor, according to the FAA website.

But abortion is still totally off the table in such a case, he said.","output":"Pope Francis vs. Donald Trump: A Clash of Ideologies In a world where political leaders and religious figures are constantly being scrutinized for their words, actions, and ideologies, a recent verbal exchange between Pope Francis and Donald Trump has caught the attention of the media. While both leaders have been known to make controversial statements, their latest disagreement shines a light on the wider social and political issues that underscore the global landscape today. Pope Francis, during an interview on his return from a six-day visit to Mexico, was asked about the American presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has been infamous for his views on immigration, specifically his idea of building a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States. The Pope responded, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” as reported by the New York Times. While Pope Francis did not explicitly instruct Americans on whether to vote for Trump or not, he said, “I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.” Trump was quick to respond to Pope Francis’ comments, calling the Pontiff’s questioning of his faith “disgraceful.” Trump went on to say, “I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.” The Republican presidential candidate also added that should the Vatican ever face an attack from terrorist group ISIS, the Pope would wish that Trump had been president, as he claims that under his leadership, ISIS would have been eradicated. He further accused Mexico of using the pope as a pawn in their ongoing struggle with the United States over trade and the border issues. As one can imagine, this heated exchange between two powerful figures has drawn widespread attention and speculation. While Pope Francis’ comment on building “bridges, not walls” advocates for unity and understanding amid diversity, Trump’s stand on immigration reform highlights a more conservative approach. This back-and-forth signifies a broader ideological clash at the heart of contemporary society, as globalization continues to redefine relationships between individuals, communities, and nations. It is essential to recognize the significance of engaging in meaningful dialogue and debate, even if it brings about disagreements. An exchange between two individuals with such unique platforms and capabilities to influence change, such as Pope Francis and Donald Trump, can stimulate further reflection and discussion on vital societal issues. As the world is grappling with identity, security, and faith, different viewpoints must be acknowledged, especially when they come from world leaders like Pope Francis and potential leaders like Trump. Their exchange highlights the necessity for empathy and understanding in a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected. In other news of significance, Pope Francis also addressed the ongoing global health concern of the Zika virus during his interview. While appearing to suggest that Catholic women may use contraception to avoid pregnancy in case of potential risk from the Zika virus, he clarified that abortion remains entirely off the table. This latest exchange, in the end, only underscores the importance of discussion and dialogue in today's connected world. As ideologies clash and the world continues to change, the contrasting viewpoints of leaders such as Pope Francis and Donald Trump serve as catalysts for reflection on our shared human condition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The rain is pouring outside, and the aroma of fresh coffee fills the air. Terry looks excitedly at Danielle, who appears slightly apprehensive.) Terry: Danielle, I just finished reading your epic fantasy short story, \\"The Enchanted Forest\\"! I absolutely loved it - your creativity, world-building, and character development blew me away! Danielle: (smiling nervously) Thank you so much, Terry! I'm glad you enjoyed it. I was nervous to share it with you, since I know how much you love the fantasy genre. Terry: Well, your nervousness was unwarranted. There were so many amazing aspects! I especially loved the magical creatures you created, like the Arcane Wolves and the Whispering Wisps - they were so unique and added so much depth to your story. Danielle: (blushing) Thanks! I've always been fascinated by magical creatures and wanted to come up with some that were different from the usual ones found in epic fantasy stories. It took some time to develop them, but I'm happy with the results. Terry: Your hard work definitely paid off! Another aspect I loved about your story was the intricacy of the plot. The quest to find the Enchanted Forest's hidden treasure, while also dealing with the protagonist's internal struggle, really made the narrative captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat. Danielle: I'm really glad you connected with the story and its characters. I wanted to give the protagonist a relatable and emotional journey, besides just a physical quest to find the treasure. Terry: You certainly achieved that! Speaking of the protagonist, I was thoroughly impressed by the complexity of Lira, the Elven thief. I've seldom encountered such a strong and independent female character in a fantasy story. She defied so many stereotypes and felt so real to me. Danielle: It was important for me to create a female character that could stand on her own. I purposefully stayed away from the \\"damsel in distress\\" trope and wanted to make Lira a role model for empowerment. Terry: And don't even get me started on the vivid descriptions of the Enchanted Forest itself! I truly felt like I was there, witnessing its ethereal beauty and mystical dangers firsthand. Can you tell me more about the inspiration behind the setting? Danielle: Of course! I've always been captivated by the idea of an enchanted forest - a place full of mystery, magic, and hidden dangers. I wanted this story to transport the reader to an entirely new world, one that they could explore and get lost in. So I drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including my own experiences in nature and my love of mythology and folklore. Terry: Well, you definitely succeeded in creating a captivating world. Honestly, Danielle, I could go on and on about your story - it's really that good! Are you planning to continue this storyline or create more stories set in this universe? I'd love to read more about Lira and the Enchanted Forest. Danielle: (smiling) I'm really touched by your enthusiasm, Terry. I'm definitely considering expanding on this storyline and delving deeper into the characters and world that I've created. Your feedback truly means a lot to me and only encourages me to keep writing. Terry: I'm so happy to hear that, Danielle! You have such a talent for writing, and I look forward to seeing more of your work. The world of \\"The Enchanted Forest\\" is one I would love to return to, and I'm sure others would feel the same way. Danielle: Thank you so much, Terry. You've made my day by sharing your thoughts on my story. I'm excited for what lies ahead, and I can't wait to share more of my writing with you.

Plot title: Havoc Movie plot: The film begins in a parking lot in which a teenage filmmaker named Eric is attempting to document the faux-gangsta lifestyle enjoyed by Allison Lang and her boyfriend Toby's gang of white upper-class teenagers living in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs oral sex on her boyfriend. The next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone. The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game. That evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle. His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person Black Francis told he was keen to record again?  While the Pixies' 1991 album Trompe le Monde was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, Gil Norton, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a cover album. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had \\"plenty of tunes and musical scraps.\\"He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, The Beach Boys' \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\". Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name \\"Frank Black\\" (inverting his old persona \\"Black Francis\\") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in \\"I Heard Ramona Sing\\", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, \\"but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did.\\"The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled Teenager of the Year. Teenager included the song \\"Headache\\" (sample ), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as \\"irresistible pop\\". The production of Teenager of the Year was markedly different from Frank Black; in the previous album, MIDI templates were used when writing songs, but in Teenager, Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and Lyle Workman on lead guitar.

Gissendaner will make a last-ditch effort on Tuesday to commute her death sentence in what seems to be a dire situation. In preparation for her final moments, Gissendaner has requested a massive last meal that consists of two Burger King Whoppers with cheese, cornbread, fries, and cherry vanilla ice cream. This request marks a significant moment in Gissendaner's life, as her time is seemingly coming to an end. The crime which concluded with Gissendaner's death sentence involved persuading her then-lover, Gregory Owen, to kidnap and stab her husband to death. After the murder had been carried out, Gissendaner helped Owen in burning her husband's car to destroy any evidence that could be traced back to them. However, their efforts proved futile, as they were both apprehended and convicted for their involvement in the crime. While Gissendaner faces the death penalty for her actions, her accomplice, Gregory Owen, has been serving a life sentence behind bars. The contrast in their punishment raises questions about the fairness and application of justice in the case. Kelly Gissendaner's impending execution and her final meal request serve as an ominous reminder of the consequences of crime and the ongoing debate surrounding the use of the death penalty in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I can watch B,B&C and feel all the emotions I felt when I first saw it at aged 18 well,maybe all but one.Certainly Miss K.Novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century.She was a thinking youth's Diana Dors.All those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart - clutching,collar - tightening,blood - pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good. Now,huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a Hoodie,they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the Video Shop,relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal. This movie is Miss Novak's Golden Moment.She seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and,despite all this,she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence. She completely dominates the amiable Mr J.Stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie.Misses E.Lanchester and H.Gingold offer comic relief along with Mr E. Kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed.Mr J.Lemmon plays Miss Novak's brother.He is a beatnik,a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream.Some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later.Certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and Mr Lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one. But all else is mere frippery,Miss Novak - bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of Technicolor - is the sole raison - d'etre for \\"Bell,Book and Candle\\".It survives,its reputation enhanced,as the ultimate showcase for one of Hollywood's most beautiful women. Loved by moviegoers,ignored by critics,Miss Novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the \\"Play\\" buttons on their DVDs.One day,probably after we are all gone,she will be discovered by a new generation who will - belatedly - realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully - dressed and sexually attractive at the same time.","output":"The sentiment of the review can be described as positive with a nostalgic tone.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hello little one! No, the answers to these two questions will be different because they are about two completely different topics. Let me help you understand each of them. Question 1: To report a violation in a multinational pharmaceutical company after the internal report was neglected, you can follow these steps: 1. Find out if the company has a hotline or an external reporting service you can contact. Many companies have this to report any issues, problems, or concerns. 2. If you can't find that, you can talk to a grown-up you trust - maybe your parents or a teacher. They can help you reach out to the local authorities or other regulatory bodies that oversee the company. 3. Alternatively, you can also ask your trusted grown-up to help you contact a lawyer or an investigative journalist to look into the issue you are concerned about. Now, let's talk about Question 2, which is about a special computer program called Crystal Report. In Crystal Report, there is a feature called 'Select Expert' that can help you find just the information you want to see. When you want to see only the records related to a specific name, follow these steps: 1.

In the next box, you or the person using the report will enter the name they want to see.  5. Click on 'OK,' and Crystal Report will show you only the records with that name.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.  and the situation: Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system.  Answer the following question: Wich comet would not be visible to naked eyes on February 19, 2022, Comet A or Comet B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Comet A would not be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022.  This is because Comet A is described as being very faint, which typically means it would be difficult or impossible to see without the aid of a telescope. Furthermore, on February 19, 2022, Comet A would still be within the inner solar system but would be about to leave on February 20, 2022. Despite its location within the inner solar system, its faintness would prevent it from being visible to the naked eye.  On the contrary, Comet B, which is described as being very bright, would be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022, especially given that this date falls within its time in the inner solar system, as it enters on February 18, 2022, and leaves on February 26, 2022."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Train A's distance: (30 mph) * (t + 2) hours Train B's distance: (36 mph) * t hours Since Train B catches up to Train A, their distances will be equal: (30 mph) * (t + 2) = (36 mph) * t To solve this equation, follow these steps: 1. Distribute the 30 mph on the left side of the equation: 30t + 60 = 36t 2. Rearrange the equation to have all terms with \\"t\\" on one side and constants on the other: 30t - 36t = -60 3.

Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation.

And I knew how to 'Walk the Dog.' \\" \\"Wow, really?\\" said our waiter, Jumario Simmons, flashing a big smile at us. \\"Don't encourage her,\\" I said. \\"What else could you do?\\" he asked. \\"I did 'Round the World,'\\" Jackie said, now ignoring me completely. \\"That cradle  thing, too.\\" I'd asked Jumario what he did when he wasn't waiting on tables. The 24-year-old waiter was so smart that I knew there had to be more to his story. It turns out that he won a regional yo-yo competition last year. He also gives free lessons to kids. \\"It gives them something to do,\\" Jumario said. \\"Keeps them off the streets.\\" One of the great things about eating out is the table talk with strangers, which reminds us that everyone has a life and a name. But the other day I heard that some restaurants are ending this talk between diners and servers. I listened to the reporter describe how their improvements are allowing customers to text orders from their tables to speed up service. The reporter got my attention with this sentence: \\"Five minutes after typing 'I'm at table 3', a meal arrives at the table.\\" But there wasn't a \\"please\\" with this order, which should have been a request, by the way. If you've ever waited on tables, you know that the last thing you need is yet another way for a customer to be unpleasant. Most servers are constantly mediating  between customers' requests for substitutions and overworked cooks' accusations of treason. Except at high-end restaurants, servers also have to hover like mothers of preschoolers so that we might consider them worthy of a large enough tip to lift their pay to minimum wage. Texting a server from a table a few feet away is equal to moving our fingers and shouting, \\"Hey, you!\\" It was rude in 1957, and it's rude now. You won't ever find me texting a waiter or waitress.

McMahon and Johnny Carson began their long association in their first TV series, the ABC game show Who Do You Trust?, running from 1957 to 1962. Then afterwards, McMahon would make his famous thirty-year mark as Carson's sidekick, announcer and second banana on NBC's highly successfully The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson from 1962 to 1992. His long association with brewer Anheuser-Busch earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Budweiser\\" and he used that relationship to bring them aboard as one of the largest corporate donors to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Since 1973, McMahon served as co-host of the long-running live annual Labor Day weekend event of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. His 41st and final appearance on that show was in 2008, making him second only to Jerry Lewis himself in number of appearances. McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes on NBC from 1982 to 1998, when Clark decided to move production of the series to ABC.  In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film The Incident and appeared as Santa Clause on The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as \\"communicator\\" (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of Monitor, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the NBC Radio Network. The 1955 movie Dementia, which has music without dialogue, was released as Daughter of Horror in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original Fun with Dick and Jane in 1977.  He then played himself in \\"Remote Control Man\\", a season one episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories. In 2004, McMahon became the announcer and co-host of Alf's Hit Talk Show on TV Land. He has authored two memoirs, Here's Johnny!: My Memories of Johnny Carson, The Tonight Show, and 46 Years of Friendship as well as For Laughing Out Loud. Over the years, he emceed the game shows Missing Links, Snap Judgment, Concentration, and Whodunnit!.  McMahon also hosted Lifestyles Live, a weekend talk program aired on the USA Radio Network. Additionally, he also appeared in the feature documentary film, Pitch People, the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of Neighborhood Watch public service announcements parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted \\"prize patrol\\".)  Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a FreeCreditReport.com commercial and in a Cash4Gold commercial alongside MC Hammer. McMahon was also the spokesman for Pride Mobility, a leading power wheelchair and scooter manufacturer. His final film appearance was in the independent John Hughes themed rom-com Jelly as Mr. Closure alongside actress Natasha Lyonne. Mostly in the 1980s through the 1990s, McMahon was the spokesperson for Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what were some of his other roles?","output":"Edward McMahon had various roles throughout his career.

Summarize this article: If you want to record your gameplay on PC, you'll need to use a screen capture program. One of the most popular free options is Open Broadcast Software (OBS). This program is completely free and open source, and can record as well as most commercial programs. You can download OBS Multiplatform for Windows, Mac, and Linux at obsproject.com. The installer is very basic, and you can leave all of the settings at their defaults. As long as you downloaded the program from obsproject.com, you shouldn't have to worry about adware. You can find this by clicking the \\"File\\" menu and selecting \\"Settings,\\" or by clicking the \\"Settings\\" button in the main window. This will allow you to adjust your basic video settings for your recordings. There are a few options that you'll want to take a look at:  Video Bitrate - This is the quality of the video. A higher bitrate will lead to a higher-quality image but lead to a larger file. Recording Path - This is the location that recorded videos will be saved on your computer. Recording Format - By default, this will be set to \\"flv.\\" You may want to select \\"mp4\\" for maximum compatibility. This will allow you to assign specific keys to starting and stopping your recording. This will allow you to start recording while in the middle of a game. You can use single keys or combinations. Try to use a key that you won't be using in the game, such as one of the Function keys or a combination of Ctrl and another key. There are several things you might want to change before starting to record:  Output (Scaled) Resolution - This is the resolution that your recorded video will be displayed in. A lower resolution will lead to a smaller file, but the quality will suffer. If you want the output to be the same as you see, set it to the same value as the Base (Canvas) Resolution. Common FPS Values - This will lock the framerate of the video to the number you set (as long as your game can perform at that framerate). YouTube now supports 60 FPS video, so you may want to change this setting. If you want to record your voice along with the gameplay, you can check and enable your microphone on this tab. You can also enable push-to-talk for your microphone so that you can record your voice when the key is held. Close the Settings menu after checking your audio settings. This will create a new Game Capture entry in the Sources list. Once you've got OBS configured, you can start playing your game. You can play any game on your computer from any source, including Steam, Origin, or games installed on their own. You won't receive any indication that recording has begun, but OBS will be recording in the background. Again, you won't receive a notification that recording has stopped. The video file will be created, and you'll be able to find it at the location you set earlier.","output":"This article is about how to record your gameplay on a computer using a free program called Open Broadcast Software (OBS).

You can adjust the video quality, where the videos are saved, and whether you want to record your voice too. Once you have OBS set up, you can play your game and it will record in the background without interrupting you. When you're done, the video file will be saved in the location you chose earlier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Linda Maria Ronstadt was born in 1946 in Tucson, Arizona, daughter to Gilbert Ronstadt (1911-1995), a prosperous machinery merchant who ran the F. Ronstadt Co., and Ruth Mary (Copeman) Ronstadt (1914-1982), a homemaker. Ronstadt was raised on the family's 10-acre (4 ha) ranch with her siblings Peter (who served as Tucson's Chief of Police for 10 years, 1981-1991), Michael J., and Gretchen (Suzy). The family was featured in Family Circle magazine in 1953. Linda's father came from a pioneering Arizona ranching family and was of German, English, and Mexican ancestry. Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including Mexican music, which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood.  Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records - rock 'n' roll, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi - is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of Gilbert and Sullivan and her father for introducing her to the traditional pop and Great American Songbook repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation.  Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as Lola Beltran and Edith Piaf; she has called their singing and rhythms \\"more like Greek music ... It's sort of like 6/8 time signature ... very hard driving and very intense.\\" She also drew influence from country singer Hank Williams.  She has said that \\"all girl singers\\" eventually \\"have to curtsy to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday\\". Of Maria Callas, Ronstadt says, \\"There's no one in her league. That's it. Period. I learn more ... about singing rock n roll from listening to Maria Callas records than I ever would from listening to pop music for a month of Sundays. ... She's the greatest chick singer ever.\\" She admires Callas for her musicianship and her attempts to push 20th-century singing, particularly opera, back into the bel canto \\"natural style of singing\\".  A self-described product of American radio of the 1950s and 1960s, Ronstadt is a fan of its eclectic and diverse music programming.

Trivia question: There have been three different years in which England has had three kings, 1066 and 1936 are two of them, what is the third? And the answer is?","output":"The third year in which England had three kings is 1483. This year witnessed a succession of monarchs in a short span of time, similar to the years 1066 and 1936. The three kings who reigned in 1483 were Edward IV, Edward V, and Richard III. 1. Edward IV: Edward IV was the first king of the year 1483. He was born in 1442 and came to power as the King of England on March 4, 1461, after deposing King Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses. Edward's reign was marked by the restoration of law and order, as well as significant advancements in trade and commerce. His second reign began on April 11, 1471, after reclaiming the throne from Henry VI. He continued to rule until his sudden death on April 9, 1483. He was succeeded by his 12-year-old son Edward V. 2. Edward V: Edward V's reign was extremely brief, lasting from April 9 to June 25, 1483. He was never actually crowned king because his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, declared Edward and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, as illegitimate based on the assertion that their father, Edward IV, had entered a pre-contract of marriage with another woman before marrying their mother, Elizabeth Woodville. As a result, Edward V's coronation was postponed, and he and his brother were placed in the Tower of London, where they were eventually declared illegitimate by Parliament through an act called \\"Titulus Regius.\\" The two boys, known in history as the \\"Princes in the Tower,\\" disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and their fate remains a subject of speculation and debate among historians. 3. Richard III: Richard III, the Duke of Gloucester, and brother of Edward IV, became the King of England on June 26, 1483, after deposing his nephew Edward V. He ruled until his death on August 22, 1485, at the Battle of Bosworth Field against Henry Tudor (who later became King Henry VII). This battle marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. In conclusion, the third year in which England had three kings is 1483, with the successive reigns of Edward IV, Edward V, and Richard III. This year was marked by political intrigue, power struggles, and family drama that ultimately led to the establishment of the Tudor dynasty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The body of the 65-year-old Brandt was found in his Miami mansion Sunday by a house guest. Miami police confirmed that Brandt hanged himself in the garage. He was found by his house guest around 9:30 a.m., hanging from a yellow cord with a white towel around his neck, according to Miami Police. The guest said he'd been staying with Brandt for the past few days because the doctor had become depressed, the police report said. Cops called Brandt's psychiatrist to the scene. She told police she'd been treating him for the past 10 days for severe depression. Dr. Brandt’s publicist, Jacquie Tractenberg, said Sunday that his death came after an illness. But Miami Herald columnist Lesley Abravanel said sources told her Brandt was “devastated” over comparisons to a character played by Martin Short in the Tina Fey-produced Netflix sitcom “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” which debuted March 6. The Newark, N.J.-raised Brandt had offices in Miami and Manhattan. Known as a wizard with a syringe, Brandt was famous for his “signature Y lifts” in which fillers are injected below the cheekbone. “If I have nice skin, I owe a lot to him,” Madonna once said.

The primary focus is on the competition and the act of outpacing each other. In this instance, \\"race\\" refers specifically to the competition and the challenge proposed by the speaker. In Sentence 2, \\"I raced him to the car, but he was there first, so he got to ride shotgun,\\" the word \\"race\\" describes the actual action of the speaker trying to outpace or outrun their opponent to reach a specific location, in this case, the car. This sentence is recounting the experience of competing against someone, in which the speaker loses, and consequently, the opponent is granted the privilege of riding in the front passenger seat (shotgun). In this context, \\"race\\" is not only about the competition but also about the experience and outcome. The speaker's use of \\"race\\" in this sentence expresses the act of running or moving quickly in comparison to the other person while highlighting the competitive nature of the action as well. In summary, while \\"race\\" conveys the idea of competition based on speed or rapidly reaching a destination in both sentences, the term is used slightly differently in each instance. In Sentence 1, \\"race\\" primarily refers to the challenge or invitation to compete, while in Sentence 2, it highlights the speaker's competitive actions, experience, and outcome in the contest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – On Sunday, the WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted out a series of odd messages: \\"pre-commitment 1: John Kerry,\\" read the first, followed by a 64-character series of numbers and letters; the next two referred to \\"pre-commitment 2: Ecuador\\" and \\"pre-commitment 3: UK FCO\\" (the United Kingdom's Foreign Commonwealth Office, as Fox News reports), also both followed by 64-character codes. Rumors started swirling that Julian Assange had died, a \\"dead man's switch\\" had been triggered, and all remaining WikiLeaks documents would be released as a result, Gizmodo reports. But a WikiLeaks volunteer has since assured the world Assange is still alive (he also tweeted pictures of them together on Monday.) WikiLeaks explained on Twitter Sunday night, \\"Julian Assange's internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party. We have activated the appropriate contingency plans.\\" As CNET reports, Assange's name and the hashtag #FreeJulian have been trending on Twitter, with some speculating that the US is responsible for severing Assange's internet connection. Time rounds up the rumors flying around the weird tweets, including one that involves Pamela Anderson. As the AP reports, Anderson visited Assange over the weekend at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he's holed up; she brought him a vegan meal, and some are theorizing (presumably jokingly) that perhaps the meal killed him. In regard to those 64-character codes, Gizmodo explains what a \\"pre-commitment\\" actually is: \\"a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with,\\" writes Bryan Menegus. \\"Essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes.\\"","output":"Title: The Mystery Behind WikiLeaks' Odd Twitter Messages and Julian Assange's Status On Sunday, the WikiLeaks Twitter account posted a series of cryptic messages which included the phrases \\"pre-commitment 1: John Kerry,\\" \\"pre-commitment 2: Ecuador,\\" and \\"pre-commitment 3: UK FCO\\" (United Kingdom's Foreign Commonwealth Office). Each phrase was followed by a 64-character string of letters and numbers. These peculiar messages sparked rumors that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, had died and triggered a \\"dead man's switch,\\" which would release all remaining unpublished documents as a consequence. However, a WikiLeaks volunteer soon tweeted photos proving Assange was still alive, and WikiLeaks clarified via Twitter that Assange's internet link had been intentionally cut by an unidentified state actor. They also stated they had activated appropriate contingency plans. As a result, Assange's name and the hashtag #FreeJulian started trending on Twitter, with many users speculating that the United States might be responsible for severing Assange's internet connection. The recent rumors included Pamela Anderson's involvement. The actress visited Assange over the weekend at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he remains in refuge. She brought him a vegan meal, which led some to jokingly theorize that perhaps the meal was the cause of the alleged death. Gizmodo provided an explanation for the mysterious 64-character codes in the tweets, identifying them as \\"pre-commitments,\\" which are part of a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. This means that these unique codes serve as proof that the content of the documents remains unaltered – changing the leaks would also change those 64-character codes. With Assange's well-being verified and the purpose of the pre-commitment codes explained, it appears that the rumors and conspiracy theories have been debunked. However, questions remain regarding who severed Assange's internet connection and why, as well as what WikiLeaks' contingency plans entail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New Year's Eve attacks on women in Cologne, blamed on migrants, have put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel. Most of those sent back to Austria are not Syrians, who usually get asylum. Instead, they are migrants mostly from Afghanistan as well as Morocco and Algeria, Austrian police said. \\"The daily number of migrants being turned back has risen from 60 in December to 200 since the start of the year,\\" David Furtner, police spokesman  in Upper Austria state, told AFP news agency.

Nineteen individuals are currently under investigation by the state police in connection with the attacks, NRW's interior ministry says in a report (in German), none of them German nationals. Those 19 suspects include 14 men from Morocco and Algeria. Ten of the suspects are asylum seekers, nine of whom arrived in Germany after September 2015.

But, as we have said, some of the settlers who had been ruined by the failure of the fisheries and the depredations of the mice, and who did not share much in the profits of the autumn hunt, were obliged once again to seek their old port of refuge at Pembina.  Among these was the Swiss family Morel. Andre went, because he did not wish to remain comparatively idle in the colony during the long months of winter. Elise went for the purpose of keeping house--perhaps we should say keeping hut--for Andre. Fred Jenkins went because he wanted to learn more about Indian ways and customs, as well as to perfect himself in the art of hunting the buffalo--that was all!  There were some who did not believe what the bold seaman said. Elise Morel was one of these--perhaps the most unbelieving amongst them.  Indeed, she laughed quite hilariously when his motive was reported to her by Billie Sinclair the day before they started.  \\"Why do you laugh so?\\" inquired Little Bill, who was always more or less in a state of surprise when he got upon this subject with Elise.  \\"It is not easy to say, Billie,\\" answered the girl, with another pleasant little laugh, \\"but it is so funny that a sailor should take such a fancy to come out here, so far away from his native element, and find so much interest in snow-shoe walking and Indian customs.\\"  Based on the article and the following list of answers, write a list of questions. 1.

Question: -  The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process might be for the bird to secure and reinforce the nest structure and create a comfortable environment for its eggs and eventual hatchlings.  Upon completing the construction of the nest, the bird may inspect the nest for any gaps or weak spots, making necessary adjustments to ensure the stability and durability of the nest. It may add more twigs, leaves, or other materials to reinforce weaker areas and provide additional support to the overall nest structure. In doing so, the bird ensures that the nest can withstand any harsh environmental conditions and external threats. Parallelly, the bird may also focus on ensuring the interior of the nest is warm and cozy. A bird may gather and layer insulating materials such as feathers, moss, soft grass, or animal fur to create a comfortable and well-insulated lining that helps regulate the temperature within the nest. This lining not only keeps the eggs cozy and safe from harm but also creates a conducive environment for the chicks to grow once they hatch. Lastly, the bird might camouflage the nest to make it less conspicuous to potential predators, using materials such as bark, lichen, or leaves that mimic the surrounding environment. This helps to reduce the risk of predation and protect the eggs and hatchlings from harm. In summary, the last step of the process would involve the bird making final adjustments to secure and reinforce the nest's structure, optimize its interior environment for eggs and hatchlings, and camouflage it to reduce its visibility to various threats, thus ensuring a safe and nurturing space for the bird to raise its offspring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland, and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them. a good answer to this question?","output":"The answer provided is accurate but not detailed or long enough. Here is a more comprehensive response to the question: The Prussians managed to slow the advance of the Russians by employing a combination of strategies which involved not only raiding the Russian supply lines but also through efficient military organization, strong leadership, and tactical maneuvers. The following are some key aspects of their efforts to slow down the Russians: 1. Raids on Russian supply lines: As suggested in the initial response, the Russian army was indeed heavily dependent on its main magazines in Poland. The Prussian army, under the leadership of King Frederick the Great, recognized this vulnerability and launched several successful raids against these supply lines. By targeting their opponent's logistical infrastructure, the Prussians were able to disrupt Russian supply chains, slow down their advance, and force the Russians to be more cautious with their movements. 2. Efficient military organization: The Prussian army was well-organized and disciplined, which was a key factor in its ability to counter the Russian threat. The Prussians had developed a system of conscription and training that produced well-trained and highly disciplined soldiers. Additionally, they had a streamlined chain of command that allowed for quick decision-making and the execution of complex strategies. 3. Leadership of Frederick the Great: One of the main reasons for the Prussian success in slowing down the Russian advance was the leadership of King Frederick II, also known as Frederick the Great. Frederick was a brilliant military strategist and a strong leader, qualities that were instrumental in helping the Prussian army adapt to the challenges presented by the Russians. His ability to inspire his troops and make decisions quickly aided the Prussians in effectively executing their military plans. 4. Tactical maneuvers: The Prussians made use of their superior mobility and local knowledge of the terrain to outmaneuver the Russians in several engagements. One notable battle that exemplified this tactic was the Battle of Zorndorf. Frederick the Great chose the battleground and took advantage of the terrain, positioning his forces in such a way that the Russians found it difficult to launch a successful attack against them. The Prussians' nimble tactics and constant harassment of Russian forces slowed down the Russian advance, forcing them to fight defensively. 5. Diplomacy: In addition to military tactics, the Prussians also employed diplomatic measures to weaken the resolve of the Russian forces. The Prussians were able to cultivate alliances with other European powers, such as Great Britain and Hanover. These alliances provided the Prussians with additional military and financial support, thus strengthening their efforts to resist the Russian advance. In conclusion, the Prussians managed to slow the advance of the Russians through a combination of strategies that included raiding Russian supply lines, superior military organization, strong leadership, tactical maneuvers, and diplomatic efforts. These strategies, executed effectively, were crucial in helping the Prussian army counter the threat posed by the advancing Russian forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before undergoing treatment for dependent personality disorder (dpd), it may be necessary for the patient to speak with a doctor. A general physician can perform an examination and run tests to see if there are any underlying causes for the patient's symptoms.","output":"Should there be any underlying medical or physical issues contributing to the development of dependent personality disorder, the doctor may recommend appropriate treatments or refer the patient to a specialist for further evaluation. Seek therapy from a licensed mental health professional. Once any necessary medical evaluations have been completed, seeking guidance from a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, is the next important step. These professionals are trained to diagnose and treat various mental health disorders, including dependent personality disorder. A mental health professional will work closely with the patient to determine the best course of treatment, such as individual therapy, group therapy, or a combination of both. Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). One of the most commonly recommended treatments for dependent personality disorder is cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy focuses on helping the patient develop healthy thought patterns and positive coping mechanisms to deal with difficult situations and emotions. CBT can help individuals with dependent personality disorder to identify and change negative thoughts, build self-esteem, and develop a stronger sense of autonomy and independence. Explore psychodynamic therapy. Another treatment option for dependent personality disorder is psychodynamic therapy. Through this therapeutic approach, the patient will work with the therapist to explore and understand the unconscious thought processes, underlying emotions, and past experiences that may be contributing to their disorder. By gaining insight into the causes of their dependency, the patient can begin to address these issues and develop healthier ways of relating to others and forming relationships. Attend group therapy. Group therapy can be a valuable tool for those with dependent personality disorder. In a structured group setting, individuals can learn from others who may be experiencing similar challenges, develop new coping strategies, and practice essential communication and social skills. Additionally, group therapy can provide a supportive environment in which individuals can work on building self-confidence and independence. Consider medication. Although there are no specific medications designed for the treatment of dependent personality disorder, some individuals may benefit from taking medications such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs. These medications can help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with DPD, such as overwhelming anxiety or depression. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication, as they will be able to prescribe the appropriate dosage and monitor any potential side effects. Engage in self-help activities. Besides professional treatment, individuals with dependent personality disorder can benefit from engaging in self-help activities. These can include reading self-help books, attending support groups, or engaging in mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Such activities can aid in building self-awareness and self-confidence and help foster a greater sense of independence and autonomy. Stay dedicated to recovery. Treating dependent personality disorder can be a long and challenging process. It is essential for the patient to remain committed to their treatment plan and maintain an open and honest relationship with their mental healthcare team. By actively participating in the recovery process and seeking support from loved ones, the patient can take the necessary steps to overcome the challenges associated with DPD and start living a healthier, more independent life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A: Choices:  a). lungs.  b). liver.  c). spleen.  d). kidneys. Answer:","output":"Answer: d). kidneys. Dialysis is a medical treatment that essentially serves as an artificial alternative to the kidneys when they are no longer able to effectively filter waste, excess fluid, and impurities from the blood. Kidney failure, also known as renal failure, is a condition where the kidneys are no longer capable of carrying out their crucial functions due to factors such as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, or other medical conditions that may impair the kidneys' ability to function. The primary role of the kidneys in the human body is to maintain proper balance and homeostasis of diverse essential elements such as water, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. Additionally, the kidneys are responsible for the elimination of metabolites and toxins from the bloodstream and the regulation of blood pressure and the production of red blood cells by secreting hormones like erythropoietin. When a patient suffers from kidney failure, it means their kidneys are no longer capable of sufficiently performing these critical tasks, which can result in the buildup of harmful wastes and excess fluid in their body. Consequently, a patient might experience symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, difficulty breathing, swelling, abnormal heart rhythms, or even sudden death due to uremia (a toxic state caused by excessive levels of waste in the blood). Dialysis is employed as a therapeutic treatment in cases of severe kidney impairment or complete failure. There are two primary types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis is more commonly utilized and involves the patient's blood passing through a specialized filter called a dialyzer or an artificial kidney. The dialyzer removes waste products, excess fluids, and electrolytes from the blood, which is then returned to the patient's body. Hemodialysis typically requires three sessions per week, each lasting about four hours. Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, uses the patient's abdominal lining, or peritoneum, as a natural filter. A cleansing solution called dialysate is introduced into the abdominal cavity, which absorbs waste products and excess fluids through the blood vessels of the peritoneum. The dialysate is then drained after a few hours and replaced with fresh dialysate, effectively cleansing the blood. Peritoneal dialysis allows for more flexibility and can often be performed at home, with variations like continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). While dialysis is a critical and life-sustaining treatment for many patients with kidney failure, it is essential to note that it is not a cure for the condition. In some cases, kidney function may improve and dialysis may no longer be necessary, while in others, a kidney transplant might be the most effective long-term treatment option. However, dialysis remains a critical tool in managing end-stage renal disease, prolonging the lives of countless individuals and improving their overall quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The NUT's annual conference in Brighton will hear warnings that counter-radicalisation policies are having the unintended consequence of stopping teachers talking about \\"challenging ideas\\" with their pupils. Fears over anti-extremism measures are threatening to \\"close down space for open discussion in a safe and secure environment\\", the conference will hear. There will also be claims that Muslim pupils can be unfairly targeted. The conference will debate proposals to call on the government to withdraw the Prevent strategy for schools and to develop an alternative approach to safeguarding. Delegates will hear warnings that schools are being discouraged from allowing pupils to debate controversial ideas and to develop their own \\"critical thinking skills\\". Teachers will say they have lost confidence in being able to talk about topical issues and that this could \\"smother\\" the discussion of legitimate political opinions. And they say that pupils should not be afraid that they could be reported for giving their viewpoints in a school debate.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"Inside a sunny room, an older woman in a blue shirt is handing a loaf of bread over a pile of bagged bread to a smiling woman with eyes closed, in flower shirt and duster sweater, as a man in a red shirt and glasses stands between them and watches.\\" if \\"A man watches his wife get bread from an older woman.\\"?","output":"Based on the shorter statement \\"A man watches his wife get bread from an older woman,\\" it is difficult to confidently conclude that the scene described in the longer statement is accurate without more context or additional information. While the shorter statement does convey the basic idea of an interaction involving bread between two women and a man, it misses several important details that are present in the longer statement.  To determine if the longer statement is an accurate interpretation of the given statement, let us analyze the two descriptions point-by-point. 1. The setting: The shorter statement does not mention the room being sunny. The presence of sunlight could affect the mood and atmosphere of the scene, providing additional context to the interaction. 2. The older woman's attire: The shorter statement does not describe the older woman's clothing, specifically her blue shirt. This detail adds specificity to the longer statement, helping to paint a more vivid mental image, but may not change the fundamental nature of the interaction. 3. The loaf of bread over a pile of bagged bread: The shorter statement simply states that the older woman hands over bread. It does not specify whether the bread is a single loaf or from a pile of bagged bread. This detail may provide insight into the situation, suggesting that the older woman has multiple loaves of bread, indicating perhaps a bakery or another setting where bread distribution is a primary function. 4. Descriptions of the wife: The shorter statement does not provide any details about the wife's appearance or emotional state. The longer statement notes that she is smiling, has her eyes closed, wears a flower shirt, and a duster sweater. These additional details provide more context and may imply a friendly, relaxed interaction between the people involved. 5. The man's attire and actions: The shorter statement only mentions that the man is watching the interaction, while the longer statement adds that he is wearing a red shirt and glasses. This further embellishes the visual depiction of the scene. In conclusion, while the shorter statement \\"A man watches his wife get bread from an older woman\\" does convey a simplified version of the interaction between the three people, it lacks many crucial details present in the more in-depth statement. It is not possible to confidently conclude that the longer statement is an accurate representation based solely on the initial shorter statement, as there is missing context that could affect the understanding of the situation. For a more accurate evaluation of the scene, additional information or context surrounding the event would be necessary. This could include descriptions of the setting, people involved, or any other relevant factors that may contribute to a thorough and complete understanding of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This aggressive strategy allowed them to overtake the struggling IBM and push Apple down to third place in the PC manufacturing hierarchy. While the 1980s and early-mid 1990s saw Compaq in the third place position among PC manufacturers, they leveraged the price war strategy effectively to gain market leadership. It's also noteworthy that this move significantly impacted both IBM and Apple, traditional leaders in the PC manufacturing space. IBM, which was already struggling, was overtaken, and Apple was demoted to the third place. This shows the level of competition and strategic movements that were taking place in the PC market during this period.

Does finish mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"finish\\" is used in different contexts, affecting the meaning of the word in each sentence. Although at first glance, it may seem like the word \\"finish\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, they are not exactly the same. Let's analyze both sentences to understand the differences: 1. Sentence 1: His best finish in a major tournament was third. In this sentence, the word \\"finish\\" refers to the final position or ranking achieved by an individual or a team at the end of a competition or event. This is commonly used when discussing sports or competitive activities to indicate the results. In this particular case, the context is a major tournament, and the person being discussed has achieved their best result by finishing third. Here, \\"finish\\" is a noun, denoting the final outcome or the conclusion of the individual's performance. 2. Sentence 2: It was a fight to the finish. In this sentence, the meaning of \\"finish\\" changes slightly. In this context, \\"finish\\" refers to the end or conclusion of a battle or struggle. This phrase, \\"fight to the finish,\\" is an idiom that means a fierce contest or struggle that continues until one side definitively wins or loses, with no compromise or interim resolution. The emphasis is on the intensity and persistence of the confrontation or battle, implying that the participants are determined to see things through to the end. In this case, \\"finish\\" is still a noun, but it is used to represent the point in time when the fight or struggle ends. In summary, the difference in meaning of \\"finish\\" in these two sentences lies in the nuances of the context in which the word is used. In the first sentence, \\"finish\\" pertains to positions or rankings, while in the second sentence, it refers to the end or conclusion of a struggle or battle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A lot of silent films don't hold my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously. Show People is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. The movie captured my attention immediately and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary. Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films.

The video documentary then transitions, with excited background music, to show Noah's incredible adventure walking with dinosaurs. Noah, accompanied by paleontologist Thomas Huxley, tours the exhibit of animatronic dinosaurs, marveling at the detailed creatures. Their journey begins with the herbivorous Triceratops, followed by other magnificent species like Pachycephalosaurus and Stegosaurus. Noah takes every opportunity to ask questions, each query followed by Huxley's detailed and informative answers. This turns into an educational segment, too, allowing the audience to learn alongside Noah. As Noah's VIP tour continues, he encounters a nest full of Velociraptor eggs, and watches in awe as the eggs move and the baby dinosaurs start to hatch. In another shot, Noah is seen riding an Ankylosaurus with a loving and protective look in his eyes. Huxley explains that the Ankylosaurus was a plant-eating species with strong defenses, sparking a conversation on how not all dinosaurs were as fearsome as Noah had expected. The climax of the video takes place when Noah comes face-to-face with a massive Tyrannosaurus Rex. He stares up at the colossal creature with a mix of terror, excitement, and wonder. As the T-Rex approaches, Noah takes Huxley's advice to remain motionless, while Huxley reassures him this T-Rex is well-trained. Now more at ease, Noah uses this encounter as an opportunity to learn about the T-Rex, discovering their behavioral and territorial patterns, as well as their role in the ecosystem. He slowly gains confidence and becomes less afraid, eventually touching the T-Rex, much to his amazement.

The Rill Lodge and Ski Resort in Colorado is holding its 50th Annual Winter Carnival and is expecting a record turnout. Unbeknownst to the assembled people, however, something is lurking in the woods, not quite human and not quite animal. Two friends skiing on the North slope, Heidi (Annie McEnroe) and Jennifer (Kathy Christopher), find mysterious tracks and hear some disturbing noises coming from the woods. Heidi takes off, but Jennifer lags behind and is set upon by a monstrous beast.Tony Rill (Robert Logan), manager of the resort, is summoned and told that a female skier was found, babbling incoherently about some sort of monster and her missing friend. Rill, doubtful at first, listens to Heidi's story and, despite being unsettled by what he hears, surmises that it was probably a grizzly bear. He and a search party set out and split up to find Jennifer. Rill comes upon a remote stretch where he finds Jennifer's jacket, bloody and torn to shreds. He also hears a monstrous roar come from the woods and turns just in time to glimpse something white, hairy and massive at the edge of the treeline.Meanwhile, back at the resort, Gar Seberg (Bo Svenson) and his wife Ellen (Yvette Mimieux) arrive. Seberg, a former Olympic Ski champion, has fallen on hard times and has come to Colorado to see if his old friend Rill can give him a job. As they step into the main building, Seberg gets the brushoff from a worried Rill, and begins to feel that this whole thing was a bad idea. Rill, meanwhile, informs his grandmother, and owner of the resort, Carrie Rill (Sylvia Sidney) about what he saw and heard, and tells her that they should put up signs restricting access to the area and inform the sheriff. Carie, however, is put off by the thought of a story about some wild man-beast roaming the slopes hurting business, and convinces Rill that while no one will believe Heidi, his word is another matter altogether. She agrees that he should merely post signs around the slopes warning of possible avalanches, arguing that... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Snowbeast,\\" the character Gar Seberg is attacked by the titular Snowbeast, which is a monstrous creature hiding in the woods near the Rill Lodge and Ski Resort in Colorado. The Snowbeast is a large, white, hairy creature, neither fully human nor animal, causing panic and fear among the people attending the 50th Annual Winter Carnival at the resort. The attack on Gar is a significant event in the film, as it serves to solidify the presence and danger of the mysterious creature lurking in the woods. Prior to this, reports and evidence of the Snowbeast's existence were met with skepticism, particularly by Tony Rill, the resort manager. Even after finding Jennifer's jacket and witnessing a glimpse of the creature, Rill was still hesitant to warn the public about the monstrous threat. Before the attack on Gar, he and his wife Ellen arrive at the resort seeking employment from his old friend Tony Rill. Although Rill is preoccupied with the unsettling events surrounding the Snowbeast, Gar manages to get involved in the situation. His encounter with the Snowbeast proves to be a turning point in the film. As a former Olympic Ski champion, Gar's involvement and the subsequent attack on him make it harder for Rill and other characters to ignore or dismiss the looming threat of the Snowbeast. Furthermore, this attack on Gar adds tension and urgency to the film's plot, as the resort's management is forced to confront the reality of the dangerous beast lurking nearby. Owner Carrie Rill is particularly concerned about the potential impact on their business, choosing to keep the information about the Snowbeast under wraps from their guests. However, as the attacks continue and the danger becomes increasingly apparent, the characters in the film must make a collective decision to confront and respond to the terrifying presence of the Snowbeast in their midst. In conclusion, the attack on Gar Seberg by the Snowbeast serves as a pivotal moment in the movie. It establishes both the potency of the threat and the need for the characters to take action against the monstrous creature endangering their resort and the people attending the Winter Carnival. The Snowbeast's attack on a prominent and accomplished character like Gar Seberg reinforces the significance of the threat, forcing the resort's management to confront and respond to the danger lurking in the woods, and setting the stage for the film's climax."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mike Pence is being sued over his decision to suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees in his state. Pence is accused of violating the Constitution by accepting refugees from other countries but not those from Syria following last week’s violent terrorist attacks in Paris that killed at least 130 people. The federal lawsuit was filed late Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana on behalf of Indianapolis-based nonprofit Exodus Refugee Immigration. “There is no border around the state of Indiana that prevents people from entering our state who may move freely within the United States,” ACLU of Indiana legal director Ken Falk said in a statement. Pence, 56, had halted Indiana’s plans to resettle Syrian refugees last week after European officials said a Syrian citizen was among the attackers in Paris. He and 26 other U.S. governors later penned a letter to President Barack Obama on Friday urging him to halt all resettlement plans in the country until proper security measures have been achieved.” “We are deeply concerned that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria may have exploited the generosity of the refugee system to carry out Friday’s terrorist attack in Paris,” the memo said. Pence did not immediately return requests for comment Tuesday. The U.S. has resettled about 1,800 refugees from Syria so far in 2015, according to the State Department. The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the temporary block. “Indiana is a welcoming state known for our hospitality,” Exodus Executive Director Carleen Miller said. “History will judge us in this moment – whether we take the moral stand for victims of war and persecution in their time of need or reject our core principles by giving in to fear and terror.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Indiana Governor Mike Pence faces a lawsuit for suspending the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Indiana, accusing him of violating the Constitution by accepting refugees from other countries but not from Syria.

Spokane sheriff: Two teens attack one's mom intending to eat her liver updated 10:17 PM EDT, Fri September 20, 2013 (CNN) -- Two teenagers -- 13 and 14 years old -- are in custody in Spokane, Washington, and the mother of one of the teens is recuperating in a hospital after she was attacked by the boys following a pill-taking episode, authorities said. The boys apparently had planned to kill the woman, who is the 13-year-old's mother, and eat her liver, Spokane County Sheriff's Deputy Craig Chamberlin told CNN Friday. \\"The 14-year-old came up with the idea of, 'Hey, let's rip her open and eat her liver,' but it never happened,\\" said Chamberlin. Instead, the older boy allegedly beat the woman with the handle of a sword, Chamberlin said, adding, \\"I think that was their original plan, to cut her open, but then they changed their minds.\\" The woman was left bloodied with head injuries after the incident Tuesday, and remained hospitalized Friday in stable condition at a local hospital. The boys were arrested after a crime spree that included auto theft, burglary and vandalism, authorities said. The injured woman was found in her home by deputies responding to call; nearby were two knives and a sword with a bent handle. After deputies found no sign of forced entry into the woman's house, a manhunt was launched for the two teenagers. Deputies were called to the home of the 14-year-old's father when the man realized his 2005 Dodge Durango SUV was missing, and shortly afterward a call came in about a vehicle hit-and-run. The Durango was found at the accident scene but the teenagers were not. Deputies then received a call of a residential burglary in process. \\"The place was damaged. There were kicked holes in the wall,\\" Chamberlin said, \\"Just malicious mischief.\\" A state patrol trooper spotted the two teens running from the scene of the burglary, they were caught and arrested. The teens, whose names were not released, were booked on juvenile charges of second-degree assault, taking a motor vehicle without permission, residential burglary , second-degree malicious mischief and hit-and-run, Chamberlin said. The son of the injured woman later told deputies that he had been taking \\"blue pills\\" and would never do anything like the alleged crimes while sober,\\" according to Chamberlin. \\"It could be anything, it could be ecstasy, it had to have been some type of opium, hallucinogen...We were never able to collect any (pills),\\" Chamberlin said.

Mal'akh places Langdon into an airtight sensory deprivation tank, where he interrogates Langdon by slowly filling the tank with liquid. He is able to convince Langdon to decipher the code at the pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon drowns and apparently dies. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm and leaves her to bleed to death then flees with a weakened and wheelchair-bound Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in and are able to save Katherine's life. After a near-death experience, Langdon is revealed to have survived due to the \`\`water'' in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato, Langdon and Simkins race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word--the unpronounceable circumpunct--out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). With tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's skylight, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer. Katherine arrives and she and Langdon then share a tearful reunion with Peter and mourn Zachary's death. Zachary is only briefly able to lament his body's mutilation before dying.

Luckily we found his,\\" says a lawyer for a man who has been freed after serving 17 years for a crime he always insisted he didn't commit. Richard Jones was released by a Kansas judge after lawyers presented evidence that there is another man who bears an uncanny resemblance to him and that witnesses could not tell the two of them apart, the Kansas City Star reports. There was never any physical evidence linking Jones to the 1999 robbery he was sent to prison for. Jones' girlfriend and family members backed up his alibi, but he was convicted after witnesses, including the robbery victim, identified him. The victim testified last week that she can no longer be certain Jones was the robber. Jones says people in prison told him there was another inmate who looked just like him and had the same first name. No criminal case has been filed yet against the other man, who, unlike Jones, lived near the scene of the crime, the BBC reports. Jones was arrested months after the robbery after a witness picked his photo out of around 200 people named Richard. Other witnesses were shown a photo line-up in which Jones was the only light-skinned person. Jones, who became a grandfather while in prison, was released with the help of the Midwest Innocence Project. Kansas has no law compensating victims of wrongful conviction, but a GoFundMe page has been set up to support Jones' return to society. Expand this summary.","output":"Richard Jones, a Kansas man, served 17 years in prison for a robbery he always insisted he did not commit. Jones was released by a Kansas judge after lawyers presented evidence revealing the existence of another man bearing a striking resemblance to him, leading to potential witness confusion. The similarity between the two men became the crucial point in eventually exonerating Jones. Besides their nearly identical appearances, the two men had no known connections. The case began in 1999 when Jones was convicted based on eyewitness testimony, despite there being no physical evidence connecting him to the crime. Jones' girlfriend and family members provided his alibi, stating he was with them at the time the crime took place. However, the witnesses, including the robbery victim, identified Jones as the perpetrator. Last week, the victim testified that she can no longer be certain Jones was indeed the robber.  While in prison, Jones heard from fellow inmates about another prisoner who looked strikingly similar to him and shared the same first name. This other individual lived near the scene of the crime and resembled Jones more closely, based on certain distinct facial features and skin marks that the actual criminal was said to possess. No criminal case has been filed yet against this other person. Jones' arrest occurred months after the robbery when a witness selected his photo from a lineup of around 200 people named Richard. Other witnesses were shown a photo lineup in which Jones was the only light-skinned person. This method of identification was a significant factor that led to Jones' wrongful conviction. During his time in prison, Jones became a grandfather. His release was made possible by the Midwest Innocence Project, which helped uncover the existence of the doppelganger and provided essential support in proving Jones' innocence. Unfortunately, Kansas currently has no law compensating for victims of wrongful conviction.

Summarize: It must have been brought home forcefully with the visit of an all-party delegation of Indian parliamentarians to Sri Lanka last week. Although India supported the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam it was wrong to presume that it would turn a blind eye to Colombo's indifference towards resolving the Tamil question since the war ended three years ago. Its error should have been apparent to Colombo when Delhi voted for the resolution in the UN Human Rights Council castigating Sri Lanka for the abuses committed by its armed forces against the Tamil militants during the three decades of war. The parliamentarian delegation, the first high level one from India after the UN vote, was led by opposition leader Sushma Swaraj. While MPs from the Tamil parties DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and the AIADMK (All India Anna DMK) had withdrawn from it, the other members - including some Tamil speaking MPs - were also of two minds because of aggressive statements on the Koodankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu state by a Sri Lankan minister virtually on the eve of the visit. Despite the situation not being politically propitious, the delegation still went ahead. Sushma Swaraj made only one public statement at the end of the visit. She urged Colombo to \\"reach a genuine reconciliation\\" based on \\"a meaningful devolution of powers which takes into account the legitimate needs of the Tamil people for equality, dignity, justice and self-respect\\". The opposition leader spoke in the same voice as the government of India - suggesting that there was weariness across the political class in India with Colombo's reluctance to devolve power to Sri Lanka's Tamil minority. The shift in India's position towards Sri Lanka as manifested in the UN Human Rights Council vote has been ascribed to several factors. One theory is that there was a backroom deal between the national government and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa that she would allow the Koodankulam nuclear power plant in her state to become operational if the government voted for the resolution. Other theories are that the government was forced to keep the DMK in good humour due to coalition compulsions and that India gave in to US pressure to support the Washington-sponsored resolution on human rights violations in Sri Lanka. It would be an error to conclude, however, that such tactical factors alone were responsible for the change in India's position. What happens to Sri Lankan Tamils has an emotional and often a political echo in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Even during the conflict with the LTTE, while India supported military action against the militant forces, it always cautioned Colombo about protecting the rights of the Tamil civilian population and ensuring their welfare. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has assured India several times about his commitment to a constitutional amendment to devolve powers to the Tamils. It was passed in 1987 as a result of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord but its legality has been questioned in the Supreme Court. So although President Rajapaksa talks of a devolution process that would be more than that promised earlier - he calls it \\"13th amendment PLUS\\", there is uncertainty about what this would mean. Many ministers in the Rajapaksa government are openly opposed to devolution and the president himself seems to be backtracking on it. A parliamentary select committee which will make suggestions on the Tamil issue is yet to be set up. Colombo, however, has failed to read India's disappointment with bilateral efforts. If it had started negotiations for devolution with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the UNHRC resolution imbroglio may not have taken place. The all-party parliamentarians' delegation emphasised these issues - urging that a dialogue be restarted in which the TNA is given an honourable role and that the parliamentary select committee on devolution be set up soon. Most importantly, it left Colombo in no doubt that the Indian political parties were united on this issue. Having created an anti-West frenzy it may not be easy for the Rajapaksa government to back away from it. It derives its social power from a peculiar psyche - of Sri Lanka (that is, the majority Sinhalas) being isolated by evil powers. However, the Rajapaksa government could still move in the direction that Delhi is pushing it. While maintaining its anti-West, anti-imperialist facade, it could compromise on implementing the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations. That would be the pragmatic way forward. Delhi after all is not seeking regime change in Colombo. The visit by Indian parliamentarians shows that the Indian policy of engagement with Colombo will continue unabated. However, so will the pressure for a permanent reconciliation with the Sri Lankan Tamils. Summary:","output":"An all-party delegation of Indian parliamentarians visited Sri Lanka, emphasizing the need for a genuine reconciliation with the Tamil minority through a meaningful devolution of powers. Despite India's support for the war against the Tamil Tigers, it disapproves of Colombo's reluctance to resolve the Tamil issue. The Indian delegation, led by opposition leader Sushma Swaraj, urged the Sri Lankan government to engage with the Tamil National Alliance and establish a parliamentary select committee on devolution. India will continue to engage with Sri Lanka while maintaining pressure for a permanent reconciliation with the Sri Lankan Tamils."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The book aroused international interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much of the initial reaction was hostile, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What field of ideas latched onto On the Origin of Species when it became a widespread success?","output":"The field of ideas that latched onto On the Origin of Species when it became a widespread success was primarily social reform and evolutionary mechanisms in scientific discussions.

Plot title: Ramana Movie plot: The film is about Ramana (Vijayakanth) who decides to abolish corruption altogether with the help of his students who are now working in various government offices. The reason behind this powerful decision is told in the flashback. Ramana is a happy professor with his wife (played by Simran) and daughter. And one day when Ramana is out to make some purchases, the entire neighbourhood collapses due to some fault in the construction and many of the residents including Simran and her daughter lose their lives. Ramana rushes to the Government Officials when he comes to know that all this was due to one person namely Vijayan, an industrialist with the necessary proof. But the incidents that he faces at the office, and on finding that these officials who are now corrupt to the core are mere puppets in the hands of Vijayan he gets frustrated on the situation and this makes him to form the ACF (Anti Corruption Force). 15 Thasildars are found missing and then the police find that 14 of them have been released after 3 days but one of them is killed. They find some files and a tape along with the body of the dead thasildar. These files carry details of why the kidnap of the 15 thasildars had been done and the reason for the murder of one of them and have the words ACF written on it. It is understood by the police that these men where the thasildars who had indulged themselves in bribery and that they were the top 15 of the list of the corrupt thasildars. ACF sends the tape, with the message that they shall continue the kidnap of the corrupt officers in all the departments and that the No.1 corrupt shall be sentenced to death according to the law of the Anti Corruption Force. There is fear among the corrupt officials. They come forward to file their returns. For a while there are no illegal transactions done, but the corruption soon continues in the society due to the threatening of the local mob to sign illegal documents and accept bribes. Meanwhile, the ACF finds that it is Vijayan who is the real reason behind this... My question: Who kills Vijayan? A:","output":"In the movie Ramana, Vijayan is the industrialist responsible for the corruption and the tragedy that befalls Ramana's family and neighborhood. Since the plot summary does not explicitly tell us who kills Vijayan, there is room for speculation and creative interpretation. One possibility is that Ramana, as the leader of the Anti Corruption Force (ACF), kills Vijayan himself in order to exact revenge for the loss of his wife and daughter, as well as to send a strong message to other corrupt officials. This would be a powerful and defining moment in the film, showcasing Ramana's commitment to eradicating corruption and fighting for justice. Another possibility is that one of Ramana's students and ACF members kills Vijayan. As the students are integral to the ACF's mission, it would be fitting for one of them to step up and deliver the final blow against the main antagonist. This could also lead to a stronger bond between Ramana and his students, emphasizing the teamwork and unity required to combat corruption. A third alternative is that Vijayan is not directly killed by any of the protagonists, but rather meets his end due to his own actions or the consequence of his corruption. For instance, he could be betrayed by one of his allies or underlings who desire to take his place, or he could be caught in a situation caused by the compromised buildings that he was responsible for. This would serve as a poetic justice for his character and a warning to others that corruption often leads to self-destruction. Ultimately, the choice of who kills Vijayan will depend on the overall message and tone the director wishes to convey to the audience. Each option has its own unique implications and emotional impact, making this decision an important one for the overall success of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: In Toulouse, Muslims Fear Diversity Is at Risk Jewish and Muslim leaders marched together silently on Sunday to honor the four people who were killed by Mohammed Merah at a Jewish school in Toulouse, a city known for tolerance. TOULOUSE, France — As near to the Spanish border as it is to the Mediterranean, this sunny red-brick city has long been known as a place of welcome and diversity, far removed from the divisive politics of Paris. In contrast to much of the French south, the far right, with its virulent anti-immigrant stance, has little presence here. Nor does radical Islam. Toulouse is by no means without racism, anti-Semitism, crime or the deep social segregation that marks many French cities, but with a culture shaped by successive waves of immigration, it is described by its inhabitants as a place of particular tolerance. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled the Franco dictatorship into France after the Spanish Civil War, and many settled here. So, too, did the pieds noirs, the French expelled from newly independent Algeria in 1962, as well as the harkis, the Algerians who had backed the French colonialists, and thousands of Jews. In addition to a host of universities and research centers, the aerospace giant Airbus is based here, attracting engineers and scientists from around the world. So while Muslims across France speak of feeling vilified, this city has largely been spared the tensions that surround Islam. “It is true that from time to time we are subjected to hateful political discourse,” said Mohamed Tataï, the imam at the mosque El Nour in Empalot, a poor neighborhood. It is effectively imported from outside the city, though, he said, often around election time. “Afterwards, we’re able to return to calm once again.” There are concerns, though, that Mohammed Merah may have changed that. The seven brutal killings carried out this month by Mr. Merah — a 23-year-old son of Toulouse, and a professed jihadi — occurred during a divisive presidential race that had already turned toward questions of immigration and Islam. Even though investigators say Mr. Merah was effectively a lone, self-radicalized extremist, his violent ideology fits closely with some French stereotypes of Islam, and Muslims here fear that the tensions brought on by the murders may prove more lasting. “All of this does not correspond at all with what Toulouse is,” Pierre Cohen, the mayor, said of the killings. But “we’ve just come out of a very tense period,” he said. “Unfortunately, this risk exists.” Already, a false rumor has spread through the city, Mr. Cohen said, suggesting that Muslims were organizing a demonstration in defense of Mr. Merah. “There will be a ‘before’ and an ‘after,’ ” said Yassin Elmu’min, 23, a round-faced young man with blue eyes and short hair slicked into tight curls. Typically, Mr. Elmu’min said, there is “dialogue” between cultures in Toulouse, and Muslims are treated well. But he and other Muslims, many living in the poor suburbs outside downtown Toulouse, said they had already begun to detect nervous gazes that were uncharacteristic of this city. “Someone had the nerve to ask me, ‘Do you agree with what he did?’ ” Mr. Elmu’min said, exasperated. President Nicolas Sarkozy called for the rejection of “easy falsehoods” about Muslims last week, after Mr. Merah was killed by police commandos, Mr. Elmu’min said. “The ‘easy falsehoods’ are already here,” he lamented. A friend, Abd’allah, 19, dressed in a cream-colored djellaba beneath a hooded sweatshirt, said, “We’re the victims in the story.” He declined to give his full name, saying he feared trouble from the French authorities. Despite Mr. Sarkozy’s recent appeals for tolerance, many Muslims say he has done much to stigmatize them, pointing often to a 2010 law banning the Islamic full veil, or niqab, and to a debate on “the national identity.” Marine Le Pen, the presidential candidate for the far-right National Front, has been vociferous in her response to the killings. “What happened is not the matter of one man’s madness; what happened is the beginning of the forward march of green fascism in our country,” Ms. Le Pen said on Sunday, referring to radical Islam. “How many Mohammed Merahs are there in the boats, the planes that arrive each day in France, full of immigrants?” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about the city of Toulouse in France, which is known for being welcoming and accepting of different cultures and religions. People in Toulouse are worried that the recent violent actions of Mohammed Merah, who killed four people at a Jewish school, might make people more scared or hateful of Muslims.

The article also mentions that the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has called for people to be understanding and kind towards Muslims, even though some feel that he has contributed to the negative views about them.

Living next door to the Chandlers, David is aware of the charisma Ruth has, since she freely allows her sons and their neighborhood friends to her house, where she entertains them and offers them beer and cigarettes. Meanwhile, Ruth starves Meg, accuses her of being a whore and subjects her to misogynistic lectures, whilst her children listen. One day, David visits the Chandler residence, where he sees the Chandler sons tickling Meg. Ralphie inappropriately tickles Meg's breasts, prompting her to fend him off as she runs from the room. His brothers humiliate Susan and when Ralphie brings Ruth to the situation, Ruth reprimands her for forgiving Meg's actions. Ruth beats Susan's bare buttocks as the Chandler sons restrain a horrified Meg, who came back to the room to save Susan. Ruth then takes the ring that Meg wears around her neck, which belonged to her mother.","output":"The first names of the people who are sent to live with their aunt are Meg and Susan.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan, and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman. (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver 10,000 to become sole manager.) Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty. Dylan said, \\"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming.\\" Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond suggesting that Dylan work with the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson, who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson went on to produce the next three albums Dylan recorded.Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963. He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama, Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television. At the end of the play, Dylan performed \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", one of its first public performances. The film recording of Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968. While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including the Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies. He also learned material from UK performers, including Martin Carthy.By the time of Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer-songwriter. Many songs on this album were labeled protest songs, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger's passion for topical songs. \\"Oxford Town\\", for example, was an account of James Meredith's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi.The first song on the Freewheelin' album, \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song, \\"No More Auction Block\\", while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What does the abort system include?\\" is \\"Cushioning for the crew\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer to the question \\"What does the abort system include?\\" appears to be a \\"launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters.\\" This launch abort system is designed to save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction, thereby providing safety and protection for the astronauts on board.

The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking.

No one can deny  that medical progress has enriched our lives greatly. Because of medical advancements, we eat better, live easier and are able to take care of ourselves more efficiently. We can cure disease with no more than one injection  or a pill. If we have a serious accident, doctors can put us back together again. If we are born with something defective  , they can repair it. They can ease our pain, replace worn parts and give us children. They can even bring us back from death. These are wonderful achievements, but there is a price we have to pay.

Rain and cold weather this summer saw honey yields from hives fall by almost three-quarters, the British Beekeepers Association(BBKA)said today. The average crop per hive was down 72% compared to last year, with just 3.6kg (81b) of honey produced compared to an annual average, the annual honey survey by the BBKA revealed. The survey of 2,712 beekeepers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales found that 88% said this summer's bad weather caused the _ in honey yields. The bad weather made it difficult for bees to excrete ,which led to disease easily, and the bad weather also increased the risk of keeping bees for heavy rain caused the places which bees regularly visited to meet natural disasters. The bad weather also influenced the plants flowering which increased the cost of keeping bees. The BBKA issued a midsummer warning to feed bees if necessary to avoid dying from hunger. But in London, which recorded the worst results with just 2.5kg (5.61b)of honey harvested on average, beekeeping experts said that in addition to the bad weather there was a lack of food for bees in the city. Angela Woods, secretary of the London Beekeepers Association, said, \\"Rather than putting beehives on office roofs, we encourage companies in London that want to help to look at different ways of supporting bees and beekeepers. We need more food for the bees and better-educated beekeepers.\\" Elsewhere, the weather was the main problem. Peter Hutton, a beekeeper in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said, \\"It has been the most difficult year I have known in my 53 years of beekeeping. Bad weather in spring prevented bees in many areas from collecting nectar from early-flowering crops such as oilseed rape ,and the rain continued in many places throughout June and July, preventing honeybees from searching for food on later crops.\\" The BBKA warned that as well as reducing the honey harvest, the bad weather is likely to have a longer-term influence as it will have affected the normal process of breeding for the queens, which mate on the wing on fine,...

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

The son of the legendary Haydn Bunton Sr., Bunton Jr. played for North Adelaide and Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), as well as Swan Districts and Subiaco in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Bunton was regarded as a tough and skilful player in both South Australia and Western Australia, but it was as a coach that he cemented a reputation alongside his father as one of Australian football's greatest identities. Bunton was inducted into the coaches section of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, as well as the Western Australian Institute of Sport Hall of Champions in 2003 and was made an inaugural member of the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SA Football Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1984, Bunton junior returned to his former haunt of Subiaco, who as a result of the loss of such players as Mike Fitzpatrick had endured another bleak era over the previous nine seasons. The Lions had not participated in the finals since 1974 and had finished dead last in 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1982, when they were in danger of a winless season before beating East Fremantle in the seventeenth round. Since 1975 Subiaco had recorded only 44 wins from 189 games and had lost its \\"average\\" game over these nine seasons by a margin of 36 points.  However, under Bunton and aided by a powerful country zone, the Lions improved rapidly: from four wins and a percentage of 70 in 1983 they went to nine wins and a percentage of 100 in 1984 and fifteen wins and a percentage of 124.5 in 1985. Despite being in their first finals series since 1974, the Lions only just failed to beat East Fremantle in the grand final and gained ample revenge against the Sharks the following year by eleven and a half goals. Their team was sufficiently good to be competitive against VFL premiers Hawthorn in a post-season \\"challenge\\" match - ironically Hawthorn's win was led by Subiaco's one star of the bleak late 1970s and early 1980s in Gary Buckenara.  An irrepressible Claremont outfit under the innovative coaching of Gerard Neesham halted Subiaco in 1987, but the following year after losing the second semi to the Tigers and being unconvincing in the preliminary against East Fremantle, the Lions, playing a much more traditional game than Claremont and aided by the controversial inclusion of West Coast Eagle Laurie Keene, ran away to win by 62 points after an even first half.  The massive drain of players to the VFL meant Subiaco could not keep up this standard, and they won only six games each in 1989 and 1990 before returning to the Grand Final in 1991 only for Claremont to have its revenge. A thrashing by East Perth in the first week of the 1992 WAFL finals saw Bunton resign at the end of the season after having coached Subiaco's most successful era since before World War II. How did that affect Haydn?","output":"Haydn Austin Bunton, who was born on April 5, 1937, was an Australian rules football player and a coach. His dad, Haydn Bunton Sr., was a legendary football player too. Haydn Jr. played in two leagues with different teams, in South Australia and Western Australia. He was a strong player, but he became even more famous when he started coaching. Haydn got into some halls of fame because he was so good at football and coaching. In 1984, Haydn went back to a team called Subiaco. They were having a tough time and lost many games, but with Haydn's help, they improved a lot. They even made it to important games but missed winning the championship a couple of times. Later, they faced more challenges because some of their best players went to play in another league called the VFL. This made it difficult for Haydn's team to keep doing well, and they didn't win as many games. They did reach the big final game again in 1991, but they lost that one too. Finally, after his team lost a game and was out of the competition in 1992, Haydn decided to stop coaching the team. All these ups and downs affected Haydn because it was tough for his team and him. They worked hard and had some successes, but they couldn't stay at the top because they lost many good players. Even though they faced many challenges, Haydn's coaching made a big difference for the Subiaco team and helped them become better than they were before."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After all, who would choose a plastic toy over a lovely puppy? But Rault argues that the robotic kind has a lot going for it: \\"You don't have to feed it, you don't have to walk it, it won't make a mess in your house, and you can go on a holiday without feeling guilty.\\" The technology also benefits those who are allergic to pets, short on space, or fearful of real animals. It's not clear whether robot pets can replace real ones. But studies do suggest that we can bond with these smart machines. People give their cars names and kids give their toy animals life stories. It's the same with robots. When Sony stopped its repair service for its robot dog Aibo in March 2014, owners in Japan held funerals. As an animal welfare researcher, Rault is concerned about how robotic pets could affect our attitudes towards live animals. \\"If we become used to a robotic companion that doesn't need food, water or exercises, perhaps it will change how humans care about other living beings,\\" he said. So are dogs and cats a thing of the past, as Rault predicts? For those who grew up with living and breathing pets, the mechanical kind might not do. But for our next generation who are in constant touch with smart technology, a future in which lovely pets needn't have a heartbeat might not be a far-fetched dream.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

Summarize this article: Tony Woodcock's early try and a penalty from fourth-choice fly-half Stephen Donald were enough to see the All Blacks home in an extraordinary match that defied all pre-match predictions. France produced their best performance of the tournament and appeared to be close to pulling off one of the great upsets after captain Thierry Dusautoir's try with half an hour remaining set up a nerve-shredding finale. But Francois Trinh-Duc missed a long-range penalty before desperate defence saw the favourites hang on for a famous win. As you looked around Eden Park late on Sunday night, camera-flashes twinkling among the black-clad thousands in the stands like stars in the night sky, one emotion dominated all others: an enormous, unmistakable sense of relief Read the rest of Tom's blog The final whistle triggered scenes of wild jubilation at Eden Park as a nation celebrated a repeat of the outcome from the very first World Cup final in 1987. And when skipper Richie McCaw hoisted the Webb Ellis Trophy high into the night, a quarter of a century of hurt was blown away in an explosion of fireworks and cheering. An already febrile atmosphere within the ground before the start had been stoked still further when France's players formed an arrow formation to face down the haka, and then advanced slowly over halfway as the capacity crowd roared. The drama seemed to unsettle the players, both sides making early errors, and when Piri Weepu pulled a penalty badly wide the nerves began to spread to the stands. With one well-worked line-out move they were soon silenced. Weepu put a penalty into the corner, Jerome Kaino took the ball off the top and popped it down into the arms of the advancing Woodcock to put the veteran prop through a gaping hole. Weepu missed a simple conversion but France were rattled. For all their good early work they found themselves on the end of some harsh decisions from referee Craig Joubert at the scrum and breakdown. With fly-half Morgan Parra forced off with a head injury the All Blacks began to dominate possession, only for Weepu to miss another straightforward penalty from 25 metres out. The scrum-half's struggles meant the lead remained at just five points instead of a possible 13, and with half-time approaching the tide began to turn. Fly-half Aaron Cruden hyper-extended his knee horribly in contact and was carried off the pitch, forcing Graham Henry to bring on Donald - a man who was fishing for whitebait a fortnight ago before injuries to Dan Carter and Colin Slade triggered his emergency call-up. France's own stand-in stand-off Trinh-Duc missed with a drop-goal when well set but then set off on a curving run through a scattered defensive line which carried him deep into enemy territory until Weepu's desperate tap-tackle finally brought him down. He had a chance to reduce the deficit to just two points only to slide a penalty from the left touchline across the face of the posts, and was then penalised by Joubert to give Donald the simplest of kicks for 8-0. If some expected France to fold, Les Bleus had other ideas. Trinh-Duc gathered a poor kick from Weepu and sliced through the All Blacks line again, and although Dimitri Yachvili slipped with the line at his mercy the ball went wide, was recycled and put into the hands of skipper Dusautoir to slide in under the posts. Eden Park was stunned, Trinh-Duc converting for 8-7 and the previously impregnable home side badly rattled. France were transformed from the feeble, divided unit that had squeaked past Wales in the semi-final, their half-backs finding the corners with beautifully judged kicks from hand, the forwards making yards with every drive and a reorganised Kiwi line-out beginning to malfunction. With 16 minutes left on the clock and the tension climbing through the roof, Trinh-Duc tried his luck with a penalty from just inside halfway only to push it wide, but the unthinkable now seemed a real possibility. Replacement Damien Traille burgled a high ball from Israel Dagg and made good ground, the All Blacks scrum coming under increasing pressure and the crowd falling silent as their World Cup dream threatened to become a nightmare. With the seconds slipping away and the gap just one point, France went through an 18-phase attack that made little ground but resulted in an attacking scrum on the New Zealand 10m line, only for the hosts to steal the ball back when Aurelien Rougerie was wrapped up. The All Blacks drove upfield, using up the remaining moments, and when Joubert blew for another French infringement, the biggest party in New Zealand's history was under way.

Not used: Fulgence Ouedraogo Referee: Craig Joubert (South Africa) Attendance: 60,000","output":"In an extraordinary and nerve-wracking final match at Eden Park, New Zealand's All Blacks defeated France to win the Rugby World Cup. Tony Woodcock scored an early try, and Stephen Donald secured a penalty to ensure the All Blacks' victory. France put up an impressive performance, with captain Thierry Dusautoir scoring a try, setting the stage for an intense finish. Despite Francois Trinh-Duc missing a long-range penalty, the All Blacks' tight defense led them to a historical win, replicating the outcome of the first World Cup final in 1987. The atmosphere at Eden Park became even more electrifying when the French players formed an arrow formation facing the haka, a traditional pre-match ritual. Both teams made early errors, but the All Blacks quickly gained momentum after Woodcock's try, shaking France. However, referee Craig Joubert's decisions on scrum and breakdowns appeared harsh on the French side. In a significant turn of events, All Blacks' Aaron Cruden suffered a knee injury, and Donald stepped in as a replacement. Despite Trinh-Duc's missed drop-goal, he made a run deep into All Blacks territory, setting the pace for France. Although France's transformation made a strong impact, the All Blacks managed to regain possession, and Joubert's call for a French infringement marked the beginning of New Zealand's celebratory moment. With a final score of 8-7 in favor of the All Blacks, the nation celebrated this monumental victory and relished in the end of a quarter-century of waiting for another triumph. The thrilling match showcased the grit and talent of both teams, and solidified the All Blacks' place in rugby history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Loyalty means being faithful and supportive to someone or something. It's like always being there for your best friend or favorite toy. To understand who Singh was loyal to first, let's go back to the beginning of their story. Singh was a grown-up from a faraway land called India, and they had a family, just like you. They loved their family, and their family loved them back. It was the first group of people Singh ever cared for and supported. So, in Singh's life journey, the first ones they were ever loyal to were their family members. It's like how you are loyal to your mommy, daddy, brothers, and sisters because they are your family, and you love and take care of each other. In our big world, people have different reasons for being loyal to others. Some people are loyal to their friends, some to the place they live in, and some even to an idea, like loving the planet Earth and taking good care of it. In the end, loyalty means being there for someone and supporting them, just like Singh supported their family first.

Unfortunately, the experience turned out to be a major letdown. I would like to outline my primary concerns in this review. 1. Service: Our server seemed disinterested and was slow to bring our drinks. We had to ask for bread multiple times, and by the time it arrived, our appetizer had been sitting on the table for a few minutes already. 2. Food quality: The appetizers were unremarkable. The calamari was chewy and overcooked, while the bruschetta was bland. My main course, the rib-eye steak, was very fatty and lacked flavor. For a high-end restaurant, I expected the food to be much better. 3. Atmosphere: Although the restaurant was not crowded, it was quite noisy, making it difficult for us to have a conversation without raising our voices. The lighting was also too dim, making it hard to read the menu and see our plates clearly. 4. Price: The prices were significantly higher than similar restaurants in the area, which would be justifiable if the food and service were top-notch. However, considering the disappointing experience, I felt the prices were not justified. In conclusion, I was very disappointed with my experience at Fancy Bistro. The service was subpar, the food was below average, and the atmosphere was not enjoyable. I would recommend looking for other dining options in the area for a better overall experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He offers her a monthly payment to stop working as a prostitute and move in with him. After receiving threats from two Turkish Muslims for the work she does, she decides to accept his offer. Ali's son, Nejat Aksu (Baki Davrak), a professor of German literature, does not have time to respond to the prospect of living with a woman of \\"easy virtue\\" before Ali is stricken with a heart attack. He softens to her: he learns that she has told her 27-year-old daughter she is a shoe saleswoman, sending shoes to her in Turkey to support that story, and wishes her daughter could receive an education like his. Back home from the hospital, Ali suspects Yeter and his son may have had a liaison. When his drunken demands of Yeter cause her to threaten to leave, he strikes her and she dies from the blow. Ali is sent to prison. Nejat travels to Istanbul to search for Yeter's daughter, Ayten (NurgÃ¼l YeÅilÃ§ay), and assumes responsibility for her education.

Options are: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Based on the examination of the two given sentences, it can be determined that the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence. To provide a detailed explanation, let us analyze both sentences: In Sentence 1, the speaker is discussing their new house, stating that they have purchased it due to the improvement in real estate prices. However, they also mention that they now have \\"some pretty stiff mortgage payments.\\" This statement implies that their mortgage payments are high or challenging to meet, due to reasons such as the house's size or the financial implications of the real estate market. In Sentence 2, the speaker simply states that \\"Our house is really expensive to pay for.\\" This statement also implies difficulty in making the mortgage payments, as the house is expensive, and by extension, the payments required to maintain ownership of it are too. By comparing these two sentences, we can see that both focus on the financial aspect of owning the house, specifically the burden and the cost associated with mortgage payments. Although Sentence 2 uses a more concise and straightforward approach to expressing this idea, both sentences essentially convey the same message. Therefore, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, as it expresses the same underlying concept related to the difficulty in managing the mortgage payments for the house."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

CONTEXT: 7 de febrero de 2006 El periódico iraní Hamshahri ha afirmado este lunes (6) que planea la publicación de caricaturas antijudías como respuesta a las \\"Caricaturas de Mahoma\\" danesas. La publicación, propiedad del consejo de la ciudad de Teherán señala que los dibujos satirizarán el Holocausto, siguiendo la actitud del presidente de ese país, Mahmud Ahmadineyad, quien en meses anteriores afirmó que el Holocausto es un \\"mito\\". Así, Hamshahri ha iniciado un concurso para encontrar las caricaturas más adecuadas para ese propósito. Farid Mortazavi, editor gráfico del diario, le dijo al británico The Guardian: \\"Los periódicos occidentales imprimieron estas caricaturas sacrílegas con el pretexto de la libertad de expresión, así que vamos a ver si mantienen lo que dicen y publican también estas caricaturas sobre el Holocausto\\". Mortazavi añadió que la edición impresa del próximo miércoles (8) saldrá la invitación para los caricaturistas que deseen participar en el concurso, cuyos premios serán monedas antiguas para los 12 ganadores —el número es idéntico al de los dibujos publicados por el periódico danés derechista Jyllands-Posten en septiembre pasado, las cuales encendieron la polémica y la ola de protestas, algunas de ellas violentas, en todo el mundo islámico, desde Marruecos hasta Indonesia y Filipinas—. Según el artículo del Jyllands-Posten donde se publicaron las caricaturas, éstas pretendían demostrar que: Para la prensa europea no es clara todavía la justificación que el Hamshahri ofrecerá por la publicación de las caricaturas \\"antisemitas\\". Ahmadineyad ha criticado el argumento de la libertad de expresión utilizado por los periódicos occidentales para justificar la publicación de los dibujos de Mahoma. El tema del Holocausto fue escogido debido a que su debate en Europa es considerado por algunos como un tabú, además de que la negación del asunto es criminalizada en algunos países. La prensa europea califica la prohibición islámica de hacer imágenes sobre Mahoma como uno de los tabúes de la religión musulmana. Las caricaturas publicadas en el diario danés tienen mensajes que van desde lo humorístico hasta lo político. Por ejemplo, una caricatura en la que Mahoma a las puertas del paraíso le dice a una fila de suicidas que \\"se detengan\\" porque \\"se agotaron las vírgenes\\". Otras caricaturas representan a Mahoma usando una bomba como turbante, la media luna creciente sobre la cabeza a manera de cuernos, la estrella y la media luna sobre la cara asemejando a un pirata con un parche en el ojo, etc. Por otra parte, algunos medios han denunciado que las caricaturas mostradas en el mundo musulmán contienen dibujos manipulados que no fueron publicados en los diarios europeos, en los cuales Mahoma es representado con cuerpo de cerdo mientras es sodomizado por un perro, u otros en los cuales el profeta es mostrado como pedofílico. El libanés Dyab Abou Jahjah, de la Liga Árabe Europea, organización con sede en Bruselas, ha lanzado la denominada Campaña por la Libertad de Expresión, en la que espera demostrar que los medios europeos sólo están dispuestos a publicar caricaturas antimusulmanas, pero no a imprimir dibujos anticristianos o antisemitas. Las caricaturas se muestran más adelante. En la primera, la elección de Anne Frank es algo irónica, pues ella fue partidaria del movimiento a favor de la libertad de expresión, y ella creía que las restricciones en la misma eran en parte culpables del ascenso del fascismo en los años treinta del siglo pasado. Paul Belien, del Brussels Journal, apunta que las \\"tres caricaturas de la AEL publicadas hasta el momento han sido muy instructivas en tanto se han mofado de la persecución de los judíos por parte de los nazis, mientras el señor Mr Jahjah enfatizar que el islamofascismo es de hecho la ideología a la que se adhiere\\".

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself . Meanwhile , after being placed in the Cairo Museum , the mummy of Prem is revived when Hasmid chants the sacred oath on the shroud . The mummy then proceeds to go on a murderous rampage to kill off the members of the expedition , beginning with Sir Basil after he escapes from the asylum .

Depressed, the boys decide to go on holiday together and Neil books them on a trip to Malia, Crete.Their accommodation in Malia is awful, but the boys meet four girls - Alison, Lucy, Lisa and Jane - in an empty bar during their first night out. Their initial meeting goes less than smoothly- Will chats to Alison and pokes fun at her cliched \\"Greek waiter boyfriend\\", Simon bores Lucy to death talking about Carli, Neil has a non-conversation with Lisa, and Jay \\"gets stuck\\" with the bubbly, if somewhat overweight Jane. The girls go on their way after Neil pulls two older women, but arrange to meet the boys the next day. Outside the bar, Simon sees Carli across the street.

During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov. A:","output":"The group that the scientist, Tonkin, is able to link to the car bomb is the FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation). Tonkin analyzes the residue sample of the bomb provided by Viktor Akopov and concludes that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority. With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace. Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum. The independence party in the Kingdom of Portugal, which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.

The sentence primarily focuses on the extinction of larger mammal species like wolves, bears, and European elk. It makes no reference to birds or bird species in any capacity, let alone specifically in relation to the British Isles. Thus, it cannot be used to answer the question, \\"How many bird species does the British Isles have?\\" To properly answer this question, one would need access to specific ornithological data or source materials which thoroughly detail the bird species that inhabit or are native to the British Isles. Based on a general estimate from bird surveys, there are more than 600 species of birds recorded in the British Isles, including both resident and migrant species. The exact number might vary based on the specific criteria of the bird count, such as the inclusion of accidental visitors or extinct species, among other factors. Keep in mind that bird species in the British Isles include a vast array of seabirds, songbirds, raptors, and many others, which can vary greatly in their population distribution and conservation status. Study and conservation efforts for these birds are significant, as the British Isles provide crucial habitats for an array of bird species. The island's varying climates and diverse geographical features, from the highlands of Scotland to the low-lying coasts of England, offer suitable living conditions for a multitude of bird species, each finding their suitable residence based on their specific behavioral and ecological niche.

The doctor asked each patient if they wanted anesthetic injected into their arm or not. Marco replied that he wanted some, and Luke declined any anesthetic.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Whose nerve impulses will be transmitted?  Hint: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. A:","output":"Based on the given information and hint, nerve impulses will be transmitted in Luke, the patient who declined anesthetic. When anesthetic is applied, it interferes with ion movement across the cell membrane, which in turn blocks the transmission of nerve impulses and prevents the sensation of pain. In this case, since Marco opted to receive anesthetic for his arm amputation, his nerve impulses would be inhibited, and he would not feel the pain during the operation. On the other hand, Luke chose not to receive any anesthetic, meaning his nerve impulses would continue to be transmitted without interruption. As a result, Luke would experience significant pain during the arm amputation, as his nerve impulses would still be functioning and sending signals of pain to his brain. In summary, Luke's nerve impulses will be transmitted during the operation, while Marco's nerve impulses will be blocked due to the use of anesthetic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

George Fox is associated with the founding of which religion?","output":"George Fox is associated with the founding of the Religious Society of Friends, more commonly known as the Quakers. This religious movement began in the mid-17th century in England and has since expanded to various parts across the globe, with followers today known as Friends or Quakers. George Fox was born in 1624 in Leicestershire, England. Although he grew up in a traditionally religious family that adhered to the Church of England, Fox became disillusioned with the established religious institutions early in his life. He was concerned about the widespread social upheaval, violence, and hypocrisy present in his society, which led him to seek a more genuine and authentic way of connecting with God. In 1647, Fox began to have a series of spiritual experiences and revelations that informed the basis of his new religious movement. He believed that all people had within them an inner light, which was a manifestation of God. This inner light, according to Fox, could guide individuals in their spiritual journeys and lead them to truth and righteousness, without the need for formal religious institutions or intermediaries such as priests. This belief in direct, unmediated communion with God was revolutionary at the time and laid the foundation for the Quakers' theology and practices. In addition to their belief in the inner light, Quakers also emphasize the ideals of simplicity, pacifism, social justice, and equality. They reject traditional religious symbols, rituals, and hierarchy in favor of a more egalitarian approach that encourages members to find their spiritual paths and contribute in their unique ways. Quakers historically have been noted for their work in social and political causes, including the abolition of slavery, women's rights, prison reform, and peace advocacy. Quaker meetings, or gatherings, are characterized by their simplicity and lack of liturgy. Friends come together in silence, without any minister or prescribed order of service, allowing the inner light to guide their thoughts and actions. When a member feels moved by the Spirit, they may stand up and share a message, known as ministry, with the rest of the congregation. This style of worship emphasizes the importance of personal experiences and communion with God over institutionalized religious practices. In the years following George Fox's revelations, tens of thousands of people joined the Quaker movement, which spread from England to the rest of Europe, North America, and beyond. The movement faced significant opposition and persecution from both the state and established religious institutions, which saw the Quakers as a threat to their authority. Early Friends were often imprisoned, fined, or even executed for their beliefs and practices. Today, the Religious Society of Friends has an estimated global membership of around 400,000, with different branches adhering to somewhat varying beliefs and practices. However, the core principles established by George Fox, including the belief in the inner light, simplicity, pacifism, social justice, and equality, continue to guide and distinguish the Quaker faith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Many homes have cameras to protect them from danger. The cameras can tell the owners if someone has entered. But the cameras do not know whether the person is a family member, a friend, a postman or a criminal  . But a new camera made by a French company can recognize   faces. It can tell parents at work that their children have returned from school, or that the mail has been sent to their home. It can also tell them if a stranger has entered their home. When family members enter a home, the smart camera \\"recognizes\\" them and sends information to the owner's phone. The owner can choose to see the video then or later.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Yawning can be an easy way to generate saliva. Even if you aren’t feeling sleepy, try yawning a few times. You’d be surprised how strongly your body responds to the simple act by producing a bunch of spit. Always cover your mouth when yawning in public. You can still be polite when you’re trying to gleek. Most sour candies will stimulate your salivary glands and generate enough saliva to gleek. Get a pack of sour candies and throw some in your mouth. After sucking on them for a few seconds, you should have plenty of saliva. Too much sugar is bad for your teeth. Make sure that you clean your mouth out if you’re eating a lot of it. Water is an excellent way to stimulate your salivary glands. It also has the added benefit of being good for you! If you’re having trouble salivating, drink a little bit of water. You’d be surprised by how moist your mouth will feel. Form a small circle by pursing your lips together. It’s incredibly hard to breathe and gleek at the same time, so you’ll want to catch your breath before attempting to gleek. Take a deep breathe and relax your shoulders. A deep breath will give the salivary gland time to generate enough spit around the bottom of your tongue. To flex your tongue, tighten the muscles by pushing it upwards and outwards towards the roof of your mouth. Press your tongue in the area between your upper teeth and the skin on the roof of your mouth. When you're ready to gleek, make this motion in one action and as quickly as possible. Your tongue should stiffen as you flex it, and you’ll know that you’re doing it right if it feels rigid and stiff in your mouth. Open your mouth as wide as you comfortably can and extend your lower jaw away from you and towards your target. Flex the muscles in your tongue as hard as you can while doing this. With enough practice, you will naturally shoot out a stream of saliva from the gland beneath your tongue.  It may be tempting to try and purse your lips together, since that’s what most people do when they normally spit. This will block the gland at the bottom of your tongue though, so try to avoid doing it while you gleek. Keep your tongue locked to the roof of your mouth while you’re doing this.","output":"This article provides various techniques to stimulate saliva production for gleeking, such as yawning, using sour candies, drinking water, and practicing proper tongue and mouth positioning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who moved to London on completing his seven-year indenture? , can you please find it?   William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

This restaurant provided a truly unforgettable evening, offering a harmonious blend of excellent service, delectable cuisine, and a warm, inviting ambiance. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff, who escorted us to our reserved table, carefully situated in a cozy corner offering a stunning view of the city skyline. The interior decor was tastefully done, featuring contemporary art pieces that added a touch of elegance to the overall atmosphere. Soft instrumental music played in the background, enhancing the fine dining experience. The menu boasted a vast array of exquisite dishes, each with its own unique presentation and combination of flavors. We opted for their signature tasting menu that featured a variety of beautifully crafted appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The chef displayed true culinary artistry in each course, combining fresh, high-quality ingredients with innovative cooking techniques. The first course, a vibrant beet and goat cheese salad, was a delightful start to the meal. The sweetness of the beets, the creaminess of the goat cheese, and the crunch from the candied walnuts blended together perfectly, setting the tone for the remaining courses. Next, we were treated to a delicate, melt-in-your-mouth seared scallop dish, which was artfully placed atop a velvety cauliflower puree, with a drizzle of lemon-thyme vinaigrette that elevated the flavors to a whole new level. For our entrees, I had the pan-seared salmon, which was cooked to perfection and served with a refreshing mango-avocado salsa, while my husband enjoyed the succulent braised short ribs, accompanied by a silky potato gratin and a rich red wine reduction. Our daughter chose the house-made ricotta gnocchi, which was perfectly cooked and paired with a vibrant, robust tomato sauce that showcased the chef's expertise in balancing flavors. To conclude the meal, we shared a divine chocolate fondant, which paired a warm, gooey chocolate center with the slight crunch of the outer shell, accompanied by a velvety vanilla bean ice cream and garnished with fresh mixed berries. It was the perfect end to an exceptional dining experience. Throughout the evening, the waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely committed to ensuring our satisfaction. They flawlessly timed each course, provided excellent wine pairing suggestions, and even presented my husband with a complimentary glass of champagne to make his birthday celebration even more special. In conclusion, I cannot speak highly enough of The Gourmet Paradise. Our dining experience was one to remember, and we will undoubtedly return to explore more of their tantalizing culinary offerings. If you are looking for an exceptional meal, impeccable service, and a memorable evening, this restaurant is, without a doubt, the perfect choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What is Charlie Muffin's profession? Movie plot title: Charlie Muffin Movie plot: The Cold War espionage thriller follows the moves of British anti-hero spy Charlie Muffin (Hemmings) who has fallen on hard times since the forced retirement of Sir Archibald Willoughby, his previous boss at the U.K. secret service (played by Sir Ralph Richardson). His new boss, Sir Henry Cuthbertson (Ian Richardson), who epitomizes the haughty upper class British imperialist, hardly attempts to conceal his disdain for the under-educated agent who quite obviously doesn't stem from the \\"right class\\". Right at the start of the film, we witness how Charlie has evidently been deemed expendable and accordingly gets set up to be caught or killed during a joint mission in East Germany â this despite Muffin essentially having been responsible for the mission's success. Cuthbertson's lap-dog agents Snare and Harrison â who are both totally lacking in experience and as arrogant as their boss â are shocked and embarrassed to see Muffin returning alive and well. Once home in the UK, Muffin's humiliation doesn't end, as he gets demoted and put on leave, which he spends with his wife Edith (Linden), but not until after a hilarious take on the obligatory spy agentâsecretary-receptionist affair. Next, a classic yet utterly unpredictable spy story unfolds around British and U.S. attempts to facilitate a safe defection of high-ranking Soviet General Valery Kalenin (Braun). CIA Director Garson Ruttgers (Wanamaker) proves not much smarter and ultimately equally officious and presumptuous as his British counterpart, though in a distinctly â satirically â American way. After Harrison and Snare's spectacular downfalls at the task (one ends up dead trying to escape and the other captured), Ruttgers' aide Braley (Rimmer), a chubby, good-hearted but docile sideshow official, is assigned to join Muffin on a trip to Prague, to liaise with Kalenin. Will Kalenin's defection succeed? Will Charlie once again be set up? Will he be able to escape alive and well this time? It is not until the very last minutes of the film that we find out.

The race, which has been held annually since its inception in 1903 (except for during the World Wars), consists of several stages and covers a distance of approximately 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) throughout the country over a three-week period in July. Each edition of the Tour de France presents a unique route, with the race organizers crafting a challenging course that showcases the varied terrains and landscapes that can be found across France. The route often changes from year to year in terms of specific locations, although certain hallmark features of the race remain fairly consistent, including grueling mountain stages in the French Alps and Pyrenees, flat stages suited for sprinters, and time trials for individual riders to prove their speed and skill against the clock. In addition to its predominantly French setting, the Tour de France has been known to cross borders into neighboring countries such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, usually in the form of brief detours or stage starts and finishes. Including stops in these countries not only diversifies the race's geographical footprint but also increases its international appeal, allowing fans and spectators from outside France to experience a taste of the competition in their home nations. Despite the varied and changing nature of the Tour de France route, certain destinations have become emblematic of the race and regularly feature in its itinerary. Amongst these, the city of Paris is of the utmost importance, as it serves as the traditional end point for the race, with riders concluding their long journey by racing the final stage on the iconic Champs-Élysées. Other famous locales, such as the notoriously steep Mont Ventoux, the Col du Tourmalet, and the Alpe d'Huez, have become storied battlegrounds for individual stages, adding an element of historic significance and drama to the race. In summary, the Tour de France primarily takes place in France but occasionally includes segments in neighboring countries. Each year, the race follows a unique route, highlighting France's diverse terrain and landscape. Although certain features of the race remain consistent, such as the inclusion of mountain stages and time trials, the specific path taken by the riders varies, making each edition of the Tour de France a distinct and challenging contest."},{"instruction":"Question: If cells are the microscopic building bricks of organisms, then cells are the microscopic building bricks of what?

Answer:","output":"Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms are both examples of animated feature films, with a common underlying form of media being computer-generated imagery (CGI). These movies utilize cutting-edge technology and artistic techniques to create visually stunning and immersive experiences for their audiences. While both films belong to the animation genre, the specific aspects of their media characteristics, production techniques, and visual styles differ. In this answer, we will elaborate on the different aspects of the media shared by both films and their unique features. 1. Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI): Both Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms employ CGI to create their animations. CGI refers to the process of creating 3D images, objects, and environments using computer software and hardware. Unlike traditional animation methods, such as hand-drawn cel animation, CGI allows for more complex and realistic visuals, as well as smoother and more lifelike animations. As technology has advanced, CGI has become an increasingly popular form of animation media. 2. Digital 3D Animation: Due to their reliance on CGI, both films can be classified as examples of digital 3D animation. In 3D animation, objects and characters are modeled with three-dimensional properties, allowing for greater depth, detail, and complexity in the visual elements of the film. This is particularly evident in the highly realistic textures and lighting effects employed in both Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms. Digital 3D animation enables animators to manipulate the objects and environments within the film more easily, contributing to the fluidity and continuity of the animation. 3. Visual Styles: While both films employ CGI and digital 3D animation techniques, their visual styles differ significantly. Fantasia 2000, as a sequel to the iconic 1940 film Fantasia, showcases a blend of classical music and modern animation. The film consists of eight segments, each developed by a different team of animators and artists, resulting in a diverse array of visual styles. Some segments retain a more traditional, hand-drawn appearance, while others are entirely rendered using CGI. Regardless of the medium, the art direction emphasizes color, shape, and movement, aiming to create a visual interpretation of the accompanying classical music scores. On the other hand, Mars Needs Moms features a more consistent visual style throughout the film, primarily rooted in digital 3D animation. The film employs motion capture technology to translate the movements of live-action actors into realistic, lifelike animated characters. The overall art direction is focused on creating an immersive world, blending photorealism with a touch of stylization to form an engaging and visually appealing sci-fi environment. 4. Production Techniques: Both films showcase innovative production techniques specific to their respective visual styles. Fantasia 2000 employed a mix of both traditional and digital production methods, including hand-drawn animation, CGI, and digital ink and paint. In contrast, Mars Needs Moms relied heavily on motion-capture technology, in which live actors perform on a specially-designed stage and their actions are recorded and translated into digital animation. The production of this film involved the use of specialized cameras, sensors, and software to ensure accurate and smooth character movements. In conclusion, while Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms are both animated feature films that incorporate CGI and digital 3D animation techniques, they each showcase unique visual styles and production methods. The innovative use of technology and artistic techniques in these films highlights the evolving nature of the animation medium, exemplifying the artistic and technical advancements made within this popular and ever-growing form of media."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the paneling and the wallpapering and the and that kind of stuff are alike.\\" According to the premise, the paneling and wallpapering, as well as some other things (which remain unspecified), are alike. This implies that there are similarities between the paneling and wallpapering, along with the other unspecified elements.  Hypothesis: \\"Yeah, the paneling and wallpapering are alike.\\" This hypothesis reiterates that paneling and wallpapering are alike. It does not mention the other elements that the premise includes. Options: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no. Given the options, we need to establish whether it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Considering the premise states that the paneling and wallpapering are alike, along with other unspecified things, it shares a common idea with the hypothesis, which also claims that the paneling and wallpapering are alike. However, the hypothesis does not mention the other unspecified elements that are also alike according to the premise. Based on this analysis, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true in the sense that it aligns with the main idea presented and supported by the premise regarding the similarities between the paneling and wallpapering. However, it is worth noting that the hypothesis is slightly narrower in scope, focusing solely on the paneling and wallpapering rather than including other unspecified elements that the premise suggests are also alike. Therefore, given the available options, the best choice would be [I] yes, as the hypothesis is true when the premise is true. However, it is essential to keep in mind the limitations outlined and the difference in scope between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.  I am facing a new situation today: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the Bt toxin is in an active state, case A or case B? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, the Bt toxin is in an active state in case A - the transgenic crop. In case A, the crop plants have been genetically engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, the Bt toxin binds to the insect's gut wall, causing it to stop feeding and eventually die. This approach is considered more environmentally friendly because it directly targets the specific pests that feed on the crops, reducing the need for widespread insecticidal spraying. In contrast, in case B - the Bt toxin spray - the toxin is in an inactive state when applied. It requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. This means that the environment gets exposed to large amounts of the inactive Bt toxin, which may then impact a wider range of insects and other organisms once ingested and activated. Furthermore, the use of Bt toxin sprays may potentially contribute to the development of pesticide-resistant insects over time, as the toxin is broadly applied rather than specifically targeting the pests that feed on the crops. So, the correct answer is that the Bt toxin is in an active state in case A - the transgenic crop. Using transgenic crops expressing the Bt toxin directly is generally considered to be a safer and more targeted approach for managing pest populations and reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can use this background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.

On 17 March 2003, Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons and former Foreign Secretary, resigned from the Cabinet in protest against the coming war in Iraq. His resignation speech inspired the first long applause in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labor's most brilliant politicians.  For the previous two years, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of the life of Labor's second term, a diary that forms the center of the narrative . The Point of Departureis Robin Cook's plain account of this extraordinary period in our political history, the most important political publication of the decade. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to bring about some changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed was essential if Parliament was to move into the 21stcentury. As Tony Blair told him, \\"This is the job for you.\\"  Drawing on first-hand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences, and late night conversations, we follow his gathering disillusionment as the political compass of the government changes to directions which he believes to be completely mistaken: from its failure about Lords reform and its unwillingness to provide leadership for social change, to a foreign policy which has led us away from our responsibility in Europe, into closer relationship with the most right-wing government in American history, and participation in Bush's war on Iraq.  This is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is a story of a politician who truly wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly separated from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing belief that on Iraq, its position was morally, diplomatically and politically wrong.  Robin Cook first entered Parliament as MP for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He held a number of senior positions in Opposition -- Shadow Foreign Secretary, Shadow Health and Social Services Secretary -- before becoming Foreign Secretary in 1997.

Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there.

Identify the key information in the question: The question provides us information about invertebrates (animals that lack a vertebral column) and fish (backboned aquatic animals). 2. Analyze the given options: We need to figure out which statement best describes fish in contrast to invertebrates, keeping in mind what fish do NOT lack. Let's evaluate each option: - the body's largest organ: This statement is not related to the difference between fish and invertebrates. - furry hide: This is also not related to the main difference between the two groups of animals. - vertebral column: This could be the answer, as invertebrates lack this structure, and fish do not. - critical organs: Both groups of animals have critical organs, so this option is not relevant. - thumbs: This is not relevant to the difference between fish and invertebrates. - aqua lungs: This option is not pertinent to the main distinction. - salt and water: This statement is not directly related to the difference between fish and invertebrates. - Chlorophyll: This is a substance found in plants, not animals, so it's not relevant to the question. 3. Select the appropriate option: After evaluating all the options, the one that stands out is the \\"vertebral column\\" because fish are backboned aquatic animals and invertebrates lack a vertebral column. So the answer is: fish are aquatic animals that do not lack a vertebral column."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Bitter war widow Janet Ames seeks out the five soldiers for whom her husband gave his life by falling on a hand grenade during the Battle of the Bulge. While crossing a city street to find the first, she is struck and knocked unconscious by an automobile. The police find no identification on her, only a list of names. One recognizes the last name on her list, Smithfield \\"Smitty\\" Cobb, a reporter recently fired for alcoholism, and contacts Smitty. When Smitty sees the list, he realizes who she must be. He goes to see her at the hospital, and finds her in a wheelchair, unable to walk. As the doctor can find no physical reason for the paralysis, he schedules an appointment with a psychiatrist. Smitty decides to treat her himself. He introduces himself as a friend of her husband David (though not as one of the men he saved), and wheels her into a private room. She explains her mission: to see if any of the men were worth David's sacrifice, making it perfectly clear that she has already made up her mind. After a nurse gives her a sedative, Smitty accuses her of wallowing in self-pity, then tries to get Janet to change her mind by describing each of the men. He is so vivid that Janet can see and talk to them. The first man she interacts with is nightclub bouncer Joe Burton. He and his singer girlfriend Katie dream of building a house.

Now he is going to have his life and work commemorated  with special gold and silver coins. But does Twain need to be commemorated? It doesn't seem like people in the US will forget him. Twain once joked that a lack of money is the root of all evil \\" but a lack of money with Twain's famous face on it wouldn't have made people forget about him. The Adventures of Huckberry Finn is thought to be his greatest works. Motherless Huck Finn is a young boy who shows the spirit of freedom. But it could be said that Huck's freedom really comes from Huck wanting to fly. When Huck gets away from his violent  father, he isn't really looking for freedom,out survival. It's even more of a problem for a slave. Jim, the escaped  slave who Huck helps, makes Huck's life seem even better. It's easier not to be able to deal with someone who wants to force you to go to school than to have to fight a law that says you are a piece of property . Huck and Jim's friendship, as shown by Mark Twain, is one of the great stories in American literature because it shows a white character, Huck, who gets an idea of the African American experience. Mark Twain is famous and would still be famous without any special coins. Anyway, the coins could be a reason to look again at the work of a writer who got under the skin of the US in the 19th century.

Magazines and newspapers were filled with account of prospectors' adventures, and of battles with cattle thieves and other outlaws -- all the tales that were then news and have become legends since.

Answer the following question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older... According to the above context, answer the following question. What does the author believe a patient with new symptoms should do? pick from the following. (1). not enough information; (2). have an MRI test; (3). check their blood pressure; (4). have bloodwork done; Answer:","output":"(4). have bloodwork done; Based on the context provided in the article, the author believes that a patient with new symptoms should have bloodwork done, as it is helpful in evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults.

With Windows 8.1, a New Start That Looks Familiar Yes, Microsoft is bringing back some comforting hallmarks of its Windows operating system, including the Start menu. No, it is not chucking out the modern, touch-friendly, tile-based look of Windows 8, the new version of the software that has sent much of the PC industry, many pundits and some computer shoppers into a tizzy. That’s the short version of what’s coming in Windows 8.1, an update to Windows 8 that will be out by the end of the year. In one of the first demonstrations of the operating system to an outsider, Microsoft executives showed off a bevy of changes the company has made to the operating system, a number of which were in direct response to some of the more pointed criticisms the operating system received from users after coming out last fall. Hints from Microsoft in recent weeks about those changes, along with a slump in PC sales that analysts believe was worsened by Windows 8, have led to heated speculation that Microsoft was preparing to backpedal from the most radical changes it made in Windows 8. Not true, executives said. “This isn’t a U-turn at all,” said Antoine Leblond, corporate vice president of Windows program management. “We really believe in the direction we started on with Windows 8.” Indeed, Windows 8.1 looks virtually indistinguishable from Windows 8 in many respects. People who dislike its colorful mosaic of tiles will not find much in the new software to change their minds. That’s because it is unlikely, as a practical matter, that people will be able to entirely escape the tile-based interface in Windows 8.1, even though Microsoft is making it easier to avoid it. As expected, the new operating system will allow people to configure the software so that they start in desktop mode — the “classic” Windows interface with a taskbar at the bottom of the screen, a background image and applications with traditional menus — whenever they boot up their PCs. Microsoft didn’t allow this with Windows 8. Even if their destination was desktop mode, where Office and millions of legacy Windows applications run, Windows 8 users had to pass through the tile screen, an inconvenience to many. It’s noteworthy that Microsoft will still put users in the tile interface by default when they start up their machines. Microsoft is also reincarnating the Start button with Windows 8.1, though it won’t behave exactly like the Windows Start buttons of yore, the primary way Windows users found and launched applications for decades. There will be a Windows flag icon in the bottom left corner of the taskbar in the Windows 8.1 desktop. But clicking — or, if you have a touch device, tapping — the button will simply return you to the tile-based interface, from which you can launch apps. People can get to a more traditional looking menu of applications from the Start button, but they have to configure the system to do that. What these changes mean is that someone who makes the effort to reconfigure the operating system will be able to spend most of their time in the classic desktop interface. In practice, Microsoft will keep nudging them in the direction of the tile-based interface at every opportunity because it believes that is the future of Windows. The company thinks most devices are moving inexorably in the direction of touch screens, including laptop computers and desktops. The tile interface of Windows 8 and its successors is how the company is preparing for that future. If developers want to distribute applications through Microsoft’s app store for Windows, they have to write them so they run through the modern Windows interface. Even if a customer only wants the old-fashioned Windows, they will be bounced into the new interface anytime they launch Netflix and any other modern app. Over time, Microsoft believes users will become more comfortable in the modern interface. But it doesn’t want to rush them if they’re unready. “There’s an opportunity here to help people feel more oriented if they don’t feel oriented,” said Jensen Harris, partner director of program management at Microsoft. There are a variety of other changes in Windows 8.1 that are likely to receive less notice. People using Windows 8.1 in the modern interface will be able to have four different windows open at once, rather than two, which will make it easier for multitaskers to jump among different applications. A new built-in search function will automatically create a slick-looking mash-up of different types of data relevant to a search term, including songs, videos, photos and Wikipedia entries. The underlying bet Microsoft is making with Windows has not changed, though. Unlike Apple, which has one operating system for the iPad and one for computers, Microsoft believes the software that powers both types of devices should be the same. “The role of Windows is to unify that experience,” Mr. Leblond said. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Windows 8.1 is an update to Windows 8 that adds new features and addresses some criticisms of the software while maintaining the touch-friendly, tile-based interface. It reintroduces the Start button, offers a customizable desktop mode, and makes various other improvements, while continuing to push users toward the tile-based interface, which Microsoft believes is the future of Windows."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have been away from it for over twenty years, but I still go back in my dreams.\\" For Yep, whose father came from China, home was an apartment and the family grocery store in a neighborhood of San Francisco. It was there that he learned about patience, hard work, and getting along with neighbors.  Mr. Brown, Laurence Yep's high school English teacher, often set high goals for his students. He was the first person to encourage Yep to write. The experience of that class changed the direction of Yep's life. At the age of 18 Yep published his first short story, a sci-fi fantasy. He has since written many books and many kinds of books. He has retold Chinese folk stories and written for the theater. In nearly all these varied works, Yep, who is married to the children's book author Joanne Ryder, has returned to questions he has been asking himself since childhood: What does it mean to be Chinese and American? Can one who belongs to two cultures ever feel at home anywhere?  When asked, \\"How has being of a Chinese by origin been important to you?\\" Laurence Yep replied, \\"As a child I wanted to be as American as possible. Then, in my early twenties, I became very interested in my Chinese roots. For years after that, I thought that my function as a Chinese American writer was to act as a bridge between two cultures. Now, though, I am not so sure that it is possible to join them together. Compared with Asian culture, American culture pays more attention to individuals and competition. The two cultures pull in opposite directions. So I see myself now as someone who will always be on the border between two cultures. That works to my benefit as a writer because not quite fitting in helps me be a better observer.\\" 1. Where did Yep grow up? 2. Where did his father come from? 3.

He was greeted at the finish line by Nepal's Dachhiri Sherpa (No. 91) and gold medalist Dario Cologna of Switzerland (No. 95). Cologna finished nearly 30 minutes ahead of Carcelen, but returned to the finish to greet him. ||||| Originally published February 3, 2010 at 10:00 PM | Page modified February 3, 2010 at 11:32 PM      Comments (0) E-mail article Print Share      Roberto Carcelén, who now lives in Seattle, met his wife through an online-dating service and learned cross-country skiing only about five years ago. Yet he'll be in Vancouver, B.C., later this month as Peru's first and only Winter Olympian.      History starts with a love story.      It starts with a Peruvian man falling head over skis for an American woman in cyberspace. It starts with a connection, forged through instant messaging, that bridges the 5,000 miles between Lima, Peru, and Seattle. It starts with two people, so shy they were hesitant to e-mail pictures, pecking feverishly on their laptops five hours a day for five months and realizing they shared the same favorite books, the same beliefs about family and the same no-limit style of dreaming.      History starts with love at first byte.      \\"When you're chatting like that, at the end of the day, you fall in love with who the person really is,\\" Roberto Carcelén says.      \\"It sounds corny, but you kind of know when you've found that person,\\" Kate Carcelén says.      We might need Celine Dion, Enrique Iglesias and Whitney Houston to sing this ballad. Seldom does a corny ol' love story carry groundbreaking significance.      If he hadn't met his future wife seven years ago, Roberto Carcelén would not be on his way to Vancouver to make Olympic history. He would not be living in Seattle, or cross-country skiing, or scheduling an interview with NBC's \\"Today.\\" He would not be a pioneer, the first person from Peru to compete in the Winter Olympics.      We all could use his brand of destiny.      \\"It worked out well for us,\\" Carcelén said, grinning. \\"I hear a lot of people who date online, it didn't work out well for them. Lucky me.\\"      Olympians typically don't start skiing at age 34. Then again, you don't find The One on lavalife.com.      Carcelén always lives with the best intentions and, it seems, the best results. At first, he went online seven years ago because he planned to travel from Peru to California for a marathon and he wanted to meet active Americans. He found Kate Clement, saw parts of himself in her inviting personality and love for the outdoors, and he forgot about that marathon.      After all those instant-messaging sessions, they decided to meet in Miami in March 2003. Carcelén stayed in the United States for the next two months to be with Kate. He then returned to Lima, handed his printing business over to his family and moved to Seattle. The couple married that July.      About five years ago, Kate introduced Roberto to skiing. He loves surfing and running. In his 20s, he was an elite Peruvian surfer, but the water in Seattle is too cold for him. When Kate likened skiing to surfing on frozen water, Roberto became intrigued.      \\"It was hilarious at first,\\" said Roberto, who now is 39 and lives in Leschi. \\"I probably fell every 40 feet. People looked at me, laughed and said, 'Ah, it's your first time.' \\"      After a few months, though, he showed remarkable improvement. His technique remained poor, but he possessed an incredible will.      Kent Murdoch, a local skier who now helps coach Carcelén, remembers the Peruvian competing in a race four years ago. He was raw yet fascinating.      \\"He was doing the right motion, but it was not a very refined motion,\\" Murdoch recalled. \\"Most people who don't learn to ski as a child have a very difficult time as an adult. But his fitness level was really, really high. He kind of willed himself up hills.\\"      Even then, Carcelén had a crystallized vision: He wanted to represent Peru in the Winter Olympics. He watched the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy, on television and started envisioning history. Peru has mountains and snow, but children don't grow up snowboarding or bobsledding or skiing.      One problem, Carcelén said, is the snow is at too high of an elevation.      \\"It's pretty crazy up there,\\" he said. \\"I don't think cross-country skiing will work. That will kill you.\\"      Another problem: Carcelén believes Peruvians can be too laid back.      \\"We take a different approach to life,\\" he said. \\"We kind of like living life in a good way. With sports, we're not like other cultures. We like food, wine and partying. We have an active community, but we like all things.\\"      Four snowboarders from Peru were supposed to compete in the Games in Turin four years ago, but they failed to register for their events and could not participate.      Because his country had little experience with even Winter Olympics logistics, the challenge would be more than just an athletic one for Carcelén.      He and Kate have a 2-year-old daughter, Francesca. She doesn't fully comprehend what her father is about to do. She doesn't know she was born in the middle of an improbable quest that already has cost the family about 60,000. But whenever Francesca sees skiers on television, she's overcome with joy.      \\"Papa!\\" she exclaims.      Papa is the real deal now. He has gone from local act to international competitor. To qualify for the Olympics, he had to meet the standards of the International Ski Federation for the 15-kilometer freestyle event. He had to earn 300 points or less in five sanctioned races. The point system is calculated by how close a skier comes to the first-place finisher. Being within 25 percent earns 300 points. The closer you finish, the lower your score.      This Olympic bid took Carcelén to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the Czech Republic. He qualified two months ago at an event at Silver Star Mountain Resort in British Columbia. He didn't celebrate too much, however.      The day before that race, he found out his mother has an advanced form of liver cancer.      He barely could focus during the qualifying race. He had no energy. His dream, four years in the making, felt inconsequential. He earned his Olympic berth that day mostly because he didn't know what else to do.      \\"That was a big bomb for us,\\" Carcelén said. \\"My mom is one of my main supporters. Knowing she's been hit with a disease, it hits me, too. I couldn't take it. The only thing I could hold onto was that I wanted to make the Olympics to make her smile.\\"      Soon after the race, he flew home to Peru for a week. His mother is doing OK, he said. Just OK. She was hospitalized for a month and caught pneumonia twice. She's now undergoing her second round of chemotherapy.      Her struggles have reminded Carcelén that he's competing for more than himself, for more than his wife and daughter, for more than his entire family even.      This is for Peru.      His country is worth all those travel expenses. It's worth all those trips to Snoqualmie Pass. It's worth the extra day-care costs for Francesca and the price of equipment and the effort required to train four hours a day.      Carcelén, a marketing consultant who also owns a Peruvian company (Inca Runners) that gives running tours through the Andes for athletic tourists, isn't focused on the sacrifices. He's fixated on the dream.      \\"In Peru, 25 million people will see the benefit of this,\\" he said.      Kate Carcelén, a Microsoft manager who also travels often, fully supports her husband. She grew up loving the Olympics. She was hooked while watching Nadia Comaneci in the 1976 and 1980 Summer Games. Kate loves her husband because they have the same passion for a good challenge. She refused to stop her husband from chasing this one.      \\"There have been times when we've wondered, 'Oh, my God, can we deal with this?' \\" she said. \\"We always come back to, 'Of course.' \\"      Peru's first Winter Olympian helped design his uniform. Roberto Carcelén called Eddie Bauer and asked for help. He went over certain Olympic requirements, gave his input and left the rest to the Bellevue-based clothing company.      A 5-foot-8 wisp of an athlete, he grins when imagining how he'll look with \\"Peru\\" stitched on his clothes.      \\"I don't want to give away how it looks,\\" he said. \\"You'll see soon. It's very simple, but I like it. I have so much pride.\\"      His pride won't lead him to the medal stand, but that's not the goal, anyway. From amorous instant messenger to skiing novice to unlikely Olympian, his journey already has been lined with gold.      History starts with a love story.      On Thursday, Carcelén and Francesca will pick up Kate from the airport (she's been in Toyko on business) and drive three hours to Vancouver, B.C. In eight days, Peru's Winter Olympian will walk in the Opening Ceremony.      He hopes to carry the red-and-white Peruvian flag with one hand and his daughter with the other, the solitary Olympian, the leader of Team Roberto, the smitten pioneer.

Swine Flu Causes New Headache For Small Businesses Small business owners who weathered the first wave of swine flu last spring are dealing with the illness all over again, including issues like employee absences and staffers who are afraid of getting sick. \\"Outside of the Obama health care plan, it's the topic of the day\\" in conversations that Rob Wilson has with his small business clients. Wilson, president of Employco, a Chicago-based resources outsourcing company, said that with schools and colleges back in session and the disease spreading, \\"we're seeing it start to hit businesses now.\\" Even if owners don't already have staffers staying home because they or their children are sick, they need to figure out how the work will get done despite the flu. Owners should also think about prevention, whether that means making it easy for workers to get flu shots or keeping the workplace more sanitary. And they also need to be sure they keep employees' health matters private even if co-workers want to know who's got the flu. The federal government, which this week warned small companies to be prepared to work with fewer staffers this fall, has published \\"Planning for 2009 H1N1 Influenza: A Preparedness Guide for Small Business.\\" The guide is available online at http://www.flu.gov/professional/business/smallbiz.html. There is also information for businesses from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/business/toolkit/. The government and HR consultants say owners can take steps to help limit the spread of flu in the workplace. Keeping a supply of strategically placed hand sanitizers and tissues can help. Frequent cleaning of surfaces that many people come into contact with is also a good idea. Owners might want to take some cues from managers in the health care business. Jamie Anderson, vice president of health care for Constant Care Management, a Dallas-based operator of Alzheimer's assisted living facilities, said surfaces like handrails are being disinfected several times a day instead of once a day before the flu outbreak last spring. Companies should also give staffers time off to get flu shots, and pay for shots even if they don't provide health insurance. But employers should be aware that they generally cannot require an employee to get a shot. It is critical for companies to plan now for multiple employee absences. HR consultants recommend that owners be sure that staffers are able to substitute for one another when someone is out sick. \\"If you don't have employees cross-trained, you need to do so as quickly as possible\\" Wilson said. The spread of swine flu should also make owners think about allowing employees to telecommute. That's particularly important when an employee needs to stay home to care for a sick child. But an owner should not be asking someone who's sick to log in to work from home. Small businesses such as manufacturers and retailers can be hard hit because employees can't do the work from home. Owners may want to consider hiring temporary staffers to pitch in, and maybe hiring them for training days in advance so they'll be ready to work when called in. As a preventative measure, owners might want to consider staggering shifts if possible to limit the amount of contact employees have with each other, said Debra S. Squyres, a director at Trinet Group Inc., which also provides human resources outsourcing. Along that line, when there have been outbreaks of flu near Constant Care facilities, non-essential visitors such as marketing agency representatives have not been allowed in, Anderson said. Once they're sick, it's important for staffers to feel it's OK to stay home. A boss needs to be sure he or she doesn't do anything to pressure someone with the swine flu -- or any illness for that matter -- to come to work. To do so can be a violation of federal and state laws, and it's also a bad health practice. Even if the weak economy makes employees feel compelled to come in because of job insecurity or because fellow staffers are already stretched to the limit, an owner should be emphasizing: Stay home if you're sick. Another concern for many staffers is using up sick time. A worker with a week of sick leave annually and who already took time for the seasonal flu this year might be tempted to come in rather than lose pay. Under these circumstances, the answer might be for owners to be a little more liberal with sick time. \\"Traditional sick day policies might not address this scenario,\\" Squyres said. Companies that don't have written sick leave policies should be formulating them now. It's easy enough to do with a little research. Owners can talk to other employers in the area, see how much time off they grant workers and then formulate a policy of their own. Human resources consultants can also help. When a worker comes down with what appears to be the swine flu, other staffers may want to know whether the sick employee is indeed suffering from the disease. Owners need to know it's against federal laws, including the Americans with Disability Act, to reveal health information about any employee. They'll have to tell other staffers that they cannot discuss the matter. If you have managers, be sure they don't divulge any information either. \\"I would make sure that managers are trained to respond to these kinds of inquiries,\\" Squyres said. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of the text are: 1. Swine flu is causing new headaches for small businesses due to employee absences and fear of getting sick. 2. Business owners need to prepare for the possibility of staff staying home due to sickness, and plan for how work will get done despite this. 3. Prevention measures, including flu shots and maintaining a sanitary workplace, can help limit the spread of the flu. 4. The federal government has published a preparedness guide for small businesses dealing with H1N1 influenza, which can be found online. 5. Cross-training employees to ensure they can cover for each other during absences is crucial. 6. Allowing employees to telecommute, hiring temporary staff, and staggering shifts can help mitigate the impact of swine flu on businesses. 7. Ensuring staff feel comfortable staying home when sick and being flexible with sick leave policies can also help prevent the spread of the flu in the workplace. 8. Owners must respect staff's privacy and avoid disclosing health information about employees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

En revanche, l’Union européenne protège le droit des particuliers à acheter des marchandises, telles que la bière, le vin et les véhicules, dans un autre État membre et à les importer dans celui où ils résident sans devoir payer de droits supplémentaires à la frontière, à condition que ces marchandises soient destinées à des amis, à la famille ou à une vente à but non lucratif. Translate to English.","output":"On the other hand, the European Union protects the right of individuals to purchase goods, such as beer, wine, and vehicles, in another Member State and to import them into their country of residence without having to pay additional duties at the border, provided that these goods are intended for friends, family, or non-profit sales. In this statement, the focus is on the European Union's policy of protecting the rights of individuals when it comes to purchasing goods across different Member States. It highlights that people are allowed to buy items like beer, wine, and vehicles in one country and bring them into their home country without incurring additional fees or taxes at the border. This policy is in place to promote the free movement of goods within the EU and to support the idea of a single market. By ensuring that individuals aren't penalized for purchasing goods across borders, the EU is encouraging trade and cooperation amongst its members. This can lead to increased economic growth and a stronger, more unified, European Union. However, there are certain conditions attached to this policy. The goods purchased must be intended for personal use or for the benefit of friends and family, and not for resale at a profit. This is an important distinction, as it prevents businesses and individuals from exploiting the system for financial gain. For example, if someone purchases a large quantity of wine in France and imports it into their home country of Germany with the intent to sell it for a profit, they would be violating the policy and could face penalties. However, if they were bringing the wine back to share with friends and family, or to donate to a non-profit organization, they would be within their rights and wouldn't face any additional fees. Additionally, it's important to note that there are still some taxes and duties that individuals may need to pay on certain goods, regardless of their intent. For instance, vehicles imported into a new country may be subject to registration fees and other costs associated with owning a vehicle in that country. Individuals should always research and understand the specific regulations and requirements in place for the goods they wish to import. In conclusion, the European Union policy mentioned in the statement aims to facilitate the free movement of goods and improve cooperation among its Member States by allowing individuals to purchase certain goods in different EU countries without incurring extra charges at the border. This policy ultimately contributes to the objective of a single, unified European market, and supports cooperation, trade, and economic growth within the European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When you consider what subject to study in college, chances are that you and your parents will think about what you can make out of _ after graduation. You will likely ask the question: \\"Can I find a well-paid job or simply a job with a degree in this in the future?\\" This consideration also influences students when they come to choose between studying science or humanities   at college. People generally believe that the humanities, which include literature ,  history, cultural studies and philosophy,  do not prepare students for a specific vocation  . Science subjects, however, are considered vocational courses that produce scientists, engineers and economists  . \\"I've decided to take finance as my college major. My parents and I think this subject will help me get a good job or start a business,\\" said Huachen Yueru, 17, a science student at Wuxi No. 1 High School. Even those who choose a liberal arts   education often pick the humanities subject which they think will best help them later find a job. \\"I'm going to study Spanish in college, which I believe will open doors to a high-paying job for me,\\" said Liu Chao, 18, a Senior 2 student at Dalian No 20 High School. He said few of his classmates show interest in subjects like philosophy and history, which are seen as \\"less promising\\" in job markets. The popularity of liberal arts subjects among college students has also been decreasing in the United States. American scholars   and universities are concerned that in the ongoing economic crisis   liberal arts subjects will be hit hardest. As money tightens  , they worry that the humanities may become \\"a great luxury   that many cannot afford\\", according to the New York Times. Question: Why do students show little interest in the subjects, like philosophy or history ? Options: A: Because they are not interested in them. B: Because they think these subjects are useless. C: Because they see these subjects as less-promising in job market. D: Because they like the science subjects. Answer:","output":"C: Because they see these subjects as less-promising in job market. The article highlights that students, when choosing their college subjects, tend to prioritize their future job prospects and financial stability. As a result, they often lean towards subjects that are considered more vocational, such as science, which can directly lead to careers in fields like engineering, economics, and research. On the other hand, humanities subjects like philosophy and history are seen as less promising in job markets, since they do not prepare students for a specific vocation. The decision-making process also seems to involve input from parents who share the same concerns for their children's future prospects. For example, Huachen Yueru and his family decided to choose finance as a college major, as they believed it would provide a better chance for a well-paid job or starting a business. Similarly, students who still choose subjects within the realm of humanities tend to focus on ones that they believe will have better job opportunities and pay, like Spanish in the case of Liu Chao. The decreasing popularity of liberal arts subjects in the United States also reflects this trend, as American scholars and universities fear that economic constraints might make the humanities a luxury that people cannot afford. So, it can be inferred that students show little interest in subjects like philosophy or history because they perceive these subjects as less-promising in the job market, which plays a significant role in their choice of college major."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Peter Allen. PUBLISHED:. 11:28 EST, 25 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 11:29 EST, 25 November 2012. The search for an aristocratic Frenchman who is believed to have murdered his wife and four children in cold blood has returned to the isolated countryside where he was last seen. Police are preparing to visit underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, where Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011. He fled his home in Nantes, western France, a few days earlier after neighbours reported not having seen any of the family for more than three weeks. Suspect: Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, 51, may be hiding in caves near where the family lived. Right, wife Agnes, 49, was found dead at their home along with her four children and two pet dogs. Detectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of Mr De Ligonnes's wife and four children, as well as the family's two pet Labradors. Agnes, 49, and children Tomas, 21, Arthur, 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, had all been blasted to death as they slept before their bodies were meticulously buried in a clear attempt to conceal them from police. De Ligonnes originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations. In emails uncovered earlier this year he revealed that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to 'the masses'. 'I think I've got a superiority complex, you could call it that,' he wrote. 'But it's based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health. Such people are rare compared to the masses.' Grim: An agent carries a body out of the family's home in 2011. Investigation: Police found a severed leg under the garden terrace, which led to the discovery of the bodies. Recalling his strict, devout childhood, De Ligonnes added: 'All my adolescence was devoted to religion and faith, under the influence of my grandmother and mother. 'To such an extent that I did not rebel like other adolescents, nor indulge in drugs or run after girls.' De Ligonnes was last seen on April 15 2011 when he left a budget hotel at Roquebrune-sur-Argens in the Var region on France's Mediterranean coast, abandoning his car there. He was wearing a backpack as he strolled through a car park into the surrounding countryside, and was picked up by a CCTV camera. An extensive search was carried out in the area between April and June 2011 and - acting on new information - police now intend to resume it. 'We won't be going back to the area already searched, but will be probing places which are difficult to access, including isolated hiking trails,' said a judicial source. Caves and mines around near Roquebrune will be examined, as well as near Draguignan and Lorgues - both town where the De Ligonnes family lived in the late 1980s and 90s. Tragic: Anne Dupont, 16, and eldest  Arthur, 18, were killed by gunfire. Shot: Tomas, 21, and youngest child Benoit, 13, had also been killed and their bodies put in a freshly-dug grave. There is a theory that De Ligonnes may have committed suicide in the days after the slaughter, in which case police will be searching for remains of his body. However, prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility that De Ligonnes is still living rough, or else is being hidden by members of his extended family, who own country homes around France. De Ligonnes's ancestors, who included the 19th Century poet Lamartine, originally lived in a southern province of France called the Rouergue. Five months before the murders, De Ligonnes said he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and started target practice at a Nantes shooting club. Receipts found in his house also reveal that he bought a silencer, as well as a spade, a two-wheel trolley, chalk lime, and other equipment which could have been used to bury the bodies. It also emerged that De Ligonnes, who ran a number of internet businesses, had severe financial difficulties. Among those he had been asking for money was a mistress in Paris.

In 1613 Hanyakrakusuma  rose to the throne of Mataram. He began the eastward conquest by an incursion towards Surabaya's southern flank, the Eastern Salient, Malang, and possibly Pasuruan in 1614. Surabayan forces attacked this Mataram army during its homeward march, but was defeated. In 1615 Agung conquered Wirasaba, personally leading the troops there. Surabaya did not commit its troops to help Wirasaba, due to the fear that its other ally, Tuban, would take advantage, betray Surabaya, and attack it from the rear. The conquest of the strategically important Wirasaba posed such a clear threat to Surabaya and other eastern states that the alliance rallied. They mobilized their troops and marched towards Pajang, a city under Mataram's control but ostensibly on the verge of rebellion. However, a Mataram spy in Tuban deceived the allied forces into taking a bad route towards Pajang. As a result, the allied army found itself isolated in Siwalan, near Pajang. This army was surrounded by Sultan Agung and defeated in January 1616. Agung then won victories in Lasem  and Pasuruan . In 1617 Pajang finally rebelled against Mataram but was defeated, and the lord of Pajang fled to Surabaya. In 1619 Agung conquered Tuban, one of the strongest members of Surabaya's alliance. This conquest put Agung in control of Tuban's shipbuilding activities, and therefore allowed him to build a navy to challenge Surabaya's previous naval supremacy. Based on the above article, answer a question. Which city did the army find itself in after being tricked by Tuban, Siwalan or Pajang?","output":"Based on the article, after being deceived by a Mataram spy in Tuban, the allied army found themselves isolated in the city of Siwalan, near Pajang. They were subsequently surrounded by Sultan Agung and defeated in January 1616. So, the correct answer is Siwalan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But Graham Kitchener replied for Tigers with Donncha O'Callaghan in the sin-bin, before the Worcester lock was red carded minutes into the second half. Home duo Gareth Milasinovich and Matt Cox were also sin-binned as Tigers capitalised through Telusa Veainu, a penalty try and Lachlan McCaffrey. Worcester, previously unbeaten at home this season, looked dangerous from the off and opened up a 17-0 lead within 22 minutes. Heathcote kicked an early penalty and then added two conversions as Olivier collected the fly-half's pass following a Worcester scrum to score under the posts before Cox dived between the sticks. But Leicester put Warriors on the back foot and with O'Callaghan sent to the sin-bin for an offside offence, former Worcester forward Kitchener barged through just minutes before the break. Worcester, who played the first half with the wind, were down to 14 men soon after the restart when O'Callaghan received a second yellow for bringing down the Leicester maul. Milasinovich came on to make his Premiership debut but was binned shortly after and Tigers made their men advantage count as Veainu dived over in the corner. Heathcote and Owen Williams then exchanged penalties before referee Wayne Barnes awarded Leicester a penalty try, with the conversion putting them in front for the first time. Worcester ended the match with 13 men as Cox was also sin-binned, allowing Leicester to sneak a crucial fourth try though McCaffrey. And Williams' conversion ensured Worcester also missed out on a losing bonus point as Leicester moved up to second in the Premiership table.

To do that, we can add 30 to both sides of our equation: 0 + 30 = 6 * n - 30 + 30 This simplifies to: 30 = 6 * n Now, we need to figure out what number we have to multiply by 6 to get 30.

This statement specifically mentions the color of White's eyes (blue). While it does mention White looking at the speaker, the critical difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the inclusion of eye color in the hypothesis. Given the options to choose from: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no Let's analyze each option: (a) Asserting \\"yes\\" would mean that it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. However, we cannot draw this conclusion as the color of White's eyes is not mentioned in the premise. (b) Choosing \\"it is not possible to tell\\" indicates that we cannot draw a specific conclusion about the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the premise. This is the most appropriate choice since the premise does not provide enough information to verify or disprove the eye color mentioned in the hypothesis. (c) Saying \\"no\\" would mean that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must be false. However, this cannot be concluded because the premise does not contradict the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the premise given, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true.

After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation.

They visited a sports physician for a checkup. 3. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation. Inflammation is the body's response to injury, usually characterized by redness, swelling, pain, and sometimes loss of function. Blood vessels dilate near the injured area during inflammation to increase blood flow, which helps deliver essential nutrients and immune cells to the site of injury for repair and healing. Since John has inflammation, his blood vessels would be dilated near the wound to aid in healing. On the other hand, Keith does not have inflammation, so his blood vessels would not be dilated.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How many years later did Judy and Peter move into the house? 26 years later The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Echoes of Time: A House Reborn\\" Plot Summary: Judy and Peter, a married couple in their 40s, move into a mysterious, yet charming Victorian-style house, 26 years after a tragic event took place within its walls. Upon their arrival, they discover that there is more to this house than meets the eye. As they slowly uncover the enigmatic history hidden inside the house, they embark on an emotional journey that brings them face-to-face with the long lost spirits that had been unable to find peace. Plot: Act 1: A New Beginning In 1995, a tragedy struck the Ellis family that resided in the stunning Victorian house - Allerdale Mansion. A house fire left no survivors, and it was left abandoned for 26 years. Flash forward to 2021 - Judy and Peter, tired of their hectic city lives, decide to move to the quiet town of Mapleton to escape the routine and build a different, more tranquil life. They find the perfect home: Allerdale Mansion, an architectural gem that had been on the market for quite some time. When they first see the house, they feel an inexplicable connection with it. Despite the encroaching vines enveloping the house and garden, they can see the potential of the space and are eager to restore the residence to its former glory. Act 2: The House Comes Alive As they renovate the house, peculiar things start to happen: objects move by themselves, inexplicable cold breezes appear, and echoes of laughter can be heard in the empty rooms. Gradually, they realize they are not alone - they are surrounded by the spirits of the Ellis family, who perished in the devastating fire. Initially frightened, Judy and Peter come to realize that the spirits mean no harm. As they learn more about the family through diaries, letters, and other hidden treasures found during renovation, they begin to sympathize with the ghosts, particularly with Lucy, a teenage girl who nurtured dreams of becoming a ballet dancer, and her younger brother, Tim, who reveled in painting portraits of the nature he so fervently adored. Act 3: Mending the Past Compelled to help the spirits find peace, Judy and Peter seek to unravel the truth behind the tragic house fire. They meet the town's older residents, one of which - Evelyn, a wise lady in her 80s - shares her memories and sheds light on the family's relationships and events leading up to the fire. Secrets of betrayal, anger, and loss are revealed as the couple is faced with an astonishing truth - the house fire was not an accident. Determined to make things right, Judy and Peter gather enough evidence to reopen the 26-year-old case. As the investigation moves forward, they help challenge past misconceptions, mend long-standing rifts, and reveal the indispensable role of forgiveness in rebuilding relationships, both with others and oneself. Act 4: Resolution and Departures With the truth about the family and tragic events revealed in court, the Ellis family's spirits, including Lucy and Tim, finally find peace and are ready to move on. Judy and Peter, now emotionally connected with these souls, feel a deep sense of gratification as they watch the spirits depart, their emotional ties to the world resolved. In honor of the Ellis family, they decide to open a community center for arts and cultural development within the house. The once empty and neglected mansion is now vibrant and filled with laughter, music, and creativity. Epilogue: The movie ends with Judy and Peter standing in front of the now-bustling community center, realizing they have not only transformed the house but have grown and evolved as a couple. In helping the spirits find peace, they too have rediscovered themselves and nurtured their own emotional connections. As the sun sets, we see them entering the house, where life is now teeming with love, art, and renewed beginnings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If you've cycled a hill before, you'll already know that it hurts physically and takes a lot of effort. If you've long been the sort to hop off the bike and walk it up the hill, you'll need a little mental prepping first!  Accept that riding uphill is more effort.","output":"Embrace the challenge ahead and acknowledge that the extra exertion required will be worthwhile in the end, as it allows you to progressively improve your fitness, cycling skills, and overall confidence on the bike. Visualize successfully conquering the steep hill and feel a sense of accomplishment, even before you start pedaling. Use positive self-talk and remind yourself that you are fully capable of tackling the uphill climb; believe in your abilities and mental fortitude to push through the physical demands of the task at hand. To prepare physically, it is essential to optimize your bike setup and gear selection. Start by ensuring that your bicycle is well-maintained and properly fitted to your body. Make any necessary adjustments to the saddle, handlebars, pedals, and frame to feel comfortable and maintain a good ergonomic posture while cycling. Choose an appropriate gear ratio for the terrain, typically a lower gear for ascending steep hills as it allows for more manageable pedaling cadence and reduced strain on leg muscles. Familiarize yourself with the functionalities of your bike's gear shifting system so that you can efficiently switch gears as needed. While climbing steep hills, maintain a steady and controlled cadence by focusing on even, rhythmic pedal strokes. This prevents muscle fatigue from inefficient use of energy and provides a consistent power output throughout the ascent. Balance your body weight distribution on the bike, with a slight pressure on the front handlebars to ensure traction and maintain stability. Leaning too far back can result in a loss of grip and control, especially on uneven or loose surfaces. Breathing is another crucial aspect to consider while cycling uphill. Focus on deep, controlled breaths that fully fill your lungs with oxygen, and exhale completely to expel carbon dioxide. This enhances oxygen delivery to the muscles and helps prevent build-up of lactic acid, which can cause cramping and soreness. Staying relaxed and composed, despite the physical effort required, can also improve your overall performance. Additionally, monitor your energy levels and pace yourself appropriately throughout the climb. It is important not to expend too much energy on the initial part of the hill, as you may need to conserve some for any further inclines or the remainder of your cycling route. Also, consider fueling your body with nutrient-rich foods that provide the necessary energy for the task ahead, hydrate adequately, and incorporate regular rest intervals if needed. Lastly, incorporate hill-focused training into your cycling routine to develop physical and mental endurance over time. This involves regularly cycling on different types of inclines, gradually increasing the steepness and difficulty of the hills you tackle. Also, experiment with approaches such as interval training, hill repeats, and group rides to further solidify your climbing skills and build camaraderie with fellow cyclists. By diligently preparing mentally and physically, optimizing your bike setup and gear selection, maintaining proper form and technique, focusing on breathing, pacing yourself, and incorporating hill climbing into your regular training routine, you will ultimately feel more confident and capable of tackling even the steepest hills while cycling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Updated Jul 17, 2013 3:55 PM ET FIFA President Sepp Blatter plans to ask the governing body's executive committee to consider moving the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the winter in order to avoid the searing summer heat. ''If this World Cup is to become a party for the people, you can't play football in the summer,'' Blatter said Wednesday. ''You can cool down the stadiums but you can't cool down the whole country.'' Despite health concerns included in an official report before the vote, the FIFA executive committee opted for the tiny emirate's bid in 2010. Blatter has repeatedly refused to say if he backed Qatar, which can have temperatures of 50 degrees C (122 degrees F) during the summer. In May, Blatter said in an interview with a French newspaper it would be ''not rational and reasonable'' to stage the first World Cup in the Middle East in the summertime. Moving the tournament to the winter would have a major impact on the schedule of European football leagues, which would have to change things for at least one season. ''There is still enough time,'' Blatter said. ''I will bring this up to the executive committee.'' Air-conditioned stadiums to beat the heat were a defining theme of Qatar's bid, but the cooling technology only resolves the problem in venues for players, fans and officials. ''We have to protect our partners, our commercial partners, our TV partners. We have to be tough on this,'' said Blatter, who spoke during a two-day conference on sports, media and economy set up by German great Franz Beckenbauer in Austria. The head of the local organizing committee, Hassan Al-Thawadi, said Qatar bid for a tournament in the summer but left the option open of a possible switch to another time of the year. ''It there is a wish from the football community to move the World Cup to the winter, we are open for it,'' said Al-Thawadi, who spoke to the conference through a live video connection.

(CNN) -- English club Chelsea have completed the signing of Oriol Romeu from Spanish and European champions Barcelona. The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid 5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option. Jeffren joined Barca from Tenerife in 2004 and made his debut for the Catalan club in the 2006-07 season.

After leaving Sheffield, Mary was transferred from her new Gaoler Sir Ralph Sadler to Wingfield Manor in Derbyshire and then to Tutbury. In this sentence, the sequence of events is different: - Mary leaves Sheffield - Mary is transferred from her new Gaoler, Sir Ralph Sadler - Mary is taken to Wingfield Manor in Derbyshire - Mary is then taken to Tutbury Primary differences between these two sentences are: - In the first sentence, Mary starts her journey from Wingfield Manor, whereas in the second sentence, she begins her journey in Sheffield. - In the first sentence, Sir Ralph Sadler takes Mary to Sheffield. In contrast, the second sentence implies that Mary was transferred from Sir Ralph Sadler after leaving Sheffield. - In the first sentence, Mary goes from Wingfield Manor to Sheffield and then to Tutbury. In the second sentence, she goes from Sheffield to Wingfield Manor and then to Tutbury. Both sequences end in Tutbury, but the journey in between is different. As a result, these two sentences do not have the same meaning and describe distinct sequences of events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Process: - An egg is laid by a mother bird - A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized - The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg - The baby bird is unable to fly to get food - The mother bird must feed the baby bird food - The bird grows stronger and grows wings - The bird is able to fly - The bird is able to leave the nest and find food - The bird is able to reproduce.  Question: suppose safe environment for mother bird happens, how will it affect mother bird dies.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In a safe environment for the mother bird, there are increased chances of her survival during the process of laying eggs, incubating, and raising her offspring. However, if the mother bird dies in this supposed safe environment, the effects on the baby bird and the overall process will still be significant despite the favorable conditions. When a mother bird dies, the baby bird's survival depends on several factors. Here, we will analyze the effects and their magnitude on the second effect mentioned, which is \\"The baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized.\\" 1. More effect: During the incubation period, if the mother bird dies, the loss of warmth, protection, and humidity provided by the mother may have a more significant effect on the developing baby bird. In this crucial stage, the absence of the mother's care could lead to inadequate development or even death of the embryo. This result means a more substantial effect on the second effect mentioned: the formation of a baby bird within the fertilized egg. 2. Less effect: If the mother bird's death occurs close to the hatching time, the baby bird may still be able to hatch successfully. In this scenario, other birds or even an attentive sibling may take over the responsibility of breaking the eggshell, leading to minimal impact on the baby bird forming within the fertilized egg. However, the impact of the mother bird's absence on the subsequent development stages will still be considerable. With no mother to feed and protect the baby bird, its chances of survival decrease significantly. This situation might lead to a less effect on the second effect mentioned in terms of forming the baby bird, but the overall process will be affected negatively. 3. No effect: In rare instances, the death of the mother bird may have no effect on the formation of the baby bird within the fertilized egg if the environment is safe and all necessary conditions for successful development are met. For example, if the temperature and humidity in the environment are ideal, the egg might not require the mother bird's incubation, leading to the embryo's healthy development. However, it is essential to note that this scenario is improbable and unlikely in most cases. In conclusion, the death of the mother bird in a supposed safe environment will generally have a more significant effect on the second effect mentioned (\\"The baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized\\") due to the essential role the mother plays during the incubation and development stages. Although the extent of the impact may vary depending on the specific stage of development and the surrounding conditions, it is undeniable that the mother bird's death will significantly influence the overall process."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive?

But she had a lot of curiosity, which kept her going. She sought many wise people to help her understand why she was so bad that her mother hurt her and why she was unable to be better so that men wouldn't hurt her.

Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions.  For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor  or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home. Question: Why do some parents feel it difficult to spare quality time for their kids? Options: A: Their kids are growing so fast. B: They have too much housework. C: Their kids are losing interest in them. D: They are tired out after work. The answer to this question is:","output":"D: They are tired out after work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Iain Cameron, from Stirling, spends his spare time monitoring snow levels in Scotland from one winter to the next, and has spent the past 22 years travelling the country in pursuit of his curious hobby. While walking on Scotland's highest mountain with fellow amateur researcher Alistair Todd in July, the pair happened upon an unusual natural phenomenon - a snow tunnel. \\"They are caused by water which burrows through the snow drift initially, creating a little tunnel,\\" Mr Cameron said. \\"Then wind begins to blow through the space and starts to expand the tunnel. \\"They begin as a couple of feet wide and get larger as the warmer air begins to eat away at the snow and melt it.\\" He added: \\"The further into summer we get, the bigger the tunnels get. You're eventually able to walk through them, like I did in these photographs.\\" The tunnels are not a new discovery, but Mr Cameron said they only occur in specific areas where snow lasts into the summer months. He said: \\"There are very few places in Scotland you get these tunnels, but they tend to form in the same places pretty much every year and at the same time.\\" \\"We don't actively look for the tunnels, they're just a bonus.\\" Despite Mr Cameron's snow-exploring experience, he still gets a little anxious. \\"It's very weird to think that there are hundreds or even thousands of tons of snow above your head. It can be quite disconcerting but we're very sensible and take precautions,\\" he said. \\"It's a surreal experience, being inside the tunnels. Some of them are completely jaw-dropping.\\" He plans to return to Ben Nevis in August when he said he expected the tunnels to be \\"even bigger and better\\". As summer turns to autumn, the tunnels continue to expand before finally collapsing. Mr Cameron said: \\"After August, the tunnels will eventually become 'bridges' as they continue to expand. The snow is being melted from below, by the wind, and also from above, from the sunlight. \\"The snow gets thinner and thinner and eventually collapses, and melts.\\" When snowfall begins again later in the year, the cycle is reborn. Mr Cameron's research involves monitoring patches of snow across the country, taking pictures and measuring them. His findings are then put into reports which are published by the Royal Meteorological Society. Last year, he recorded the most surviving patches of snow in more than 20 years, but Mr Cameron insists he is no expert. \\"I do this in my own time - I have a day job.

These tunnels are formed by water burrowing through snow drifts, and later expand as wind blows through the space. As the warmer air melts the snow, tunnels grow in size and can even be walked through during the summer months.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the better-known name of the person who sang lead vocals on \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\"? , can you please find it?   Sir Richard Starkey  (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US.

Review: The events of the 11th of September 2001 cast its shadow on this Oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy extravaganza that we\`d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing . Entertainment was more or less curtailed to a LOTR send up with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and that was it . The rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and I have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we\`ve seen over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric David Letterman from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of 9/11 was haunting and dignified  As for the awards New Zealand was absolutely robbed . FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four minor awards while A BEAUTIFUL MIND undeservingly picked up most of the major prizes except for best actor which should have gone to a tough guy New Zealander but went to an An all American nice guy instead .

If the rock melts completely, it will cool to become an igneous rock.   Choices:  - carbohydrates  - grains  - fossils  - minerals   A: Answer:","output":"Metamorphism, as mentioned in the paragraph, is a process that causes changes in rocks due to heat or pressure, but it does not cause a rock to melt completely. If a rock were to melt entirely, it would cool and solidify, ultimately becoming an igneous rock. Metamorphism, instead, influences the transformation of the minerals within the rock. From the given options: 1. Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are organic compounds consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen that serve as an energy source for living organisms. They have no relevance to the process of metamorphism or changes in rocks. 2. Grains: While grains might refer to the small components or structure of a rock, the term is not specific enough to describe the changes that occur during metamorphism. 3. Fossils: Fossils are the preserved remains or impressions of ancient organisms, typically found in sedimentary rocks. Although they can be affected by the metamorphic process, the indicated transformation in the paragraph is primarily concerned with the mineral composition of the rocks, not the fossils present. 4. Minerals: Minerals are the essential components of rocks, composed of specific chemical compositions and defined crystal structures. They are responsible for the rock's properties and can undergo changes during metamorphism. The minerals present in the rock change their composition, arrangement, and physical properties when subjected to heat, pressure, or chemically reactive fluids, resulting in a new metamorphic rock with different characteristics.

Some perfumes are under 20 dollars while others cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Before you go shopping, decide how much money you want to spend on a perfume. If the perfume is a gift, consider both your personal finances and your relationship with the recipient of the gift. If you are giving perfume to your wife, you may want to spend more than you would on perfume for an acquaintance you don't know very well. Perfumes have different names depending on their lasting power. Typically, the most expensive perfumes are the ones that last longest, while cheaper perfumes don't have as much staying power. You can usually see the type or concentration of the perfume under its name on the front of the bottle.  Eau de cologne has the lowest fragrance concentration, lasting about two hours. It is 3-5% oil in a mixture of water and alcohol. Eau de toilette is a slightly more concentrated type of perfume and will last three to four hours. It is a about 4-8% oil. Eau de parfum has a higher oil concentration than eau de cologne and lasts around six hours. It is 15-18% oil mixed with alcohol. The perfume with the highest concentration is simply called perfume or parfum. It has great staying power and will last all day. It is 15-30 oil mixed with alcohol. Consider which scents you or the perfume recipient enjoy. Perfumes generally are separated into four scent categories, though many perfumes contain a subtle mix of scents. If you are buying perfume for someone else, see what kinds of perfumes they use. If you have no idea what kind of scents you like, don't worry: you can figure out what scent family you prefer when you are trying perfumes in the store.  Floral/Sweet perfumes smell like freshly-cut flowers. Common scents used in floral perfumes are rose, lavender, carnation and orange blossom. Floral perfumes are the most popular perfumes for women because of their sweet, feminine scent that most enjoy. Citrus/Fruity perfumes smell like fruits, particularly citrus fruits. Common tones are citrus fruits like orange, grapefruit and lime, but also other fruit like apricot, apple or peach. In general these scents are bright and refreshing. Oriental/Spicy perfumes smell musky and complex. Many of them contain tones of spices like star anise, cinnamon and vanilla. Woody/Chypre perfumes smell woody and earthy. Many contain scents like bergamot, oakmoss and patchouli. Be conscious of the scents people around you are wearing, no matter if you're at work, on the train or in class. If you catch a whiff of something you really like, ask the wearer what kind of perfume it is. You never know, you could find your new scent without even stepping into a store. If you don't like the scent of your friends' perfumes, try to pinpoint what about them you don't like. This is valuable information that will help you narrow down your options.","output":"Perfumes are special things that smell nice, and they can cost a little bit of money or a lot of money. Some perfumes stay smelly for a long time and others only smell for a little while. There are different kinds of perfumes, like ones that smell like flowers, ones that smell like fruits, ones that have a strong, spicy smell, or ones that smell like trees and dirt. If you want to buy a perfume for someone or for yourself, you can think about how much money you want to spend and what kinds of smells you like.

There will be no strikes over Easter; planned strikes could still be avoided. Unite says BA plans will damage customer service and brand. BA said union proposals would save the airline less money than its own changes.","output":"Title: British Airways Faces Strikes in March: Impact and Possibility of Resolution Introduction The British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) has announced two separate strike periods for their members working for British Airways (BA). The first strike is set to last three days, commencing on March 20, followed by a second strike lasting four days, starting on March 27. These strikes arise from a dispute between the pilots' union, Unite, and British Airways over planned changes that the union says will damage customer service and harm the airline's brand. Fortunately, no strikes are planned during the Easter holidays, and there is still hope for a resolution before the industrial action takes place. Strikes and Their Duration The first strike is scheduled to begin on March 20 and last for three consecutive days, ending on March 22. Following a brief respite, the second strike is planned to start on March 27 and continue for four days, ending on March 30. Both strikes are aimed at exerting pressure on British Airways to reconsider their proposed changes. Impact on Easter Plans Travelers can breathe a sigh of relief as no strikes have been planned over the Easter holidays. The union is aware of the potential disruption that could be caused to millions of passengers and has deliberately avoided planning any industrial action during this busy period.  However, passengers scheduled to travel during the announced strike periods should be prepared for potential disruptions, including flight cancellations and delays. Unite's Concerns over BA's Plans Unite has expressed concerns that British Airways' plans to cut costs and change working conditions could damage the quality of customer service and tarnish the airline's reputation. The union argues that the proposed changes put too much emphasis on cost-saving, at the expense of maintaining BA's brand value and high standards. BA's Response and Alternative Proposals In response, British Airways has maintained that the proposals put forth by the union would not save the airline as much money as its own plans. The airline is facing financial pressures due to increased competition in the industry and the rising costs of fuel. As a result, BA believes that the cost-saving measures it has proposed are necessary to remain competitive in the market. Possibility of Avoiding Strikes While the strike action is currently scheduled to take place, there is still potential for negotiations to prevent the industrial action. Both parties are urged to come together and seek a mutually agreeable solution in order to avoid further disruption to passengers and harm to British Airways' business. Conclusion As British Airways faces two separate strike actions in March due to ongoing disputes with the pilot's union, Unite, the risk of disruption to passengers remains high. With the potential impact on customer service and reputation, it is crucial for both parties to engage in meaningful negotiations and reach a resolution before the strike action takes place. In the meantime, passengers traveling during the strike periods should stay informed of any developments and potential changes to their plans."},{"instruction":"Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What nationality was the presenter who fronted the second series of Hair ?

The given scenario only mentions there being eight drag racers competing on a curvy track with helmets on, and the presence of a line of trees around the edge of the course.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Both men get tagged “moderate,” but for different reasons. Mr. Romney is a technocrat, a business leader who focuses on getting the job done. As governor, that meant governing in a way that suited Massachusetts. Today the job is winning the presidency, and if that means “evolving” in his views as the primary electorate swings further right, and running away from his signature accomplishment as governor, so be it.      You’d think that even if they don’t like it, those on the extremes would respect the fact that those of us in the sensible center decide general elections — and seek out a candidate who appeals to us. But the unhealthy demand for ideological purity obscures a hopeful fact about the GOP presidential field: There are actually two sensible, experienced grownups. And while Mr. Romney is far more appealing than any of the other choices, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is more principled, has a far more impressive resume and offers a significantly more important message.      AFTER MONTHS of flirting with candidates who considered inexperience an asset, obstinance and vitriol a virtue and extremism — even flakiness — a job requirement, Republican voters seem to be settling down. Increasingly, they are rallying around a grownup who has impressive experience as a chief executive, in and out of government, and a history of making things work rather than pursuing ideological fetishes. Yet nearly two-thirds of Republican primary voters still reject Mitt Romney, and his opponents are convinced they can raise that number by screaming: “Moderate! Moderate! Moderate!”      Mr. Huntsman is a true conservative, with a record and platform of bold economic reform straight out of the free-market bible, but he’s a realist, whose goal is likewise to get things done. Under his leadership, Utah led the nation in job creation, and the Pew Center on the States ranked it the best-managed state in the nation.      He also is head and shoulders above the field on foreign policy. He served as President George H.W. Bush’s U.S. ambassador to Singapore and President George W. Bush’s deputy U.S. trade representative and U.S. trade ambassador, and the next entry on that resume is even more impressive: He was a popular and successful governor in an extremely conservative state, well positioned to become a leading 2012 presidential contender, when Mr. Obama asked him to serve in arguably our nation’s most important diplomatic post, U.S. ambassador to China. It could be political suicide, but he didn’t hesitate. As he told our editorial board: “When the president asks you to serve, you serve.”      We don’t agree with all of Mr. Huntsman’s positions; for but one example, he championed one of the nation’s biggest private-school voucher programs. And with George Will calling him the most conservative candidate and The Wall Street Journal editorial page endorsing his tax plan, independent voters might find less to like about his positions than, say, Mr. Romney’s or Newt Gingrich’s.      What makes him attractive are the essential values that drive his candidacy: honor and old-fashioned decency and pragmatism. As he made clear Wednesday to a room packed full of USC students on the first stop of his “Country First” tour, his goal is to rebuild trust in government, and that means abandoning the invective and reestablishing the political center.      Don’t expect him to engage in meaningless hyperbole or apologize for his occasional moderate positions. As he explained recently: “We have to draw from ideas that are doable and not so outlandishly stupid that they create a lot of political infighting and finger-pointing and never, ever in a thousand years are going to get done.” And don’t expect him to spout ridiculous superlatives about the existential threat the incumbent poses to our nation; President Obama simply has failed to lead or has led in the wrong direction, he argues.      Why on earth would we want a candidate to say anything worse about his opponent? Explain why he’s wrong, and why you’re right, and let the voters choose.      We need a president who can work within our poisonous political environment to solve our nation’s problems, not simply score partisan points. Someone who understands that negotiation is essential in a representative democracy, and that there are good ideas across the political spectrum. Someone who has a well-defined set of core values but is not so rigid that he ignores new information and new conditions. Someone who has shown himself to be honest and trustworthy. And competent. Someone whose positions are well-reasoned and based on the world as it is rather than as he pretends it to be. Someone with the temperament and judgment and experience to be taken seriously as the commander in chief and leader of the free world.      We think Mr. Romney could demonstrate those characteristics. Mr. Huntsman already does. And we are proud to endorse him for the Republican nomination for president of the United States. ||||| MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - Jon Huntsman will aim to give Mitt Romney a boost going into the final week before the South Carolina primary, endorsing his one-time rival in the hopes of helping him clinch the nomination.      The former Utah governor's announcement - set for 11 a.m. Monday in a speech at the Convention Center here - comes after several days of discussion within the campaign about the consequences of splitting moderate voters with Romney in Saturday's vote. Resigned to the fact that Huntsman wouldn't win, they believed that their votes would be better used helping Romney hold off his conservative challengers and wrap up the primary race early.      Text Size -      +      reset      But those conservative challengers greeted the Huntsman news with a shrug.      \\"Moderates are backing moderates,\\" Rick Santorum said at a diner in Columbia Monday. \\"That's sort of the bottom line. No surprise there. Gov. Huntsman ran as a moderate, trying to compete for Gov. Romney for the establishment moderate vote. And Gov. Romney had a leg up on him being a solid moderate that the establishment could get behind. Gov. Huntsman wasn't able to crack through that. So I'm not surprised by that all, and I anticipated that actually sooner than today.\\"      Newt Gingrich said he believed Huntsman’s exit helps him.      “It narrows down the field and I think the next five or six days are going to tell the tale,” Gingrich told POLITICO Monday morning. “If the conservatives consolidate, it’s clear that I’ll beat Romney.”      Gingrich warned against conservatives splitting the vote.      “The next five days are going to be wild. Really, the test here is really simple: if the conservatives consolidate, Romney loses decisively. If they don’t consolidate, it’s going to be very close,” Gingrich said.      Huntsman's decision to drop out comes less than a week after he claimed victory from his third-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, the contest he'd staked his candidacy on ever since entering the race last summer. Huntsman experienced a surge of support in the closing days before that vote, but he still fell well short of Ron Paul - and even further behind Romney, whom he'd sniped at in the closing days.      A source said that Huntsman's rationale for now backing Romney, who he has criticized for weeks on the campaign trail as lacking a \\"core,\\" is that he didn't want to block the person best prepared in the field to beat Obama, and then to lead the country and grapple with the economy.      \\"Jon Huntsman is proud of the campaign he ran and the message of restoring trust in Washington,\\" said a campaign official familiar with his thinking. \\"He didn't want to stand in the way of the candidate most likely to beat Barack Obama and turn the economy around. That's Mitt Romney.\\"      Although Huntsman was only polling at about 5 percent in South Carolina, his voters are most likely to wind up with Romney.

It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., in the United States. On the other hand, \\"International Organization\\" in the given context refers to a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the field of international affairs. It is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International Organization Foundation. So, while both ICSID and the International Organization journal are related to global affairs and cooperation, they serve different purposes and functions.

Question: What does Benjamin ask the widower? Movie title: The Secret in Their Eyes Movie plot: (Note: in this summary, last names describe the characters in the fictionalized novel of the 1970's history of law enforcement officer BenjamÃ­n \\"EspÃ³sito\\", first names describe the people in retiree \\"Benjamin\\" EspÃ³sito's modern world.) Retiree BenjamÃ­n EspÃ³sito is having trouble getting started on his first novel. He pays a visit to the offices of Judge Irene MenÃ©ndez Hastings to tell her about his plans to recount the story of the Liliana Coloto case, the one they both worked on 25 years before, when Irene was his new department chief and he was the federal agent assigned to the case. Irene suggests that Benjamin start at the beginning. The beginning marks the discovery of Coloto's body, raped and murdered in her home in 1974. EspÃ³sito promises her widower, Ricardo Morales, that the killer will do life for his crime. Morales states that he opposes the death penalty. EspÃ³sito's investigation is joined by his alcoholic friend and assistant, Pablo Sandoval, and the Cornell Law School-educated Hastings. Before the three can start, their rival, Romano, tries to show them up by having officers beat a confession out of two innocent laborers, who had been working near the couple's apartment. EspÃ³sito has the confessions overturned and lashes out at Romano in a justice building hall. EspÃ³sito threatens to file a complaint as Romano racially insults the construction workers. Back on the case, EspÃ³sito notices that pictures from Coloto's home town of Chivilcoy frequently show a man named Isidoro GÃ³mez whose eyes never leave her. Although Irene is skeptical, BenjamÃ­n insists all of a young man's feeling for a woman is spoken there. Seeing that GÃ³mez has disappeared, EspÃ³sito and Sandoval travel to Chivilcoy and sneak into GÃ³mez's mother's house, where they find his letters to her. Sandoval steals them but they contain nothing useful and, when their supervising judge learns of the illegal action, the case is closed.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Krishnan Nair (25 July 1939 - 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name Jayan, was an Indian film actor, naval officer, stunt performer and cultural icon of the 1970s. He starred in over 120 Malayalam films. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his macho image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing stunts of a dangerous nature on his own. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan's screen persona in Kerala and his old movie scenes came to prominence again. It was owed mostly to programs by popular mimicry stage artists in the State, whose imitations of the star's mannerisms caught on and soon became commonplace in college stage events, television programs and mimicry stage shows along with quotes of superhuman strength known as Jayan quotes. However, it has been pointed out that many grotesquely imitated screen dialogues of Jayan are not actually his, but that of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for many of his characters after his death.  The \\"comeback\\" of Jayan and his renewed popularity lately may be taken as an affirmation that Jayan has not been replaced even nearly three decades after his death. Today, Jayan is best remembered as the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, so far, besides his trademark colourful attire, risky stunts, machismo mannerisms and unique speaking style. He has rightly won immortality in the hearts of the Malayalam film fans as a martyr in his yearning to thrill and entertain them even by putting his life at stake. Madhu, a famous actor prominent in the 1960s, once stated in an interview: \\"Jayan will forever be young and alive. No one can ever visualise him as an old man.\\"  A film titled Avatharam presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies. A documentary on Jayan's life and death Jayan - The Man behind the Legend is nearing completion for release in the near future. Where is he most popular?","output":"Jayan is most popular in Kerala, a state in India, where his screen persona experienced a resurgence in the late 1990s and early 21st century.

All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s.

Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west. Residents of Sydney are known as \\"Sydneysiders\\". Sydney is the second official seat and second official residence of the Governor-General of Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia and many federal ministries maintain substantial presences in Sydney.  - Neville Kenneth Wran, (11 October 1926  20 April 2014) was the Premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1986.

Now, I know you understand the difference between good behavior and bad behavior, right? So these girls behaved very badly. They hurt someone, and that person sadly died.  Imagine if someone took away your favorite toy and smashed it. You’d feel sad and upset, right? Now, think about how much more it hurts when someone hurts a person instead of a toy. It's a lot, lot worse, isn't it? The woman they hurt was vulnerable. Like how a baby bird is vulnerable because it can't fly or find its own food yet. This woman needed help from other people for various things. But instead of helping her, these girls chose to hurt her. It’s very important to remember, though, that hurting others is never okay. Because they did something really, really bad, the girls were taken to a place called a court, where some people decide what happens to those who break the rules. Have you ever been put in time-out when you’ve misbehaved? This is like a very serious version of a time-out for grown-ups.  The court decided that these girls must spend a long, long time in a place called prison, away from their families, friends, and all the fun things they love doing. This is because what they did was extremely wrong. The court said they must stay in prison for at least 15 years.  Think about how old you are now. That's three times your lifetime! This is a big punishment, but it matches the very big mistake they made.  Remember, behaving badly can lead to serious consequences. It's always important to be kind, gentle, and helpful to everyone around you. If you see someone who is vulnerable, like that baby bird, or like the woman in our story, do the right thing. Help them.

Test sentence: \\"I weighed the package.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, the test sentence \\"I weighed the package\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. To further analyze and explain why this sentence is grammatically correct, let's break down its structure and individual components. 1. Subject: \\"I\\" - The subject of the sentence refers to the person performing the action, which in this case is the speaker themselves. Using the pronoun \\"I\\" is appropriate here as it denotes the speaker or writer of the sentence. 2. Verb: \\"weighed\\" - The verb in the sentence is \\"weighed,\\" which indicates the action being taken by the subject. \\"Weighed\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to weigh,\\" implying that the action of weighing the package has already occurred. The usage of the past tense verb is grammatically correct in this context, as it matches with the subject \\"I.\\" 3. Object: \\"the package\\" - The object of the sentence is the entity that receives the action of the verb, which in this case is \\"the package.\\" \\"The\\" is an article that is used to identify a specific object, while \\"package\\" serves as the noun that is the receiver of the action. In combination, \\"the package\\" is a grammatically correct and appropriate object for this sentence. Putting all these components together, you have the sentence \\"I weighed the package,\\" which follows standard English grammatical rules. The subject, verb, and object are all clearly identified and appropriately used in their respective roles to convey the meaning of the sentence. The sentence is also both coherent and concise, making it an effective and clear example of proper English grammar and syntax."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"A man passing by a group along a cobblestone road.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is walking.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, based on the scenario described in the initial sentence - \\"A man passing by a group along a cobblestone road.\\" - the statement \\"A man is walking.\\" can be considered true. Though the original sentence does not explicitly state the mode of the man's movement, the phrase \\"passing by\\" typically implies walking or moving in some form, particularly in the context of a cobblestone road. If the man was in a vehicle or on a bicycle, a different expression, such as \\"driving by\\" or \\"riding by,\\" might've been used to more accurately portray the scene. Overall, the action of \\"passing by\\" inherently includes some form of locomotion. In our everyday life, when we say someone is \\"passing by\\" something or someone, we usually understand it as that person is moving or walking past. More often than not, it is linked to pedestrian movement.  However, it is important to remember that while \\"walking\\" can be understood from the phrase \\"passing by,\\" the actual form of motion isn't specified in the sentence. The man could also be running or jogging, for instance. Despite these possible variations, it's generally safe to infer that the man is walking, especially given a cobblestone road's context which can make running or jogging less probable due to its uneven surface.  In terms of the verb tense used in the sentence, while the first sentence is in the present continuous tense, the latter is in the present simple tense. The use of the continuous tense in the first sentence conveys the action's ongoing nature, while the simple present in the second sentence speaks of a general action or habit. Thus, although the two sentences use different tenses, they both accurately describe actions an individual could take under the given circumstances. In conclusion, even though the original sentence does not explicitly indicate the man's mode of movement, the expression \\"passing by\\" coupled with the setting of a cobblestone road suggests that it's logical and correct to deduce that \\"A man is walking.\\" Considering the verb tenses used in both sentences, we can confirm that they both depict plausible actions or habits of the man."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What parts of Chinese culture were brought into Japanese society?\\" is \\"Literature\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right! Chinese culture was brought into Japanese society through Buddhism, and it included many things like literature, religion, history, music, and painting. So, literature is one of the parts of Chinese culture that were introduced to Japan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

After a while, people became attached to one brand and sales leveled off(stage of maturity). Sales went into a slight decrease when freeze-dried coffees were introduced(stage of decline). The importance of the product life cycle to marketers is this: Different stages in the product life cycle call for different strategies. The goal is to extend product life so that sales and profits do not drop. One strategy is called market modification. It means that marketing managers look for new users and market sections. Did you know, for example, that the backpacks that so many students carry today were originally designed for the soldiers? Market modification also means searching for increased usage among present customers or going for a different market, such as senior citizens. A marketer may re-position the product to appeal to new market sections. Another product extension strategy is called product modification. It involves changing product quality, features, or style to attract new users or more usage from present users. American auto manufacturers are using quality improvement as one way to regain world markets.

To provide a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the context and the outcomes of the first EU-Brazil Summit, it is important to discuss the backstory and the shared goals both political entities hold. The EU and Brazil have a longstanding history of cooperation and partnership, focusing on various aspects such as trade, investment, environment, human rights, and security. The first EU-Brazil Summit, held on July 4th, 2007, in Lisbon, represented a major step forward in strengthening this partnership by establishing a broader and more strategic dialogue between the two entities. The EU and Brazil recognize each other’s importance on the global stage, with Brazil being one of the major emerging economies and the EU holding a significant role in trade and international cooperation. The summit aimed to create a dialogue that allowed for the discussion of various topics, including the following: 1. Economic and Trade Relations: Enhancing bilateral trade and investments, promoting market access, and fostering business exchanges to create growth opportunities and support sustainable development. 2. Political Affairs: Engaging in open dialogue to address critical global challenges such as peace and security, good governance, and the rule of law, and collaborating on matters of common interest, including conflict resolution, disarmament, and fight against terrorism and organized crime. 3.

Question: \\"The people who beat Demetrius were from Epirus and where?\\"  Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The people who defeated Demetrius were from Epirus and Thrace. In the given context, it is mentioned that Demetrius, who had taken control of the Macedonian throne and conquered a significant portion of central Greece, was defeated in 288 BC. This defeat occurred when two powerful and strategic rulers invaded Macedon from two different directions. These rulers were Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus. Lysimachus, originally a bodyguard of Alexander the Great, became the ruler of Thrace after the division of Alexander's empire among his generals. Thrace, situated in the southeastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, had a significant strategic position in governing the areas around it. Lysimachus sought to expand his power and territory, eyeing Macedon as an opportunity to do so. On the other hand, Pyrrhus of Epirus, a skilled and ambitious military leader who later became known for his phrase \\"Pyrrhic victory,\\" ruled the region of Epirus in northwestern Greece. Pyrrhus had a claim to the Macedonian throne through his distant relationship with the royal family of Macedon, and he sought to assert his influence over the region. Seeing the weakening state of Demetrius' control over Macedon, both Lysimachus and Pyrrhus seized the opportunity to invade the kingdom from their respective regions – Thrace and Epirus. Their coordinated invasion proved to be successful, as both leaders managed to defeat Demetrius and divide the Macedonian kingdom between them. In summary, the people who ultimately defeated Demetrius and led to his loss of control over the Macedonian kingdom were from two distinct regions – Epirus and Thrace. The invasion from both these fronts was orchestrated by two ambitious rulers, Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose combined efforts destabilized Demetrius' rule and allowed them to carve up the Macedonian kingdom for themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - atlantic ocean - bikini bottom - japanese restaurant - store - pacific ocean A:","output":"Jellyfish are marine creatures, meaning that they are typically found in the Earth's oceans, including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. To stay warm, these invertebrates generally prefer areas with milder temperatures, which could vary depending on the specific species of jellyfish in question. While both the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean contain regions with warmer waters, such as those in proximity to tropical or subtropical climates, the exact location where the jellyfish stays warm would be determined by its preferred temperature range. The Atlantic Ocean stretches from the Arctic in the north to the Antarctic in the south, making it the second-largest ocean in the world. It encompasses a variety of water temperatures, ranging from bitterly cold waters near the poles to warmer waters along equatorial regions. The Gulf Stream, a powerful wind-driven ocean current, is renowned for bringing warmer waters from the Gulf of Mexico up the east coast of North America and across the Atlantic. As such, certain jellyfish species may gravitate towards the Atlantic's warmer waters to stay warm. Similarly, the Pacific Ocean, the largest and deepest ocean on Earth, contains a wide range of water temperatures due to its vast geographical reach. One can find tropical and subtropical waters in the western Pacific, particularly in the area known as the Coral Triangle, which includes the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands. The area's warm temperatures could potentially provide a suitable habitat for jellyfish seeking warmth. Considering the other options presented:  - Bikini Bottom is a fictional place in the popular animated television series, SpongeBob SquarePants. While this underwater location may harbor an assortment of sea creatures, including jellyfish, it is not an actual, real-world location where jellyfish would gather to stay warm. - Japanese restaurants may serve dishes containing jellyfish as a culinary ingredient, but these establishments do not offer suitable habitats for living jellyfish to reside and maintain warmth. - A store is an incredibly unlikely location for a jellyfish to stay warm, as it is an indoor, terrestrial environment and generally devoid of the saltwater habitats necessary for jellyfish survival. In conclusion, among the given options, the most reasonable locations for jellyfish to stay warm would be the warmer regions of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The specific area would depend on the jellyfish species' preferred temperature range, as well as factors involving water quality, food sources, and other environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With chemical B the water becomes much warmer.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Given the changes in temperature, does chemical A cause an exothermic process or an endothermic process?  Hint: Some materials have negative heats of solution; the dissolution of one of these solutes in water is an exothermic process. Heat is released, causing a net increase in the temperature of the solution. Conversely, other substances have positive heats of solution. For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder.

Teacher:In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: find the number of rows in airports table whose country equals John F Kennedy International Airport Student:","output":"To solve this problem, we will write an SQL query that returns the number of rows in the airports table where the country of the airports matches the country of John F Kennedy International Airport.  Here's the SQL statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM airports WHERE country = (     SELECT country     FROM airports     WHERE name = 'John F Kennedy International Airport' ); \`\`\` In this query, we first find the country of John F Kennedy International Airport using a subquery within the WHERE clause.

(CNN) Paul Stam and Candis Cox are on opposite sides of the debate over a controversial new transgender law that's turning national attention toward North Carolina. To Stam, a Republican state lawmaker who sponsored the measure, it's a necessary step that stops anyone from getting special rights and one city from dictating policies that should be decided by the state. To Cox, a transgender woman and advocate, it's a dangerous and discriminatory measure that puts her and tens of thousands of others at risk. In separate interviews with CNN's Nick Valencia on Sunday, Stam and Cox shared their thoughts on a number of issues raised by the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which puts in place a statewide policy that bans individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex.GOP lawmaker Paul Stam: This law is about protecting privacy, not discriminationTransgender advocate Candis Cox: This is no different than the South's Jim Crow laws   Questions:Stam: \\"For 180 years, _ has had the constitutional public policy that issues of labor and trade would be decided on a statewide basis instead of locally.

Monica  will cope with intense situation with panic.","output":"In an emergency, you can rely on Maria but not Monica, as Monica will cope with intense situations with panic. This distinguishes the two individuals in their approach to handling crises, with Maria demonstrating calm and collected behavior, while Monica succumbs to anxiety and worry. Maria's ability to remain level-headed under pressure is critical in emergency situations as it enables her to think clearly, analyze the problem, and make timely, well-informed decisions without becoming overwhelmed or incapacitated by fear. On the other hand, Monica's inclination to panic amplifies the severity of the situation. Her inability to cope effectively with intense situations can lead to detrimental outcomes for her and those around her. Panic can cloud one's judgement, reduce efficiency, and create additional stress for the involved parties, ultimately exacerbating the emergency or heightening the potential risks. Furthermore, when a person panics in an emergency, they can unintentionally undermine the efforts of those who are keeping calm and trying to find a solution. As a result, it is crucial for individuals to manage their emotions and reactions during emergencies, so they can contribute positively to the resolution of the problem. In conclusion, between Maria and Monica, it is preferable to count on Maria during emergencies as she exercises composure and rational thinking, while Monica has a tendency to panic in intense situations, potentially aggravating the crisis at hand. By relying on those who can remain calm during emergencies, we can increase the likelihood of efficiently navigating through challenging circumstances and achieving successful outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In early September Amanda was released from her conservatorship and moved out of her parents' house. She now lives in an apartment in Orange County. Once she started living on her own, that's when things started to go 'haywire,' according to a source. The arrest is causing a legal problem because Bynes is on probation for a  reckless conviction from last February. A tough time: The 28-year-old She's The Man actress had a difficult phase in 2012 and 2013; here she was spotted in September 2012. The Sydney White actress was taking fashion design classes at the Fashion Institute Of Design And Merchandising in Irvine, California, earlier this year and seemed to be in good health. Amanda's legal troubles began in March 2012 when she was pulled over and ticketed by police for talking on a cell phone while driving. One month later the Family Guy star was arrested and charged with driving a DUI after side-swiping a police car in West Hollywood. Then in September the Thousand Oaks native was charged for two alleged hit and run incidents, one occurring in April and the other in August. The charges were dismissed three months later, however. A worrying time: At her worst, the Easy A actress shared Twitter photos where she wore wigs and had a cheek piercing, which she did here. Her DUI charged was also dropped in February 2014 but she was placed on probation. When she moved to New York City in 2013 the Hairspray star started displaying some odd behavior. In May she was arrested at her apartment for criminal possession of marijuana, attempted tampering with evidence, and reckless endangerment. She was also accused of throwing a bong out the window of her dwelling which was located on the 36th floor. A much-loved TV icon: The star at the 2011 MTV Movie Awards; she's had a big following thanks to her small-screen hits The Amanda Bynes Show and What I Like About You. Behind the wheel: Before the Family Guy star's legal troubles in 2009. She seemed to be on the road to recovery: Things reportedly went sour in early September when the Love Wrecked star moved out from her parents' home in Thousand Oaks and into an apartment in Orange County; here she is seen in March. The Maxim cover girl then went under psychiatric evaluation and eventually (June 2014) the case was dismissed. Things got worse when she returned to LA. In July 2013 she was detained after trying to set fire to a neighbor's driveway. Bynes was then put on a 5150 mental health evaluation hold and her parents filed a conservatorship. Treatment at a Malibu facility followed. 'Amanda currently is on zero medication,' her attorney Tamar Arminak said in a statement to UsWeekly in April. 'She's devoted to living her life as healthy as possible. Her family is closely involved with her day-to-day life, but they try to give her as much autonomy as possible.'

The California Highway Patrol confirmed that the 28-year-old star was cited for driving under the influence of a controlled substance while behind the wheel of her Mercedes-Benz. She was later released on a bail of 15,000. Amanda Bynes has struggled with legal issues and erratic behavior in recent years, including multiple DUI charges and a conservatorship arranged by her parents. After being released from conservatorship in early September, Bynes moved out of her parents' house and into an apartment in Orange County. Sources suggest her behavior became more erratic after she started living on her own. Bynes' recent arrest has created a legal problem for her, as she is already on probation for a reckless driving conviction from February. The actress was last seen in public in June. Amanda Bynes' legal troubles began in 2012 when she was ticketed for talking on a cell phone while driving. Her issues escalated with numerous run-ins with the law, including charges for hit-and-runs, DUIs, and various drug-related offenses. Bynes attempted mental health treatment in 2013, and her family worked to support her as she tried to establish a healthier lifestyle. Bynes' recent arrest for DUI on October 23rd has raised concerns about her well-being and the ongoing challenges she faces in maintaining a stable lifestyle. Despite earlier attempts at treatment and her family's efforts to help her, Bynes' latest arrest is a concerning development in her ongoing legal and personal struggles."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: What committees are joint committees I found the following answer on Google: A Joint Committee is a term in politics that is used to refer to a committee made up of members of both chambers of a bicameral legislature. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, that is a correct answer. Joint committees are indeed formed by members from both chambers of a bicameral legislature, typically including the lower house (like the House of Representatives in the United States) and the upper house (like the Senate). These committees serve various purposes, such as providing oversight, conducting investigations, developing policies, or recommending legislation. They provide a platform for the members of both houses to collaborate and address issues of common interest. In the United States Congress, there are currently four joint committees: 1. Joint Committee on Printing: This committee oversees the functions of the Government Publishing Office and addresses the various printing needs of the federal government. They supervise matters relating to the production, distribution, and management of government documents, including printing, binding, and digitization. 2. Joint Committee on Taxation: This committee is responsible for the analysis and review of the tax-related legislation in Congress. They assist in estimating the revenue impacts, suggesting modifications to the tax code, and offering recommendations on tax policy. The Joint Committee on Taxation consists of members from the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. 3. Joint Economic Committee: Established in 1946, this committee is tasked with reviewing matters relating to the country's economic performance and offering recommendations to improve the economy. They analyze issues such as employment, income, interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. The Joint Economic Committee is composed of members from both the House and Senate Committees on Finance. 4. Joint Committee on the Library: This committee is responsible for managing and supervising the Library of Congress, a research library serving the needs of the U.S. Congress. They also oversee matters pertaining to Congressional art, monuments, and other similar items. The Library is responsible for preserving national collections and providing access to vast research resources. These joint committees enable members of both chambers to coordinate their efforts and provide a framework for effective policymaking. By fostering cooperation and collaboration, joint committees contribute to a more efficient and comprehensive legislative process."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said.

Betty was afraid of the dark, while Sarah was not, so","output":"Betty was afraid of the dark, while Sarah was not, so when the two friends found themselves confronted with the prospect of navigating through the dimly lit, unfamiliar terrain of the dense woods that lay between them and their destination, it quickly became apparent that they would have to rely on their individual strengths and work together in order to safely traverse the shadowy, ominous landscape. As the sun dipped lower in the sky and twilight began to settle, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Betty felt a creeping sense of unease that she tried to quell, while Sarah exuded an air of confidence and bravado that seemed to combat the encroaching darkness. Sarah, recognizing Betty's apprehension, took it upon herself to be the guiding light both literally and figuratively for her friend as they embarked on their journey. Sarah reached into her backpack and pulled out a high-powered flashlight, which she handed to Betty with an encouraging smile, telling her that together they could face any challenges the night might have in store. The heavyset flashlight was a reassuring weight in Betty's hand, and as she flicked on the powerful beam, she felt a new determination surge within her. Slowly, they ventured onward, with Betty shining the flashlight ahead to illuminate the path before them, while Sarah kept her eyes and ears tuned to the fading light and the whispers of nocturnal creatures stirring in the underbrush. Sarah's experience in navigating through dimly lit spaces and her fearlessness in the face of danger proved invaluable, as she confidently gave directions, warned of impending branches or tree roots, and offered words of encouragement and support to her friend all the while. For her part, despite her fear, Betty remained a steadfast companion, doing her best to project her own courage and force herself to adapt to the darkness that enveloped them. As the two trekked deeper into the woods, their conversation danced between childhood memories and stories of legendary forest creatures that lurked in the night, interwoven with bouts of laughter and shared moments to lighten the potentially eerie mood. As the night wore on, Betty began to feel less frightened of the dark when she realized that together, they had the power to face their fears and make it through adversity, provided they relied on one another. The seemingly daunting and treacherous terrain of the forest took on a less sinister appearance with each passing step, as the bonds of their friendship illuminated the path ahead, much like the glow from the flashlight. Finally, they reached their destination, their faces tinged with a sense of accomplishment and their hearts warmed by the knowledge that they had not only faced their fears but had come out victorious on the other side. And as they sat together under a sky now dotted with stars, they reveled in the journey and the knowledge that they had grown as individuals and friends because of it.
