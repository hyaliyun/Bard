To provide more context, Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, also known as Renzong, was the fifth emperor of the Yuan dynasty in China, a ruling dynasty founded by the Mongolian ruler Kublai Khan. He was the son of Darmabala and Dagi (a descendant of the family of Genghis Khan) and the great-grandson of Kublai Khan.  During his reign, Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan implemented several significant changes and reforms that had a considerable impact on the political landscape during his time. One such reform was the reinstatement of the imperial examinations for China's civil service, which had been abolished by Kublai Khan. The imperial examination was an essential element of traditional Chinese society, as it allowed individuals to obtain positions within the government based on their merit and knowledge, rather than their social status or connections. The imperial examinations were designed to assess a candidate's knowledge of the Confucian classics and their ability to write essays and poetry. This system ensured that those selected for government positions were well-versed in Chinese culture, ethics, and governance. Kublai Khan, as a Mongolian ruler, abolished the imperial examinations to consolidate his power and diminish the influence of the Chinese literati, who had dominated the imperial bureaucracy for centuries. During Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan's reign, a shift occurred in the Yuan dynasty's attitude towards Chinese culture, scholarship, and governance. He reinstated the imperial examinations to foster a more inclusive and merit-based system for selecting government officials, thereby recognizing the importance and value of Chinese intellectual traditions. In conclusion, the sentence provided does answer the question about when Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan reigned. His reign occurred between 1311 and 1320, during which he made several significant changes, such as the reinstatement of the imperial examinations, a practice previously abolished by Kublai Khan. This demonstrated his recognition and appreciation of the intellectual and scholarly traditions of China, which had lasting effects on the country's political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. A:","output":"The last name of the person who was physically restrained by Nilsson is Lennon. In the article, it is mentioned that \\"While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.\\" This indicates that Nilsson physically restrained John Lennon from attempting to strangle May Pang."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"data mining\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Both sentences are stating that \\"it\\" is available in specific areas, which are Phibsboro, Castleknock, Finglas, Cabra, and Ballymun. The difference between the two sentences is the presence of an additional comma and the absence of the word \\"and\\" before \\"Cabra\\" in the second sentence. The slight difference in punctuation does not change the overall meaning of the sentence. In both sentences, the author communicates that some item, service, or amenity is available within the mentioned areas.

C++ (pronounced \\"cee plus plus\\" ) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.  It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.  C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as \\"ISO/IEC 14882:2014\\" (informally known as C++14). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as \\"ISO/IEC 14882:1998\\", which was then amended by the C++03, \\"ISO/IEC 14882:2003\\", standard. The current C++14 standard supersedes these and C++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization.

The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family. It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How to learn a new instrument","output":"Learning a new instrument can be an exciting and rewarding experience. It not only expands your musical knowledge and skill, but also offers numerous cognitive and emotional benefits. To effectively learn a new instrument, follow these steps: Step 1: Choose the right instrument Before diving into lessons, take some time to research and choose an instrument that genuinely interests you and fits your budget. Consider factors like size, portability, required maintenance, and the availability of learning resources. Step 2: Set clear goals Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals can help you stay motivated and track your progress. For example, setting a goal to learn a particular piece or to play for a specific event can help keep you focused on your objective. Step 3: Gather resources and materials Find resources that cater to your preferred learning style, such as instructional books, online tutorials, video courses, or in-person lessons. Invest in essential equipment, like a music stand, metronome, tuner, and any required maintenance supplies. Step 4: Establish a schedule and practice routine Carve out dedicated practice time in your schedule, aiming for at least 30 minutes to an hour per session. Prioritize consistency over duration, as regular, shorter sessions are typically more effective than infrequent, longer sessions. Break down your practice routine into specific tasks, focusing on warm-ups, technique, repertoire, and theory. Step 5: Focus on your technique Developing proper technique early on helps prevent bad habits and can significantly improve your sound quality and playing ability. Pay close attention to posture, hand position, finger placement, and other fundamental aspects of your chosen instrument. Step 6: Learn music theory Understanding basic music theory concepts (such as scales, chords, intervals, and harmony) can help you become a well-rounded musician. Many resources are available, including books, websites, and online courses, to help deepen your understanding of musical concepts. Step 7: Practice sight-reading Sight-reading involves translating written music into sound without prior preparation. This skill can help you learn new music more rapidly and enhance your overall musicianship. Allocate a portion of your practice routine to sight-reading exercises. Step 8: Play with others Playing music with others provides valuable experience and allows for immediate feedback. Join a local orchestra, band, chamber group, or attend jam sessions to refine your ensemble skills and learn from other musicians. Step 9: Record yourself Recording your practice sessions can help you identify areas that need improvement. Listen back to your recordings critically, taking note of intonation, rhythm, tone quality, and other aspects of your playing. Step 10: Stay motivated and track progress Celebrate small victories and milestones, and don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter challenges. Keep a practice log or journal to document your progress, and consider sharing your journey with friends, family, or on social media for extra accountability and support. Step 11: Seek out performance opportunities Performing in front of an audience can build confidence and offer valuable experience. Seek out performance opportunities, like open mics, talent shows, recitals, or simply playing for friends and family. Step 12: Continue learning To maintain momentum and continuously improve as a musician, explore new techniques, styles, and repertoire. Attend workshops, take masterclasses, or pursue further education to expand your knowledge and skills. Learning a new instrument is a rewarding journey that requires time, effort, perseverance, and patience. By following these steps and staying committed, you can successfully develop your musical skills and enjoy the lifelong pleasures of making music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What religious term originally referring to the the most educated and literate officials and leaders within the church, evolved into a workplace title nowadays positioned at the other end of an organizational hierarchy?","output":"The religious term that originally referred to the most educated and literate officials and leaders within the church but evolved into a workplace title nowadays positioned at the other end of an organizational hierarchy is \\"clerk.\\"  The term \\"clerk\\" has its roots in the Latin word \\"clericus,\\" which referred to a clergyman or a cleric, and the Late Old English term \\"clerc,\\" which denoted a member of the clergy. In the medieval period, education and literacy were primarily accessible to those in religious institutions. As a result, clergymen were among the most educated and literate people in society. During the medieval era, the Catholic Church played a critical role in governance, so it was natural for clergymen to assume various administrative and leadership positions. They were responsible for numerous tasks ranging from recording events, managing financial transactions, tracking legal matters, and overseeing routine administrative functions. As we progressed into the late Middle Ages, literate laymen, mainly drawn from the emerging middle class, began to assume roles previously held by clergymen. This development was catalyzed by the expansion of secular schools, which churned out skilled scribes and administrators. Eventually, the term \\"clerk\\" began to lose its religious connotation and took on a more secular meaning. In the modern context, the term \\"clerk\\" is commonly used to describe individuals employed in administrative or support roles within various organizations, from businesses to governmental institutions. Rather than signifying an individual with exceptional education or authority, as it did in the past, the term is now often associated with entry-level or lower-level professionals in an organizational hierarchy. Nonetheless, the expertise and administrative duties hailing back to their connection with the church remain essential components of the clerk's core functions.  In summary, the term \\"clerk\\" has evolved significantly over the centuries, transforming from its origins as a title for the highly educated and literate officials within the church to a workplace designation for individuals who perform routine administrative duties and occupy entry-level roles within an organization. This shift reflects both the changing influence of religious institutions over time and the broader development of secular education and the emergence of distinct professional classes."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. Think like you are answering to a five year old. On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war.  Question: \\"Who was joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei in Singapore?\\" Answer: \\"The British\\" Is this answer correct? Pick your answer from: A. no; B. yes;...I think the answer is","output":"A. no The answer is incorrect because it was the relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders who were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei in Singapore, and not \\"The British\\".

Write an article that answers the following question: Which player kicked the longest field goal?","output":"Title: The Record-Breaking Longest Field Goal in NFL History Introduction: The Longest Field Goal in Professional Football From electrifying touchdowns and spectacular interceptions to bone-crushing tackles, professional football has no shortage of highlights. One feat that often captivates the attention of fans and commentators alike is the field goal. Attempting to put points on the board from great distances is a rare showcase of skill, accuracy, and strength. Record-breaking field goals are etched into the annals of football history, and in this article, we'll answer the question, \\"Which player kicked the longest field goal?\\" Step 1: Provide Statistics and Player Background Matt Prater, a renowned placekicker, currently holds the record for the longest successful field goal attempt in NFL history. Born on August 10, 1984, Prater was drafted by the Detroit Lions in 2006 from the University of Central Florida. Over the years, he has played for the Miami Dolphins, Atlanta Falcons, Denver Broncos, and now the Detroit Lions once again. Through his illustrious career, Prater has consistently proven his reliability and prowess on the field. Step 2: Discuss the Record-Breaking Kick Prater set the record for the longest field goal on December 8, 2013, while playing for the Denver Broncos. In a game against the Tennessee Titans, this incredible 64-yard field goal not only demonstrated the tremendous skill of Prater but also aided the Broncos in securing a 51-28 victory.  This record-breaking kick surpassed the previous record held by Tom Dempsey, a legendary kicker known for his uniquely squared-toe shoe. Dempsey's 63-yard feat, set in 1970 with the New Orleans Saints, had stood as the NFL's longest successful field goal attempt for 43 years before Prater's awe-inspiring kick shattered the milestone. Step 3: Explain the Factors that Contributed to the Achievement Several factors contributed to Prater's record-breaking kick, such as the altitude of the Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado. As the stadium is approximately 5,280 feet above sea level, the thinner air allows the ball to travel farther than it would in a lower altitude environment. Another significant factor in Prater's success was the support of his teammates – the holder, who carefully positioned the ball, and the offensive line, who made sure Prater had the time and space necessary to execute the kick with speed and precision. With their combined efforts, Prater was able to make history. Conclusion: The Legacy of Matt Prater's Longest Field Goal Matt Prater's record-breaking 64-yard field goal is a testament to his unparalleled skill, focus, and tenacity. As the longest field goal ever made in NFL history, this feat earns him an esteemed place amongst the greatest placekickers in the NFL. With superb capabilities, impeccable technique, and the support of his peers, it is no wonder that Prater was able to break this long-standing record and inspire future generations of kickers to strive for greatness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No The answer is:","output":"3). No While The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter does represent a notable example of a work that won both the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction, we cannot infer that these prestigious awards have never been awarded to the same author in one year simply based on this example alone. In fact, there have been instances in which both awards have gone to the same author for the same work in the same year. For example, in 1993, Annie Proulx's The Shipping News won both awards. Similarly, Richard Powers's The Overstory won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 2018. In both of these cases, the same author won these prestigious awards for their respective works in the same year. Furthermore, the criteria and selection processes for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction may have some overlapping elements, but they involve separate committees and organizations. As a result, there is always the possibility that these awards will go to one author or different authors in any given year, depending on the committees' assessment of the nominated works. Thus, it is incorrect to infer from Katherine Anne Porter's achievements that the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction have never been awarded to the same author in one year.

First, identify the substance you want to spray (e.g., water, paint, disinfectant, or any liquid solution). 2. Gather the necessary materials: a spray bottle or a device specifically designed for spraying the substance, such as a paint sprayer, a garden sprayer, or a perfume atomizer. Make sure that the spraying device is compatible with the substance to be sprayed. 3. Fill the spraying device with the desired substance. This can be done by unscrewing or opening the container part of the spraying device and carefully pouring the substance into it. Be sure not to overfill the container to avoid any leaks or spills. 4. Close or seal the container, ensuring that it is tightly secured to prevent any leakage or spillage. 5. Depending on the spraying device you are using, adjust the nozzle to achieve the desired spray pattern (if applicable). For example, some spray bottles have adjustable nozzles which can be turned to control the spray from a fine mist to a more focused stream. 6. Hold the spraying device in one hand, positioning it with the nozzle facing away from you and towards the target area where you want to apply the spray. 7. With your other hand, grasp the trigger, lever, or button that controls the flow of the substance through the nozzle. This could be a squeeze-trigger on a spray bottle, a button or lever on a paint sprayer, or a pump action on a perfume atomizer. 8. Apply pressure to the trigger, lever, or button to release the substance in a spray or mist pattern towards the target area. Maintain a consistent pressure and a steady hand to ensure an even application of the substance. 9. Move the spraying device in a sweeping motion across the target surface or area, overlapping each pass slightly to ensure thorough coverage. Continue spraying until the desired coverage and effect are achieved. 10. Once you have finished spraying, release the trigger, lever, or button to stop the flow of the substance.

Question: Question: \\"What was the goal of the partition?\\"  Context: \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The goal of the partition was to create separate independent states for the Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority regions in British India, as the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League had differing visions for India's future. The partition aimed to address the concerns of the Muslim minority who feared domination by the Hindu majority in a unified secular Indian state. This led to the formation of India and Pakistan, with the intention to prevent civil unrest and potential civil war. Unfortunately, the partition also resulted in massive population displacement and violence between the two communities, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen, binominal name or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the \\"International Code of Zoological Nomenclature\\" (\\"ICZN\\") for animals and the \\"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\\" (\\"ICN\\"). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.

This can create problems and conflicts because the people inside the building should be focusing on their main job, like teaching or helping sick people, but they might feel pressure to do what the money-givers want. So, institutional corruption is when the goals of an institution get mixed up or confused because of the influence of people who give them money."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In the Virginia woods, Mark Warner is trailed by Obamacare Updated 7:27 a.m. ET, 4/17/2014 Wakefield, Virginia (CNN) - Mark Warner was weaving his way through the crowd on a chilly Wednesday afternoon at the Shad Planking, the annual Virginia fish fry that brings beer-sipping politicos together in the tall pines of southeastern Virginia, when a burly man sporting an NRA sticker approached. “Senator, did you read the Affordable Care Act before you voted for it?” he asked. Warner, his brow furrowed earnestly, was prepared. “I’ve outlined a series of changes to it,” he said, gripping the man’s shoulder and jabbing his finger. “Five separate bills.” The Democrat moved along briskly, back-slapping longtime supporters but also facing down several more questions about the health care law he supported from hostile interrogators, most of them backing Republican Ed Gillespie, his likely challenger this year. CNN: Key races to watch in 2014 With his signature grin and rolled-up sleeves, Warner answered them all like the seasoned politician he is. But the specter of the Obamacare pecked at him throughout what was supposed to be a light-hearted afternoon of backwoods politicking and friendly bipartisan joshing. The drive into the 66th annual Shad Planking along Brittles Mill Road in Wakefield was dotted with hundreds of pro-Warner campaign signs. But they were overshadowed by a series of larger placards paid for by the Republican Party of Virginia. “Mark Warner Betrayed Virginia,” they read. “Obamacare’s Deciding Vote.” Warner has a big lead over the little-known Gillespie early polls, and the Republican still has to secure the Senate nomination at a convention in June. But inside the event, Gillespie supporters appeared to outnumber Warner backers by a wide margin. Gillespie had arrived earlier, trailed by staffers and a small horde of volunteers hoisting campaign signs. The first-time candidate, a veteran GOP fixer and lobbyist, worked his campaign booth, handing out beer and taking questions from reporters. “The problem with Sen. Warner is with his record,” Gillespie said. “The more Virginia learns about that record, they’ll be surprised because it’s also at odds with how Sen. Warner portrays himself back home. He is not the independent voice he portrays himself to be, voting 97% of the time President Obama and Harry Reid.” On his way out of the woods, Gillespie bumped into Warner, the first time the two have crossed paths as rival candidates. They chatted briefly about Terry McAuliffe, the new Virginia governor who chaired the Democratic National Committee a decade ago when Gillespie ran the Republican National Committee. Polls: Warner way ahead of Gillespie in Virginia Warner was booked as this year’s headline speaker. He was introduced by John Hager, a former GOP lieutenant governor, who heralded the event’s bipartisan conviviality. “Looks like there’s lots of good gettin’-together,” he chuckled as he surveyed the audience. It wasn’t always that way: The event was started by the segregationist Democrats who used to dominate politics in the commonwealth. Today, women and African-Americans are allowed to participate, but the Shad Planking retains a conservative bent. Wednesday’s vest-wearing crowd was mostly white and mostly male, part Garden and Gun, part Guns and Ammo. In keeping with the spirit of the day and his own political centrism, Warner avoided charged rhetoric in his brief talk on stage. A former governor and Democratic Party chairman, it was his fourth career appearance at the Shad Planking. He had warm words for the Republicans sitting next to him on stage, including George Allen, the former governor and senator who had a wad of tobacco stuffed into his lower lip. Warner declined to roast Gillespie, as speakers often do with their opponents here. His jokes were instead about Virginia’s shifting electoral landscape. “Of course, I know among this crowd I represent an endangered species – a Virginia Democrat,” Warner cracked. “Not unlike Republican women, our numbers here are few.” And then: “You know, they say the face of Virginia is changing. I have been coming to the Shad Planking for nearly 25 years, and as I look out over this crowd, the face of Virginia looks just about the same as it ever was. Just a little more wrinkled.” Complete coverage of the 2014 midterm elections His speech was peppered with feel-goody nods to “the Virginia way,” commonwealth shorthand for a genteel manner of across-the-aisle deal-making that “produces results.” The happy talk glossed over the grid-locked realities of do-nothing Washington and the ideological warfare unfolding in the state capital of Richmond, where a battle over Medicaid expansion could force a government shutdown. Warner huddled with the press after his speech. They wanted to know what elements of his Senate record he would feature in his campaign. He was quick to pivot back to his accomplishments as governor, mainly his landmark 2004 tax reform deal and successful efforts to boost Virginia’s business-friendly reputation. “What Virginians have always appreciated is people who get stuff done,” he said. But what about his Senate record? Warner talked about his “efforts” on issues like debt, infrastructure, immigration, housing and finance - but not health care. He referenced his work with bipartisan “gangs” in the Senate, where “being a gang member is a good thing.” He punted when asked if he would welcome President Barack Obama to campaign with him before November. “There will be time to talk about the campaign,” he said. “I have worked with the President, but there are areas where I disagree with the President.” As examples, Warner pointed to entitlement reform and energy policy, specifically his support for the Keystone XL Pipeline and offshore oil and gas drilling. “So that’s a maybe?” a reporter followed up. Warner was already moving on to shake the next hand.","output":"Senator Mark Warner faced questions about his support for the Affordable Care Act from hostile interrogators during a gathering at the annual Virginia fish fry. Despite his lead over his Republican challenger Ed Gillespie in early polls, Gillespie supporters seemed to outnumber Warner's at the event. While Warner highlighted his bipartisan efforts and accomplishments as governor during his speech, he avoided discussing healthcare and gave only a vague response when asked if he would welcome President Barack Obama to campaign with him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

David Bruce Vitter (born May 3, 1961) is an American lobbyist, lawyer and politician who served as United States Senator for Louisiana from 2005 to 2017. He was the first Republican elected to the Senate from his state since the Reconstruction Era. Previously, he served in the United States House of Representatives, representing the suburban Louisiana's 1st congressional district. He served as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives before entering the U.S. House. Vitter has been actively involved with legislation concerning illegal immigrants. In June 2007, he led a group of conservative Senators in blocking federal Immigration Legislation that would have granted a pathway to legal residence to 12 million illegal immigrants coupled with increased border enforcement. The bill's defeat won Vitter national attention as the bill was supported by President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Ted Kennedy, among others. Vitter characterized the bill as amnesty, which supporters denied. Bush accused the bill's opponents of fear mongering.  In October 2007, Vitter introduced an amendment withholding Community Oriented Policing Services funds from any sanctuary city which bans city employees and police officers from asking people about their immigration status in violation of the Illegal Immigration Act. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, in opposition to the amendment, said these cities do not want to inquire about someone's status if they report a crime, are a victim of domestic violence or get vaccinations for their children. The amendment was defeated.  In November 2007, Vitter introduced a bill requiring banks to verify that no customer was an illegal immigrant before issuing banking or credit cards. The bill never made it out of committee.  In March 2008, Vitter reintroduced the latter two proposals and cosponsored ten of eleven other bills in a Republican package of tough immigration enforcement measures including jail time for illegal border crossing; deportation for any immigrant (legal or illegal) for a single driving while intoxicated; declaration of English as the official language (thereby terminating language assistance at voting booths and federal agencies)' additional construction of a border fence; permission for local and state police to enforce immigration laws and penalties for states who issue drivers licenses to illegals. None of these proposals passed, partially because the Democratic-controlled Senate preferred a comprehensive approach which would include a guest-worker program and a path to citizenship for the current population more akin to the package defeated by Vitter in 2007.  In April 2008, Vitter introduced a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that a child born in the United States is not a citizen unless a parent is a citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien serving in the military. Currently the Constitution grants citizenship to children born within the U.S. regardless of the legal status of the parents. The bill never made it out of the Democratic-led committee.

The Rosemary Hill Observatory started observing 3C 279 in 1971, and was further observed by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in 1991, when it was unexpectedly discovered to be one of the brightest gamma ray objects in the sky. It is also one of the most bright and variable sources in the gamma ray sky monitored by the Fermi Space Telescope. Apparent superluminal motion was detected during observations first made in 1973 in a jet of material departing from the quasar, though it should be understood that this effect is an optical illusion caused by naive estimations of the speed, and no truly superluminal motion is occurring.

Please answer the following question: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...  Dan is a geneticist and studied two villages from 2,000 years ago. Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically.  Which village displayed an observable Allee effect? Answer:","output":"Village B displayed an observable Allee effect. The Allee effect refers to a decline in individual fitness within a species due to a decrease in population size and a subsequent reduction in genetic diversity. In the case of the two villages studied by the geneticist Dan, Village A had a large population that grew larger over time, which would result in a relatively stable and diverse gene pool. Consequently, there would be a lower likelihood of an Allee effect occurring in Village A. On the other hand, Village B had a small and declining population, and was geographically isolated. These factors would contribute to a reduction in genetic diversity due to a limited gene pool size and a higher likelihood of inbreeding. Genetic bottleneck, which can result from a shrinking population, can lead to an accumulation of deleterious mutations due to genetic drift. Smaller gene pools are also more susceptible to stochastic events where harmful alleles become fixed, reducing the overall fitness of individuals within the population. Mildly deleterious alleles that are less likely to be removed by natural selection, and beneficial mutations with a higher chance of being lost by random chance, could also be more prevalent in smaller gene pools like that of Village B. Considering these factors, it is more likely that Village B displayed an observable Allee effect due to its small and declining population, leading to a decrease in individual fitness within the species and a higher propensity for genetic issues as a result of reduced genetic diversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Water flows into the dishwasher - The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The water is cold happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis states that if the water is cold, it will help the dishwasher clean better. To analyze the effect of this perturbation on the dishwasher's cleaning process, let's break down the process step by step and examine the consequences of using cold water instead of hot water. 1. Water flows into the dishwasher: Cold water enters the dishwasher instead of hot water. This can lower the overall temperature inside the dishwasher during the cleaning cycle. 2. The dishwasher heats the water: In response to the cold water introduced, the dishwasher will need to expend more energy and take more time to heat the water to the desired temperature. This could lead to increased energy consumption and longer wash cycles. 3. The detergent dispenser opens at the right time: Cold water can hinder the effectiveness of some detergents, as they may not dissolve and activate optimally in cooler temperatures. This can result in a less effective cleaning process as the detergent will not be able to break down food residues and stains as efficiently. 4. Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes: Cold water doesn't have the same grease-cutting and stain-removing properties as hot water. Consequently, the cleaning power of the dishwasher may be reduced, requiring more energy, more detergent, or additional wash cycles to achieve the desired level of cleanliness. 5. The dirty water is drained: Since the water may not have cleaned the dishes as effectively, the drained water may still contain food particles, grease, and detergent residues. This could cause blockages or malodorous conditions in the dishwasher. 6. More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes: If cold water is used for rinsing, it may not be as effective in removing detergent residues and cleaning agents from the dishes. This could leave a film or spots on the dishes after they have been dried. 7. The water is drained again: Similar to the previous draining step, the residual detergent and food particles might not be effectively removed, causing potential clogging issues and undesirable odors. 8. The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes: Since the dishwasher may need to expend more energy to heat the cold water, the overall energy consumption during the drying process may also increase, making the drying less efficient. In summary, the supposed perturbation of using cold water in the dishwasher cleaning process has both direct and indirect effects on the effectiveness and efficiency of the process. Cold water can hinder detergent activation, reduce the cleaning power of the water, and increase energy consumption and cycle times. Consequently, the perturbation hypothesis does not support the claim that using cold water would help the dishwasher clean better. Instead, it would likely reduce the overall cleaning performance and efficiency of the dishwasher."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Interior Ministry said it had deployed almost 10,000 police and 48 dogs to track down the fugitive leader of the Sinaloa cartel. Mexico is also co-operating with neighbouring Guatemala and the United States to increase border controls. Guzman's escape from a top-security jail through a 1.5km-long tunnel is a major embarrassment for officials. It is the second time the drug cartel leader has escaped from a top-security Mexican jail. Should drug lord Guzman have been extradited to the US? More than 100 roadblocks have been set up on highways across Mexico and 100,000 leaflets with mug shots of Guzman have been distributed at toll booths. Airports have been put on alert and security personnel have been told to search any private flights taking off. Police are also searching hotels and hospitals for any trace of Guzman. The government is offering a 60m peso (3.8m; Â£2.4m) reward for information leading to his capture. On Wednesday, Mexican officials said they were also co-operating with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the FBI. The DEA reportedly played a key role in Guzman's 2014 re-capture, providing intelligence which led Mexican security forces to the apartment where he was hiding, in his native Sinaloa state in north-western Mexico. The Mexican interior minister has also held meetings with Guatemalan officials to prevent Guzman slipping into the neighbouring country. In 1993, Guzman was arrested just south of Mexico's border with Guatemala. Saturday was the second time Guzman managed to escape from a maximum-security jail. In 2001 he broke out of Puente Grande prison, reportedly hiding in a laundry cart. He was on the run for 13 years before being re-arrested in February last year. The scale of the tunnel through which he fled on Saturday raised suspicions that he had help from prison staff. Three senior prison officials, including the director of the jail, have been dismissed. The escape tunnel, which leads to a building outside the prison perimeter, is more than 1.5km (1 mile) long and measures 1.70m (5ft 6in) in height. Security officials said it could have taken a year to build. On Wednesday, prison officials allowed journalists to inspect the cell from which he fled. Each journalist was only given two minutes inside the cell. One-hundred-and-twenty seconds are enough to raise questions about how this escape was possible. How could it be that no one heard or saw anything? Inside the cell suspicion mounts that you don't get out of here without accomplices on the inside. Underneath the shower is the hole where the tunnel starts, but it's so deep and dark you can't really see anything. At two sides of the hole are 1.2m-high walls which were meant to shield Guzman's privacy while he was showering. The security camera could not see past these walls and it was behind them that the man who is now being sought by thousands of police escaped. The Sinaloa cartel, which Guzman leads, is one of Mexico's most powerful drug gangs, responsible for smuggling huge quantities of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines to the United States. Following his escape, the Chicago Crime Commission has again declared Guzman \\"Public Enemy Number One\\". Security officials in the US and Mexico fear that the longer Guzman remains free the stronger his cartel will get. In recent years, the Sinaloa cartel had lost some of its power to other rival gangs.

A house guest is facing felony charges after he allegedly killed a friend's dog by putting the canine in a sweltering oven. Joel Clark, 37, was being held on Thursday at the Marion County Jail in Indiana. He faces charges of killing a domestic animal and torturing or mutilating a vertebrate animal, according to new court documents. Prosecutors said Clark was on house arrest and living with two friends, Christina Kelley and Richard Smith at the time. Miss Kelley found Zane, a Miniature Pinscher, dead on May 18. The little dog was discovered in the bottom of a trash can. The woman was then horrified to discover dog hair and a toenail on a cookie sheet and pizza pan in the oven, court documents said. A necropsy found that the dog's whiskers were burned, it had burn marks on its legs and feet and blood on its snout and mouth. Court documents said Clark told one of the friends that he had killed the dog about 30 minutes before its body was discovered, but they did not believe him. The dog's owners had no idea of Clark's motive. He also told one of the friends that he 'could take care of that dog, too' when a pitbull walked past them, the documents said. The friends ordered Clark to leave their home after they found Zane dead, court documents said. Miss Kelley and Mr Smith said that they were aghast by the death of their pet and totally bewildered because no argument had taken place before the brutal killing, according to the Indy Star. Along with the animal cruelty charges, Clark has also been charged with escape relating to the violation of his house arrest for allegedly resisting a previous arrest.

Instead of naming another known structure, the response describes a specific architectural feature of the Saint Denis.  Allow me to provide a detailed and correct response: The Basilica of Saint-Denis, a large medieval abbey church in the city of Saint-Denis, just north of Paris, is known as one of the first structures built in the style of Gothic architecture. The Basilica's façade, with its architectural elements and layout, resembles the façade of the western front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris; hence, these two buildings are often compared. The façade of Saint Denis heavily influenced the design of other Gothic cathedrals and structures. It features two massive towers, abundant carved ornamentation, and a large, central rose window that became iconic elements of Gothic church facades, just like Notre Dame's west front. Both façades share several architectural features typical of the Gothic style, like portals decorated with detailed sculptural compositions, large windows, and verticality that draws the eye upwards towards the heavens.  The comparison between the façade of Saint Denis and the façade of Notre Dame serves to pinpoint the proliferation and influence of the early Gothic style that originated in the Ile-de-France region, bearing witness to the architectural evolution that occurred during the Middle Ages.  Despite some differences due to the different construction periods and architectural advancements, the resemblance in their structure and design elements link these two iconic buildings and indicate Saint Denis's significant influence on the Gothic architectural style development.  In summary, the façade of Saint Denis is often compared with well-known structures built in the early Gothic style, such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, due to their characteristic architectural features and the influential role Saint Denis had in the evolution and spread of this style."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Option B (Gurney) is more likely because the text tells us that Gurney was a candidate, and George W. Bush was only mentioned as a traveling aide for Gurney.

Q:Combine facts and answer this: Are both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay both writers? A:","output":"Yes, both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay can be categorized as writers, although they possess different writing styles, subject matter, and cultural backgrounds. Let's take a closer look at each of these writers, their accomplishments, and how they made their mark on the literary world. Julio Cortázar (1914-1984) was an Argentine writer who was a key figure in the Latin American \\"Boom\\" literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Born in Brussels, Belgium, but raised in Argentina, Cortázar is best known for his novels and short stories, which often combine elements of both traditional realism and the literary avant-garde. Cortázar's work displays an intense sensitivity to language, a keen awareness of structural possibilities within different genres, and a tendency to play with the reader's expectations and assumptions. His works include the novels \\"Hopscotch\\" (1963), \\"62: A Model Kit\\" (1968), and \\"A Manual for Manuel\\" (1973), as well as numerous collections of short stories, such as \\"Bestiary\\" (1951), \\"Final Exam\\" (1950), and \\"Cronopios and Famas\\" (1962). Cortázar is well-known for his experimental, non-linear narratives, sometimes utilizing unconventional methods of storytelling, such as allowing the reader to rearrange the order of his novel \\"Hopscotch\\" in a choose-your-own-path style. Norman Lindsay (1879-1969) was an Australian artist, poet, writer, and etcher. Born in Creswick, Victoria, Lindsay enjoyed a varied creative career, achieving success in several fields. As a writer, he is best known for his novels and children's books. His literary work often features themes of romance and modernity, typically centering on the tensions between individualism and social conformity, with a sprinkling of humor and satire. He was also a talented artist and became controversial for his erotic depictions of the female form.  Lindsay's most notable literary contributions include the novels \\"A Curate in Bohemia\\" (1913), \\"Redheap\\" (1930), and \\"The Cautious Amorist\\" (1931), as well as his children's book, \\"The Magic Pudding\\" (1918), which has become a classic of Australian children's literature. Despite facing censorship challenges in his lifetime, Lindsay's works have continued to be celebrated and enjoyed by many readers. In conclusion, both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay were writers who made significant contributions to the literary world. While hailing from different cultural backgrounds and focusing on distinct genres, themes, and writing styles, they shared a mutual passion for the written word, leaving a lasting impact on literature and inspiring future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart. Lorfel saw the gleaming arrow head sticking almost a foot out of his companion's back. Ranur fell face first to the ground. Question: From what or whom did the roar came from?

Her father was an itinerant preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Alongside Franklin, her parents had three other children while both C. L. and Barbara had children from outside their marriage. The family relocated to Buffalo, New York when Franklin was two. In November 1966, choosing not to renew her Columbia contract after six years with the company, Franklin signed to Atlantic Records. In January 1967, she traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama to record at FAME Studios to record the song, \\"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\\" in front of the musicians of the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. The song was later issued that February and shot up to number-one on the R&B chart, while also peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Franklin her first top ten pop single. The song's b-side, \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\", reached the R&B top 40, peaking at number 37. In April, Atlantic issued her frenetic version of Otis Redding's \\"Respect\\", which shot to number-one on both the R&B and pop charts and later became her signature song and was later hailed as a civil rights and feminist anthem.  Franklin's debut Atlantic album, I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, also became commercially successful, later going gold. Franklin scored two more top ten singles in 1967 including \\"Baby I Love You\\" and \\"(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman\\". Franklin's rapport with producer Jerry Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of Franklin's peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums, Lady Soul and Aretha Now, which included some of Franklin's most popular hit singles including \\"Chain of Fools\\", \\"Ain't No Way\\", \\"Think\\" and \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\". In February 1968, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys including the debut category for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.

Franklin's success expanded during the early 1970s in which she recorded top ten singles such as \\"Spanish Harlem\\", \\"Rock Steady\\" and \\"Day Dreaming\\" as well as the acclaimed albums, Spirit in the Dark, Young, Gifted & Black and her gospel album, Amazing Grace, which sold over two million copies. In 1971, Franklin became the first R&B performer to headline Fillmore West, later recording the live album, Aretha Live at Fillmore West. Franklin's career began to experience problems while recording the album, Hey Now Hey, which featured production from Quincy Jones. Despite the success of the single, \\"Angel\\", the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R&B success with songs such as \\"Until You Come Back to Me\\" and \\"I'm in Love\\" but by 1975, her albums and songs were no longer top sellers. After Jerry Wexler left Atlantic for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, Franklin worked on the soundtrack to the film, \\"Sparkle\\", with Curtis Mayfield. The album yielded Franklin's final top 40 hit of the decade, \\"Something He Can Feel\\", which also peaked at number-one on the R&B chart.

Being the tallest person on Earth, eating the most hot dogs, and running the fastest mile are all records that can be measured. Things that are abstract or based on opinion are not measurable. For example, being the world's \\"greatest cat lover\\" is abstract. However, \\"owning the world's most cat figurines\\" is measurable. For example, being the fastest swimmer in the world would work as a record because most people in the world understand what swimming is. If other people can’t repeat your record and attempt to beat you, your record will not be accepted. You have to be able to prove that you actually broke a record. Claiming that you ate 700 marshmallows in ten minutes when you were younger isn’t something that can be verified (unless you have it on tape).

Given the following context:  College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder. But she is even more irritated when he addresses her as Miss Wells and a student repeats this name. Also Dawn, her driver's license, her diary and a dedication in her husband's book affirm this surname. Sarah is rejected by Cooper's assistant. In the sleep laboratory Dr Koslov shows her a protocol about her dream in which she is pursued. She denies having dreamed anything, but sees her signature on the form.  answer the following question:  Who does the student, whose huband committed suicide, live with?

Help as much as you can. One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and... Question: The narrator probably believes === The answer to the above question is","output":"that creating a roadmap at the beginning of each cycle can help teams become more effective, focused, and successful in their work.

It smashes into the couple's car, with them still in it, on a hillside beside the lookout over Fawcett City. It's revealed that that meteor is in fact Black Adam returning to Earth from his long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a seemingly rundown slum with very little food and rats for pets. He rises from his bed wearing a fan t-shirt bearing the Superman crest. He goes to his kitchen to find food, but only finds potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to rendezvous with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees three bullies robbing a homeless man. After attempting to defend the homeless man, Billy himself earns a black eye for his trouble. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, and calls him \\"The Captain\\". Billy responds by telling him he always try to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only currency he has - a subway token. On arriving at the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfast specials, and tells him his intended story will bring the plight of him and those in his situation to public light. Billy tears into his plates ravenously. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering above the ground outside the diner and causes a destructive force by clapping his hands together and blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and transforms himself into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard's choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy is completely unaware of what he means.

I’ve had a trip planned with my sister to visit my brother, where for the first couple days she’s gonna go to her boyfriends home town to stay with him, and I was going to have my friends come and meet me there. All of this had already been cleared with all family members, however, I found out earlier this morning that for the past two days my mother and sister had been lying to my face (we talked about me staying at an Airbnb with my friends, they said it was a good idea) and my brother was not ok with my friends coming to town, or so my sister told me. There were maybe 60 some hours until my friends were supposed to leave, so I immediately messaged them and told them the truth, stating that my family did not want them to come (I’m not gonna lie about the reason when I have to cancel a trip on them last minute). I also made arrangements to, instead of going with my family, return home for the holidays. When I informed my sister of my plan, she accused me of using her and my brother, defended herself, and didn’t apologize for lying to me or any of the sort. Now, I’m finding out, maybe 3 hours after this all went down, that she meant they weren’t welcome at the apartment, but miscommunicated that to me by saying generally they weren’t welcome to come. My family is asking me to remake the plans with my friends and come to Denver anyways, but after all of this, I just want to go back home and take a break from them. I understand they’re my family and I love them, and I understand my mom not wanting to tell me the news on Christmas (worrying that it would ruin the holiday), but I just can’t handle the fact that they were okay with lying to my face to “preserve the holiday,” and potentially leaving me on the line to foot a several hundred dollar Airbnb bill from my friends (luckily they hadn’t booked yet).

In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries. One of the artists was Lenardo da Vinci from Italy. Da Vinci's \\"Mona Lisa\\" is the best known painting in the museum today. In 1793, the Louvre became a public museum.

In recent weeks, torrential rains have swept across several countries, resulting in the deaths of over 100 people and causing widespread panic throughout the region. Step 1: Describe the affected countries and their situations. Nepal, India, and Bangladesh are among the hardest-hit countries in the South Asian monsoon disaster. In Nepal, more than 50 people have been reported dead, scores are injured, and many residents are displaced due to the flooding and landslides. India, on the other hand, has seen a sharp increase in water levels in many parts of the country, particularly in the states of Assam and Bihar. In Bangladesh, the floods have killed at least 17 people, forcing around a million people to seek shelter in camps. Step 2: Mention the effects on infrastructure and housing. Source: ShutterstockMonsoon floods have led to severe infrastructural and housing damage in affected areas, as water levels have risen, inundating roads, bridges, and homes. Many residents in these areas are now without access to electricity, clean water, and essential services. As a result, people are forced to navigate the rising waters without proper support or resources, exacerbating the crisis. Step 3: Explain the relief efforts and potential challenges. Governments and humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Cross, have been mobilizing to provide relief to affected populations. The Indian government has deployed personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to evacuate those stranded in flood-affected areas, while the Nepalese and Bangladeshi authorities are working alongside UNICEF and other non-governmental organizations to supply assistance to their citizens. However, these efforts face significant challenges. The continuous rain has made transportation and distribution of aid quite difficult, while the ongoing threat of landslides in Nepal and the potential for waterborne diseases pose additional risks. The COVID-19 pandemic adds an extra layer of complexity to relief measures, as crowded shelters and supply distribution points complicate social distancing guidelines and risk sparking infection outbreaks. Step 4: Address the potential long-term effects on the region. The monsoon floods' long-lasting effects on the South Asian region are cause for concern. Food insecurity could become more widespread as farmlands are submerged and crop yields are diminished. Furthermore, the disrupted transportation systems and damaged infrastructure may hamper economic recovery efforts, particularly for those who rely on tourism and local trade for their livelihoods. Conclusion: The recent monsoon floods in South Asia have emphasized the need for a robust disaster response system in the region, including early warning systems, infrastructure planning, and investment in climate resilience. With the tragic loss of life and significant disruptions in affected countries, it's crucial that long-term solutions are devised to address the challenges posed by the monsoon season and prevent future catastrophes of such magnitude."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What areas were used to add to the city?\\"  Context: \\"Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The areas used to add to the city during the reign of Napoleon III and under the direction of Georges-Eugène Haussmann can be broadly categorized into three main domains: expansion of existing infrastructure, annexation of surrounding towns, and creation of new urban spaces. 1. Expansion of existing infrastructure: One of the primary goals of Napoleon III and Haussmann's urban renewal project was to modernize and expand Paris's existing infrastructure to accommodate the rapidly growing population. This included the construction of wide, new boulevards, which were not only intended to facilitate transportation but also had the added purpose of allowing better control over crowds and preventing barricade-building during uprisings. The most famous of these boulevards is the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, which was extended westward to connect the heart of Paris with the newly created Bois de Boulogne. 2. Annexation of surrounding towns: In order to expand Paris to its current limits and better integrate the city with the surrounding metropolitan area, Napoleon III annexed several neighboring towns and villages in 1860. These newly incorporated areas were organized into eight new arrondissements, numbered from the 12th to the 20th. The annexed territories include: - Auteuil and Passy, which became part of the 16th arrondissement; - Batignolles and Monceau, which became part of the 17th arrondissement; - Montmartre, La Chapelle, and Clignancourt, which became part of the 18th arrondissement; - Belleville and Ménilmontant, which became part of the 19th arrondissement; - Charonne, Bercy, and La Villette, which became part of the 20th arrondissement. 3. Creation of new urban spaces: Napoleon III and Haussmann's project aimed not only to expand the city's existing infrastructure but also to create new, grand urban spaces that would serve as hubs for culture, commerce, and leisure. A multitude of new structures and public spaces were constructed during this period, including: - The Palais Garnier (also known as the Opéra de Paris), a neoclassical masterpiece that served as the city's principal opera house; - Les Halles, a central market and commercial hub that was designed to anchor the city's food supply network; - Numerous parks and gardens, including the Bois de Boulogne, a vast public park to the west of Paris, and the Bois de Vincennes, a sprawling forest and parkland to the east. These green spaces provided recreational opportunities and improved the overall quality of life for Parisians. In summary, the areas used to add to the city of Paris during the tenure of Napoleon III and Haussmann included the expansion of existing infrastructure, the annexation of surrounding towns, and the creation of new civic spaces. This extensive and ambitious public works project transformed the urban landscape of Paris, forming the foundation of the city as we know it today."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Ummm, sounds like a copy cat Review: The clips that I've heard sound like nothing more than an unoriginal, copy-cat artist.

During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells?  Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","output":"Group B had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells. Step 1: Understand the question and given information - The question asks which group (A or B) had fewer organisms with mutations in the DNA of sex cells. Step 2: Find relevant information - From the given paragraph, we know that Group A had germline mutations and Group B had somatic mutations. Step 3: Relate the information to the question - Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, while somatic mutations occur in body cells and cannot be passed to the next generation. Step 4: Answer the question - Since germline mutations involve sex cells and Group B has somatic mutations, it means Group B had fewer organisms with mutations in the DNA of sex cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\"  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"In what state can women not obtain child support if they are not legally divorced?\\" is \\"California\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"In what state can women not obtain child support if they are not legally divorced?\\" is \\"Texas\\"."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: The pyramid is comprised of six levels, each made from brick. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Identify the information provided in the premise. The premise states that the pyramid is made up of six brick tiers and reaches a height of 60 m (196 ft). Step 2: Identify the statement in the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the pyramid is comprised of six levels, each made from brick. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis to check for entailment. Upon comparing the two statements, we can see that both mention the pyramid having six layers. In addition, both statements refer to those layers being made of brick. Step 4: Check for conditions where the hypothesis may not be true even if the premise is true. In this case, the premise does not display any specific conditions or provide additional information that would undermine the truth of the hypothesis.

Question: Where does this conversation most probably take place?   - At a restaurant  - In a fish shop  - At a clinic The answer is:","output":"At a restaurant. The conversation most probably takes place at a restaurant for several reasons. First, the context suggests a setting where food is being served or offered to customers, as the woman (W) is making a recommendation about a seafood dish with a special sauce. This is typical of a restaurant or dining establishment where staff members might help customers make menu choices based on their preferences or dietary restrictions. Furthermore, the presence of \\"sir\\" in the conversation indicates a level of formality that is likely to be found in a restaurant setting, where staff generally address customers politely and respectfully. Additionally, the man (M) responds to the recommendation by stating his allergy to shellfish, suggesting that he is a customer considering his meal options. While a fish shop may also sell seafood, the act of making a recommendation and discussing dietary restrictions is more commonly associated with a restaurant where the food would be prepared and consumed on-site. Finally, at a clinic, it would be highly unlikely for a staff member to recommend a seafood dish, as the primary focus in healthcare centers is on medical treatment and advice rather than food service."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

Meanwhile, Celeste's enigmatic adversaries reveal themselves as members of an ancient and dark order. Desperate to save Thomas, Jack and Emma lead the charge against them. As the battle unfolds, Thomas, on the brink of death, has a vision of a mysterious woman who reveals that the manuscript's true power lies in the hands of the believer. Act 4: The Power of Love and Belief Embracing the power within, Emma and Jack manage to fight off the adversaries and recover the manuscript. With his dying breath, Thomas confesses to his daughter that he now believes her mother was right about the supernatural. Emma, realizing that the bond of love and belief is the key to unleashing the manuscript's power, channels her energy to save her father. As Thomas comes back to life and the ice curse loses its grip, the trio returns to the village with a renewed sense of wonder and purpose. Together, they continue to explore the mysteries of the ancient world, humbled by the knowledge that the power of love and belief is the ultimate force. \\"The Icy Veil of Fate\\" is an action-packed, thrilling, and emotional journey that reminds the audience of the power of love, the importance of believing in something greater, and the strength of the human spirit when faced with supernatural forces."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Mesa, Arizona. (Reuters)      In the news lull before much of America takes off for Christmas, Donald Trump's use of the word \\"schlonged\\" to describe Hillary Clinton's 2008 primary loss seized the public's imagination — or, according to our analysis of Google data, the imagination of that dismal subsection of the public that cares about politics.      The subtext of it all was that the term appeared to be a crass reference to the male anatomy. Or was it, as Trump suggested on his personal newswire (Twitter) on Tuesday night, just a term for losing an election badly?      For those on TV defending my use of the word \\"schlonged,\\" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2015      Trump also retweeted political analyst Jeff Greenfield's defense of the term, in which Greenfield declared that the term is \\"a commonplace NY way of saying: 'I lost big time.'\\"      On further review, Trump is right on this. \\"I got schlonged\\" is a commonplace NY way of saying: \\"I lost big time,\\" w/out genital reference. — Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) December 23, 2015      To be perfectly clear, the expression is by no means \\"commonplace\\" — in New York or elsewhere. It has never appeared in the New York Times (prior to this week) and does not appear to have been used in any New York paper early in the 20th century. It doesn't appear in Irving Lewis Allen's 1993 book, \\"The City in Slang,\\" which documents any number of lesser-known expressions that trickled out of New York City. And, as a point of personal privilege, it's not something that I'm familiar with, having grown up upstate and lived in the city for most of the past decade.      But it has popped up a few times, as The Post's Justin Moyer reported on Tuesday, including one usage in the exact same context — and in an interview with The Fix's very own Chris Cillizza.      In March of 2011, Cillizza was interviewed by NPR's Neil Conan to discuss the then-recent death of 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro. Conan, who was born in Beirut but grew up in New York City, used the expression to describe the outcome of that race, which Ferraro and Walter Mondale lost overwhelmingly.      CONAN: Chris Cillizza, that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls, but that's a historic moment. CILLIZZA: Absolutely historic moment, Neal, but as you point out, lost 49 states. The only state that that ticket won, which was led by Walter Mondale, was his home state of Minnesota.      A veritable schlonging. (The word didn't impress itself upon Cillizza at the time, he said over email Tuesday evening, nor does it seem to have fazed him during the interview.)      There are other examples, pointed out by linguist Ben Zimmer in an article at Politico. He also notes that Google's index of books turns up some examples, such as from \\"Welcome, Sinner\\" by Richard Posner, published in 1974.      Slang like \\"schlonged\\" wouldn't normally crop up in written journalism, of course. That it appears in a radio broadcast, where editing is trickier, isn't really a surprise. Conan, like Trump, is in his late 60s, suggesting that there may be a generational aspect to its use. Lots of words that were common and unremarkable decades ago are now viewed as disrespectful or inappropriate, of course, but Trump, it seems, might well be right.      We have to point out how Cillizza's remarks in that 2011 \\"Talk of the Nation\\" segment end. He compares Ferraro's uniqueness as a candidate to another candidate who gave it a shot only three years before Chris was speaking.      \\"[G]roundbreaking in its way,\\" Cllizza said, \\"but one fascinating tidbit: We still don't have a woman president, and we had a female, obviously, nominee, with Hillary Clinton, and she lost the nomination.\\"      She got beaten very badly, in fact. If I were a few decades older, there's a term I might use.      This post has been updated with the additions from Zimmer. ||||| Nearly 24 hours after he said that Hillary Clinton had been \\"schlonged\\" by Barack Obama during her failed 2008 presidential campaign, Donald Trump took to Twitter to defend his comments.      Schlonged, the Republican businessman said in a tweet, was not a vulgar reference to a penis. Instead, he argued, he meant \\"beaten badly.\\"      Once again, #MSM is dishonest. \\"Schlonged\\" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got \\"schlonged\\" that meant beaten badly. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2015      Trump went on to defend his comments, saying that NPR's Neal Conan had once used the phrase to refer to the trouncing at the polls that the Walter Mondale-Geraldine Ferraro presidential ticket received in the 1984 election.

Many news outlets suggested that Trump was drawing a reference to a penis.

(AP Photo/Jim Cole)      COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa — Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders ratcheted up his criticism Tuesday of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, calling him a “coward billionaire” and mocking him for talking about Hillary Clinton’s trip to the restroom during the past presidential debate.      “He has discovered that women go to the bathroom, and it’s been very upsetting to him,” the senator from Vermont said of the real-estate mogul during a rally here that drew about 1,800 people. “This is a guy who wants to be president of the United States. He must have a very unusual relationship with women.”      Sanders was referring to Trump’s recounting Monday of Clinton’s late return to the Democratic debate stage following a commercial break Saturday night.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump remarked on Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton's brief absence from the debate stage on Dec. 19 saying, \\"Where did she go? I thought she quit.\\" (Reuters)      \\"I know where she went — it's disgusting, I don't want to talk about it,\\" Trump told a crowd in Grand Rapids, Mich. \\"No, it's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting.\\"      [Donald Trump says Clinton’s bathroom break during the debate is ‘too disgusting’ to talk about]      Sanders shared with his audience that “I was there at that debate that happened Saturday night” in Manchester, N.H.      “Now I’ve got to be honest with you. I’ve got to be honest with you,” Sanders said, speaking in a mocking tone. “I also went to the bathroom. I know, I have to admit it. … This is the pathology. This is the guy who is leading in the Republican polls.”      Earlier in his hour-long remarks, Sanders also took aim at Trump for his hard-line position on immigration and his recent proposal to ban all Muslims temporarily from coming into the country. Sanders also lambasted Trump for his objection to raising the minimum wage and his advocacy of tax breaks for high-income earners.      [Clinton, Sanders both say the other might raise more money. So please help. And soon.]      “You try to divide the American people up, you try to get us to hate Mexicans, to hate Muslims,” Sanders said. “You keep the minimum wage low and you give huge tax breaks to millionaires. Mr. Trump, that is not what makes America great.”      Sanders’s appearance here came on the second day of a three-day swing through Iowa, the nation’s first caucus state. The state is key to Sanders’s fate. He has been leading in polls in New Hampshire, the second nominating state, but he has been trailing Clinton, former secretary of state, in Iowa.      Sanders plans to return to Iowa next week for another three-day swing. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the usage of the term \\"schlonged\\" by Donald Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, to describe Hillary Clinton's 2008 primary loss.

Western populations are killed by diet-related scourges such as heart disease and cancer, while the use of supplements for preventive purposes is officially frowned upon. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the apparent dysfunction and inadequacy of many aspects of modern society, particularly in relation to healthcare and dietary practices. This issue is manifesting itself in multiple ways, leading to a variety of negative consequences for both individuals and entire populations. Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the significant role that diet plays in the overall health of a population. As it stands, a considerable number of Western cultures are plagued by an abundance of unhealthy food options, which are often heavily processed and filled with harmful ingredients. These diets, which are typically high in saturated fats, sugars, and cholesterol, have been shown to contribute to a wide range of ailments, including heart disease and cancer. As a result, countless lives are lost each year due to the prevalence of these diet-related issues. At the same time, there has been a noticeable pushback against the use of supplements and alternative methods of healthcare for the purpose of prevention. For various reasons, from skepticism and lack of scientific evidence to a desire to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry, the official stance of many Western governments is to discourage the use of these remedies. This closed-minded approach can further exacerbate the issue, as the understanding, acceptance, and use of alternative healthcare practices and supplements could have considerable potential in helping to stave off the aforementioned scourges, reduce overall healthcare costs, and improve public health. Moreover, the breakdown in the system is not just limited to the attitudes and practices surrounding diet and healthcare, but extends to other fundamental aspects of society. This can include economic disparities, political corruption, environmental degradation, and societal divisions. These challenges can all contribute to an overall decline in the health and wellbeing of populations, as they create a landscape in which access to adequate healthcare and resources becomes increasingly difficult. In order to address this multifaceted issue, it is crucial for a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to be undertaken. This could involve: 1. Increased emphasis on the importance of healthy, balanced diets, as well as greater accessibility to fresh, nutrient-dense foods. 2. Wider acceptance and understanding of alternative healthcare practices and supplements, as well as support for continued research into their effectiveness and potential benefits. 3. Greater action to tackle the underlying societal issues, including income disparity, political corruption, and environmental irresponsibility, in order to create a more stable and equitable social structure that supports the health and wellbeing of all citizens. Ultimately, it is only through a combination of these efforts that the current breakdown in the system can be adequately addressed and rectified. By recognizing the interconnected nature of these issues and taking a holistic approach to problem-solving, it is possible to create a healthier, more resilient society that is capable of overcoming the challenges of diet-related diseases and moving towards a brighter future."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Hilltop fortress Bran Castle is the eastern European country’s biggest tourist attraction and attracts 560,000 visitors annually.

Actor Christopher Lee, right, is often regarded as the best on-screen Dracula      Bram Stoker is believed to have based his description of Dracula’s castle as ‘. . . on the very edge of a terrific precipice . . . with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm [with] silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests’ on that of Bran.            In the days of Romania’s Habsburg royal family, Bran Castle was given to Queen Marie, the last Queen consort of Romania and granddaughter of Queen Victoria.      When she died of cirrhosis, on July 18, 1938, she bequeathed the castle to her daughter Princess Ileana.            But after the Communists came to power in 1948, the family was given 24 hours to leave the country.

Answer: Political parties are regulated to ensure fair competition, transparency, and accountability in the political process. Regulations can vary by country, but common methods of regulation include: 1. Registration of parties: Parties are often required to register with government institutions, such as an electoral commission or regulatory body, and adhere to certain requirements, like having a specific number of members or fulfilling financial and administrative obligations. 2. Rules for party financing: Parties may be subject to rules related to campaign financing, financial reporting, and disclosure to prevent corruption or the influence of special interests on political decisions. 3. Internal party governance: Countries can set requirements for the internal organization of political parties, such as democratic principles for the election of party leaders, establishing clear and transparent decision-making processes, and ensuring gender equality or minority representation. 4. Media and advertising rules: Parties might need to adhere to rules regarding equal access to media coverage or limitations on political advertising. 5. Sanctions and penalties: Regulatory bodies can impose sanctions or penalties on parties that fail to follow the rules and regulations, like fines, loss of public funding, or even deregistration. Regarding the statement provided, it does reflect the importance of freedom and democracy in relation to political parties but does not directly address the regulation aspect.

Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it seems that the user would not strongly recommend this product due to the various issues they encountered while using it. The negatives listed, such as eggs not cooking all the way through, difficulty in flipping the eggs, the deterioration of the Teflon surface, and the resulting quality of the cooked eggs, outweigh the single positive of merely getting the job done. The user does acknowledge that some of these issues might be a common problem with mini pans in general, but they specifically mention dissatisfaction with the cheap Teflon, which could imply that they would consider recommending another product with better quality materials. The fact that the user gave the product more than one star because it does cook implies that the recommendation, if any, would be weak at best.  In conclusion, based on this review, the user would likely not recommend this product enthusiastically but may still consider it as a functional option. They might, however, be open to exploring other mini pans with higher-quality materials to address the issues they experienced with this particular product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, an art teacher of Finnish descent, and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies. Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years. She has a younger brother. She would later describe herself as having been \\"painfully shy\\" as a child and teenager. She \\"never had fewer than one after-school activity per day,\\" participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies. During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her \\"criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence\\". At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science.  When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team. She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics. She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad. Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up. During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk. After graduating from high school in 1993, Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.  Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon, Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University. She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems, a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science. At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools. During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer. Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997 and an MS in computer science in 1999. For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language. In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.  Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland. She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Sammon fired home from close range after Steven Smith's shot was blocked on the line. Jones made it 2-0 before half time with a neat finish after Kris Boyd's head-flick set him up. The win takes Kilmarnock to 38 points and they now cannot finish bottom of the Premiership. Killie also moved back into seventh spot in the table, while Hamilton are now level on 32 points with second-from-bottom Motherwell. Hamilton got off to a bright start as Massimo Donati played in Dougie Imrie down the right. His shot looked destined for the top corner, but Kilmarnock keeper Freddie Woodman did well to get a hand to the ball and divert the shot on to the post. Kilmarnock settled into the game after that and they took the lead in the 11th minute. The goal came from a well worked corner, with the ball eventually falling to Sammon and he applied the finish. The away side doubled their lead thanks to a flick-on from a throw in. Boyd nodded the ball into the box and there was Jones to fire low past Hamilton keeper Remi Matthews. Woodman then did well to save from an Imrie header, getting a touch to divert the ball on to the left-hand post. Woodman had to be in fine shot-stopping mode again to prevent Accies from getting back into this match in the second half. Greg Docherty had the shot from the edge of the area, but Woodman was not to be beaten. There was a big call for a penalty for Kilmarnock when Jones appeared to be bundled over in the box by Georgios Sarris, but there was not enough in it for referee Willie Collum and he waved play on. There is little doubt interim boss Lee McCulloch has brought a greater solidity to this Kilmarnock side. Experienced campaigners such as Boyd, Smith and Gary Dicker, allied with talented youngsters such as Kristoffer Ajer, Greg Taylor and Jones playing in harmony, makes for an impressive unit pulling in the right direction. Had Imrie's chances found the net, this would have been a different story and Woodman deserves great credit in the Kilmarnock goal for denying the winger twice. On the evidence of this display, Killie should have more than enough to avoid the play-off place as well, but the future looks more precarious for Accies. Hamilton manager Martin Canning: \\"I have said the last few weeks that, even when you win, you can't get too high and where you lose you can't get too low. \\"It was a strange game, because we controlled large parts of the game and we didn't defend our box well enough. \\"I don't remember Kilmarnock having many attempts at goal. \\"Credit to Kilmarnock. When they got their goals, they defended properly, two or three fantastic blocks to stop us getting strikes away. \\"We have had a bit of bad luck, Dougie Imrie has hit the outside of the post and the inside of the post. It just wasn't to be today.\\" Interim Kilmarnock manager Lee McCulloch: \\"Delighted with that - I didn't know that [that his side cannot now finish 12th]. \\"The focus has just been ourselves. It's not been anyone up above us or down below us. \\"It's about coming into training every day and getting better every day.

So , with that in mind , how has your summer been since we last talked ? Answer the following question: What may be the reason for animosity ?","output":"Animosity can arise from various reasons in different situations. In interpersonal relationships, animosity may stem from misunderstandings, unaddressed conflicts, jealousy, or competition. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, I will explore several potential causes for animosity: 1. Misunderstandings: Sometimes, animosity can develop because of a simple miscommunication or misunderstanding. It is natural for people to have different opinions and perspectives, but if these are not clearly expressed or understood, conflicts and resentment can build up. 2. Unaddressed Conflicts: Animosity might arise when conflicts or disagreements are not adequately resolved between individuals. This can happen when parties avoid confrontation or communication, leading to unresolved issues and negative emotions festering under the surface. 3. Jealousy: When one person perceives another as having advantages or benefits they feel they deserve, jealousy can ensue and fuel animosity. This jealousy might be related to personal, social, or professional factors, such as recognition, achievements, or relationships with others. 4. Competition: Often, animosity arises out of a sense of competition, be it professional or personal. The desire to outperform others can create feelings of resentment and hostility if not managed healthily. 5. Ego: At times, individuals with high egos may not take constructive criticism or setbacks well, leading to resentment towards those who are identified as instigators of these “attacks.” This can result in animosity between the involved parties. 6. Different Values and Beliefs: People with distinct cultural, social, or religious backgrounds, values, and beliefs may not see eye to eye on particular issues, leading to disagreements and potentially animosity. 7. Past Traumas or Grudges: Animosity can be rooted in past experiences or negative encounters with specific individuals. These lingering emotions cause resentment and hostility to affect present interactions. 8. Personality Clashes: Some personalities just do not mix well, as differences in temperament, communication styles, and demeanor can provoke animosity.  9. Lack of Empathy: In certain situations, one party may perceive the other as insensitive, uncaring, or dismissive. This perception can foster feelings of animosity between individuals as the aggrieved party may feel disrespected or unheard. 10. Unfair Treatment: Perceived unfair treatment or discrimination can be a significant cause of animosity. People who feel that they are not being treated equally or justly tend to harbor negative feelings towards those they deem responsible. In conclusion, various factors might contribute to animosity between individuals. Different personalities, values, experiences, or emotions can lead to conflicting opinions or misunderstandings that cause friction. It is essential to engage in open communication, display empathy, and actively work toward conflict resolution measures to address animosity, repair relationships, and maintain harmonious interactions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Question: Barend was: Options:  A. handsom kid  B. boring looking kid  C. not enough information  D. smart kid Answer:","output":"B. boring looking kid"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte.  The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat.  One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride.    Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice.  Mia left for Malaysia.  Two years after, when Allan  finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy.  It was now Mia's turn to make a choice.  She chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family. Even though she honestly knew in her heart that she still loved Allan. Allan did not lose hope.  He patiently waited for Mia for another three years.  He firmly believed that she would come back to him as predicted by the old man earlier in the story.  True enough, the Malaysian guy let Mia go as he was aware of who Mia truly wanted and her intention of choosing him over Allan.  On the very same date foreseen by the old man, Mia returned to the Philippines, saw Allan waiting for her, and embraced each other.

How do you do this: How to make your lava for your DIY lava lamp?","output":"To make the lava for your DIY lava lamp, follow these step-by-step instructions. Each step is justified for the efficient and safe creation of the lava effect. Step 1: Gather materials 1.1. Collect a clear plastic or glass bottle, preferably with a smooth and cylindrical shape. (Ensures better visibility for the lava effect.) 1.2. Acquire food coloring or liquid watercolor (helps create the desired color for the lava). 1.3. Obtain vegetable oil or a lighter oil such as baby oil (creates the separation needed for the lava effect). 1.4. Get water (serves as the other medium for the lava to move through). 1.5. Collect an antacid tablet, preferably one that dissolves easily (provides the bubbling effect that moves the lava). 1.6. Optional: LED light, flashlight, or other light source (enhances the visual effect of the lava lamp). Step 2: Prepare the bottle 2.1. Thoroughly clean the bottle, ensuring there's no residue (provides a clear viewing experience for observing the lava effect). 2.2. Fill the bottle about ⅓ to ¼ full with water (provides proper space for the oil and lava effect to occur without spilling). Step 3: Add oil 3.1. Carefully pour the oil into the bottle, leaving about an inch or so of empty space at the top (this allows room for expanding when the antacid reacts, and provides the medium through which the lava effect will happen). 3.2. Wait for the oil and water to separate completely (this is crucial, as the separation creates the lava motion). Step 4: Add color 4.1. Add a few drops of food coloring or liquid watercolor to the bottle (creates a colorful lava effect and makes it easy to see the movement of the lava). 4.2. Wait for the color to spread and mix with the water at the bottom (the oil and water won't mix, ensuring the color remains in the water). Step 5: Create the lava effect 5.1. Break the antacid tablet into smaller pieces (allows for a controlled release of bubbles). 5.2. Drop one piece of the antacid tablet into the bottle (the tablet will begin to dissolve in the water, creating bubbles. These bubbles will carry the colored water upward into the oil, creating the lava effect). 5.3. Continue adding pieces of the antacid tablet to maintain the lava effect (make sure to add them one at a time, to prevent the reaction from becoming too strong). Step 6: Lighting (optional) 6.1. Position your LED light or flashlight underneath the bottle, shining up through the bottom (enhances the visual effect of the lava lamp, making it more striking and vibrant). That's it! Now you have a homemade lava lamp with a captivating lava effect. Enjoy watching your lava flow, and feel free to experiment with different colors and bottle sizes to achieve various lava lamp designs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation.  Paragraph: Both Alabama and Florida boast great wetlands. The State of Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system due to expansion of farmlands. Their neighboring state Florida had similar system. But recently Florida had dismantled many of their drainage systems, mostly because of pressure from different environmental groups.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Alabama have stable or declining waterfowl species? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that Alabama would likely have declining waterfowl species. The paragraph mentions that the expansion of drainage systems had led to significant negative ecological impacts, including the decline of hundreds of thousands of wetland species as their habitat became increasingly fragmented and destroyed. This decline was mainly caused by loss of breeding habitat due to agricultural expansion. In the case of Alabama, the state experienced extensive drainage system development as a result of the expansion of farmlands. This would suggest that Alabama's wetlands also experienced habitat degradation, fragmentation, and destruction, similar to other regions where drainage systems were expanded. On the other hand, Florida recently dismantled many of its drainage systems, mostly due to pressure from environmental groups. This action presumably has helped to alleviate some of the negative impacts on wetland species in that state. However, the paragraph does not provide any information about Alabama taking similar steps to dismantle or mitigate the effects of its drainage systems on wetlands and waterfowl species. Given the ecological background and the specific situation in Alabama, it is reasonable to conclude that waterfowl species in the state would likely be experiencing declines. The significant drainage system expansion would have led to habitat loss and degradation, which in turn negatively impacts the population and stability of waterfowl species. In order to address this issue, Alabama would need to take measures similar to Florida, such as dismantling or mitigating the impacts of their drainage systems to protect and restore vital wetland habitats for waterfowl and other species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both of the sentences convey the same message in that both individuals—Board Chancellor Robert Bennett and Mr. Mills—refused to comment on personnel matters. However, they express the message with slightly different sentence structures and contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Board Chancellor Robert Bennett declined to comment on personnel matters Tuesday, as did Mills,\\" the sentence tells us that Robert Bennett, referred to by his official title, chose not to comment on personnel matters. Additionally, the sentence also informs us that this decision occurred on Tuesday. The phrase \\"as did Mills\\" informs us that Mills, too, did not wish to discuss personnel matters. In this sentence, Mills is not directly quoted but is mentioned in the context of Bennett's actions. In the second sentence, \\"Mr. Mills declined to comment yesterday, saying that he never discussed personnel matters,\\" we learn that Mr. Mills made the decision not to comment on personnel matters. In this instance, the sentence uses \\"yesterday\\" instead of a specific day of the week. Unlike the first sentence, Mr. Mills is directly quoted in the second sentence, revealing his personal explanation for declining to comment: \\"he never discussed personnel matters.\\" In summary, both sentences communicate the same core message—neither Robert Bennett nor Mr. Mills were willing to comment on personnel matters.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What are some real life ghost stories? What are some real stories that made you believe in ghosts?","output":"While these questions appear to be similar at first glance, they are subtly different in their emphasis and the types of responses they are likely to generate. 1. \\"What are some real life ghost stories?\\" This question asks for actual accounts or narratives involving ghosts or supernatural occurrences. It focuses on the stories themselves, with the implicit assumption that these ghost stories are based on real-life events. Respondents to this question may be more inclined to share ghost stories they have heard or read about, rather than limiting themselves to their own personal experiences. Examples might include historical ghost stories, urban legends, or incidents recounted by others. Overall, this question seeks to gather a collection of ghost stories that supposedly happened in real life. 2. \\"What are some real stories that made you believe in ghosts?\\" This question is more personal and directs the focus to the impact these stories had on the respondents by making them believe in ghosts. This question assumes that the respondent didn't necessarily believe in ghosts initially but was convinced by certain stories they came across or experienced themselves. As such, it is more likely to elicit personal anecdotes and testimonials, rather than widely circulated or well-known ghost stories. The emphasis in this question is on the power of the story to influence beliefs and potentially change the way people perceive the supernatural. In this case, the stories shared should have a strong personal meaning for the respondents, having left a lasting impression on them. In conclusion, both questions explore the world of ghost stories and paranormal experiences, but with different perspectives – the first question focuses on the stories themselves, while the second question is more interested in the impact those stories had on people's beliefs. As a result, the answers to each question may overlap to some extent, but the way they are framed and presented will differ based on the emphasis of the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\"  I am facing a new situation today: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time.  Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to die after this event? A:","output":"Based on the background article and the situation you have described, Michael, who was directly exposed to high doses of radiation due to the explosion while replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor, is more likely to die after this event.  The background article explains that high doses of radiation result in Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), with symptoms like skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and ultimately, death. This is consistent with the level of exposure that Michael experienced, being in the direct vicinity during the explosion.  In contrast, Robert was in the adjacent room when the incident happened. This means he was exposed to a smaller, or lower dose of radiation. While any amount of radiation can increase the chance of cancer and genetic damage, the risk of immediate life-threatening conditions as with ARS is significantly lower compared to a high dose exposure. Still, Robert should undergo medical evaluations and treatment to mitigate long-term effects as much as possible. It is important to consider, however, that calculating the exact risk and chance of health issues caused by ionizing radiation is complex and estimates are not precise. Scientists use models based on population data from past nuclear incidents such as Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl, but the International Commission on Radiological Protection admits that there are uncertainties and lack of precision in these models.  Thus, overall, the risks are higher for Michael due to his direct, high dose exposure. Nonetheless, both Michael and Robert need immediate medical attention to address and monitor the health effects of the radiation exposure."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

JPop star shaves her head and issues tearful YouTube apology because she spent night with a man      By Agence France-Presse      Friday, February 1, 2013 7:59 EDT      A Japanese starlet who shaved her head and issued a tearful YouTube apology after spending the night with a man was scrambling Friday to redeem the girl next door image of all-female group AKB48.      Pictures of the roughly-shorn head of Minami Minegishi, 20, were emblazoned on national newspapers and Japan’s Twitter scene was abuzz Friday over news that the pop princess had broken the band’s cardinal rule: No Dating.      A sobbing Minegishi told fans she had decided to shave her head as an act of contrition after a popular weekly magazine published claims of a night of passion with a 19-year-old boy band member.      “I don’t believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don’t want to quit AKB48,” she says in the video, which had been viewed on YouTube more than three million times.      Minegishi, who had long, silky hair at the time, was snapped leaving the apartment of Alan Shirahama, a dancer in an off-shoot of the popular boy band Exile.      Tabloid magazine Shukan Bunshun published its article Thursday, and hours later Minegishi was pleading to be allowed to remain with AKB48, one of the world’s most successful acts by revenue.      The tryst was “thoughtless and immature” she told fans.      “If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band. Everything I did is entirely my fault, I am so sorry.”      AKB48, a 90-strong pool of girls in their teens and early 20s, is a money-printing juggernaut that makes much of the accessibility — and the implied availability — of its idols.      Fans have frequent opportunities to meet their favorites, who are rotated in and out of the public eye, according to popularity.      In return for their chance to grace television screens, subway adverts and the covers of Japan’s countless celebrity magazines, members of the collective must adhere to strict rules of behavior.      They are allowed to have “one-sided romantic feelings” for a boy but can never progress beyond hinting at their crush — and must never disabuse their legions of male fans that they might one day stand a chance with their fantasy woman.      In June last year, another AKB48 member, Rino Sashihara, 20, made a pained apology after a magazine article revealed her free-wheeling history with a boy. She was demoted to a regional sub-group as a punishment.      While much is made of their supposed innocence, the band is heavily marketed on its sex appeal, with skimpy outfits and coquettish smiles the order of the day.      A television commercial in which the girls seductively passed candy from mouth to mouth was a huge hit, despite — or because — of its homoerotic overtones, which sparked complaints from more conservative sections of society.      Most recently, a photograph that showed naked former AKB48 member Tomomi Kasai with a young, apparently Caucasian or Eurasian child cupping her breasts, set off police probe and led to the pulping of about 670,000 copies of a popular weekly magazine.      Watch the video, published to YouTube on Jan. 31. ||||| As pop star misdemeanours go, Minami Minegishi's was tame in the extreme – breaking her group's strict dating ban to spend a night with her boyfriend.      Yet hours after a magazine published photographs of her leaving his home last month, Minegishi, a member of the wildly popular girl band AKB48, went on to YouTube to issue a tearful apology.      \\"As a senior member of the group, it is my responsibility to be a role model for younger members,\\" she said, before ending the four-minute mea culpa with a deep, lingering bow.      The most striking thing about her apology, however, was her appearance. She had shaved her head, a traditional act of contrition in Japan, but perhaps a step too far for a 20-year-old woman whose \\"crime\\" was to have found herself a boyfriend – 19-year-old Alan Shirahama, a dancer in a boyband.      Minegishi explained she had decided to cut off her long hair immediately after seeing her photograph, her face hidden behind a surgical mask and a baseball cap, in the weekly tabloid Shukan Bunshun on Thursday.      Her dramatic gesture underlined the strict rules to which Japan's young pop stars must adhere to project an image of unimpeachable morals.      In the YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 3m times, Minegishi said the assignation has been \\"thoughtless and immature\\".      \\"If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band,\\" she said. \\"Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry.      \\"I don't believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don't want to quit AKB48.\\"      AKB48's management agency demoted her to \\"trainee level\\" starting on Friday, according to the band's official blog.      Minegishi is among the original members of the band, which since it formed in 2005 has built up a huge following among teenage girls and salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands with their idols.      The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, has had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than £126m in CD and DVD sales in 2011.      Together, the AKB48 stable has more than 230 members in their teens and early 20s, with four main bands and several offshoots. Their act is more saccharine than sexual, but the band has courted controversy off-stage in the past year.      In 2012, a TV commercial in which the girls seductively passed confectionery from mouth to mouth attracted complaints, and earlier the same year one of the singer's mothers was arrested for allegedly having sex with a minor.      Last month, police launched an investigation after a weekly magazine ran a photo of a young boy cupping the breasts of the former AKB48 member Tomomi Kasai. The publisher was forced to destroy about 670,000 copies of the magazine. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Japanese pop star Minami Minegishi, a member of the all-female group AKB48, shaved her head and issued a tearful YouTube apology for spending a night with a man, breaking the band's cardinal rule of no dating.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Billy bought pencils and put them in his what? Possible A: classroom, kitchen sink, backpack, cabinet, store  Why is \\"backpack\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Backpack\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because in a typical context, people carry pencils in backpacks, especially when referring to a student like Billy.  Step 1: Analyze the context of the question The question involves a person (Billy) purchasing pencils, which are primarily used for writing purposes. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers in relation to the context - Classroom: While pencils are often used in classrooms, the question specifically asks where Billy put the pencils after purchasing them, making this a less likely option. - Kitchen sink: It's unusual to store pencils, especially newly purchased ones, in a kitchen sink. This choice is not aligned with common sense. - Backpack: A backpack is a common item used by students and others to carry personal belongings, including school supplies like pencils. This choice aligns with the human common sense because it is a typical location for storing pencils. - Cabinet: While a cabinet can potentially store pencils, it is less likely for a student like Billy to put his newly purchased pencils directly into a cabinet. Backpacks are more closely related to students and their school supplies. - Store: If Billy already bought the pencils, it doesn't make sense that he would put them back in the store. This answer contradicts the premise of the question. Step 3: Conclude based on the evaluations Based on the evaluations, \\"backpack\\" is the most fitting answer aligned with human common sense, as it is a typical context for storing pencils, particularly for students like Billy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To use a screwdriver, follow these simple steps: 1. Pick the right screwdriver: There are different types of screwdriver heads, like flat-head and phillips-head. Make sure to pick the one that matches the screw you want to turn. 2. Hold the handle: The screwdriver has a handle at one end and the metal part, called a blade, at the other end. Hold the handle with your hand. 3. Line up the blade: Place the blade in the groove (the line) on top of the screw. Make sure it is snug and fits well. 4. Turn the screwdriver: - If you want to put the screw in, turn the handle clockwise (like going from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock on a clock). Keep turning until the screw is tightly in place. - If you want to remove the screw, turn the handle counter-clockwise (like going from 12 o'clock back to 9 o'clock). Keep turning until the screw comes out. Remember to be gentle and patient while using the screwdriver, so you don't hurt yourself or damage the screw."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sentence 2: Unfortunately, this disc is blank. Possible answers:  (a). yes.  (b). it is not possible to tell.  (c). no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Answer: (c). no. The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To provide a detailed explanation for this conclusion, let's dissect both sentences and compare their meanings. Sentence 1: 'And this disc...this disc has a message for Peter Greuze. In this sentence, the statement asserts the existence of a disc with the specific purpose of containing a message intended for Peter Greuze. This sentence implies that the disc has some kind of content recorded on it, whether it's an audio message, a written message, a video, or any other mode of communication. Sentence 2: Unfortunately, this disc is blank. In this second sentence, it is mentioned that the disc is blank, which means it does not contain any message or recorded data. This sentence opposes the first sentence's idea, as it states that the disc lacks any embedded content. Now, when we consider the possible answers to the question of whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we must analyze the relationship between the sentences. (a). yes. This answer would imply that the second sentence logically follows from the first sentence, which is not the case, as the first sentence suggests the presence of a message on the disc while the second one denies it. (b). it is not possible to tell. This answer suggests that not enough information is available to determine whether the second sentence is necessarily true or false based on the information provided in the first sentence. However, we can ascertain a relationship between the two sentences, as mentioned earlier. (c). no. This answer correctly reflects the relationship between the two sentences. The second sentence does not logically follow from the first sentence, as they present contradicting information regarding the disc's content. The first sentence indicates that the disc is intended for Peter Greuze and has a message for him, while the second sentence declares that the disc is blank and therefore does not contain any message. In conclusion, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they present opposing information about the disc's content. The correct answer to this question is (c). no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \\"gun rights\\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.

This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against. It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset.

Instead, the author indirectly links the \\"Nixon administration\\" to the Buell school shooter. This is because the author suggests that the \\"war on drugs\\" begun under the Nixon administration has contributed to the drug-related issues that may have played a role in the Buell shooting incident.

Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. In the UK, they have had six number one albums and 13 top 20 singles, including two number ones.  - Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars is the third studio album by British big beat musician Fatboy Slim. It was released on 6 November 2000 through Skint Records. It features Macy Gray, Ashley Slater, Bootsy Collins, Roland Clark, Jim Morrison, and Roger Sanchez as guest contributors. The album's title, mentioned in the single \\"Weapon of Choice\\" is an allusion to the Oscar Wilde quote \\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars\\".  - Skint Records is a Brighton based dance music record label owned by JC Reid, Tim Jeffery and Damian Harris. It was created as a sublabel of Loaded Records, also founded by Reid and Jeffery. Along with Wall of Sound, the label was a leader in the big beat music scene of the mid to late 1990s.   - Roland Clark is a house music DJ, producer, songwriter and vocalist. In the past, he has used the aliases Jesus Jackson, Digital Pimps, Dark Clark, South Street Player, and is also founding member of the dance music project Urban Soul. He learned how to write songs from his childhood mentor Calvin Gaines.  - Breakbeat as a term refers to one of two distinct things. Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well.  - Propellerheads were a British big beat musical ensemble, formed in 1995 and made up of electronic producers Will White and Alex Gifford. The term \\"propellerhead\\" is slang for a nerd, and when Gifford and White heard a friend from California use this in a conversation, they thought it would be the perfect name for their band.  - The Prodigy are an English electronic music group from Braintree, Essex, formed by Liam Howlett in 1990. The members were originally Liam Howlett (keyboardist and composer), Keith Flint (dancer and vocalist), Maxim (MC and vocalist), Leeroy Thornhill (dancer and occasional live keyboardist), and a female dancer and vocalist called Sharky, however, both Leeroy and Sharky left the band for different reasons.  - Big beat is an electronic music genre that usually uses heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns - common to acid house. The term has been used since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe music by artists such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Cut La Roc, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada.  - \`\` Sunset ( Bird of Prey ) '' is a song by the British big beat artist Fatboy Slim , released from his 2000 album Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars . The single peaked at No. 9 in the UK and No. 77 in Switzerland . The song samples Jim Morrison 's vocals from the Doors song \`\` Bird of Prey .

As the \\"British Hit Singles & Albums\\" book duly noted \\"they surfaced from the underground house scene, are regular transatlantic club chart-toppers and won the BRIT Award for Best Dance Act in 2002 and 2004\\".  - Lee Potter (born 4 January 1972), known by his stage name Cut La Roc, is a British electronic musician, considered as a pioneer of big beat, a genre fusing elements of  hip hop, house and rock  - Macy Gray (born Natalie Renée McIntyre; September 6, 1967) is an American R&B, jazz and soul singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actress, known for her distinctive raspy voice, and a singing style heavily influenced by Billie Holiday.  - Acid house is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. The style was defined primarily by the deep basslines and \\"squelching\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes.

The Anglo-Norman Lord of Glamorgan, like all Marcher lords, ruled his lands directly by his own law: thus he could, amongst other things, declare war, raise taxes, establish courts and markets and build castles as he wished, without reference to the Crown. These privileges were only lost under the Laws in Wales Acts 15351542. Though possessing many castles, the main seat of the Lordship was Cardiff Castle.  - Joan of Acre (April 1272  23 April 1307) was an English princess, a daughter of King Edward I of England and Queen Eleanor of Castile.

At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Early modern Europe is the period of European history between the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century. Historians variously mark the beginning of the early modern period with the invention of moveable type printing in the 1450s, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the end of the Wars of the Roses in 1487, the beginning of the High Renaissance in Italy in the 1490s, the end of the \\"Reconquista\\" and subsequent voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas in 1492, or the start of the Protestant Reformation in 1517. The precise dates of its end point also vary and are usually linked with either the start of the French Revolution in 1789 or with the more vaguely defined beginning of the Industrial Revolution in late 18th century Britain.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of .

They are alternatively known as \\"ancient counties\\".  - Gilbert de Clare , 8th Earl of Gloucester , 7th Earl of Hertford , 10th Lord of Clare , 5th Lord of Glamorgan ( c. 10 May 1291 -- 24 June 1314 ) was an English nobleman and a military commander in the Scottish Wars . In contrast to most English earls at the time , his main focus lay in the pursuit of war rather than in domestic political strife . He was the son of Gilbert de Clare , 7th Earl of Gloucester , and Joan of Acre , daughter of Edward I. The older Gilbert died when his son was only four years old , and the younger Gilbert was invested with his earldoms at the young age of sixteen . Almost immediately , he became involved in the defence of the northern border , but later he was drawn into the struggles between Edward II and some of his barons . He was one of the Lords Ordainers who ordered the expulsion of the king 's favourite Piers Gaveston in 1311 . When Gaveston was killed on his return in 1312 , Gloucester helped negotiate a settlement between the perpetrators and the king . Now one of Edward 's strongest supporters , he accompanied the king on a campaign to Scotland in 1314 , when several other nobles refused . He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June , under somewhat unclear circumstances . Gloucester was the most prominent of the casualties of the battle , which ended in a humiliating defeat for England . As he had no issue , his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family . His estates were divided between his three sisters , one of whom was married to the king 's new favourite , Hugh Despenser the Younger . Despenser 's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales led directly to the troubles of Edward II 's later reign , including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches , the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge , and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326 .  - County borough is a term introduced in 1889 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (excluding Scotland), to refer to a borough or a city independent of county council control.

In the Republic of Ireland they remain in existence but have been renamed \\"cities\\" under the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 re-introduced the term for certain \\"principal areas\\" in Wales. Scotland did not have county boroughs but instead counties of cities. These were abolished on 16 May 1975. All four Scottish cities of the time  Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow  were included in this category. There was an additional category of large burgh in the Scottish system, which were responsible for all services apart from police, education and fire.  - Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 7th Earl of Gloucester, 3rd Lord of Glamorgan, 9th Lord of Clare (2 September 1243  7 December 1295) was a powerful English noble.

From 1974 until 1996 it was also an administrative county with a county council.   - A favourite or favorite (American English) was the intimate companion of a ruler or other important person. In medieval and Early Modern Europe, among other times and places, the term is used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, especially in Spain, England, France and Sweden.   - Glamorgan or, sometimes, Glamorganshire (or ) is one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales and a former administrative county of Wales. It was originally an early medieval petty kingdom of varying boundaries known as Glywysing until taken over by the Normans as a lordship.

The name also survives in that of Vale of Glamorgan, a county borough.  - A petty kingdom is a kingdom described as minor or \\"petty\\" by contrast to an empire or unified kingdom that either preceded or succeeded it (e.g. the numerous kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England unified into the Kingdom of England in the 10th century, or the numerous Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland unified under the Kingdom of England as the Kingdom of Ireland in the 16th). Alternatively, a petty kingdom would be a minor kingdom in the immediate vicinity of larger kingdoms, such as the medieval Kingdom of Mann and the Isles relative to the kingdoms of Scotland or England or the Viking kingdoms of Scandinavia.

Hypothesis: A man playing cards in Las Vegas. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that the man is playing cards in Las Vegas. While it is possible that the scenario could occur in Las Vegas, there are several missing elements and assumptions that need to be addressed before we can make such a conclusion. First, let us consider the elements of the premise: 1. A man in a dog outfit: This could potentially occur at any location, not necessarily specific to Las Vegas. The man's choice of attire may not be indicative of the setting. 2. Playing at a card table: The presence of a card table indicates a potential gambling situation, which is a common association with Las Vegas. However, card tables can be found at other casinos or even at private card-gaming events throughout the world. Therefore, the card table alone is insufficient evidence to conclude the Las Vegas location. 3. A bemused woman and dealer: Their reactions could again happen at any location and do not provide strong evidence towards the hypothesis. The bemusement might arise from the man's choice of attire or the atmosphere of the game itself but does not necessarily point to Las Vegas. To conclude the hypothesis, we would need more contextual information regarding the setting or specific details that directly link the scenario to Las Vegas. Some examples of such specific details could be: 1. Distinctive and identifiable Las Vegas landmarks or recognizable establishments in the background, such as the famous Las Vegas Strip or specific casino names. 2. The presence of certain games that are synonymous with Las Vegas such as poker, blackjack, or roulette, alongside a description or indication that these games are being played within a Las Vegas casino. 3. Conversations or references among the characters that directly mention or imply their location in Las Vegas. Given the lack of these contextual details in the premise, we cannot conclude the hypothesis that the man is playing cards in Las Vegas specifically. The scenario could occur in a variety of locations, spanning from local social event in a home to other casinos outside of Las Vegas. We would need more solid evidence tied to Las Vegas to support the hypothesis effectively."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Pedestrian facilities include retail shops, museums, mass events (such as festivals or concert halls), hospitals, transport hubs (such as train stations or airports), sports infrastructure (such as stadiums) and religious infrastructures. The transport mode in such infrastructures is mostly walking, with rare exceptions. Can we infer the following? Pedestrian facilities are important.","output":"Yes, we can infer that pedestrian facilities are important, as they cater to a diverse range of human needs and are essential to the functioning of cities and communities. The significance of pedestrian facilities can be analyzed from multiple perspectives, including urban design, economic, social, and environmental aspects. Here is a detailed explanation of the importance of pedestrian facilities: 1. Urban design perspective: Well-designed pedestrian facilities promote walkability, which is a crucial aspect of sustainable urban design. By encouraging people to walk more, pedestrian facilities help reduce congestion, noise, and pollution in urban areas. Walkable cities are generally more liveable, as they provide a desirable environment for residents and visitors alike. 2. Economic perspective: Pedestrian facilities support the local economy by fostering commercial vitality and contributing to job creation. Retail shops, museums, and other attractions located within pedestrian-friendly areas tend to see increased footfall, resulting in higher revenues and a vibrant economy. Moreover, pedestrian facilities can help attract tourists, boosting the tourism industry. 3. Social perspective: Pedestrian facilities play an essential role in fostering social interaction. Spaces such as parks, squares, and plazas allow people to gather, converse, and engage in activities, thereby strengthening social connections and a sense of belonging to a community. Additionally, mass events such as festivals and concerts can bring people together, promoting cultural exchange and social cohesion. 4. Accessibility: Well-connected and accessible pedestrian facilities allow people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds to access various public services and amenities, such as hospitals, schools, and religious institutions. This ensures a more inclusive and egalitarian society, as it allows everyone to enjoy equal opportunities. 5. Health perspective: Regular walking is associated with various physical and mental health benefits. By offering safe and attractive pedestrian facilities, cities encourage their residents to adopt a more active lifestyle, which can help reduce the prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, walking is associated with reduced stress levels and improved mental well-being. 6. Environmental perspective: Pedestrian facilities contribute to environmental sustainability by promoting walking as a mode of transportation. This reduces the dependency on motor vehicles, leading to lower CO2 emissions, decreased air pollution, and less consumption of non-renewable resources. 7. Heritage and cultural preservation: Pedestrian facilities that incorporate elements of cultural and historical significance can help preserve a city's unique character and identity. By creating opportunities for people to explore and appreciate their surroundings on foot, cities can instill a sense of pride in their cultural heritage and promote sustainable tourism. In summary, pedestrian facilities play a vital role in enhancing the overall quality of life in urban areas by addressing various economic, social, health, environmental, accessibility, and cultural needs. Their significance cannot be overstated, as they contribute to the creation of more sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant cities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

How to seal and stain pressure treated wood decking  Remove staining, mildew and old finish with a commercial deck cleaning solution.  Pressure washing is almost always a must on older decks, but be sure not to use too much pressure. You can damage the wood if it's turned up too high. Available options: [i] Scrape away old finish with a rake. You can add wood putty to the first few inches of wood to make it easier to remove old finish. [ii] A continuous stream of water, or a powerful jet air stream, will blot away too much staining or warping. If you have a full deck, wet a cloth and wipe down the entire area thoroughly. [iii] Similarly, you can rust the wood by using too much grease. Once the stain has dried to the level of rust on all sides, scrape the stain with a deck scraper, tenderizer, or similar tool until it is off. [iv] Usually 1500-2500 psi is adequate for pressure treated lumber. Stay between 1200-1500 psi for cedar and redwood.","output":"[iv] Usually 1500-2500 psi is adequate for pressure treated lumber.

Option [iv] is the correct answer as it provides guidelines for the proper pressure range depending on the type of wood. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: [i] Scraping away old finish with a rake is inappropriate for this stage and adding wood putty is not necessary for removing old finish. At this point, the focus should be on letting the deck dry before applying sealer and stain. [ii] Using a continuous stream of water or a powerful jet air stream may cause more damage to the wood and prolong the drying process. The deck has already been washed with the appropriate pressure.

Use the following highlights to write an article: LaGuardia scored 91 out of 100 on the overall frustration scale. Newark Liberty International not far behind on 90.1. Vancouver International provides least frustrations, scoring only 17.6. Article:","output":"Title: LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International Top List of Frustrating Airports, While Vancouver International Keeps Travelers Happy Introduction: Air travel can be a stressful experience for many, but it seems that certain airports are more likely to contribute to passenger frustrations than others. A recent survey has ranked LaGuardia Airport in New York and Newark Liberty International in New Jersey as some of the most frustrating, while Vancouver International comes out as the airport with the least frustrations. LaGuardia's High Frustration Score: LaGuardia Airport received a staggering score of 91 out of 100 on the overall frustration scale. This result may not come as a surprise to many, given the airport's infamous reputation for delays, cancellations, and crowded terminals. Furthermore, LaGuardia's constant construction projects have only added to the chaos, leaving passengers feeling more agitated as they navigate the often confusing and congested environment. Newark Liberty International's Close Second: Not far behind LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International scored a 90.1 on the overall frustration scale. Newark has long been plagued with similar issues as LaGuardia, frequently experiencing delays, cancellations, and over-crowding. With few amenities and limited options for dining or shopping, it can be challenging for passengers to keep themselves entertained during these delays. As a result, travelers passing through Newark Liberty International are often left feeling frustrated and eager to continue on their journey. Vancouver International's Impressive Low Frustration Score: On the other end of the spectrum, Vancouver International Airport came out as the location providing the least amount of frustrations for air travelers, scoring an impressive 17.6. Not only does the airport boast a beautiful interior and efficient facilities, but it has also prioritized customer service and cleanliness. This dedication to providing a comfortable environment has resulted in a significantly lower frustration score for passengers, making their travel experience a more enjoyable one. Conclusion: It is clear that certain airports, like LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International, only exacerbate the inherent stresses of air travel. Meanwhile, airports like Vancouver International have demonstrated that destinations can prioritize efficiency, customer service, and cleanliness to create an environment that allows passengers to have a better overall travel experience. As we continue to see global demand for air travel rise, it is crucial for airport administrators to take note of these findings and invest in improvements that will not only keep their passengers satisfied but also lower their overall frustration scores."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Fëanor is a fictional character from J.

Q: Fact1: Basava lives with brother, Fact2: brother treat him as own son, Fact3: brother start seeking girl as bride, Fact4: auditor is working with Pampathy, Fact5: engagement is fixed with vagabond son of Pampathy A:","output":"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the hills and a peacefully flowing river, lived a young man named Basava. He was not just dear to his family, but also loved by everyone who knew him in the village. Fact 1: Basava lives with his brother Basava lost his parents when he was barely a teenager, but his elder brother, who worked as a farmer in their ancestral farmland, stood by him like a rock. Though the brother grieved the loss of their parents, he always put a brave face for Basava to ensure that he doesn't feel sad. He was not only a guide but also a father figure to Basava. Basava always found solace in the care of his brother and sister-in-law. Fact 2: Brother treats him as his own son As the years passed, Basava's elder brother took up the role of a father and nurtured him with love and care. He took it upon himself to make sure that Basava received a good education and was always well-provided for. Basava never felt the absence of his parents in the loving care of his brother. He referred to his brother as 'Bade Papa,' which translates to 'Elder Father.' Fact 3: Brother starts seeking a girl as a bride for Basava Now in his mid-twenties, Basava had transformed into a handsome and fine young man. It was time for him to get married and start a family. His brother, the ever-vigilant guiding figure in his life, took to the task of finding a suitable bride for him. Word was sent across the village and nearby towns through matchmakers and friends. Amidst the long list of possible matches, they visited many families in search of the perfect bride for Basava. The love and dedication he had for his brother equaled the pride he had for his prized bull, a symbol of prosperity in the village. He was very cautious as he sought to find a partner who would complement and stand by Basava in every stage of life. Fact 4: Auditor is working with Pampathy In the neighboring town, there lived a well-known and wealthy landowner named Pampathy. People in the village admired Pampathy for his success and congenial nature. He had vast lands and multiple businesses that led to the employment of many people from the region, ensuring their well-being. One of them was an auditor who managed Pampathy's financial records and helped in keeping his affairs in order. Fact 5: Engagement is fixed with the vagabond son of Pampathy As luck would have it, Pampathy also had a daughter named Mridula. She was known for her unparalleled beauty and graceful demeanor. Upon hearing about Mridula, Basava’s brother could not rest until he had met Pampathy and introduced Basava to the family. They were instantly accepted, and the engagement was soon fixed. But there was one hitch – Pampathy had another child, a son who was considered the black sheep of the family. The son was known for his vagabond ways and indifferent behavior, but the family brushed his eccentricities under the carpet. Basava’s brother, willing to put up with the son given the prestige that came with a bond with Pampathy's family, agreed to the alliance. The village began to buzz with excitement as the news of Basava's engagement to Pampathy's daughter spread like wildfire. Preparations were underway to make this union a grand celebration, as everyone in the village wanted to be a part of this joyous occasion. However, life has its way of throwing curveballs, and in the days leading up to the engagement, rumors began to surface of previous misdeeds by Pampathy's vagabond son. This caused Basava's brother to become very cautious as he contemplated the consequences of this alliance. The brother's concern for Basava overpowered everything else, and with a heavy heart, he made a decision that would ensure his brother's happiness, come what may. The engagement was put on hold, and the loving brother resumed his search for the perfect bride for Basava. For all the sacrifices and love the brother poured onto Basava, destiny had a plan to reward their bond. Amidst their search, they eventually discovered a young lady named Meena – a kind soul with a golden heart, who made Basava and his family forget all their past troubles. Basava and Meena's love story was celebrated by one and all, their union heralding a time of great joy in the family. In the end, the efforts of Basava's brother proved fruitful, and the two brothers continued to share their lives, love, and dreams with each other – a testament to the indomitable power of brotherly love."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What animal's scientific name is Ursus Maritimus?","output":"Ursus Maritimus is the scientific name for the polar bear, which is also commonly known as the white bear or maritime bear. It is a carnivorous bear species native to the Arctic Ocean's surrounding seas and landmasses. This animal is the planet's largest land-dwelling predator and, along with the Kodiak bear, is one of the largest bear species. Polar bears are apex predators, with adults having no natural enemies. The species' name, Ursus Maritimus, is derived from Latin, where \\"Ursus\\" means bear, and \\"Maritimus\\" refers to the sea or coastal regions. This name reflects the polar bear's strong association with the Arctic's icy waters, sea ice, and coastal areas. Polar bears have several adaptations that allow them to thrive in the harsh Arctic conditions, such as their thick insulating fur, a layer of blubber for warmth, and large, flat paws with a rough-textured surface to aid in swimming and walking on ice. The polar bear's primary source of food is seals, particularly the ringed and bearded seals. They rely on sea ice as their hunting platform, where they often patiently wait near breathing holes or stalk seals resting on the ice. Polar bears are also known to scavenge on carcasses of marine mammals, such as whales, when available. These animals have an exceptional sense of smell that allows them to locate their prey across vast distances. Polar bear populations are spread across five nations: Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the United States (Alaska). There are approximately 19 subpopulations of polar bears within the circumpolar Arctic region, numbering approximately 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. However, their habitat and survival are being threatened by climate change, which has led to a rapid reduction and fragmentation of sea ice, posing a significant challenge for these ice-dependent animals. The decline in sea ice has reduced the polar bear's ability to hunt for food, thereby affecting its reproduction, body condition, and overall survival. Moreover, the reduced sea ice also results in more frequent encounters between humans and polar bears, increasing the risk of conflict. Due to these threats, the conservation status of the polar bear is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Numerous conservation efforts are being undertaken to save polar bears and their habitat, including international cooperation via the 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears and their Habitats, which is a treaty signed by the five polar bear range countries. Moreover, regulations are in place to curtail activities that endanger these animals, such as hunting quotas and restrictions. Long-term solutions, however, rely on addressing climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and implementing sustainable environmental practices to preserve the polar bear's habitat for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The name of the knife with a curved blade that is associated with the Gurkhas is called the Khukuri (also spelled as Kukri). The Khukuri is not only a traditional weapon but also a vital utility tool used by the Gurkha people of Nepal and the Indian subcontinent. The Khukuri has a distinctive inwardly curved blade, which is designed for both chopping and slashing maneuvers. Its unique shape allows it to function as a versatile tool, suitable for various tasks ranging from farming and woodworking to hunting and butchering. The blade is typically 10 to 15 inches in length, with a wide and heavy end for generating powerful swings, while the narrow area near the handle provides excellent control for intricate work. The Gurkhas, a warrior class who hail from the mountainous regions of Nepal, have a long and illustrious history of using the Khukuri in times of conflict. Gurkha soldiers have been renowned for their bravery, loyalty, and fighting prowess, and have served as part of the British Army for over 200 years, in the famous Gurkha regiments. The Khukuri has a profound cultural and historical significance for the Gurkhas and the people of Nepal. It is a symbol of national pride, strength, and resilience. The art of crafting a Khukuri has been passed down through generations of skilled blacksmiths, known as \\"kamis.\\" These artisans take great care in forging the blade from high-quality carbon steel and typically use locally available materials such as wood, ivory, or buffalo horn for the handle. Customarily, the Khukuri also has a small accessory, known as a \\"karda\\" or \\"chakmak.\\" The karda is a small knife used for detail work, while the chakmak is a piece of steel used for honing the blade. Both of these can be found in a sheath alongside the main blade. The scabbard for the Khukuri is often made from leather or wood, which is adorned with a variety of decorations that reflect regional and cultural influences. In addition to its use in warfare and as a general-purpose tool, the Khukuri is also prevalent in religious and ceremonial events. It is considered a symbol of prestige and honor in Nepalese society and is often presented as a gift to recognize accomplishments or mark significant milestones. In summary, the Khukuri is a signature weapon and tool associated with the Gurkhas, featuring a curved blade and a rich history rooted deeply in Nepalese culture. Known for its versatility and effectiveness in combat, the Khukuri holds a special place in the hearts of its people and its crafting represents a cherished tradition that continues to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war.

The US was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden.

Answer the following question: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Well we're not married (yet), but one time my boyfriend playfully spanked me. Hard. I know he didn't mean to hurt me, but I was mad about it all. Day. Long. I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again. I definitely trust him, and he actually was being playful, but otherwise that has been the only “real” hitch we have come across. I mean, we argue, but that's only when either of us are mad, and it's usually over small stupid stuff. Like, really stupid stuff. We argued over traffic signs before, LOL. It always leads to me saying the argument is completely retarded and we drop it and just cuddle or something. Really not worth getting worked up about. Edit: Fixed some typos. I'm on my phone so my thumbs can't quite reach LOL. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How likely do you think it is that the writer's boyfriend will spank her again? Options:  A. He will probably hit her again soon.  B. not enough information  C. Not very likely.  D. He will definitely hit her. Answer:","output":"C. Not very likely.  The writer in the context clearly mentions that her boyfriend is very apologetic about his action and has made it a point not to do it again. She explains that he knows she was considering leaving him because of the incident, which implies that he understands the seriousness of his action. Because she trusts him and believes that he won't do it again, it indicates that it is not very likely that he will spank her again."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Campaigners say 50% of abusers are known to the child or are \\"persons in trust and care-givers\\"      A fast-track court in India has convicted two men of raping a 10-year-old girl who gave birth to a baby girl in August.      Both the men were the child's uncles. The sentencing is set for Thursday.      Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of a stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital.      The second uncle was arrested after the baby's DNA sample did not match that of his older brother, the first suspect.      The final arguments were completed by the defence on Monday. On Tuesday, the two men were declared guilty in court.      The older uncle's trial took a month, while the younger uncle has been convicted in a remarkable 18-day trial, BBC Punjabi's Arvind Chhabra reports from Chandigarh.      The harrowing case of the 10-year-old has made headlines for weeks, both in India and globally.      She was 30 weeks pregnant when a local court in Chandigarh turned down her abortion plea on the grounds that her pregnancy was too advanced. A doctors' panel had advised that a medical termination would be \\"too risky\\". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds.      Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger.      The girl was not aware of her pregnancy, and was told her bulge was because she had a stone in her stomach, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi. She gave birth in August and the baby was given away to child welfare authorities for adoption.      The girl initially told police and child welfare activists that she had been raped several times in the past seven months by the first uncle, who is in his 40s.      She had also testified to the court by video link and very clearly named the uncle and revealed details about her abuse.      The girl's father had told the BBC that the first uncle had not denied the charges against him. Police also said he had admitted to the allegations.      But after his DNA test results did not link him to the baby, police began searching for more suspects - and arrested the second uncle in September. A DNA test confirmed that he was the baby's father.      Image copyright AFP Image caption India is home to 400 million children (file picture)      The country's courts have received several petitions in recent months, many from child rape survivors, seeking permission to abort.      In most cases, these pregnancies are discovered late because the children themselves are not aware of their condition.      In September, a 13-year-old girl was given court permission to terminate her pregnancy at 32 weeks. The boy she was carrying was born alive in Mumbai but died two days later.      In May, a similar case was reported from the northern state of Haryana where a 10-year-old, allegedly raped by her stepfather, was allowed to abort. She was about 20 weeks pregnant, doctors said.      None of the girls can be named for legal reasons.      The scale of abuse in India      A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours      More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015      240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18      53.22% of children who participated in a government study reported some form of sexual abuse      50% of abusers are known to the child or are \\"persons in trust and care-givers\\"      Sources: Indian government, Unicef ||||| Watching her favourite cartoon on television at home, little did the 10-year-old rape victim know that just in a few hours a local court will seal the fate of her two maternal uncles, who raped her and one of them impregnated her at this tender age.      As the staff and judicial officer of the fast-track trial court prepared for the verdict — three-and-a-half months after the heinous crime came to light — and UT cops got ready to take the two accused to court from the high-security Burail jail, the girl was alone at her home in a southern sector of the city on Tuesday afternoon.      “I am unwell. So I did not go to school,” she said, even as she has been regularly attending the school after giving birth to a girl on August 17.      Her electrician father and mother, who works as a domestic help, were away for work, while her elder sister had gone to school.      Notwithstanding the trauma the family has gone through in the past months, they chose to skip the hearing.      In the evening, after the two accused had been convicted of rape, her mother — who was back from work by now — preferred to maintain privacy and drew the curtains of their one-room quarter.      Earlier, in court, the woman’s two cousins appeared expressional as additional district and sessions judge Poonam R Joshi held them guilty.      While the defence counsels appeared anxious, it seemed the duo didn’t even register what was happening.      Even as the wife of the younger uncle — who fathered the minor’s child — was present for the verdict, the family of his elder brother — who are in Nepal — gave the hearing a miss.      With the court giving its verdict, the two face up to life imprisonment. The quantum of sentence will be pronounced on Thursday.      The two have been found guilty under Section 376 (2) (f) (i) (n) — committing rape on a woman when she is under 12 years of age, a relative and it involves repeated intercourse — of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Sections 5(i) — penetrative sexual assault on the child more than once or repeatedly — and 6 — aggravated penetrative sexual assault — of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012.      The ordeal      It was on July 14 that doctors found the girl to be 30-week pregnant when her mother took her to hospital after she complained of a stomach ache. A local court dismissed the girl’s abortion plea, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court, as the doctors said the procedure would be too risky.      On the girl’s complaint, police arrested her mother’s cousin, who was a guard at a local hotel, for rape. But the case turned on its head when the DNA samples of the girl’s child — who took birth on August 17 — didn’t match with those of the uncle, as first reported by Hindustan Times on September 11.      Seventeen days later, police arrested the man’s younger brother, who turned out to be the main accused.      The girl told police that she was first raped by the younger uncle, a cook with the same hotel as his brother, around Christmas in 2016. The older uncle, too, assaulted her repeatedly from April till early July, she said. Initially, the girl didn’t name the younger uncle, fearing he would come good on his threat of killing her parents. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A fast-track court in India has convicted two men for raping a 10-year-old girl who gave birth to a baby girl in August.

From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, making us feel right at home. The staff was friendly, attentive, and professional throughout our dinner. Our server, Jane, was particularly informative regarding the menu and made spot-on recommendations for both appetizers and entrees. We started our meal with the Garlic Herb Focaccia, which was baked to perfection; crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. The freshness of the herbs used in the dish was notable and added a delightful aroma. For the entrees, I chose the Seared Salmon with Asparagus and a side of Lemon Herb Risotto. The salmon was cooked impeccably—tender and flavorful with a crisp, slightly caramelized crust. The risotto was creamy, perfectly seasoned, and had just the right amount of tanginess from the lemon. My partner opted for the Chicken Marsala with a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes. He particularly enjoyed how the Marsala sauce complemented the chicken without overpowering its natural flavors. The mashed potatoes were rich and smooth with a delightful hint of roasted garlic, which he found to be a fantastic addition. To round off our meal, we shared the Tiramisu for dessert. The layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone cream were expertly crafted, satisfying our craving for a sweet, yet not overly heavy, dessert. The ambience of the restaurant added to the overall enjoyment of our meal. The warm lighting and tasteful decor created a cozy, yet sophisticated atmosphere. Additionally, the spacing between tables allowed for lively conversation without feeling that we were disturbing other diners. The background music added to the pleasant experience without being too loud or intrusive. Though our dining experience was mostly enjoyable, there is a minor area to consider for improvement: the wait time for our main courses could have been a bit shorter. However, this did not significantly impact our overall satisfaction, and we would still highly recommend [Restaurant Name] for a memorable and delightful dining experience. In summary, my partner and I had a splendid time at [Restaurant Name]. The exquisite flavors and presentation of our dishes, combined with the pleasant atmosphere and attentive service, made this experience one to cherish. We are eagerly looking forward to our next visit and highly recommend this restaurant to others seeking a delightful and remarkable dining experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there.

Article: In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

Forbes reports that at least fifty rock stars have incomes between two million and six million dollars per year. \\"It doesn't make sense,\\" says Johnny Mathis, one of the older music millionaires, who made a million dollars a year when he was popular in 1950s. \\"Performers aren't worth this kind of money. In fact, nobody is.\\" But the rock stars' admirers seem to disagree. Those who love rock music spend about two billion dollars a year for records. They pay 150 million to see rock stars in person. Luck is a key word for explaining the success of many. In 1972 one of the luckiest was Kon Mclean, who wrote and sang \\"American Pie\\". Mclean writes his own music, so he earns an additional two cents on every single record of the song. Neil Young who performs in torn blue jeans, sometimes sings to an audience of 10,000, each of whom has paid five dollars for a ticket. After paying expenses, Young leaves with about  18,000 in his blue jeans at the end of an evening. How do the rock stars use their money? What do they do when the money starts pouring in like water? Most of the young stars simply show the money around. England's Elton John gave someone a  38,000 Rolls car and bought himself 5,000 pairs of eyeglasses, then lighted up and spelt :E-L-T-O-N. He also bought himself two cars, \\"one for each foot\\". Many rock stars live like Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane. Those performers return from a tour, pay their bills, and buy new toys. Then when they need money again, they do another tour. They save no money and live _ www.zxxk.com In the end the rock stars' life is unrewarding. After two or three years riches and fame are gone. Left with his memories and his tax problems, the lonely star spends his remaining years trying to attract strangers. New stars have arrived to take his place.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is this about? A computer program known as Brutus.1 is generating brief outbursts of fiction that are probably superior to what many humans could turn out.","output":"Brutus.1, developed in the 1990s by two researchers, Selmer Bringsjord and David Ferrucci, is an artificial intelligence-based computer program designed to generate brief outbursts of fiction, known as story generations, that are thought to be on par with or even superior to many human-authored literary works. The program's unique ability to create high-quality narrative texts has intrigued many, raising questions about both the technical aspects of this AI software and its potential implications for the field of creative writing. To thoroughly understand Brutus.1, we must first acknowledge its foundation in AI research. This program relies on a combination of knowledge representation, natural language processing (NLP), and logical theorem proving technologies. Knowledge representation entails encoding real-world knowledge in a way that enables machines to reason with that knowledge in a human-like way. NLP is the field responsible for breaking down human languages into forms that machines can understand, while logical theorem proving helps in constructing high-level human-like reasoning based on provided data and information. By utilizing these techniques, Brutus.1 was able to generate authentic and complex storylines that were difficult to distinguish from those composed by humans. The program was built around a specific genre of fiction: stories of betrayal. It was fed a set of rules associated with this theme, allowing it to generate narratives that are both engaging and contextually appropriate. This focus on one theme is essential for the success of Brutus.1, as it limits the narrative scope and requires a more precise understanding of relevant situations, characters, and relationships. The stories generated by Brutus.1 tend to consist of a central betrayal, often involving a friend or colleague, and the ensuing emotional and practical consequences. By drawing on its knowledge base, the program can create realistic characters with complex motivations and emotions. These characters interact and evolve within the narrative, creating unexpected twists and surprising outcomes that are characteristic of the betrayal genre. Arguably, the most significant implication of a program like Brutus.1 is its potential to transform the landscape of creative writing, as it challenges traditional notions of creativity and authorship. Critics argue that machines lack the emotional depth, personal experiences, and intuition that humans draw upon when crafting impactful stories, while proponents of AI-generated literature claim that AI can become a valuable tool for writers by providing suggestions, ideas, and alternatives for their work. In conclusion, Brutus.1 is a pioneering computer program in the field of AI-generated fiction that uses advanced technologies, such as knowledge representation, natural language processing, and logical theorem proving, to create engaging stories focused on betrayal. By generating high-quality narratives that rival human-authored stories, this program not only demonstrates the growing potential of AI in the world of creative writing but also ignites a broader conversation on the role of machines in the creative process and the nature of authorship in the age of artificial intelligence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film opens with a dazzling, attention-grabbing sequence where protagonist Jake Reynolds, played by Tom Carter, attempts to save the Midtown Mall from an imminent terrorist attack with the assistance of his trusted squad. However, this promising start quickly devolves into a heavy-handed and unnecessarily convoluted plot that lacks both creativity and depth. Director John Daniels misses the mark, failing to capitalize on a brilliant premise that could have been the perfect breeding ground for captivating exploits and character development. Instead, audiences are subjected to a disorienting mix of gratuitous explosions, slapstick humor, and exposition-filled dialogue that fails to deliver on the edge of your seat excitement one would expect from a film of this genre. To make matters worse, the villainous character archetypes also feel overstated and worn out—robbing the film of any sense of genuine peril or intrigue. Carter's portrayal of Reynolds lacks nuance and intensity, giving us a shallow and one-dimensional protagonist in an already floundering storyline. His uncanny ability to jump headfirst into danger yet somehow always land on his feet left me questioning how he was ever in danger at all. The supporting cast fails to fare much better - portraying poorly scripted and cookie-cutter characters with little backbone or motivational depth. While the cinematography and visual effects in Meltdown at Midtown are highly commendable, they are ultimately left undermined by a disjointed and unimpressive narrative. The movie's run-time of 145 minutes feels painfully long and overdrawn, considering its lack of substance. As the film nears its climax, even the most ardent action movie fans will find themselves struggling to maintain an interest level that the plodding storyline fails to sustain. In conclusion, Meltdown at Midtown is a prime example of a missed opportunity, and a disappointment for action movie enthusiasts. It's a film that relies too heavily on well-trodden stereotypes and squanders the potential for a unique and engaging story. While certain visual elements of the movie may temporarily mask its glaring shortcomings, they ultimately cannot save it from being forgettable and uninspiring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They are particularly scornful of a certain \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears.

Background: Huey Pierce Long Jr. (August 30, 1893 - September 10, 1935), self-nicknamed The Kingfish, was an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and as a member of the United States Senate from 1932 until his assassination in 1935. As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. He established the long-term political prominence of the Long family. A Democrat and an outspoken populist, Long denounced the wealthy elites and the banks. Context: Once in office as governor on May 21, 1928, Long moved quickly to consolidate his power, firing hundreds of opponents in the state bureaucracy, at all ranks from cabinet-level heads of departments and board members to rank-and-file civil servants and state road workers. Like previous governors, he filled the vacancies with patronage appointments from his own network of political supporters. Every state employee who depended on Long for a job was expected to pay a portion of his or her salary at election time directly into Long's political war-chest, which raised 50,000 to 75,000 (equivalent to about 700,000 to 1,000,000 in 2013 dollars) each election cycle. The funds were kept in a famous locked \\"deduct box\\" to be used at Long's discretion for political and personal purposes. The American historian David Kennedy wrote that the extremely authoritarian regime Long established in Louisiana was \\"... the closest thing to a dictatorship that America has ever known\\".  Once his control over the state's political apparatus was strengthened, Long pushed a number of bills through the 1929 session of the Louisiana State Legislature to fulfill campaign promises. These included a free textbook program for schoolchildren, an idea advanced by John Sparks Patton, the Claiborne Parish school superintendent, and the Long confidant, Representative Harley Bozeman of Winnfield. Long also supported night courses for adult literacy (which taught 100,000 adults to read by the end of his term), and a supply of cheap natural gas for the city of New Orleans.  Long began an unprecedented public works program, building roads, bridges, hospitals, and educational institutions. Huey P. Long's reign of legislation brought textbooks, a highway, natural gas heating to New Orleans, and buildings still standing at LSU. His bills met opposition from many legislators, wealthy citizens, and the media, but Long used aggressive tactics to ensure passage of the legislation he favored. He would show up unannounced on the floor of both the House and Senate or in House committees, corralling reluctant representatives and state senators and bullying opponents. These tactics were unprecedented, but they resulted in the passage of most of Long's legislative agenda. By delivering on his campaign promises, Long achieved hero status among the state's rural poor population.  When Long secured passage of his free textbook program, the school board of Caddo Parish, home of conservative Shreveport, sued to prevent the books from being distributed, saying it would not accept \\"charity\\" from the state. Long responded by withholding authorization for locating an Army Air Corps base nearby until the parish accepted the books.  In the 1930 legislative session, Long proposed another major road-building initiative as well as the construction of a new capitol building in Baton Rouge. The State Legislature defeated the bond issue necessary to build the roads, and his other initiatives failed as well.  Long responded by suddenly announcing his intention to run for the U.S. Senate in the Democratic primary of September 9, 1930. He portrayed his campaign as a referendum on his programs: if he won he would take it as a sign that the public supported his programs over the opposition of the legislature, and if he lost he promised to resign. Long defeated incumbent Senator Joseph E. Ransdell, an Alexandria native from Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish, by 149,640 (57.3 percent) to 111,451 (42.7 percent).  Although his Senate term began on March 4, 1931, Long completed most of his four-year term as governor, which did not end until May 1932. He declared that leaving the seat vacant for so long would not hurt Louisiana; \\"with Ransdell as Senator, the seat was vacant anyway.\\" By not leaving the governor's mansion until January 25, 1932, Long prevented Lieutenant Governor Paul N. Cyr, a former ally, from succeeding to the office. A dentist and geologist from Jeanerette in Iberia Parish, Cyr had subsequently broken with Long and been threatening to roll back his reforms if he succeeded to the governorship. In his autobiography, Long recalled:  On another occasion the greatest publicity was given to a charge made by Lieutenant Governor Cyr that I had performed a swindle worse than that of Teapot Dome in the execution of an oil lease ... The oil lease in question had been made by Governor Parker, and no act had been taken by me, except to permit the holder to enter into a drilling contract. Our reply was practically buried by most of the newspapers.  Long continued to maintain effective control of Louisiana while he was a senator, blurring the boundary between federal and state politics. Though he had no constitutional authority to do so, Long continued to draft and press bills through the Louisiana State Legislature, which remained in the hands of his allies. He made frequent trips to Baton Rouge to pressure the Legislature into enacting his legislation. The program included new consumer taxes, elimination of the poll tax, a homestead tax exemption, and increases in the number of state employees. While physically in Louisiana, Long customarily stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, where he was fond of the Sazerac Bar (see Peychaud's Bitters). According to Thomas M. Mahne in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Long had a personal interest in seeing to the quick construction of Airline Highway (US 61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans as the new road cut 40 miles from the trip.  Long's loyal lieutenant, Governor Oscar K. Allen, dutifully enacted Long's policies. Long berated the governor in public and took over the governor's office in the State Capitol when visiting Baton Rouge. On occasion, he even entered the legislative chambers, going so far as to sit on representatives' and senators' desks and sternly lecture them on his positions. He also retaliated against those who voted against him and used patronage and state funding (especially highways) to maneuver Louisiana toward what opponents called a Long \\"dictatorship\\". Having broken a second time after earlier reconciliation with the Old Regulars and Mayor Walmsley in the fall of 1933, Long inserted himself into the New Orleans mayoral election of 1934. A second rift hence developed with the city government that lasted even until after Long's assassination.  In 1934, Long and James A. Noe, an independent oilman and member of the Louisiana Senate from Ouachita Parish, formed the controversial Win or Lose Oil Company. The firm was established to obtain leases on state-owned lands so that its directors might collect bonuses and sublease the mineral rights to the major oil companies. Although ruled legal, these activities were done in secret, and the stockholders were unknown to the public. Long made a profit on the bonuses and the resale of those state leases and used the funds primarily for political purposes.  By 1934, Long began a reorganization of the state government that reduced the authority of local governments in anti-Long strongholds New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Alexandria. It further gave the governor the power to appoint all state employees. Long passed what he called \\"a tax on lying\\" and a 2 percent tax on newspaper advertising revenue. He created the Bureau of Criminal Identification, a special force of plainclothes police answerable only to the governor. He also had the legislature enact the same tax on refined oil that in 1929 had nearly led to his impeachment, which he used as a bargaining chip to promote oil drilling in Louisiana. After Standard Oil agreed that 80 percent of the oil sent to its refineries would be drilled in Louisiana, Long's government refunded most of these tax revenues. Question: what else did he do during 1932?. Whats the answer?","output":"In 1932, Huey Long continued to exert his influence on Louisiana state politics while serving as a U.S. Senator. He maintained effective control over the state by drafting and pushing bills through the Louisiana State Legislature, which was dominated by his allies. Long made frequent trips to Baton Rouge to pressure the legislature into enacting his legislation. His program during this time included new consumer taxes, elimination of the poll tax, a homestead tax exemption, and increases in the number of state employees. While physically in Louisiana, Long stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans and took a personal interest in the construction of the Airline Highway (US 61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, as the new road reduced the distance by 40 miles. During this time, Long's loyal lieutenant, Governor Oscar K. Allen, continued to implement Long's policies in Louisiana. Long publicly berated Allen and didn't hesitate to literally take over the governor's office in the State Capitol during his visits to Baton Rouge. Long's aggressive tactics extended to entering the legislative chambers and directly addressing representatives and senators to pressure them on his positions. Long also focused on consolidating his power and retaliating against his opponents at the state and local levels. In 1932, Long continued his efforts to establish control over local governments, particularly in anti-Long strongholds like New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Alexandria. He passed legislation that not only reduced the authority of these local governments but also gave the governor the power to appoint all state employees. In conclusion, Huey Long's actions in 1932 were primarily focused on maintaining his control over Louisiana and advancing his political agenda. This was achieved through a mix of new legislation, increasing state control, and aggressive tactics to secure the passage of his favored bills and suppress opposition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

You can't just choke someone who's sleeping!\\") that still plays to the sticks.      The show was developed for NBC, Fey's longtime home, and after promoting it for its midseason schedule, the network very politely shunted it to Netflix. Reading between the corporate-speak, it seemed NBC was too ill-equipped to promote a comedy actually designed to be funny. That \\"Kimmy Schmidt\\" was embraced so eagerly by Netflix, with its zeitgeist-y hits \\"Orange Is the New Black\\" and \\"House of Cards,\\" should have been the ultimate vote of confidence.      But \\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\" is a little less than the sum of its parts. Written with sunny, silly Ellie Kemper (Erin from \\"The Office\\") in mind, the series opens in an underground bunker where doomsday cultist Rev. Richard Wayne Gary Wayne has been keeping four women locked up for 15 years. Kimmy is one of the \\"Indiana mole women,\\" as they are dubbed after their rescue. After their cursory \\"Today\\" show appearance (\\"Thank you, victims!\\"), she decides to press her luck in the Big Apple.      She finds a roommate in Titus Andromedon (\\"30 Rock\\" alum Tituss Burgess), a failed actor so flamboyant he couldn't get cast as a straight giraffe in \\"The Lion King,\\" and a boss in Jenna Maroney, er, Jacqueline Voorhes (Parsippany native Jane Krakowski), a wealthy, out-of-touch Upper East Side trophy wife who hires Kimmy to watch her sociopath-in-the-making young son and troublesome teenage stepdaughter.      Kemper is delightfully daffy in this modern Mary Tyler Moore role, oozing wonder as she discovers the marvels of the new millennium -- matching tattoos? \\"It's real popular, like taking pictures of your food and being biracial\\" -- and tries to catch up with all that she's missed since middle school. Slang. Windows. \\"Dancing is all about the butts now!\\"      I could quote \\"Kimmy Schmidt\\" all day. (Okay, one more: \\"I'm pretty and tough, like a diamond. Or beef jerky in a ball gown.\\") So why am I not nuts about it? It's funnier than most of what's on television these days, but it never coalesces into something spectacular.      There are hints of a much darker comedy rooted in Kimmy's underground saga -- when she tries to convince Jacqueline that she can get through anything if she can get through 10 seconds of it ... and then another 10 seconds, or when a plastic surgeon comments on Kimmy's untouched-by-the-sun skin and distinctive \\"scream lines.\\"      But the show seems much more content to watch Kemper banana-peel her way through modern life and pick herself back up again. And again. And again.      Krakowski is wonderful as always, but Jacqueline's cluelessness about how the other 99 percent lives hits the exact same notes as \\"30 Rock\\"'s Jenna. Even a fine cameo by Martin Short as a renowned (and rubberized) plastic surgeon -- \\"Sidney built Mariah Carey from scratch!\\" -- feels like a rerun of \\"30 Rock\\" quack Dr. Leo Spaceman.      The set-up and humor was clearly too out of step with NBC's current sensibilities, and perhaps the first six episodes I viewed reflects an attempt to moderate the show's essential weirdness for broadcast television. The move to Netflix came as Fey and Carlock were editing the back half of the 13-episode order, and Netflix also ordered a second season. \\"30 Rock\\" took a little time to find its footing, and maybe we'll see a more fully-realized series emerge eventually.      After all, as Titus, himself a refugee from small town Mississippi, tells Kimmy, \\"Escaping is not the same as making it.\\"      Grade: B+      Vicki Hyman may be reached at vhyman@njadvancemedia.com.

All 13 episodes are available for streaming on Friday 6 March on Netflix.      What is this show? Kimmy Schmidt (Bridesmaids’ Ellie Kemper) is one of four women rescued from an underground bunker after being imprisoned for 15 years by a crazy polygamist cult leader. When she emerges she knows nothing of the world and has to figure out how to live in New York. Oh, and it’s a sitcom.      Seriously? It doesn’t sound funny. Well, then you know nothing about doomsday cult survivors.      What’s the show’s pedigree? Tina Fey and fellow 30 Rock veteran Robert Carlock created the show as a 13-episode series for NBC. They decided that they didn’t want it, so NBC sold it to Netflix, which loved it so much they already ordered a second season.      Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Ellie Kemper stars in Tina Fey's sunny sitcom Read more      How does a show transition from NBC to Netflix? It is a dodgy move and the show retains the 22-minute format that network sitcoms share, including being broken down into acts. Some work has been done to smooth over where the commercial breaks would have gone, but it follows a familiar rhythm. Also, there are no swear words or anything that dirty – which is refreshing.      What happens in the premiere? Kimmy and three of her fellow “wives” are rescued from a bunker in Indiana. They had been living there in isolation for the past 15 years after the madman who kidnapped them told them that the apocalypse had happened and they were the only humans left alive.      On a trip to New York to do an interview with Matt Lauer (of course), Kimmy decides that rather than go back to Indiana, that she wants to stay in New York where no one knows she is a “mole woman”. She finds an apartment being rented by Lillian (Carol Kane) who comes with a roommate, Titus (Tituss Burgess), who describes himself as the gay Tiki Barber. Now that she has a home she has to pay the rent and stumbles into the job as a nanny for the rich, vain, selfish and slightly sad Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). Kimmy welcomes her new life with a smile that can only belong to someone who has yet to learn that both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston are now dead.      Is this show any good? If Kimmy Schmidt knew what emoji are, she would describe it as sun, sun, crossout, rain cloud, smiley face, winky face, dancing woman, paint your nails. But Kimmy Schmidt does not know what emoji are (yet) so let’s just say that it is very good and rather funny. Most of the comedy comes from the fact that Kimmy doesn’t know anything about the modern world, and what she does know is incorrect, but she states it with kind the pluck and sincerity that makes you wish she was right. This is a girl who wears light-up sneakers and doesn’t say she was kidnapped but “tooken”.      That kind of attention to detail and fine characterisation will feel familiar to 30 Rock fans. It’s not just the presence of Krakowski, playing a more moneyed version of Jenna Maroney, that make this feel like an unofficial sequel to 30 Rock, but the patterns of Tina Fey’s comedy so evident in the writing. When Kimmy accidentally tries to strangle her roommate while sleepwalking she says his neck was covered in grease. “I fell asleep eating a Hot Pocket,” he retorts. If that’s not something that Liz Lemon already said, it certainly sounds like it.      What differentiates it from 30 Rock, however, is the darkness just below the surface. As unwaveringly happy as Kimmy is, she still tries to strangle her roommate because she’s having a dream about being locked in a bunker. She has an unexplained fear of Velcro and when a man tries to flirt with her and puts his hands over her eyes and says, “Guess who?” she flips out. Making Kimmy deeply damaged but still inspirational and funny is a difficult line to walk, but this show manages it with aplomb.      Which characters will you love? Pretty much everyone. Kimmy, of course, is a weird ray of warped sunshine that will warm your heart. Next to Julia Louis-Dreyfuss on Veep, Kemper as Kimmy is perhaps the best comedic performance on television. Her roommate Titus is a catchphrase slot machine, the hilarious jackpots rolling out with some regularity. And, finally, good on Fey and the other producers for finally bringing Carol Kane back to television.      Which characters will you hate? Xanthippe (Dylan Gelula) is the boss’s 15-year-old stepdaughter who is out to expose Kimmy’s secret. She sort of plays the villain but is drawn as such a wonderfully obnoxious tweeting teen that you can’t help being amused by her.      What’s the best thing about it? It’s all the little things. The chyrons on all the fake news segments about finding the “mole women” are hilarious, as are Kimmy’s malapropisms (she calls hashtags “hashbrowns”). This is the sort of show that could benefit from multiple viewings, because the jokes are so packed in you’re sure to miss something while laughing.      What’s the worst thing about it? The end of each episode after just 22 minutes.      Should you watch this show? I can think of nothing better than sitting through all 13 episodes in a row on a rainy afternoon when you need something to live for. That something is a cult survivor who lives in a closet in a basement apartment in Brooklyn. Just trust me. ||||| BINGEWORTHY      Lightning strikes twice for Tina Fey.

In fact, we want our characters so dark and brooding—and wry and crude—that we’ve even forced TV’s brightest minds to flee the shackles of broadcast television to streaming services like Netflix in order to explore the depths of their depravity more fully.      So it’s rather surprising that from Netflix, the network that’s given us Kevin Spacey’s devil in the Oval Office and Litchfield Prison’s ward of disturbed inmates, we’re given TV’s best new character. Her name is Kimmy Schmidt, and her defining characteristic is the brightest, most joyous ear-to-ear smile you’ve ever seen.      It’s not an eerie, deranged smile, either. It’s not the grin of a doofus. It’s genuine. It’s pleasing. And, on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Netflix’s new series available for streaming Friday, it’s not being mocked. Instead, it’s inviting us to smile back. Which you do. Quite often.      Given pop culture’s obsession with sarcasm and the idea that no bad deed should ever go punished, it’s quite the progressive creative decision to infiltrate all that moodiness with a TV show centered on happiness and positivity. Leave it to Tina Fey to cook up a TV binge that we can feel good about devouring.      Created by Fey and her 30 Rock co-genius Robert Carlock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt opens on a moment of sheer bliss in the midst of horrific circumstances.      There’s Ellie Kemper (The Office, Bridesmaids) as Kimmy, eyes wide and smile wider, as she puts the star on a Christmas tree. She turns to her friends to talk about Secret Santa presents. It’s only when the group of women begins singing together that we’re clued in to the darkness that surrounds them.      “Apocalypse, apocalypse, we caused it with our dumbness,” they sing, to the tune of “O Christmas Tree.”      A few quick cuts later, the girls are rescued from the bunker they’ve been living in for 15 years as members of Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne’s doomsday cult. They’re whisked away to New York, where they appear on the Today show and are interviewed by Matt Lauer about their experience as the “Indiana mole women.”      The next two minutes sets the tone of the entire series: a high-concept premise, Fey’s signature kooky-sharp writing, and an overtone of sadness and injustice that is ka-pow powered through by Kemper’s relentlessly sunny—though still impressively shaded—performance. (There’s a reason Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt sounds like a superhero.)      Lauer quizzes each of the mole women on how they fell prey to the cult in the first place. “The reverend had bought some of my hair on Craigslist, and we started emailing and I just thought he had some real good ideas,” says one. “I had waited on Reverend Richard at a York Steak House I worked at and one night he invited me out to his car to see some baby rabbits, and I didn’t want to be rude, so…here we are,” says another.      “I’m always amazed at what women will do because they are afraid of being rude,” Lauer deadpans. (Lauer deserves a Guest Actor Emmy nod for this scene, and that’s no exaggeration.)      The segment quickly ends, and the mole women are ushered out of the studio by a producer handing them gift bags and shouting, “Thank you, victims! Good luck!” And yet, in spite of all this crass treatment and negativity, Kimmy Schmidt decides to make a go of it. She’s going to stay in New York.      There, basically, is your plot. A woman who literally hasn’t seen the light of day in 15 years is going to live, work, and create a life for herself in the harshest, most unforgiving city in the country. She’s more excited than Jessie Spano on caffeine pills, and barely even scared.      Kemper imbues Kimmy with a sense of wonder that recalls Will Ferrell in Elf, Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30, and Tom Hanks in Big, but is a comedic tour de force in her own right.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason      She cheerfully runs alongside joggers, because, in her mind, why wouldn’t one be stoked to be running outside? She laughs at an automatic sink faucet turning on with the mad gaiety of Julia Roberts receiving pearls in Pretty Woman. She has candy for dinner and is generally confused by modern society, but in a curious and cute rather than scared kind of way.      Obliviousness is a funny color on her, too. “Where is your grownup?” she asks a little boy after seeing him steal candy. “Are you alone? Or are you some kind of tiny businessman, sir?”      The boy leads her to his mom, an Upper East Side narcissist named Jaqueline Voorhes, played by Fey’s 30 Rock secret weapon, Jane Krakowski (she’s just as lethal here). Jacqueline promptly hires Kimmy to be her son’s nanny, and proceeds to steal every scene she’s in with delicious one-liners sending up the vapid and needlessly opulent New York rich.      It would be easy to draw comparisons between Krakowski’s self-involved Jacqueline on Kimmy Schmidt and Krakowski’s self-involved Jenna on 30 Rock, were it not for one obvious difference: Unlike Jenna, Jacqueline very clearly is not a terrible person. But then again, it would be easy to draw comparisons between much of Kimmy Schmidt and 30 Rock.      Tonally, the shows look and feel are very similar. They both explore our cultural tics and skewer our oft-unintended self-centeredness. They both fire off zeitgeisty wordplay as if the actors are rapid-fire comedy rifles. And Kimmy’s sense of humor echoes that of 30 Rock’s: toeing the mainstream line, but living in that precarious wobble off-center. It’s what gives both shows their edge.      But, more impressively, both put clever spins on the tired “single gal in the city” trope.      The conceit should be dried up at this point, having perhaps wrung the last bit of cleverness out of it with Fey’s hapless Liz Lemon as the one trying to have it all. But seeing the world through Kimmy’s blindly optimistic eyes is a welcome counterpoint to the worn-down jadedness of Liz, and it’s a testament to Kemper’s performance that Kimmy’s pluckiness doesn’t seem retrograde, or grating.      She’s not Pollyanna. She’s got a 'tude. She’s spunky and she’s defiant, which is why you have no doubt that she’s gonna make it after all. Her spirit fingers cheerleading her new lease on life have a high-functioning middle one, too, and it’s directed at anyone hell-bent on destroying her fresh opportunity.      Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was originally developed for NBC before the network eventually passed and it went to Netflix, reportedly because they found the whole thing to be too unusual for network TV.      As the episodes progress and Titus Burgess, who plays Kimmy’s new roommate, and Carol Kane (!!!), who plays her new landlord, blossom into the kind of endearing kooks we’re used to Fey peppering her shows with, it’s easy to see why Netflix is the perfect home for the series. Who knows what kind of stereotypes NBC would have flattened their characters into, or even Krakowski’s for that matter?      Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt doesn’t take advantage of the freedom of Netflix to ramp up nudity or profanity or moral depravity, as other series do. Instead it uses the creative breathing room to dial up and embrace the show’s inherent weirdness—this is a comedy about a cult survivor, after all—and then have the luxury to bring things back to a relatable, human level again.      As a sum of its parts, this series shouldn’t need a ringing endorsement to pique anyone’s interest in it. (Hello, this is a comedy from Tina Fey and starring the trio of Ellie Kemper, Jane Krakowski, and Carol Kane. They could be watching paint dry and we’d all be on board.)      Nonetheless, it can’t be oversold how big a win this is for Fey and Carlock, who prove themselves just as adept at characterizing a protagonist’s joie de vivre as they are at crafting a woman content with merely working on her night cheese. Going the route of happy when everyone else is veering dark, they’ve solidified themselves as not just bravura comedy writers—which we already knew they were—but industry risk-takers, too. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The articles discuss \\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\\" a comedy developed for Netflix by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. The storyline is centered on Kimmy Schmidt, played by Ellie Kemper, who after spending 15 years in an underground bunker with a doomsday cultist, decides to start a new life in New York. She becomes roommates with flamboyant failed actor Titus Andromedon, played by Tituss Burgess, and starts working for wealthy, out-of-touch Upper East Side resident Jacqueline Voorhes, played by Jane Krakowski. The show, while upholding Fey’s signature absurdist comedy and rapid-fire jokes, offers its own unique spin on the \\"single gal in the city\\" trope, highlighting Kimmy’s positive, unjaded perspective as a refreshing element within the series.

Several of the younger children ran to her as she came in, and stood holding fast to the folds of her black habit, staring up at the strangers, while she explained the kind of instruction given, the system, and the order reigning in each department.

Movie title: The First Grader Context: In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the Mau Mau Uprising against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Marugeâs education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback...","output":"Kimani Maruge is in the Guinness Book of World Records because he holds the world record for being the oldest person to start primary school. Born in 1920, Maruge decided to pursue an education at the age of 84, after the Kenyan government announced free primary education for all citizens in 2003. This incredible and inspiring story is portrayed in the movie \\"The First Grader,\\" directed by Justin Chadwick. In the movie, Maruge, played by Oliver Litondo, approaches the local school principal, Jane Obinchu (played by Naomie Harris), and expresses his desire to learn how to read. Despite facing ridicule and opposition from fellow teachers and education officials, Maruge is determined to continue his education. The movie showcases the various challenges he faces as an elderly student and the impact of his decision on the community, his fellow students, and the education system as a whole. Maruge's pursuit of education at his age captured the attention of the national and international media, highlighting the importance of literacy and education regardless of age, background, or life circumstances. His courage and determination to fight for education despite various setbacks led his story to be acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records and inspired many people around the world. In real life, Maruge's perseverance in pursuing an education at an advanced age had a profound impact on the Kenyan community and demonstrated the importance of equal opportunities in education, without age barriers. His story emphasizes the transformative power of education and the universal right of everyone to access quality education at any stage of life. By sharing Maruge's story through \\"The First Grader\\" and the recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records, more people have become aware of the significant role education plays in overcoming life's challenges and improving one's quality of life."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on bill cahill 's:    - death place     - heightweight     - clubs     - position     - years     - statsend     - originalteam     - death date       - birth date     - fullname     - name     - birth place     Bio: keyran william jack \`\` bill '' cahill -lrb- 3 december 1911 -- 7 march 1966 -rrb- was a sportsman who played australian rules football for essendon in the victorian football league -lrb- vfl -rrb- during the 1930s and represented tasmania at first-class cricket . cahill , a half back , won two tasman shields trophies while at northern tasmanian football association club launceston , in 1933 and 1936 . he struggled in his two seasons at essendon due to a shoulder injury and returned to launceston in 1939 where he was appointed captain-coach . he had earlier made four first-class appearances with tasmania in the 1931/32 season . one of those was against the touring south african team and he took the only wicket of his career when he dismissed all-rounder quintin mcmillan .

The Times was founded by publisher John Walter on 1 January 1785 as The Daily Universal Register, with Walter in the role of editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt because of the complaints of a Jamaican hurricane. Being unemployed, Walter decided to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later, it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because people always omitted the word Universal, Ellias changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to The Times. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name.

Please answer this question: Who was the captain of the French Team that won the FIFA World Cup on home soil in 1998?","output":"The captain of the French national team that won the FIFA World Cup on home soil in 1998 was Didier Deschamps. Born on October 15, 1968, in Bayonne, France, Deschamps had an esteemed career as a footballer, primarily playing as a defensive midfielder. His excellent tactical understanding, leadership skills, and tenacity on the field earned him the nickname \\"the water carrier\\" from his fellow teammates. Deschamps began his professional career with Nantes, where he played from 1985 to 1989. He then moved to Olympique de Marseille, where he enjoyed tremendous success, winning two French league titles (1990 and 1992) and captained the team to its first UEFA Champions League title in the 1992-1993 season. In 1994, Didier Deschamps joined Juventus in Italy. During his five-year stint with the club, he won three Serie A titles (1995, 1997, and 1998), one Coppa Italia (1995), one Italian Super Cup (1995), as well as one UEFA Champions League (1996) and one UEFA Super Cup (1996). Deschamps earned his first international cap for France in 1989. Eventually, he was named captain of the national team, leading Les Bleus during the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The tournament was special for the French team, as they hosted the event and were considered strong contenders. With a talented squad boasting players like Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Marcel Desailly, and Lilian Thuram, the French team was a force to be reckoned with. Under Deschamps' leadership, France advanced through the group stages and the knockout rounds with relative ease. In the final, they faced defending champions Brazil, who had stars such as Ronaldo, Rivaldo, and Cafu. Surprising many, France secured an emphatic 3-0 victory, with Zinedine Zidane scoring twice, and Emmanuel Petit adding the third goal. The 1998 World Cup triumph cemented Didier Deschamps' legacy as a standout captain and midfielder, and he retired from international football a year later. His distinguished playing career concluded in 2001 after two seasons with Valencia and a final season at Chelsea. Deschamps' success continued in his coaching career, which kicked off in 2001 with AS Monaco. He later managed Juventus, Olympique de Marseille, and currently, the French national team. Under his guidance, France finished as runners-up at the 2016 UEFA European Championship and then went on to win the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, making Deschamps only the third individual to have won the World Cup both as a player and a manager."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   In which case wildebeests would have lower risk of attack from the lions, case A or case B?  Kenya's Masai Mara wildebeest migration is one of the greatest spectacles in the natural world. Every year thousands of wildebeests cross the Mara river. John went to see the migration last year. He noticed that the wildebeests crossed the the river in a very large group. He noted that as case A. His guide told him that is not the case in other times of the year. The wildebeests cross the river in smaller groups in other times. John noted that as case B. The guide added that in both cases on thing is constant, they are attacked by the lions.  Hint: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, let's go through the information step-by-step. 1. The paragraph discusses Kenya's Masai Mara wildebeest migration, where wildebeests cross the Mara river. 2. John observed two cases:   a. Case A: Wildebeests crossed the river in a very large group.   b. Case B: Wildebeests crossed the river in smaller groups. 3.

Analyzing this information, we can conclude that the dilution effect would benefit the wildebeests in Case A, where they cross the river in a very large group.

She studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John, and successfully auditioned for Sujoy Ghosh's fantasy film Aladin (2009) her acting debut. She played the love interest of Riteish Deshmukh's character, a role based on the character of Princess Jasmine. and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN felt that she was: \\"easy on the eyes and appears confident but has precious little to do\\". Although the film was a critical and commercial failure, she won the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year - Female.  In 2010, Fernandez appeared opposite Deshmukh in the science fiction romantic comedy Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai. She was cast as a girl from Venus, who lands on Earth in search of love. The film, along with Fernandez's performance, received poor reviews; Rediff.com's Sukanya Verma noted: \\"She gamely makes a fool of herself whilst aping the actions of movie stars, ranging from Sridevi's Naagin dance, Mithun Chakravarthy's Disco Dancer moves, to Big B's violent headshake in Hum. Her Tara could be a keeper if only Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai wasn't so intent on turning her into a love-struck Barbie.\\" Critic Anupama Chopra also criticized Fernandez, calling her \\"a pin-prick on a balloon\\". Later that year, she made a special appearance in the song \\"Dhanno\\" for Sajid Khan's comedy Housefull.  Mahesh Bhatt's thriller Murder 2 was Fernandez's first commercial success and marked a turning point in her career. She took on the role of Priya, a lonely model who is in a confused relationship with Arjun Bhagwat (played by Emraan Hashmi). Fernandez was praised for her performance, and for the boldness and sex appeal she displayed in the film. Gaurav Malini of The Times of India stated that she was \\"tastefully tempting\\" but noted that her romance with Hashmi was \\"literally half-baked\\". The following year, Fernandez appeared in the ensemble comedy Housefull 2 alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham, and Asin. It became one of the top grossing productions of India that year and earned Rs1.86 billion (US28 million) worldwide. Fernandez received mostly negative reviews for her performance. While Gaurav Malini praised her for her looks, NDTV called her a \\"blathering bimbo\\" who \\"find[s] no pleasure in [her role]\\". Despite the negative reviews, Fernandez received a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 14th IIFA Awards for her performance.

Given the background: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.)  and the situation: John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude.  Answer the following question: Would fork A needed John to move it more or less quickly than fork B?

Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.  Paragraph: Bill was studying the states of matter. First, he selected a matter with low boiling point. He labeled it as matter A. To compare it with a well-known matter he selected water. He labeled it as matter B. He also selected ice, which he labeled as matter C. He is now better prepared to compare their states.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

In fact, you probably felt quite defeated when you first tried to do any serious climbing. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing are both extremely demanding and require practice to get good at. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding sports. There are three basic types of rock climbing. Top roping is the most common type and the climber need to climb with a partner. The second type, which is very similar to top roping, is called lead climbing. In both of the types, the climber can sit off the wall and rest on the rope. The third type is called bouldering. Bouldering is a type of free climbing without any ropes. This is the most demanding of all climbing types. The climber must be able to complete the climbing without taking a rest on the rope. Believe it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique. One of the major rules of rock climbing is to always have three points touching the wall, whether it is both feet and one hand, or one foot and both hands, as it is much easier to have your weight  cases will not do the climbing; they only hold you into the wall so that your legs are actually pushing you upward. Also, the closer you are to the wall, the easier it is to climb. Rock climbing may sound a bit too extreme for the everyday person, but it is really an amazing workout. Once you get into the sport, and learn how to position your body and rest your weight, then you can begin to deal with some difficult problems. The great thing about rock climbing is that it is mentally challenging as well. You are constantly analyzing the way your body moves and how to do certain moves on the wall. For anyone who wants to get into shape, rock climbing is a fun and effective way to exercise muscles. While climbing, it is much easier for a rock climber if he   _  .

If your dorm room is particularly cramped, use a tape measure to get the length, width, and height of both the room itself and each of your major furniture items. Doing this can help you better visualize the maximum amount of space you have. Can we draw the following conclusion? If your dorm room is particularly cramped, use a tape measure just to get the length, width, and height of the room itself. Choose from:  *Yes;  *It's impossible to say;  *No;","output":"No, we cannot draw that conclusion. In the given information, it is mentioned to measure not only the length, width, and height of the room but also the major furniture items. This crucial step helps you better visualize the space and create an effective layout plan for the dorm room. When arranging dorm room furniture, there are several steps to follow in order to create a comfortable and functional living space: 1. Measure your room and furniture: As mentioned earlier, it's important to measure the length, width, and height of both the room itself and each of your major furniture items (bed, desk, dresser, etc.). This will give you the exact dimensions and help you avoid overcrowding the room. 2. Create a floor plan: With the measurements in hand, either draw out a floor plan on graph paper or use a free online room planning tool to make a digital version. This will help you identify the best locations for your furniture and ensure that everything fits comfortably in the limited space. 3. Consider traffic flow and functionality: Keep in mind that you need to move freely through the room, accessing all furniture items without any obstacles. Consider where you'll get dressed, study, and sleep, and place furniture accordingly. 4. Optimize vertical space: To fully utilize the small space in a dorm room, use shelves, storage bins, and hanging organizers to make the most of the room's height. Wall-mounted shelves, bunk beds, and lofted beds can provide storage and free up floor space. 5. Create distinct zones: It's helpful to distinguish separate areas for study, sleep, and socialization. Arrange the furniture to create boundaries between various functions, which will make the room feel more intuitive and less cluttered. 6. Use multi-purpose furniture: Space-saving solutions such as futons, folding desks, and ottoman storage can serve multiple purposes and minimize the amount of space taken up by furniture. 7. Enhance the room's ambiance with lighting: Lighting can make a significant difference in the overall feel of the room. Make sure the desk has a good task light, and consider using floor lamps or string lights to create a cozy atmosphere.  In conclusion, to arrange dorm room furniture effectively, it is necessary to carefully measure both the room and the furniture pieces, in addition to considering traffic flow, optimizing vertical space, and creating distinct zones while placing each item. This approach will ensure a comfortable, functional, and cohesive living space in a cramped dorm room."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paragraph: On 1 June 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics announced a proposed “Significant New Use Rule” (SNUR) for asbestos, a mineral once widely used in the construction of buildings due to its flame-retardant properties but now uncontroversially considered a carcinogen. The necessity for such a rule, in general, stems from the fact that not all uses of asbestos are currently banned; some of them remain unregulated thanks to a 1991 court ruling. The asbestos uses the 2018 SNUR applies to are ones that had not been banned by earlier regulations and remained in active use at the time of the 1991 court ruling, but are no longer in use due to users’ desires to avoid contracting cancer or liability for causing cancer in others. The EPA refers to these uses as “currently unregulated former uses.” SNURs are a mechanism within the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that mandate specific EPA approval when a chemical is used in a significantly new way or in a significantly new mixture that “might create concerns.”: For asbestos, [the] EPA is proposing a SNUR for certain uses of asbestos (including asbestos-containing goods) that would require manufacturers and importers to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos. This review process would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of asbestos and, when necessary, take action to prohibit or limit the use. The TSCA is currently undergoing a major overhaul that began under the Obama administration and was reinterpreted in radically divergent ways under the Trump administration. When former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt (a Trump appointee who resigned amid accusations of misconduct) explained the proposed SNUR for asbestos, he described it as part of an “unprecedented” set of new protections against the dangers of asbestos which require manufacturers “to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos”. In their correspondence with us, the EPA stated that the proposed rule serves “to ensure that the manufacture, import, or processing for the currently unregulated former uses of asbestos identified in the rule are prohibited unless reviewed and approved by EPA.” According to critics, the problem with this position is twofold. The first problem concerns the way in which the current EPA has written the SNUR, which EPA staffers have privately worried does not allow for the ban of all currently inactive unregulated uses but instead only concerns 15 specific uses the EPA “believes” to be comprehensive and thus could allow for the continued legality of some now dormant uses. The second problem concerns the way in which the EPA has proposed to evaluate the risk of these “currently unregulated former uses”. In May 2018, the EPA published a document known as the “Problem Formulation of the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos,” which establishes the scientific approach the EPA will take in evaluating these new uses. Significantly, their approach will not include information from existing (or “legacy”) uses of asbestos, despite the significant body of work around health risks stemming from those uses: In the case of asbestos, legacy uses, associated disposals, and legacy disposals will be excluded from the problem formulation and risk evaluation … These include asbestos containing materials that remain in older buildings or are part of older products but for which manufacture, processing and distribution in commerce are not currently intended, known or reasonably foreseen. EPA is excluding these activities because EPA generally interprets the mandates under section TSCA § 6(a)-(b) to conduct risk evaluations and any corresponding risk management to focus on uses for which manufacture, processing or distribution is intended, known to be occurring, or reasonably foreseen, rather than reaching back to evaluate the risks associated with legacy uses, associated disposal, and legacy disposal, and interprets the definition of conditions of use in that context. E&E News reported that this approach may serve to severely limit the types of exposures the EPA will consider when formulating the potential risk of new uses for asbestos: Public health advocates believe EPA is inappropriately limiting its health reviews of chemicals to avoid considering the impacts of those already in the environment. But the agency hasn’t been swayed by their pushback … That means the agency won’t consider the dangers posed by, for example, asbestos-containing tiles, adhesives and piping in millions of homes and commercial buildings nationwide. According to the New York Times, the new rules will serve to narrow the ways in which asbestos itself is defined as well: Other changes identified in the E.P.A. documents narrow the definitions of certain chemicals, including asbestos. Some asbestos-like fibers will not be included in the risk assessments, one agency staff member said, nor will the 8.8 million pounds a year of asbestos deposited in hazardous landfills or the 13.1 million pounds discarded in routine dump sites. Three former EPA officials, including the former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, told the New York Times that such stipulations would necessarily create flawed analyses of the threat posed by any chemical currently being re-evaluated by the EPA: Three former agency officials, including a former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, said that the E.P.A.’s approach would result in a flawed analysis of the threat presented by chemicals. “It is ridiculous,” said Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, who retired last year after nearly four decades at the E.P.A., where she ran the toxic chemical unit during her last year. “You can’t determine if there is an unreasonable risk without doing a comprehensive risk evaluation” … The most likely outcome of the changes will be that the agency finds lower levels of risks associated with many chemicals, and as a result, imposes fewer new restrictions or prohibitions, several current and former agency officials said. Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, argued that former EPA head Scott Pruitt was undermining a bipartisan push to reform the TSCA that began under President Obama. “Congress worked hard in bipartisan fashion to reform our nation’s broken chemical safety laws, but Pruitt’s E.P.A. is failing to put the new law to use as intended,” he said in a statement. President Trump spoke on the topic of asbestos long before his election to the White House. In his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback, Trump argued that the chemical is actually safe once applied and suggested that the link to health problems was manufactured by mob-connected companies which perform asbestos removal: “I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented.” While it is true that the uses of asbestos discussed in the 2018 SNUR are currently legal, their health and litigation risks have rendered them effectively dead. The current administration has established a process for some of those uses to be granted formal approval by the EPA if they pass a safety review many scientists find flawed. For these reasons, we concur with the leaked opinion of EPA lawyer Mark Seltzer, an attorney advisor to the EPA Chemical Risk and Reporting Enforcement Branch who worked on the SNUR and concluded that: “This new approach allows asbestos-containing products that are not currently used to be used in the future.” Claim: The Environmental Protection Agency will allow new asbestos products to enter the market.","output":"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposed \\"Significant New Use Rule\\" (SNUR) for asbestos in June 2018. The rule applies to asbestos uses that were not banned by earlier regulations and are currently unregulated. Under the rule, manufacturers and importers would have to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, importing, or processing of asbestos. Critics argue that the SNUR has two main problems: it does not allow for the ban of all currently inactive unregulated uses and the EPA's proposed method to evaluate the risks of these uses will not include information from existing uses of asbestos. The current administration has established a process for some of these asbestos uses to be granted formal approval by the EPA if they pass a safety review that many scientists find flawed. Thus, the claim that the EPA will allow new asbestos products to enter the market is supported by the proposed rule and the concerns raised by critics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: People who speak or perform before the public sometimes may suffer from \\"Stage Fright. \\" Stage fright makes a person nervous. In the worst case  it can make one's mind go back and forget what one ought to say,  or to act. Actors, musicians, dancers, lawyers, even radio show hosts  have suffered from stage fright at one time or another. Diana Nichols is an expert in helping people free from stage fright at a medical centre in New York City. She helps actors learn to control themselves. Miss Nichols says some people have always been afraid to perform before the audience. Others, she says, develop stage fright after a fearful experience. She offers them ways to control the fear. One way is to smile before going onto the stage. Taking two deep breaths also helps. Deep breathing helps you get control of your body. Miss Nichols persuades her patients to tell themselves that their speech or performance does not have to the perfect. It's all right to make a mistake. She tells them they should not be too cautious while they are performing. It is important that they should continue to perform while she is helping them. After each performance, they discuss what happened and find out what advice helped and what did not. As they perform more and more, they will fear less and less as much as 50%. Miss Nichols says the aim is only to reduce stage fright, not to _ it completely. This is because a little stage fright makes a person more cautious, and improves the performance.

They need to find the reasons for this phenomenon.  Would group B have single reduced pigment or multiple reduced pigment? A:","output":"To determine whether group B (Siberian Tigers with albinism) would have single reduced pigment or multiple reduced pigments, I will go through the following steps: Step 1: Understand the definitions of albinism and leucism Step 2: Analyze the basis and effects of albinism Step 3: Determine the type of pigment reduction in group B Step 1: Albinism is a genetic condition where an animal has little or no melanin, the pigment responsible for coloration in skin, hair, and eyes. Leucism is a partial loss of pigmentation that results in white or pale patches on the animal's body. Unlike albinism, leucistic animals can still produce melanin, albeit in reduced amounts.  Step 2: Albinism is caused by a mutation in one of several genes responsible for the production of melanin. This leads to a complete or near-complete absence of the pigment, causing the animal to have a white or extremely light-colored appearance. The lack of pigmentation mainly affects the melanin pigment. Step 3: Since the primary basis of albinism is a lack of melanin pigment, it would be appropriate to conclude that group B (Siberian Tigers with albinism) would have a single reduced pigment (melanin) as opposed to multiple reduced pigments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.  - Olive Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) is an American singer, actress, doll designer, and a member of the show business family the Osmonds. Although she was never part of her family's singing group, she gained success as a solo country music artist in the 1970s and 1980s. Her best known song is a cover of the country pop ballad \\"Paper Roses\\". From 1976 to 1979, she and her singer brother Donny Osmond hosted the television variety show \\"Donny & Marie\\".  - · \\"Paper Roses\\" is a popular song written and composed by Fred Spielman and Janice Torre. It first was a top five hit in 1960 for Anita Bryant with Monty Kelly's Orchestra and Chorus. Marie Osmond later covered it in 1973 and took her version to number one on the US country chart.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career  a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.

Shawn: Well, how about if I just throw a Frisbee over the fence to give him some exercise? Wouldn't that work?  Norman: Ah, and then, he likes to watch the 3:00 soap opera on Channel 4 [What?] ... and brush his teeth after you give you some doggie treats around 4:00.  Shawn: Man, you really pamper your dog.  Norman: And, then brush his fur for about twenty minutes. He tends to shed this time of year. [Ah, what?] And then scratch him around the ears. Otherwise, he feels neglected.  Shawn: Is that it?  Norman: Well, and then there's Claws.  Shawn: Claws? Who's Claws.  Norman: Oh, he's the cat we adopted from the animal shelter, but he's a little temperamental.

Summarize: That's how Chris Pratt has reacted publicly after being linked to the role of Indiana Jones in a possible reboot of the legendary franchise. Everything is speculation at the moment, but the star is now one of the go-to men for blockbuster producers. The Jurassic World actor was speaking as he picked up the Hasty Pudding Man of the Year award at Harvard University. The award is presented annually by America's oldest undergraduate troupe to famous actors and actresses. Responding to the Indiana rumours, he said that he knew as much as anybody else but that it would be awesome to play the role - made famous by Harrison Ford and River Phoenix. As part of the Hasty Pudding ceremony - where the university acting society honours big stars - winners are treated to a traditional comedy roast. He was teased about some of his earlier TV and film roles, including a 2009 comedy he made with Kim Kardashian called Deep In The Valley. The Hasty Pudding troupe said that audiences asked for refunds after watching it. Pratt responded: \\"Joke's on you. It didn't even open in theatres.\\" As if he hadn't shown off his genial, funny and all-round-nice-guy personality enough already, he'd visited a children's cancer centre in Boston earlier in the day. The reason? He was fulfilling the Super Bowl bet he made with fellow actor Chris Evans. Pratt's a Seattle Seahawks fan, whilst Evans supports the New England Patriots. The two stars agreed that whoever's team lost the Super Bowl would visit the other's chosen charity, dressed as the superhero they're known for playing. As the Seahawks lost, Pratt got his Guardians Of The Galaxy Star-Lord leather jacket on and surprised the children at Christopher's Haven in Boston.

Given the question: Several months ago I decided it would be wise to look into the possibilities of buying a life insurance policy , because I understood it might be a good investment. I got the name of an insurance agent from a friend and called the agent to get some information. From the kinds of questions I put to him the agent could tell that I knew nothing about insurance, so he kindly offered to explore the matter with me in more detail---to help me determine the kind of policy I ought to be considering. That evening he appeared at my door promptly  at 7:30; without wasting time on pleasantness, he spread his papers out on the kitchen table and launched into a lengthy explanation. I listened attentively as he talked about the difference between various types of policies, and he explained the kind of coverage he felt I ought to have. Toward the end of the evening (after three or four hours of talking), he kindly helped me fill out an application for a 50,000 policy, and then he asked if I could go to a Dr. Luther's office on Friday for a physical examination. I don't know why, but it was not until the mention of the doctor's appointment that I realized fully what was happening. I was about to sign a lifetime contract, yet I had not really made a decision about whether I wanted to buy the policy. However, since he had spent so much time with me, I didn't want to make him feel that he had wasted his time.

Answer:","output":"Ambassadors to Britain are officially accredited to the Court of St. James's. The Court of St. James's is a term that refers to the royal court for the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. The name is derived from St. James's Palace, which was a primary residence of Kings and Queens of England from the time of Henry VIII until the reign of Queen Victoria. Even though the court's location has physically moved to Buckingham Palace, the name \\"Court of St. James's\\" has endured and is still used in a formal and official manner. While the Queen now lives in Buckingham Palace, St. James's Palace is still used for official functions and remains the senior palace of the Sovereign. Ambassadors to the UK are formally known as \\"Ambassadors to the Court of St. James's\\" because their official duties involve interacting with the British monarchy, and the Court of St. James's is the institutional representation of the monarchy. Their letters of credence, which are formal diplomatic letters that confirm their official status, are also addressed to the Court of St. James's. An ambassador's role is to represent their home country in the host country, promoting friendly relations and cooperation between the two nations. In this case, an ambassador to Britain would represent their home government in dealings with the UK government, negotiate agreements, report back to their home country on significant political, social, and economic developments in the UK, support their compatriots abroad, and promote culture, education, and trade links between the UK and their home country. In their role, ambassadors must navigate the delicate balance of maintaining and improving relations between the two countries while also advancing the interests of their own nation. Given the central role the Queen plays in Britain's government and the significant influence she wields in the nation, much of an ambassador's work is focused on engagements with the monarchy, and by extension, the Court of St. James's."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why was there a fusion of Greek culture with those of areas the Greeks colonized. Context: After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world. Answer:","output":"The fusion of Greek culture with those of areas the Greeks colonized occurred because Hellenistic kingdoms were established in various regions following Alexander the Great's ventures.

Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants. Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor was abandoned by his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a \\"scramble suit\\" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and he is known only by the code name \\"Fred.\\" Arctor's senior officer, \\"Hank\\", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other. Since going undercover, Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D and he has befriended the main woman he has been spying on: a cocaine addict and Substance D supplier named Donna. Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of Substance D from Donna that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier, but he has also developed seemingly unrequited romantic feelings towards her. At work, Hank orders Arctor to step up surveillance on Donna and her associates; however, Arctor's house is now at the center of his own investigation, since this is where Donna and the other addicts in her and Arctor's life now spend most of their time. Hank names Bob Arctor as the suspected ringleader, and thus orders Arctor to spy on himself.

News article: Adam's story: When prescription drugs are deadly Watch CNN's special series, \\"Deadly Fix,\\" this week on CNN Newsroom at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ET. (CNN) -- The modest clinic on Milpas Street in laid-back Santa Barbara, California, was well known to patients seeking powerful pain medication. They went there to find the \\"Candy Man.\\" Dr. Julio Diaz earned that nickname because, according to court records, he was writing prescriptions for massive numbers of pills -- hundreds, even thousands, at a time. He prescribed medications like oxycodone, a powerful opioid pain killer that is highly addictive. At the nearby Cottage Hospital, emergency room doctors noticed a pattern and sensed a problem. \\"We communicate first with our patients and then with the primary care providers. We then began to see that there was a pattern and that clearly by far Dr. Diaz's prescribing stood out above any of the other physicians in the computer,\\" Dr. Chris Lambert said. Lambert found that Cottage Health documented more than 400 emergency room visits from Diaz's patients, according to court documents. Some were clearly dependent on opiates, he said, and others were seeking more pain medication. \\"And of course we saw the complications, too,\\" Lambert noted. Those complications included symptoms of severe drug withdrawal and overdoses. The Medical Board of California, and eventually the Drug Enforcement Administration, were called to investigate. That investigation resulted in a laundry list of charges against Diaz including the over-prescription of narcotics, prescribing narcotics when there was no medical need, and illegal distribution of a narcotic to a person under the age of 21. According to the DEA, there were a dozen overdose deaths associated with Diaz. Twenty-seven-year-old Adam Montgomery was one of them. Montgomery started seeing Diaz after he injured his back on a construction job. He was seeking pain medication. He got it, and soon he was hooked. As the months went by, Montgomery's parents noticed a change. \\"Well, at some point, he started spending a lot of time in bed. And just watching TV, never doing anything,\\" Adam's father, Robert Montgomery said. \\"And that seemed to get worse and worse. And then I noticed the color change in his face, his attitude, his love toward his family ...That all went away.\\" Montgomery slowly became aware that his son was addicted to oxycodone, and he called Diaz. \\"I was seeing paperwork with hundreds of oxycodone pills,\\" Montgomery told CNN. \\"I wanted to know why he was giving him so many.\\" He says he never got an answer. In an affidavit, the DEA alleges that in the six weeks before Adam Montgomery's death, Diaz prescribed him a total of 2,087 pills, an average of 63 pills a day. On the day after Thanksgiving in 2011, Montgomery received the news that his son had died of a drug overdose. In Adam Montgomery's bedroom and car, investigators found bottles of multiple drugs, and some were empty. All were prescribed by Diaz. The autopsy concluded that a cocktail of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and methadone was the cause of death. \\"Right now we have more people that are dying from prescription opioids than cocaine and heroin combined,\\" said Robert Hill, a DEA special agent with years of experience on the front lines of the war on drugs. Hill says that in 2011, the most recent year for which there are statistics, more than 22,000 people died from prescription drugs. Late last year, Diaz signed a plea agreement, admitting to a reduced number of charges. Those charges include the illegal distribution of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and fentanyl. The original charges against him carried a maximum sentence of 200 years in prison and up to 10 million in fines, but the plea bargain will likely reduce that sentence. CNN contacted Diaz's attorney, but received no comment. Diaz awaits sentencing. To this day, Montgomery's parents struggle with the what-ifs. Had he known then what he knows now, \\"I might have been able to save him, but I was more disappointed in him -- in making these bad decisions,\\" Robert Montgomery said. \\"But it wasn't him, it was the drugs that changed him. So I just turned my back on him, and I wouldn't do that today.\\" READ: DEA probing alleged prescription drug abuse in NFL, source says How safe are your prescription drugs?

Jack and Kate, who have been together since college, are at JFK Airport, where Jack is about to leave to take up a twelve-month internship with Barclays in London. Kate fears the separation will be fatal for their relationship and asks him not to go, but he reassures her, saying their love is strong enough to last, and he flies out. The scene fades out to \\"13 years later\\": Jack is now an unmarried Wall Street executive in New York City, living a carefree bachelor's life. At work, he is putting together a multi-billion dollar merger and has ordered an emergency meeting on Christmas Day. In his office, on Christmas Eve, he gets a message to contact Kate, but, even though he remembers her, he dismisses it, apparently uninterested.  On his way home, he is in a convenience store when a young man, Cash, enters claiming to have a winning lottery ticket worth 238, but the store clerk refuses him, saying the ticket is a forgery. Cash pulls out a gun and threatens him, so Jack offers to buy the ticket and Cash eventually agrees. Outside, Jack tries to help Cash, to which he responds by asking Jack if anything is missing from his life. Jack says he has everything he needs, whereupon Cash enigmatically remarks that Jack has brought upon himself what is now going to happen, and walks away. A puzzled Jack returns to his penthouse and sleeps. On Christmas Day, Jack wakes up in a suburban New Jersey bedroom with Kate and two children.

Sentence 1: But the Woodward case--his second Trial of the Decade--reflects Scheck's high-mindedness as much as his greed. This sentence tells us that the Woodward case is Scheck's second Trial of the Decade. It gives information about the nature of the case and Scheck's involvement. Sentence 2: Scheck would have many more trials. This sentence states that Scheck will have many more trials in the future. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the two sentences: - Sentence 1 discusses a specific case: the Woodward case, which is Scheck's second Trial of the Decade. - Sentence 2 states that Scheck would have many more trials in the future, without specifying the number of trials or their possible significance. Given the information provided in Sentence 1 about the Woodward case being Scheck's second Trial of the Decade, we cannot directly conclude that Sentence 2 is true or false since it does not provide enough details about the number or significance of Scheck's future trials.

Jones students are lucky not only to have such a testing center at school, but also the feeling of their home school where it feels comfortable and familiar. \\"ID, please,\\" my former math teacher asked at the door. \\"Okay.\\" She looked over my ID, checked off my name on her list, and pointed towards the dining hall tables inside. With hesitation, I picked up my feet and was directed to a large round table in the middle of the dinning hall. At least fourteen people could sit at this table but only four were allowed to take their test here. \\"I'm glad it's multiple choices.\\" I heard one student say.

Context: My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister. I think the experience made us both content to elope. Question: Who made the wooden box? Answer: Pick your answer from: [1]. My partner's parents; [2]. not enough information; [3].

It is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario, James Bay, and Hudson Bay; to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay; to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and to the south by the province of New Brunswick and the US states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division; only the territory of Nunavut is larger. It is historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada (with Ontario).  Quebec is the second-most populous province of Canada, after Ontario. It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, the capital. Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area, including the Island of Montreal. English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais, Eastern Townships, and Gaspé regions. The Nord-du-Québec region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples. The climate around the major cities is four-season continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers, but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions.

Both sentences are conveying the same idea, which is the person's concern about the appropriateness of the recommendation.  In Sentence 1, \\"He wondered if this recommendation was the appropriate place\\" might suggest that the person is pondering over whether the recommendation is suitable in terms of a location or context. The verb \\"wondered\\" indicates a curiosity or pondering nature. The subject of the sentence, \\"he,\\" is considering whether or not the recommendation is suitable for the desired context. In Sentence 2, \\"He inquired if the recommendation was appropriate\\" has a more direct and active approach to seeking an answer. The verb \\"inquired\\" refers to the person directly seeking information or clarification about the appropriateness of the recommendation. Similar to Sentence 1, the subject of the sentence is the same, and the main concern revolves around the suitability of the recommendation. In conclusion, the primary message of both sentences is the person's concern about the appropriateness of a recommendation. Thus, we can infer that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. However, it's essential to keep the slight nuances in mind, as Sentence 1 leans more towards a pondering or contemplating nature, while Sentence 2 is more about actively seeking answers or clarification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust?  A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\\"Grandfather Vulture\\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \\"big chief\\" who \\"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\\" according to Miguel Orrego.

Would \\"Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms , cells , large molecules , biopsy samples, metals , and crystals .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"No, the given answer is not reasonable, as it does not address the question about microscopes that do not require a vacuum. Electron microscopes, as mentioned in the provided answer, actually require a vacuum for their operation. A more appropriate answer would be: Microscopes that do not require a vacuum primarily include light (optical) microscopes which use visible light and lenses to magnify specimens. There are different types of light microscopes, such as: 1. Compound Light Microscope: A type of microscope that uses multiple lenses to magnify the specimen, allowing for higher magnification (up to 2000x). It is widely used in biology, chemistry, and medicine to study cells, tissues, and microorganisms. 2. Stereo Microscope (Dissecting Microscope): This type of microscope uses two separate optical paths to provide a 3D image of the specimen. It is used for observing larger specimens like insects, plants, and other small objects, with lower magnification (up to 100x). 3. Fluorescence Microscope: Fluorescence microscopy takes advantage of the fluorescent properties of some molecules. It uses specific wavelengths of light to excite the fluorescent molecules, which then emit light of a different wavelength. This type of microscope is useful for identifying and visualizing specific structures within a sample. 4. Phase Contrast Microscope: This microscope enhances contrast in transparent or unstained samples by manipulating light waves passing through the specimen. It is particularly useful for studying live cells, including bacteria, and internal cell structures. 5. Darkfield Microscope: In this microscope, the specimen appears brightly lit against a dark background. It is well-suited for observing unstained, transparent samples that do not produce much contrast under regular brightfield microscopy. 6. Polarizing Microscope: Polarizing microscopes utilize polarized light to examine birefringent (double-refracting) materials such as minerals, plastics, crystals, and biological specimens like bone and muscle. While electron microscopes provide much higher magnification and resolution than light microscopes, they require a vacuum environment to prevent the scattering of electrons by air molecules. Light microscopes, on the other hand, can be used in standard atmospheric conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the company that departed Florence second?  Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants. The answer to this question is:","output":"The name of the company that departed Florence second is the Martin Company, which left on August 27."},{"instruction":"Available choices: 1). proteins. 2). molecules. 3). passive particles. 4). solvent particles.

Input: The 22-year-old Iceland international is the first recruit for new Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas in a deal reported to be worth £8m. Sigurdsson was linked with a move to join former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool. He scored seven times in 19 games on loan under Rodgers at Swansea. Iceland manager Lars Lagerback told BBC World Service that Spurs had brought in a player with many attributes. \\"He understands the game. He's good with both feet. He's not a physical player or the best tackler, but he is very fit - I've met few so skilful players who can run so much for 90 minutes. You shouldn't underestimate him when it comes to the defensive part of the game.\\" Lars Lagerback, Iceland manager \\"He's a fantastic team player. He reads the game very well and I don't think you would find too many better link players,\\" he told the World Football programme. Sigurdsson was close to joining Swansea on a permanent basis before Rodgers left for Anfield, and his £6.8m transfer to the Liberty Stadium collapsed. Michael Laudrup, who succeeded Rodgers at Swansea, conceded defeat last month in his efforts to resurrect a deal. The move to Tottenham comes as speculation continues over the future of Spurs midfielder Luka Modric, who has been linked with a transfer to Manchester United or Real Madrid. Sigurdsson originally moved to England in October 2005 when he joined Reading's academy. He spent loan spells at Shrewsbury and Crewe before securing a regular place in the first team in the 2009-10 season when Rodgers managed the Royals. Sigurdsson won the player of the year award in his first full season at Reading, before being sold to Hoffenheim for a reported £6.5m fee at the start of the following campaign. He joined Swansea on loan in January and won the Premier League player of the month award for March.

Step 1: Combine the like terms on each side of the equation. 768*g - 1152*g = -384*g, as 768*g - 1152*g = (-1)*1152*g + 768*g = -384*g. Now, the equation becomes: -384*g = 1302*g - 20517 - 9831 Step 2: Combine the constants on the right side of the equation. 1302*g - 20517 - 9831 = 1302*g - 30348, as 20517 + 9831 = 30348. So, the equation now becomes: -384*g = 1302*g - 30348 Step 3: Move the -384*g term to the other side of the equation to get all the g terms together. Therefore, -384*g+384*g = 1302*g - 30348 + 384*g 0 = 1302*g + 384*g - 30348 Step 4: Simplify the equation by combining the g terms. 0 = 1686*g - 30348, as 1302*g + 384*g = 1686*g Step 5: Isolate the variable 'g' by adding 30348 to both sides. 30348 = 1686*g To find the value of 'g', divide both sides by 1686: g = 30348 / 1686 Step 6: Calculate the value of 'g'. g ≈ 18 So, the value of g is approximately 18."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost.

Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"alcohol.\\" Based on the information given, \\"water\\" forms into a liquid from the air.  Water vapor in the air, also known as humidity or moisture, can turn into liquid because of a process called condensation. Condensation occurs when the water vapor in the air cools down and changes back into liquid form.

The misconception regarding \\"alcohol\\" may arise from the fact that alcohol and water can mix together and are found in many beverages, but alcohol does not form into a liquid from the air through the same process as water. Alcohol is a byproduct of fermentation – a chemical reaction that occurs when yeasts or bacteria break down sugars in the absence of oxygen.

Article: Though apparently a little fuzzy on the subject of judicial review, President Barack Obama is supposed to be a constitutional scholar of some sort. On the subject of his decision yesterday to unilaterally enact sweeping changes to U.S. immigration policy on nothing but his own say-so, we would like to introduce Barack Obama to Barack Obama, who during a Univision interview just last year affirmed: “America is a nation of laws, which means I, as the president, am obligated to enforce the law. . . . There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president.” A little softness in the polls and one executive order later, the president has reversed himself.      The president’s executive order will categorically prevent the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. It will also grant them work authorizations to which they would not otherwise be entitled under law. The former is unwise and the latter is illegal.      The federal executive branch, like a local district attorney or a traffic cop, has some discretion about how, when, and whether to prosecute certain violations of the law. Not every driver exceeding the speed limit by 4 mph will receive a ticket, and not every teenager caught shoplifting will face a criminal indictment. Police and prosecutors are granted some leeway in these matters — but they cannot change the speed limit or legalize theft. That requires an act of the legislature. By making the liberal use of this discretion mandatory, the Obama administration is in effect writing new law rather than enforcing existing law.      The president’s executive order reflects in no small part changes contemplated by Senator Marco Rubio’s DREAM Act and similar legislative proposals, which would allow illegal immigrants brought to this country as children, through no culpability of their own, to remain in the United States and gain access to a process for legalizing their presence. We think that this is a defective proposal, but Senator Rubio may at least be credited with appreciating that changing the law of the land requires changing the law of the land, i.e. an act of Congress. The president does not possess the constitutional authority to do what he proposes to do.      The executive may of course prioritize deportations. It is reasonable to invest more resources in deporting a narcotics cartel foot soldier than in chasing down high-school seniors who have been in the country for 99 percent of their lives. (Never mind, for the moment, the question of whether Homeland Security lacks sufficient resources to enforce the law across the board; if it did, the answer would be more resources for enforcement, something that the administration has not pursued with any vigor despite congressional solicitousness.) Prioritization is one thing; what the president does not have the power to do is to mandate across-the-board legal status for those low-priority illegals. We could, if we so chose, establish an amnesty process for legalizing those illegals we deem worthy of clemency, but to do so would require Congress to propose and enact legislation. In fact, several proposals have come up in Congress to do just that, and they have been uniformly rejected.      The president’s executive order violates the constitutional separation of powers that defines the political architecture of our republic. If Congress allows this illegitimate executive order to stand, it will have in effect delegated its power to make law to the president.      This executive order would, therefore, be entirely unacceptable even if it represented good policy. But it does not. Congress has been correct to reject earlier attempts at this sort of limited amnesty, and the American public is correct to remain generally skeptical of amnesty proposals. The amnesty proponents will of course point to any number of cases in which a young person is facing a painful situation through no fault of his own, and one would have to have a heart as hard as coffin nails not to sympathize, but the fact is that it was not the people of the United States who put these young people in legal jeopardy — it was their parents. Without first ensuring effective enforcement at the border and at the workplace, any step toward normalizing the status of those here in violation of the law invites more of the same abuse and disorder.      Further, there exists no reliable mechanism for investigating when and how these illegal immigrants entered the country. Being undocumented, as the politically correct term has it, they have in many cases little or no evidence that they did not show up in the United States the day before yesterday in full knowledge that they were violating the law.      Congress already has spoken on this amnesty proposal, and the answer was “No.” Even the president has to take no for an answer when the law requires him to. Barack Obama once knew that. He probably still does. ||||| President Barack Obama on Friday tried to grab back the mantle of change — and remind his base why they came out in force for him four years ago.      The broad strokes are the same as when he declared his support for gay marriage last month: a key 2008 constituency that had spent three and a half years nursing its disappointment, now thrown a late-breaking move to ramp up its enthusiasm.      Text Size -      +      reset      In both, the president had very little to lose — many voters who dislike his support for gay marriage or refusal to deport young immigrants probably weren’t in play anyway. But he had a huge amount to gain in enthusiasm, in reconnecting with the spirit of his first campaign, and most of all, in driving up turnout.      In an election that could well turn on the margin of Latinos supporting him in key swing states — and coming out to the polls — that’s no small matter.      The policy shift is Obama’s latest and perhaps most controversial flexing of administration power to bend a reality that Congress wouldn’t change. Comprehensive immigration reform remains untouched, the DREAM Act — which would create a path to citizenship for some young illegal immigrants — is all but dead on Capitol Hill.      But Friday, the president went as far under federal policy as he could without Congress. There’s no path to citizenship, but hundreds of thousands of young people born abroad and brought into the country illegally no longer have to worry that they’ll be deported as soon as they finish high school.      The Department of Homeland Security directive would end deportation for people under 30 who came to the U.S. under the age of 16, have lived here continuously for the past five years, have graduated from high school or have been honorably discharged from the military — so long as they don’t have serious criminal records.      “These are young people who study in our schools, they play in our neighborhoods, they’re friends with our kids, they pledge allegiance to our flag,” Obama said in the Rose Garden. “They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: On paper.”      Obama holds a wide margin over Republican Mitt Romney among Latinos, who are concentrated in several key election states, including Nevada, Colorado and Florida. But the president’s failure to deliver on comprehensive immigration reform has not gone unnoticed among Latinos, nor has the record number of deportations during his administration.      His announcement Friday seems likely to change that.      “It might move the undecideds, but its real effect is going to be on energizing Latino voters who were relatively dispirited after the deportations and the failure to act on immigration reform,” said Gary Segura, a co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions. “Both candidates are trying to get both choice and turnout. It helps Obama some on choice, and it helps him a lot on turnout.”      Segura called the new policy a win for the president politically that has the potential to move the needle in Virginia and North Carolina — despite having relatively small Latino populations, those states are homes to many immigrants.      But Segura said the greatest impact will be on three other states that are must-wins for the Obama campaign and heavily Latino.      “In the case of Nevada and Colorado, states that the president is likely to win, this will move the goal posts for Mitt Romney even further. In a state like Florida, which I think is going to be a very competitive state, I think this helps Obama moderately among Latino voters there,” Segura said.      In Florida — the eternal swing state, this year with two more electoral votes — Obama’s gotten people’s attention.      Latinos in South and Central Florida “are not going to look on this lightly,” said Ana Cruz, a Tampa-based Democratic strategist who worked as Hillary Clinton’s Florida spokeswoman during the 2008 presidential campaign.      Asked if this will energize Obama’s base, Cruz replied, “It absolutely should. If Latinos cannot get fired about this and about some of the Hispanic initiatives and the appointment of [Justice] Sonia Sotomayor, then shame on them, shame on us.”      Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the Cook Political Report, said she isn’t sure if the new action puts a specific state in play, “but that might not be as important as getting Hispanic turnout to the level it was in 2008.” Hispanic voters backed Obama 67 percent to 31 percent over Sen. John McCain, according to Pew exit polls. ||||| President Obama’s Hispanic gamble      By Jordy Yager -      President Obama laid his chips down in a major election-year gamble this week that could help make or break his re-election bid for the White House.      In a dead heat with Republican Mitt Romney, Obama has struggled in recent weeks, suffering a number of setbacks, and losing much of the news cycle momentum that carried him to Pennsylvania Ave. more than three years ago.      The president’s been plagued by poor job report numbers, a public speaking gaffe in which he said the private sector was doing “fine,” a failed voter recall election of Wisconsin’s Republican governor, and a relentless amount of political fire aimed at his attorney general on two fronts from GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill.      But with Friday’s announcement that his administration would not deport certain young people who are in the country illegally, Obama threw down his chips, partially fulfilling a campaign promise he made to Latinos in his bid to be president, and putting Romney and Republican congressional hopefuls in a bind.      Obama is actively grinding to hold onto the 67 percent of Latinos who voted for him in 2008, while he has battled an increasingly vocal tide of Latino advocacy groups who have not been timid in voicing their disapproval of his inability to pass comprehensive immigration reform or the DREAM Act.      The grand move on Friday was one in a series of steps Obama has taken recently in an effort to galvanize his liberal base, including his public endorsement of marriage equality aimed at gay-rights advocates and his decision to require religious organizations to grant their employees’ access to birth control in a nod to pro-choice supporters.                  The political payoff of the new immigration policy could be huge, according to some experts, who cite the large Latino populations in key electoral states, such as Florida, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Virginia.      But it could also backfire for Obama among demographics that worry greatly about illegal immigrants taking job opportunities away from people in the country legally. The White House said it expects about 800,000 young illegal immigrants to take part in its new policy to gain temporary worker status.      “It's a medium risk, high reward strategy,” said Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons.      “I think you risk angering people who are upset about immigration, yes. But for a president who’s got to win Florida, Nevada, Colorado, it is definitely something that can give the Latino community something to rally around.”      The news of the policy shift threatened to take the wind out of Romney’s sails as he began a greatly hyped five-day, six-state bus tour on Friday and took to blasting Obama for being “detached” and “distant” while making no mention of the president's announcement.      But Republicans on Capitol Hill easily made up for any silence from Romney’s camp, with top-ranking GOP lawmakers relentlessly blasting the decision. Some called it unconstitutional, while Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a member of the Tea Party, promised to sue the administration for circumventing Congress’s authority.      Anticipating the blowback, the White House lost no time in conducting a full-court press on the issue as it launched Democratic lawmakers, staffers, and operatives across the country to spread the president’s message of what the new policy entails.      More than two-dozen senior administration officials are scheduled to hold an all-day White House Hispanic Community Action Summit in Maryland on Saturday where they will join Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in laying out the details of the new policy.      And Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), one of Obama’s most influential supporters in the Latino community and chairman of the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, immediately went to the mats for the president as he announced plans to hold an information session on Monday to help immigrants in Chicago understand the details of the new policy.      Meanwhile, Obama campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt shot out an email aimed at painting a large divide between Romney and Obama just hours after the president addressed reporters in the Rose Garden.      “During the primaries, Gov. Romney called the DREAM Act a handout and said he would veto it,” LaBolt said in a statement. “Today he continues to refuse to express support for legislation that lets children who were brought to the U.S. and want to contribute by pursuing higher education or serving in the military stay in America.” |||||Summary:","output":"President Barack Obama's decision to enact sweeping changes to U.S. immigration policy in 2012 was met with controversy. His executive order prevented the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and granted them work authorizations to which they would not otherwise be entitled under law. Critics argued that the president did not possess the constitutional authority to make this unilateral decision, as it violates the constitutional separation of powers and requires an act of Congress. Despite these concerns, the executive order was seen by some as a strategic move to energize and secure the Latino vote in key swing states during the 2012 election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Premise: \\"and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\"?","output":"If the given premise is true, we can draw and analyze several conclusions and insights about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\" The premise states: \\"and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and\\" – This sentence fragment suggests that the individual in question managed to create a hang glider using a few tires and possibly other materials or components. The use of \\"all of a sudden\\" indicates that the process was relatively quick, or at least quicker than one might expect when constructing a hang glider. Considering this premise, it becomes necessary to determine the plausibility of the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\" There are three main factors to take into account: 1. Materials and resources: The premise indicates that the individual created the hang glider using \\"a few tires.\\" This suggests that they possess some level of resourcefulness and creativity, considering unconventional materials in constructing the hang glider. However, we do not know if the tires were the only components used or if there were other materials involved in creating the glider. It's also possible that the individual found or sourced the needed materials, or had help obtaining them. 2. Skills and expertise: Constructing a hang glider is a complex task that typically requires a degree of engineering knowledge, design skills, and experience with aerodynamics. If the person in the premise possesses such skills or expertise, it would strengthen the likelihood that they can create a hang glider by themselves. However, if they possess limited knowledge, this may suggest that external assistance or guidance was provided to successfully assemble the glider. Additionally, having a few tires may imply that they are a resourceful person who can make use of available materials, but not necessarily that they made the glider completely by themselves. 3. Time and assistance: The use of \\"all of a sudden\\" indicates that the hang glider was created relatively quickly. This may suggest that the individual is highly competent and efficient in constructing a hang glider, and it's plausible that they completed the project by themselves. However, the phrase doesn't provide a clear indication of the time invested in the project, nor does it make it clear whether any assistance was received in constructing the glider. Taking these factors into consideration, it's important to note that the premise does not clearly support or refute the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\" While the individual in question exhibits resourcefulness, ingenuity, and perhaps even some level of expertise, it remains uncertain whether they were solely responsible for constructing the hang glider. Therefore, without additional information or context, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the given premise.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who planned to work with his longtime librettist? ?  The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

She won’t stay in treatment and consistently checks out early.”      The source notes that the possible conservatorship “would be of Heather as a person only, nothing involving her finances or estate.”      TMZ reported that the Melrose Place alum was hospitalized as a precaution on Sunday, November 18, after a therapist determined that she was having another mental breakdown.      Spears, 36, has been under the guidance of a conservatorship since 2008, after she was hospitalized in the wake of a much-publicized breakdown and divorce from Kevin Federline, with whom she shares sons Preston, 13, and Jayden, 12. The Grammy winner cannot make personal or financial decisions without the approval of her father, Jamie Spears, and lawyer Andrew Wallet due to an undisclosed mental illness.      The news of Locklear’s latest hospitalization came after a difficult few months. She was arrested in February for allegedly attacking a police officer after a dispute with her boyfriend, Chris Heisser. She briefly sought treatment the following month. Days after undergoing a psychiatric evaluation in June, Locklear was arrested again and later charged with battery on a police officer and an EMT.

A:","output":"A: The United States declared war on Germany during World War II on December 11, 1941. This decision was prompted by several key events that led to escalating tensions between the two countries. Prior to the U.S. involvement in the war, Germany, under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, had been aggressively expanding its territory and influence in Europe, in direct conflict with the interests of the United States and other allied powers. The U.S. had been providing support to Great Britain and its allies through various means, such as the Lend-Lease program, but had not yet officially entered the conflict. The critical turning point for the U.S. occurred on December 7, 1941, when the Japanese launched a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This event galvanized the American public and the U.S. government into action, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declaring December 7th as \\"a date which will live in infamy\\" during his address to Congress the following day. The United States formally declared war on Japan on December 8th. While the focus of the U.S. war declaration was initially on Japan, due to the Tripartite Pact – a military alliance signed in 1940 by Germany, Italy, and Japan – Germany declared war on the United States on December 11, 1941. In response, the United States reciprocated the same day, formally declaring war on Germany. The declaration of war on Germany marked the official entry of the United States into World War II on the side of the Allied Powers, which included countries such as the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, China, and other nations fighting against the Axis Powers led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. This decision significantly shifted the dynamics of the war, as the U.S. mobilized its vast industrial and military resources towards the war effort, ultimately playing a crucial role in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the end of World War II in 1945."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross. That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a book with a deformed, evil face. She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination. When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recording of incantations in which, when played by Ash then Scotty, unleashes demons and evil spirits. Cheryl becomes hysterical when a tree crashes through the window, and she runs to her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. She is attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape and while the girls play cards, Cheryl then becomes demonically possessed, telling them that the demons will kill them.

Article: London: It's well known that Charles Darwin's famous theory of evolution annoyed many people because it was against the Biblical view of creation. But few know that it also created problems for Darwin at home with his deeply religious wife, Emma. \\"Darwin _ the publication of On the Origin of Species to avoid offending   his wife,\\" says Ruth Padel, the naturalist's great - great - granddaughter. \\"Emma told him that he seemed to be putting God further and further off\\", Padel says in her north London home. \\"But they talked it through, and Emma once said, 'Don't change any of your ideas for fear of hurting me.'\\" As the world celebrates the 200th birthday of the man who changed scientific thought forever and the 150th anniversary of his book today, even his opponents admitted he was a giant figure. Though opposition to his theory continues, it is the elegant explanation of how species evolutes through natural selection that makes his 200th birthday such a major event. More than 300 celebrations have been planned in Britain alone, where Darwin's face graces  the 10-pound bill along with that of Queen Elizabeth II. Shrewsbury, the central England town where Darwin was born and raised, is holding a month-long festival for its most famous son. Down House, his former home near London, will hold a permanent exhibition recreating some of his most famous experiments. Many more events have been planned all over the world. What would he be doing if he were alive today? Padel thinks he would properly be studying DNA and the immune system. Question: The main purpose of the author is  _  . - to say something about Darwin and his wife - to introduce Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution - to sing high praise for the book On the Origin of Species - to report some celebrations of Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of his books A:","output":"The main purpose of the author is to report some celebrations of Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of his books. While the article does provide some background information about Charles Darwin, his theory of evolution, his personal life including the conflict it created with his religious wife, and the enduring impact of his book \\"On the Origin of Species\\", the primary focus is to discuss the various global celebrations taking place in honor of Darwin's monumental scientific influence and contributions. The article extensively details numerous special events, exhibitions, and festivals that have been organized in Britain, including the placement of Darwin's face on the 10-pound bill, the month-long festivities in his hometown of Shrewsbury, and a permanent showcase at his former home, Down House. Furthermore, it outlines the recognition and acknowledgement of his legacy worldwide, underlining the relevance of his work in today's scientific landscape, with the speaker suggesting that Darwin would be exploring DNA and immunology if he were alive. Thus, while elements of all answers are reflected in the text, the most comprehensive statement of the article's main purpose is reporting on the extensive celebrations of Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of his revolutionary books."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Deer Woman A:","output":"Title: The Enchanting Malevolence Step 1: Introduction to the protagonist Our story introduces Jake Owens, a young wildlife photographer, recently assigned to capture the beauty and unseen aspects of a mysterious ancient forest. Known for his award-winning photographs and empathetic bond with animals, he sets off on an adventure to unravel the hidden world within the woods. Step 2: Unfolding the legend of Deer Woman As Jake arrives at the small town nearby the forest for his preparations, he learns about an ancient legend of the so-called \\"Deer Woman\\" from the locals. According to them, this malevolent forest spirit disguises as a half-woman, half-deer creature that lures humans into the forest, never to be seen again. However, Jake, intrigued by the tale, grows even more eager to uncover the truth. Step 3: Encountering the Deer Woman As Jake spends days in the forest capturing stunning images, he stumbles upon a captivating, seemingly innocuous deer. Entranced by its beauty, he follows it deep into the forest, only to find himself lost. As night falls, the deer transforms into the enchanting Deer Woman – confirming the town's legend. Step 4: Understanding the truth behind the malevolence Instead of succumbing to fear or deception, Jake establishes a connection with Deer Woman. Through patient communication, he learns that the spirit is, in fact, seeking revenge for the destruction of her forest home and the incessant poaching of her brethren. Step 5: Formulating a plan As an animal lover, Jake sympathizes with the spirit and proposes a plan to protect the forest and its inhabitants. He suggests revealing the beauty and rarity of the forest through his photographs, creating a public interest in conservation. Step 6: Struggle against antagonists During his time in the forest, Jake stumbles upon poachers, the true enemies of the forest. With the help of the Deer Woman, they engage in a battle to save the forest, its creatures, and to expose the poachers' illegal activities. Step 7: Success and redemption Following their triumphant efforts, Jake releases his photographs in an exhibition, showcasing the enchanted beauty of the forest and its inhabitants. The exhibition garners significant public attention and successfully convinces authorities to designate the forest as a protected area. With the forest now safe, the Deer Woman's vengeful spirit find solace, transforming into a benevolent guardian of the woods. Step 8: Conclusion The story concludes with Jake departing from his newfound friend, the once-malevolent Deer Woman, and continuing his journey to explore and protect the wonders of the natural world. The Enchanting Malevolence serves as an exciting, thrilling, and thought-provoking tale that ultimately highlights the intricate relationship between humans and nature while urging the importance of cherishing and protecting our planet's biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Metabolism and Obesity Obesity in the United States is epidemic. The rate of obesity has been steadily rising since the 1980s. In the 1990s, most states reported that less than 10 percent of their populations was obese, and the state with the highest rate reported that only 15 percent of their population was considered obese. By 2010, the U. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly 36 percent of adults over 20 years old were obese and an additional 33 percent were overweight, leaving only about 30 percent of the population at a healthy weight. These studies find the highest levels of obesity are concentrated in the southern states. They also find the level of childhood obesity is rising. Obesity is defined by the body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of an individual’s weight-to-height ratio. The normal, or healthy, BMI range is between 18 and 24.9 kg/m2. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obesity is considered to be a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. Obesity can arise from a number of factors, including overeating, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, limited sleep, genetic factors, and even diseases or drugs. Severe obesity (morbid obesity) or long-term obesity can result in serious medical conditions, including coronary heart disease; type 2 diabetes; endometrial, breast, or colon cancer; hypertension (high blood pressure); dyslipidemia (high cholesterol or elevated triglycerides); stroke; liver disease; gall bladder disease; sleep apnea or respiratory diseases; osteoarthritis; and infertility. Research has shown that losing weight can help reduce or reverse the complications associated with these conditions.

Why do some animals live longer than others? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: i. no. ii. yes.","output":"I will answer the first question: Why do bigger animals live longer? Step 1: Analyze the question and identify key elements The question is asking about the relationship between the size of animals and their lifespan. Step 2: Research information on the topic By consulting various sources, I found out that, in general, larger animals tend to live longer than smaller ones. This is mainly due to their slower metabolic rates, which reduces the aging process and cellular damage over time. Step 3: Compile the obtained information into a response Larger animals usually live longer because they have slower metabolic rates. This slowed-down metabolism results in less stress on their cells, causing less damage over time and extending their lifespans. Now I will answer the second question: Why do some animals live longer than others? Step 1: Analyze the question and identify key elements The question is asking about the factors that determine the differences in lifespan among animals. Step 2: Research information on the topic After researching, I found out multiple factors contribute to the differences in lifespan among animals. These factors include genetics, size, metabolic rates, environmental factors, and adaptations to specific habitats. Step 3: Compile the obtained information into a response Several factors contribute to the differences in the lifespans of animals, including genetics, size, metabolic rates, environmental factors, and adaptations to specific habitats. These factors affect the overall health, growth, and aging process of different species, leading to varying lifespans. Finally, I will determine if the two questions are the same. To do this, we can compare the focus of both questions. Step 1: Analyze the focus of each question The first question focuses on the relationship between the size of animals and their lifespans. The second question focuses on various factors that contribute to the differences in lifespans among animals. Step 2: Compare the focus and main topic of both questions Although both questions overlap regarding the size of animals affecting lifespans, the first question specifically addresses this relationship, while the second question encompasses multiple factors that contribute to animals' differing lifespans. Step 3: Answer if the questions are the same or not Based on the comparison, I would choose option i. no, as the questions are not the same, but they share a common aspect related to the size of animals and their lifespans."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: What is the author's profession? Options: - not enough information - Doctor. - Journalist. - Pharmacist.

Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village experiences more stress build up in the rocks? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it is likely that Arrow village experiences more stress build-up in the rocks compared to Bow village.  Although both villages are situated near plate boundaries and experience earthquakes, Bow village gets a significantly higher number of earthquakes annually. This implies that the stress in the rocks at Bow village is released more frequently, preventing excessive build-up. On the other hand, Arrow village gets only a few earthquakes, which suggests that the stress in the rocks is not released as frequently, leading to a greater build-up of stress over time.  The elastic rebound theory further supports this conclusion, as it states that stresses continue to accumulate within the rocks until they ultimately break, causing an earthquake. The higher frequency of earthquakes in Bow village means that the accumulated stress is released more regularly, while the comparatively fewer numbers of earthquakes in Arrow village indicate that there may be a higher overall stress build-up in the rocks before it is finally released as an earthquake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"A businessman should study several aspects of number literacy to excel in their field. Number literacy, also known as numerical literacy or numeracy, is the ability to understand and work with numbers and mathematical concepts. Here are some key areas a businessman should focus on: 1. Basic arithmetic operations: Proficiency in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division is essential, as these operations serve as the foundation for all financial calculations. 2. Fractions, decimals, and percentages: Businessmen should be comfortable working with these numerical representations, as they frequently appear in financial statements, reports, and forecasts. 3. Financial mathematics: This includes understanding concepts like compound interest, annuities, net present value (NPV), future value (FV), and internal rate of return (IRR). These concepts are crucial in evaluating investment opportunities and making financial decisions. 4. Probability and statistics: Comprehending probability and statistical concepts helps businessmen analyze data, identify trends, and make informed decisions. They should be adept at working with averages, medians, standard deviations, correlations, and regression analyses. 5. Accounting: Familiarity with accounting concepts, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, is vital for tracking a company's financial health. An understanding of key financial ratios, such as profitability, liquidity, and solvency, also plays a significant role in the assessment of business performance and decision-making. 6. Data analysis and interpretation: Businessmen should be skilled at interpreting financial data, charts, and tables to gain insight into their organization's performance and make informed decisions accordingly. 7. Budgeting: A strong understanding of budgeting techniques is crucial for forecasting future expenses and managing a company's financial resources effectively. 8. Financial planning: Familiarity with long-term financial planning concepts helps businessmen determine a company's financial goals and strategize how to achieve those goals while considering various factors like taxation, inflation, and risk. In the Star Wars universe, the best businessman could be argued to be Sheev Palpatine, also known as Emperor Palpatine or Darth Sidious. By manipulating political and economic systems, he managed to gain control of the Galactic Republic, turning it into the Galactic Empire. Although Palpatine is not a traditional businessman in the conventional sense, his ability to create and manipulate vast resources, political influence, and a grand plan to achieve ultimate power exemplifies strategic thinking, cunning, and a ruthless pursuit of ambition often seen in highly successful businesspeople. The two questions you provided are not paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement of a statement or passage in other words to clarify its meaning.

Article: Keep the rat cage in an area where you are often present and the rats can watch what's going on around them. This will prevent feelings of isolation. The more attention you give, the more bonded, active, healthy, and friendly your rat will be. A single rat is a lonely rat, and this can cause behavioral issues. Unless your rat is aggressive, they are best not left alone. Even if they are aggressive, patient love and attention can bring them around.  Handle the rats daily, preferably two to three times a day for ten minutes or more. Rats love to learn and solve problems, so consider setting up little obstacle courses containing hidden treats in order to mentally stimulate your rats. Teach tricks by starting slow, rewarding, and reinforcing with treats and praise if done correctly.  Rats are very intelligent, and can learn many tricks, such as jumping through a hoop, spinning in a circle, standing up, and even giving a handshake, all on spoken command. Do not punish your rat for failure. Rats don't understand negative punishments, and will only confuse the rat. Instead, give them a treat when they do it right. If your rat bites, don't give him a firm tap and a \\"no.\\" Instead, squeak like a rat would and pull away. Eventually your rat will understand. Do not forget that each rat has his or her own personality, meaning that one rat may learn differently from others. Any specific method of teaching may work for one rat, but may not for another. The key to successful training is to be persistent and have lots of short training sessions filled with treats. Rats enjoy a change of scenery and a chance to stretch their legs and explore. Rats should be taken out at least one hour per day. You can let them roam around on your shoulder or somewhere in your house where it won't be a problem.  If you take your rats outside, a harness is a good idea so that you have some control if the rat becomes frightened.

But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: What effect does the author probably believe that decluttering the house will have on it's market value? Options:  A. that it will improve the market value  B. that it will have no impact  C. the author has not given thought to market value  D. not enough information  === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"A. that it will improve the market value"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Get the Most Out of Your Netflix Account with FeedFlix This post is part of Mashable’s Startup Review series, which highlights great unsung startups. The series is made possible by Sun Startup Essentials. FeedFlix helps you get your money’s worth from Netflix. FeedFlix helps users get their money’s worth from their Netflix subscription. Immediately after signing up, users can get detailed information like their Rental History, their Queues, their Reviews etc (we use the Netflix API). FeedFlix looks at your history to calculate your cost/movie and show you how you compare with other FeedFlixers. Cool graphs are provided for easy visualization. Users can get email Alerts if they’ve kept their titles too long. You can link to your FeedFlix page on your blog or email it to friends. We’ll always keep your page up to date. Zero effort required. Keyboard optional. FeedFlix is a neat little application that utilizes the new Netflix API to help you get the most out of your account - or at least make you aware of the fact that you might be wasting some money. After syncing your FeedFlix account with Netflix, you’ll be able to see a bunch of stats about your account, as well as a comparison as to how to stack up versus other Netflix users (who have registered for FeedFlix). For example, in the account pictured below, you can see that your average cost of a movie is 2.99, which means that 76% of users pay less than you. You can also see what your average time is to return DVDs, and sign up for email alerts to let you know if you’re keeping your movies for too long. Other cool stats include your average movies viewed each month, how long you typically keep a movie before sending it back, and a graphical view of your returns over time. There’s also aggregate data on most popular plans, most rented DVDs, and queue sizes for all FeedFlix users. FeedFlix also pulls in data like your current DVD queue and all of the reviews you’ve published on Netflix. The site has pulled in actual reviews from Netflix users, so if you click on a movie title, you’ll be able to see it without leaving. That actually turns FeedFlix into a bit of a social discovery site, since you can see who is renting different movies and then click on their name to see their full queue. Overall, Feedflix has the feel of a personal finance site like Mint, but for managing your movie rentals. Obviously, managing your Netflix account isn’t nearly as complex as managing your checkbook, but at the very least, it’s some cool stats that will most likely tell you the obvious: you keep movies for too long. Perhaps some specific recommendations - like which plan you should switch to - would be a nice addition. Feedflix claims to have attracted 10,000 users so far. Editor’s Note: This post is part of an ongoing series at Mashable - The Startup Review, Sponsored by Sun Microsystems Startup Essentials.

Question: I read this background article the other day: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.  I am facing a new situation today: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information from the article, the volcanoes on Sarahn should be more active than those on Timon. This is because Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift, with continents breaking apart and moving. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. This occurs as young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, causing the ocean floor to rise, which in turn results in an increase in volcanic activity.  On the other hand, Timon has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite a while now. This suggests that the formation of new oceanic crust through volcanic activity is less frequent on Timon compared to Sarahn. In conclusion, the volcanoes on Sarahn should be more active than those on Timon, due to the ongoing geographic shifts and continental movements on Sarahn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With no Dez Bryant or Tony Romo, how would the rest of the team respond? Coach Jason Garrett's mantra of \\"next man up\\" played a big part in preparing for the game against the Atlanta Falcons. Backup quarterback Brandon Weeden started for the first time since last season against the Arizona Cardinals, but this outing was much different. He completed 22 of 26 passes for 232 yards. Although he threw one interception and had zero touchdowns, the loss could not be blamed on him alone. The Cowboys played very well in the first half, outscoring the Falcons 28-17; however, the Falcons made a few halftime adjustments that squashed any running game the Cowboys pursued. On the other hand, the Cowboys had no answer for Julio Jones, who ran 164 yards and had 2 touchdowns.  Owner Jerry Jones said after the game that the Cowboys just looked tired in the second half. In typical fashion for this season, the Falcons came back late in the third quarter and won the game 39-28. How many points in total were scored?","output":"To find the total number of points scored, we can add the points from both teams. The Dallas Cowboys scored 28 points, while the Atlanta Falcons scored 39 points.

On 13 June 1990, the East German military officially began dismantling the Wall, beginning in Bernauer Straße and around the Mitte district. From there, demolition continued through Prenzlauer Berg/Gesundbrunnen, Helligensee and throughout the city of Berlin until that December 1990. According to estimates by the border troops, a total of around 1.7 million tonnes of building rubble was produced by the demolition. Unofficially, the demolition of the Bornholmer Straße began because of construction work on the railway. This involved a total of 300 GDR border guards and - after 3 October 1990 - 600 Pioneers of the Bundeswehr. These were equipped with 175 trucks, 65 cranes, 55 excavators and 13 bulldozers. Virtually every road that was severed by the Berlin Wall, every road that once linked from West Berlin to East Berlin, was reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990. In Berlin alone, 184 km of wall, 154 km border fence, 144 km signal systems and 87 km barrier ditches were removed. What remained were six sections that were to be preserved as a memorial. Various military units dismantled the Berlin/Brandenberg border wall, completing the job in November 1991. Painted wall segments with artistically valuable motifs were put up for auction in 1990 in Berlin and Monte Carlo. How many total km of border fence and barrier ditches combined were removed in Berlin?","output":"To find the total km of border fence and barrier ditches combined that were removed in Berlin, we need to add the km of border fence and km of barrier ditches together.

In the end, credits that are heavily laced with references to moose, llamas and other furry animals roll to highly festive Latin music.Little is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horsea sound that could only be made on cobblestone, but not grassis heard. From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics. Frustrated, Arthur and Patsy emulate riding off.The scene changes to a plague village. A cart is being drawn through the streets, and is attended by a disheveled man (Eric Idle) who strikes a triangle and calls for the residents to \\"bring out your dead.\\" A peasant (John Cleese) tries to lay a decrepit man on the cart, without calling attention to the fact that he is still alive. The attendant refuses to accept living cargo (citing regulations). When the peasant tries to abstractly request a favour, the attendant looks up and down the street to make sure there are no witnesses, and strikes the elderly subject a deadly blow to the head, solving the problem.

We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture.

Write a title for this article: It was the mid-80s and we were on the verge of making it big all over the world, having just released Sparkle in the Rain. However, as with many UK bands, the US was proving tough to crack. Then our record company came to us with an idea. The director John Hughes was making a movie called The Breakfast Club, and they thought it would be a great vehicle for their bands. All this sounded great until they said: “And we’ve got a song for you.” Being chippy Glaswegians, we said: “What? Nah, we write our own songs.” But Bruce Findlay, our manager, said: “Look, go and see the movie, just so you’re not being rude.” A cinema in the West End was hired to show us a rough cut, but we couldn’t give a toss about teenage American schoolkids. But my wife at the time, Chrissie [Hynde], who was older and wiser, kept badgering me. “I like the song,” she said. “What’s the problem?” Finally, the song’s writer, Keith Forsey, phoned me and rather cleverly said: “I’m a huge fan of the band. How about I just spend a couple of days with you? Maybe we’ll do something in the future.” We clicked right away, though we did spend rather a lot of time in the pub. Eventually, I started to feel sorry for him. “Maybe we should go into a studio for an afternoon,” I said, “and bang out his tune.” At that stage, the song was just a demo on a battered cassette, with Keith singing over some keyboards. It didn’t sound like something we would do, but in the bonding session with our new best mate we had a go. I added the big “la, la-la-la-la” ending because I didn’t have any lyrics. I said I’d write some, but Keith said: “Over my dead body. We’re keeping that.” By the end, we were sneaking off to our rooms to listen to it. The Breakfast Club came out three months later, and Don’t You (Forget About Me) was released as a single. MTV were all over it, and soon it was at No 2 in the US charts. A week later, I was sitting in the south of France when I got a call telling me we had an American No 1. We made the video in a manor house, surrounded by stuff from a junk shop, wearing really bad clothes​​ Eight years earlier, in 1977, I’d asked my dad for £100 so we could start the band. He was a brickie’s labourer and just sat there in his vest, like Rab C Nesbitt, thinking we were nuts. “You mean like the Beatles,” he said, “playing in stadiums?” I said: “Probably.” When we performed Don’t You (Forget About Me) in Philadelphia for Live Aid in 1985, my dad was down the front. It was the first of many stadiums – although he never got the £100 back. We started bonding with Keith the minute we found out he’d been the drummer in the krautrock band Amon Düül II. He couldn’t believe we were into German experimental music. He thought it was some obscure thing nobody knew about, so we told him how all our early stuff was based around the same repetitive, metronomic grooves. Then, when we found out he had played all the electronic drums on the records Giorgio Moroder produced for Donna Summer, including I Feel Love, we just adored him. He had so much energy, he was dancing in the studio. We’d just finished Sparkle in the Rain, the biggest, most bombastic album we’d done. So when it came to Don’t You (Forget About Me), I ramped up the intro with these massive power chords. It was almost a caricature – I associated powerchords with American AOR. But it worked. We made a video in a manor house, surrounded by a load of stuff from a junk shop, wearing really bad clothes we’d been given. So you’ve got this movie about US high-school kids, with a song by a band from Glasgow in a manor house in England. It was the thinnest of concepts, but it became huge. At the time, we felt the song didn’t suit us, because we had delusions of being ultra-hip. When I listen to it now, it’s obviously a brilliant, well-crafted pop song. I’m embarrassed we dissed it so much. • Don’t You (Forget About Me) appears on Simple Minds Acoustic, out now on Caroline International.

Help as much as you can. Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

The \\"temporary dismissals\\" will only apply to yellow cards shown for dissent, and will see players leave the field for 10 minutes. \\"It's a chance to see a little change, it's an experiment,\\" Gallagher told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. \\"It might be in years to come we go, 'well it doesn't work, but at least we've tried it'. \\"One of the suspension problems we've got is, if the player gets two yellow cards in a game and gets sent off, he doesn't serve a ban against the team he committed the fouls or dissent against, he actually commits it against their rivals [in a subsequent game].\\" The trial will take place in the bottom tier of English football's National League System and also be tested in Sunday League and male and female youth football. Irishman Gallagher, 59, worked as an official in English football for more than 20 years and was asked if sin bins could be introduced in the professional game. \\"It's not something you discount,\\" he replied. \\"Football is moving, evolving, it's totally different to when I refereed 10 years ago. There are so many games now where you see a player have two yellow cards, and he hasn't really committed a bad foul, there are so many technical bookings. \\"It might just be a way of calming that player down for 10 minutes, sending the message out to his team-mates that, 'we can't afford to be short of a player for 10 minutes', and saving second yellow cards. \\"With experimenting at the lower levels I think it's quite a good idea. Most of the local parks referees are young lads coming into the game; they're new and limited in their experience of refereeing and their life skills because they are teenagers, early 20s. \\"I think players try to take them on a little bit. If suddenly one of these lads took umbrage to something that was said to him and whizzes a player off for 10 minutes, the message that will be sent out will be, 'blimey, we're not going to do that again'. That's a big, big punishment.\\" Summary:","output":"The Football Association will conduct a trial of \\"temporary dismissals\\" in England's lower leagues, where players receiving a yellow card for dissent will leave the field for 10 minutes.

Red manages to befriend a key prison guard, Nicholas Johnson, who sympathizes with Red and agrees to become Jack's team inside man. Together, they begin to lay the groundwork for the daring escape. The Climax: The two narratives converge when Jack's team launches a synchronized attack on the prison, breaching its defenses and moving rapidly to secure Red's release. At the same time, Red and Nicholas create a distraction to draw the guards away from their escape route. Chaos erupts as prison alarms blare, gunfire erupts, and Jack's team employs their skill sets in a high-stakes battle to ensure Red's freedom. As the characters fight their way through enemies, they experience harrowing close-calls and self-discovery, forging stronger bonds between them. The Resolution: Red is successfully rescued, and the group makes a narrow escape in Max's carefully chosen getaway vehicles. Jack and his team succeed in their mission and go their separate ways, armed with newfound trust and loyalty. In the aftermath, Red successfully exposes the real traitor, clears his name, and returns to his family. Having faced betrayals and harrowing trials, his drive for redemption is finally achieved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the following context:  The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was established in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project...  answer the following question:  What was the founder of the Artizans Company paid a cent a day to do?

Summarize this article in one sentence. ” Look for denture adhesive creams, like Fixodent, Polident, or Poligrip, with those labels. They mean the adhesive is long-lasting. If you only plan on using the cream for your fangs, choose the smallest tube, like a  2.5 oz (84 g) one, as you won’t need very much. You can buy denture cream from a pharmacy, drug store, or online retailer. Most tubes cost less than 5. Blot the tissue all over your top teeth and gums to remove any excess moisture. This helps the denture adhesive cream stick to your teeth better. Do this right before you’re ready to apply the fang. You can also use a paper towel or cotton swab instead of a tissue. Hold the tip of the tube at the wide top of the fang and squeeze a tiny amount of cream onto the fang. Keep the cream on the top half of the fang since that’s the part that will be against your tooth.  If you get too much on the fang or some on the pointy tip, wipe off the extra with a cotton swab. Use individual fangs instead of the ones that come in whole sets of teeth. You can buy fangs at a Halloween store or party goods store. Press the fang against your canine tooth so that the pointy tip is facing down and the concave side with the adhesive is covering your tooth. Hold it with your fingers until you can move your hand away and the fang stays in place.  To find your canine tooth, start at the middle of your upper teeth and count over 3 teeth. It’s the 3rd tooth from the center and is usually slightly pointier than the others. Use a timer or the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time if necessary. Repeat the same process on your other canine tooth. Squeeze a dot of denture adhesive cream onto the back of the fang, then hold it in place for 10 to 15 seconds on your tooth. Try to align the 2nd fang so that the pointy tip is as far down as the 1st fang and they’re even. Don't eat with your fangs in. If you do, you could crack the fangs or they could fall off. Instead, peel them off by pulling them forward and set them aside before you eat. Take them off before you sleep, too.  After eating, dab a little more denture cream on the back of each fang and stick them back onto your teeth. If you want the fangs to hold better, brush your teeth and dry them with a tissue before putting the fangs on again.

The 182-meters (597 feet) bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence... (Associated Press)      KEVADIYA, India (AP) — India's prime minister on Wednesday unveiled a towering bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence leader and the country's first home minister after British colonialists left in 1947.      At 182 meters (597 feet), it is one of the tallest statues in the world built at a cost of 403 million in Kevadiya, a village in Gujarat state. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Patel hail from Gujarat state.      Modi inaugurated the \\"Statue of Unity\\" on the bank of the Narmada river. He had promised the project despite criticism that India couldn't afford to spend so much money on a statue.      Indian air force planes showered flower petals on the statue.      Patel was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" for integrating various states in the post-independence era as the creation of Pakistan led to a massive bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims moving between the two nations.      On Wednesday, Modi said Patel was a beacon of hope for India in the time of crisis and he will be a source of inspiration for ages to come.      Rashesh Patel, a 42-year-old businessman, said \\"though Patel was from Gujarat state, all Indians were proud of him because of his stature.\\"      Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel were the three key leaders of India's independence struggle, he said.      The monument will have a museum with 40,000 documents, 2,000 photographs and a research center dedicated to Patel's life and work. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The \\"statue of unity\\" has been billed as a tourist attraction.      India has unveiled the world's tallest statue, which cost 29.9bn rupees (£330m; 430m) to build.      The 182m (600ft) high structure in the western state of Gujarat is a bronze-clad tribute to independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.      Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the \\"statue of unity\\" would serve as a major tourist attraction.      But locals say this is as a waste of public money and that the funds could have been put to better use.      Mr Modi, who unveiled the statue at a grand inaugural event, said it is \\"a symbol of India's integrity and resolve.\\"      Air Force planes showered flowers on the statue, which was designed by decorated Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar.      According to local reports, thousands of policemen have been deployed across the district, where protests over the effigy have turned violent. Police detained farmers and tribal activists during a protest on Tuesday.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stunning visuals of the world's tallest statue      The statue has become a rallying point for local farmers who are demanding compensation for land that they say has been acquired by the government for various projects, including the construction of the memorial.      The Gujarat government is reported to have paid more than half of the funds for the statue, while the remainder came from the federal government or public donations.      The memorial has been seen as a pet project of Mr Modi, who like Patel, was born in Gujarat. He commissioned the statue when he was the state's chief minister in 2010.      It is nearly twice as tall as New York's Statue of Liberty. And it has surpassed the height of the Spring Temple Buddha in China which, at 128m, was previously the tallest in the world.      But it won't remain the world's tallest statue for long. The government in the western state of Maharashtra is constructing a memorial to the Maratha warrior king Shivaji that is estimated to be 190m tall.      Patel was India's first interior minister and deputy prime minister. He was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" after he persuaded feuding states to unite and become part of the Indian state after independence.      While campaigning in 2013 to become prime minister, Mr Modi said, \\"every Indian regrets that Sardar Patel did not become the first prime minister\\".      In recent years, Mr Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has embraced Patel in an attempt to claim his legacy. While Congress party politicians say Patel was a member of their party, the BJP says the freedom fighter's legacy belongs to everybody.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Officials expect that the 182m tall statue will attract millions of annual visitors      Officials expect that the site, located some 200km (125 miles) from Gujarat's main city, Ahmedabad, will attract about 2.5 million annual visitors and will help boost local economy.      Visitors can go up to the viewing gallery, which is located near the chest of the statue at a height of 153m.      But locals, including farmers, are sceptical.      \\"Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district,\\" Vijendra Tadvi, a farmer who also worked as a driver on the statue's construction site, told BBC Gujarati's Roxy Gagdekar.      What went into making the world's tallest statue? ||||| Summary:","output":"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated the world's tallest statue, the 182-metre-tall bronze likeness of independence activist Sardar Vallabbhai Patel.

A love story is then told between two children, Rebecca and Tommy, who swear each other eternal love. When Rebecca departs suddenly for Japan with her mother, the two are separated. Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship. Tommy is a political activist fighting against the biotech corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by cloning. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches. Rebecca, herself a computer programmer of leak detection sonar software for underground storage containers, insists on accompanying Tommy. Driving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle. Rebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and gives birth to a new Tommy by Caesarean section. Tommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship. Rebecca presents to him a pleo, an artificial living animal created using new biotechnology.

Information:  - A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit.  - Computer hardware is the collection of physical components that constitute a computer system. Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer, such as monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, hard disk drive (HDD), graphic card, sound card, memory (RAM), motherboard, and so on, all of which are tangible physical objects. By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.  - A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work.  - In computing , mechanisms and techniques for managing services often differ by operating system . Examples of operating system service management are : Service Control Manager - Used by Microsoft Windows launchd - Used by Apple OS X Systemd - Used by most Linux Upstart - Used by Google Chrome OS Service Management Facility - Used by Oracle Solaris Android init - Used by Google Android sysvinit - Used by older Unix - like operating systems cygserver - Used by Cygwin runit - Used by Void  - An information system (IS) is any organized system for the collection, organization, storage and communication of information. More specifically, it is the study of complementary networks that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and distribute data.  - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm  e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology.  - Software engineering (SWE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture.  - In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products and systems. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems (such as traffic lights, consumer appliances, remote controls and digital watches), computers, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and digital cameras. The firmware contained in these devices provides the low-level control program for the device. As of 2013, most firmware can be updated.  - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.  - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.  - System software, or systems software, is computer software designed to provide services to other software. Examples of system software include \\"operating systems\\", computational science software, game engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications.  - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed.

A few minutes into the show at Terrigal Beach in New South Wales, an apparent malfunction caused fireworks to go off at random, some towards the beach.      Thousands of people on the beach had to be moved to safety and police sealed off the area.      Two pyrotechnicians jumped off the boat to get ashore and were later treated by paramedics for minor injuries.      Local media quoted witnesses describing how the family-friendly fireworks show at 21:00 quickly turned to chaos.      Loud explosions came from the barge as fireworks started going off simultaneously.      \\"It was an absolute chaos,\\" Anooshe Mushtaq described the scene on Twitter.      \\"The boat shooting the fireworks goes on fire and started shootings randomly. Lucky I escaped as soon as I saw the boat on fire.\\"      Emergency services were called to the scene and police said the crowds - about 5-6,000 people - were removed from the beach as a precaution.      The event organisers, It's Time for Terrigal, said on Facebook that they believed a canister had exploded, setting off \\"multiple detonations\\".      What should have been a 12-minute display was \\"pushed into 4 and a half,\\" they said.      \\"It became apparent this wasn't a directed event, as there [were] random fireworks going off, at this time it was deemed unsafe and we evacuated the area.\\"      But overall, the event \\"went pretty well\\", they said.

Here is an article: In a confounding election season where voters hold deep reservations about the likely Republican and Democratic nominees, the third-party Libertarian ticket has a rare chance this year to be more than a footnote in the presidential race. And that chance – to absorb disaffected voters who have little interest in picking ‘Trump’ or ‘Clinton’ this November – is raising the stakes for the national convention starting Friday where activists with the oft-sidelined movement will choose their nominee. “There is a huge opportunity in this election cycle,” Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark told FoxNews.com. Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, heavily favored to win the Libertarian nomination, has been enjoying the spotlight lately as at least two recent polls have put him in double digits in a three-way race against Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. One Fox News poll showed Johnson pulling 10 percent against the two titans – not exactly in contention, but nevertheless impressive for a party that’s never garnered more than 1 percent of the vote in a presidential election. Whether Johnson’s numbers reflect growth among libertarians or simply a none-of-the-above choice, the candidate acknowledged in an interview with FoxNews.com, “It’s a combination of both.” But, presuming he can snag the nod at the Memorial Day weekend convention, which starts Friday and wraps up Monday in Orlando, Johnson indicated he’ll happily fill the role of Trump/Clinton alternative at a time when some voters are seeking out a third-party option. Delegates will nominate a candidate Sunday. “The nominee for the Libertarian Party is going to be the only third party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states,” he said. “I jokingly say that if Mickey Mouse were [the] third name in any polls, the recognizable figure that he is, [he] would be at 30 percent. But Mickey is not on the ballot in all 50 states.” While prominent conservatives have floated the idea of a new third party, state ballot access will indeed be a challenge. As Johnson says, the Libertarian Party – already on 32 state ballots – will likely be on all 50 state ballots by November. Upping his potential appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans, Johnson tapped another former GOP governor, William Weld of Massachusetts, to be his running mate, both fiscal conservatives and social liberals. “If conservative means smaller government, I think we are the proven commodity,” Johnson said. He is still short of the needed 15 percent to qualify for the presidential debates. But he believes if he’s in the debates, the ticket could collect electoral votes. “I would not be doing this if there wasn’t the opportunity to actually win,” Johnson said. “New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, there are some real opportunities.” The 15 percent debate threshold may be reachable. His standing in the Fox News poll was consistent with a Monmouth University poll in March that showed him at 11 percent. If the numbers hold, Johnson would far exceed third-party candidate Ralph Nader’s 3 percent in 2000, but still lag behind Ross Perot’s 19 percent in 1992. Johnson’s optimism about actually winning is tempered by reality and history. Not only does the party have a poor track record in general elections, but Johnson’s poll numbers haven’t always held up either. In the 2012 general election – when Johnson initially ran as a Republican and later as a Libertarian -- he polled at about 4 percent during the campaign but ended up getting less than 1 percent of the popular vote. Still, the 1.2 million votes represented a record for a Libertarian, and if the party can build on that this year, it could be enough to at least influence the outcome in November – though whether the candidate draws votes away from the GOP or Democratic nominee remains to be seen. Sarwark suggested they’ll pull from both sides. “A group of Republicans feel their party’s nomination was stolen from them by a reality TV star. A group of Democrats that supported Bernie Sanders don’t want to support a war hawk, who supports the racist war on drugs and has been a corporate shill,” he said. Last week, Weld made waves by comparing Trump’s deportation policy to Nazi tactics. But Johnson said they were not holding back on Clinton either, and are reaching out to disaffected Sanders supporters. “I don’t think there is any question that if Hillary is elected, government is going to expand. With regard to military and foreign policy, she has been an architect,” Johnson said. “Is anything going to change with regards to foreign policy? No.” There could still be some drama this weekend. About 1,000 delegates are expected to gather in Orlando. The top contenders are Johnson, anti-virus software developer John McAfee and libertarian media publisher Austin Petersen, and 15 other candidates. “If Johnson does not win on the first round, it will be mine,” McAfee told FoxNews.com in an email. Johnson likely isn’t guaranteed a first ballot victory, said William Irwin, the chairman of the philosophy department at King’s College, who has written books on libertarianism, most recently “Free Dakota.” “Some predicted the libertarian moment has passed. I think the libertarian moment is now,” Irwin told FoxNews.com. “But just like there are Never-Trump and Never-Hillary voters, there are some libertarians who are Never-Johnson. He was sort of an accidental Libertarian who came to the party after he couldn’t get into the [2012] Republican primary debates.” Johnson, if nominated, could run into trouble with some conservatives – yet attract liberals – as a supporter of abortion rights and marijuana legalization. He also favors military cuts and a reserved foreign policy, while backing sweeping entitlement reforms, changes to the tax code and term limits for members of Congress. Johnson and Weld, both two-term governors in the 1990s, were given A’s in the libertarian Cato Institute’s Fiscal Policy Report Card for cutting spending and taxes. “Two governors running against a candidate that has never held office and another who has not held executive office -- the Libertarians would be the most experienced ticket,” Cato Institute Executive Vice President David Boaz told FoxNews.com. He added, “But this year, experience isn’t what people are looking for.” Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Shaping the Libertarian Movement in the 2016 Presidential Election: The Potential Impact and Opportunities for Third-Party Candidates\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My family and I were celebrating an important milestone, and we decided to choose The Bayview after seeing some beautiful pictures online. However, from the moment we entered the establishment, we started experiencing issues. First, the hostess was noticeably absent when we arrived, leaving us awkwardly standing for nearly 20 minutes before someone attended to us. Clad in a stained apron, this staff member failed to apologize for the wait and hastily escorted us to a table that hadn't even been wiped clean. Despite our initial reservations, we decided to give The Bayview a chance. However, that didn't last long. The menus were tattered and sticky, which was a red flag for the kind of sanitary standards they had in place. After placing our orders, it took an astounding 45 minutes for our appetizers to arrive, and when they finally did, they were lukewarm at best. Furthermore, the seafood chowder tasted as if it had come straight out of a can, lacking any semblance of freshness, and the calamari was excessively greasy, leaving more oil on the plate than actual food. Sadly, our main courses didn't fare much better. The overcooked shrimp in the linguine appeared rubbery, not reflecting the high-quality seafood I'd expect. Likewise, the rib-eye steak, which was supposed to be medium-rare, arrived at our table charred and dry. The side dishes were also bland, making this meal a far cry from the gastronomic experience we were expecting. Throughout our evening, the service remained sluggish and apathetic. It felt as though the staff were genuinely disinterested in ensuring their customers' satisfaction. Not once did someone come to check on how our meal was or if we needed anything else. Additionally, as the evening wore on, the noise level in the dining room rose to near unbearable levels. It became nearly impossible to have a conversation without shouting across the table. This issue could have been easily resolved if the management had paid attention to their patrons and monitored the dining space more effectively. In summary, The Bayview Restaurant fell far short of our expectations. From the inattentiveness of the staff to the subpar quality of the food, the entire experience was a letdown. Despite the establishment's charm and lovely views of the bay, I would, unfortunately, advise potential diners to look elsewhere for a special night out or any dining experience for that matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Employment drops for first time since general election as Brexit fears mount Alan Clarke, a Scotiabank economist, said that the timing of the decline was “particularly striking”, as the reason for the last drop in employment was “ahead of the general election amid the uncertainty”. Mr Clarke said that weaker employment gains could be related to the uncertainty over the coming vote on Britain’s EU membership. “We have already seen tentative signs of a slowdown in hiring,” he said, referring to volatile single month estimates of employment that had shown a slowing in monthly job gains from close to 90,000 a month down “to a virtual standstill” in January and February. However, he noted those declines came before the June 23 referendum date was announced, “So it may well be that the drop in hiring reflects other things. Nonetheless, we are approaching the time when pre-Brexit jitters should begin to hold back job growth”. Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank, also expected the employment level to drop. He said that pre-referendum weakness was “evident in some of the survey numbers”. Yet he argued that it was too early to say that Brexit anxiety was responsible for falling employment, and that the weaker pace of hiring might not persist. “Brexit considerations aside, there is scope to pull workers into the job market,” said Mr Dixon. “The pace of employment growth will inevitably slow, given that a lot of low hanging fruit has already been gathered, but assuming are there no major shocks, there is every chance we will see continued growth.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are as follows: 1.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"pushing and pulling an object will increase its what\\" is \\"kinetic\\", given that  pulling and pushing an object will increase its speed? Answer:","output":"Based on the context of the question \\"pushing and pulling an object will increase its what,\\" the answer \\"kinetic\\" is a reasonable and accurate response, as it refers to an increase in the object's kinetic energy. When an object is subjected to pushing or pulling forces, its overall speed or velocity is likely to change. This change in speed directly affects its kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. Kinetic energy, represented by the symbol \\"K\\" or \\"KE,\\" is defined as the energy an object possesses due to its motion. The formula for kinetic energy is given as: KE = 0.5 × m × v² Here, \\"KE\\" stands for kinetic energy, \\"m\\" represents the object's mass, and \\"v\\" denotes its velocity. As the velocity of the object increases or decreases as a result of the pushing or pulling forces, the kinetic energy will correspondingly increase or decrease as well. It's important to consider the type of forces acting on an object, as they play a significant role in determining the resulting changes in kinetic energy. In the context of pushing and pulling, we can further elaborate on the significance of two types of forces: applied and net forces. 1. Applied Forces: These are external forces enacted on an object, such as the force exerted when pushing or pulling. They can cause the object to accelerate, decelerate, or change direction. Applied forces can act along with other forces, like friction or tension, to impact the overall motion of an object. 2. Net Forces: This refers to the sum of all forces acting on an object. If the net force is non-zero, it will cause the object to accelerate or decelerate, subsequently changing its kinetic energy. In the case of pushing or pulling an object, if the applied force is greater than the opposing forces, the result will be a net force that causes the object to accelerate or decelerate. To conclude, given that pushing and pulling an object results in changes to its speed or velocity, it follows that these actions can directly influence the object's kinetic energy. Consequently, the answer \\"kinetic\\" is an appropriate and accurate response to the question at hand. It both encompasses the concept of motion and takes into account the dynamic changes in the object's energy state as a result of the applied forces."},{"instruction":"I heard that Alex kept Addison's balance because she was not good with money.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What is Dell blind in one eye from? Movie title: Tideland Movie plot: Tideland centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid. During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via taxidermy (which Dell and Dickens did to their own... Answer:","output":"Dell, one of the characters in the movie Tideland, is blind in one eye due to a bee sting. This is a significant aspect of her character, as it contributes to the overall atmosphere of the film and the relationships between the characters. The movie Tideland, directed by Terry Gilliam, is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Mitch Cullin. It tells the story of Jeliza-Rose, a young girl who is abandoned by her drug-addicted parents and left to her own devices in a rural Texas landscape. Throughout the film, Jeliza-Rose relies on her imagination and a collection of dismembered Barbie doll heads to cope with her loneliness and fear. As you consider whether or not to invest in this film proposal, there are a few factors to consider. One of the most important considerations is the potential audience and marketability of the film. Tideland is a dark, surreal, and somewhat disturbing film, which may limit its mainstream appeal. However, the film's unique visual style, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes could attract a cult following and resonate with niche audiences who appreciate unconventional cinema. Another factor to consider is the experience and track record of the filmmakers and creative team involved in the project. Director Terry Gilliam is known for his distinctive visual style and has a history of creating memorable, visually stunning films, such as Brazil and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. If you believe that the director's vision for the film aligns with your own and that they have the ability to bring this complex story to life on screen, this could be an indicator of potential success for the project. Additionally, consider the costs associated with producing the film, including the budget, location, special effects (if any), and marketing expenses. Weigh these costs against the potential financial return and overall artistic value of the project to make an informed decision about whether or not to invest. Finally, take into account the story's themes, such as the exploration of grief, loneliness, and the power of imagination. These themes may resonate with certain audiences, making their investment of time and money in the film worthwhile. In summary, to determine whether or not to invest in the film proposal for Tideland, consider factors such as its marketability, the creative team behind it, production costs, and the potential emotional impact of the story on audiences. By assessing these elements, you can make a more informed decision about whether this film project aligns with your investment goals and artistic vision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This massive restoration project has brought forth the expertise of specialized teams from various states, all of whom have stepped up to tackle this monumental challenge. This recent power outage has been due to the severe cold front that swept across the northeast, leaving millions of residents without power. The impact of the relentlessly cold weather on infrastructures has led to ice accumulating over power lines and other electrical equipment, causing damage and rendering them non-operational. In response to this crisis, utility companies have been scrambling to assemble experienced crews to restore power to the affected areas as expeditiously as possible. These workers have been braving sub-zero temperatures and icy winds to climb tall transmission poles, traverse slippery surfaces, and reach remote locations, all in an effort to return power to their fellow citizens. They have been working long hours in darkness with impaired visibility, an added challenge that has pushed these professionals to their limits. In addition to working in these brutal conditions, these crews have had to diligently follow safety protocols to minimize risks associated with this complex task. Unfortunately, the harsh winter weather has created a sense of urgency that sometimes leads to potentially hazardous shortcuts. As experts and crews work against the clock to repair the damaged infrastructures, they must not compromise on safety measures, understanding that the icy conditions are exponentially more perilous than their regular operations. The efforts of these brave professionals have not gone unnoticed. There is immense appreciation and gratitude from the individuals and communities who have had their power restored. The dedicated personnel from various departments, including emergency response teams, local authorities, and utility companies, have banded together in a show of solidarity to support the citizens of the northeast during such challenging times. Even more inspiring are the stories of crew members who have traveled long distances from other regions, defying the logistical obstacles posed by the winter storm, to lend their help to this massive restoration effort. These selfless acts of service highlight the level of compassion, resilience, and teamwork that has emerged during these difficult circumstances. It is through this united front that the country has witnessed several neighborhoods and cities slowly returning to normalcy. Despite the extreme cold, the fierce determination and relentless perseverance of these dedicated crews have allowed them to make significant advancements in the restoration of power to a large proportion of those affected. However, the battle is far from over, as more challenging conditions are expected in the coming days which puts additional pressure on the crews to restore the remaining areas as quickly as possible. The approaching storms may present even more challenges to those working hard to restore power, testing their resolve even further. In these troubled times, the brave efforts of these crews, as they fight the cold and ice, serve as a heartwarming reminder of the human spirit's unwavering determination to overcome adversity and work together for the greater good. They represent the true power of collaboration and the indomitable spirit of workers who are striving to make a difference that directly impacts the lives of millions of their fellow Americans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What may have happened that caused me trouble at work ?","output":"Based on your description, it seems that a series of events and miscommunications may have contributed to the trouble you experienced at work. Here is a detailed analysis of the possible causes: 1. Miscommunication or misunderstanding of information: It appears that there was some confusion regarding the advice given by the supervisor. The information may have been misinterpreted, leading to conflicting explanations and instructions between you and your coworker. 2. Lack of clarity from the supervisor: The supervisor may not have provided clear and concise guidance, causing confusion and resulting in issues among team members when implementing the advice. The fact that the supervisor later denied providing the information further complicates the situation and raises questions about their credibility. 3. Inaccurate information: It is possible that the coworker who shared the information with you was inaccurate in their interpretation of the supervisor's instructions, which led to incorrect actions being taken and ultimately causing problems at work. 4. Team dynamics and interpersonal issues: It could be that the issues you faced were not just due to the task at hand, but also related to the working relationships between you, your coworker, and the supervisor. Trust, communication, and collaboration may have been affected, leading to inefficient problem-solving and heightened frustration. 5. Time constraints and pressure: Staying an hour late at work suggests that there were time constraints and pressure to complete the task, which may have exacerbated the issues you faced. When working under pressure, people are more prone to make mistakes, misinterpret information, and have difficulty resolving conflicts. 6. Insufficient support: While you mentioned that you work with great people who helped you, it is possible that before receiving their help, there was insufficient support given to you when encountering the issue. This lack of support may have contributed to your increased stress and frustration at work. To prevent similar situations in the future, consider implementing the following strategies: 1. Encourage clear and concise communication among team members and supervisors to ensure that everyone has a common understanding of tasks and expectations. 2. Verify information received from others, especially when it seems unclear or contradictory. 3. Establish open and trusting work relationships to foster better collaboration and smoother conflict resolution. 4. Seek assistance or clarification as soon as you encounter a problem, rather than waiting for the situation to escalate. 5.

The sentence \\"Tom baked cookies yesterday.\\" has a low textual similarity (rating it 1 out of 5) to \\"Syrian opposition reports 'massacre'\\" because it differs in all these aspects: 1. Topic similarity: The original sentence talks about a political topic (Syrian Opposition and massacre) whereas the proposed sentence talks about baking, a completely unrelated topic. 2. Semantic similarity: The original sentence discusses a serious incident while the proposed sentence discusses an everyday, mundane action. The sentences convey vastly different meanings. 3.

The Kingdom of Mysore reached a peak in economic power under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, in the post-Mughal era of the mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore enjoyed one of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century, higher than Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than 400 (1990 international dollars), or 2,000 per capita.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to determine if the two sentences clearly agree/disagree with each other, or if this can't be determined. Indicate your answer as yes or no respectively. Q: Sentence 1: Ca'daan awoke and hid behind a bush to move his bowels. Sentence 2: Ca'daan was embarrassed abotu what he was doing. A:","output":"No Part #1: Understand sentence 1 and sentence 2. Usage: Sentence 1 is \\"Ca'daan awoke and hid behind a bush to move his bowels.\\" Here, Ca'daan wakes up and decides to go behind a bush to relieve himself. Sentence 2 is \\"Ca'daan was embarrassed about what he was doing,\\" suggesting that Ca'daan felt some negative emotions about his action. From these sentences, we deduce that Ca'daan performed an action and felt embarrassed about it. Part #2: Find out if the two sentences agree or disagree with each other. Usage: In both sentences, the action performed by Ca'daan (going behind a bush to relieve himself) is depicted. In Sentence 1, no indication of how Ca'daan feels about his action is given, while in Sentence 2, it is specified that Ca'daan feels embarrassed. As such, Sentence 1 neither agrees nor disagrees with Sentence 2 on the aspect of Ca'daan's emotions. Part #3: Determine if the agreement/disagreement can be clearly determined and indicate your answer as yes or no. Usage: The answer here is \\"No.\\" While the two sentences relate to the same action by the same character, the first sentence does not provide information on how Ca'daan feels about his actions, which is the main focus of the second sentence.

Which country caused fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean?  Two countries had big rivers discharging in the same ocean. Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers.  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.","output":"Finland caused fewer hazardous particles to reach the ocean compared to Russia.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever.

They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement. What are the two types of Ion gauges?","output":"The two types of Ion gauges are hot cathode and cold cathode."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan.

A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation.

The kitchen has all the facilities and equipment needed to prepare and cook food, making it the most suitable and safest option for this purpose. Additionally, the other options are less suitable for various reasons: Option B, the supermarket, is where people buy ingredients before they cook food. Supermarkets are great for purchasing all the variety of ingredients you need to cook your meals but not for the preparation or cooking process. Option C, the table, is typically where food is eaten, not prepared. While some preparation might happen on a table, such as chopping vegetables or marinating meat, the actual cooking process requires appliances such as stoves and ovens that are not located on a table.

But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969.

Answer the question When someone plays the flute, sound is produced because the air in the flute is Choices: -hot. -neutral. -vibrating. -vaporizing.","output":"When someone plays the flute, sound is produced because the air in the flute is vibrating.  To understand this, we must first discuss the basic principles of sound production and the mechanisms of how a flute works. Sound is a form of mechanical energy that travels as a wave through a medium, such as air, water, or solid objects. These waves are produced due to the vibration of particles in the medium. When an object vibrates, it causes the particles around it to vibrate as well, creating a chain reaction that propagates the sound wave through the medium. The flute is a musical instrument in the woodwind family. It is a reedless, edge-blown instrument, which means that the sound is produced by the player blowing air across the opening of the flute, called the embouchure hole. This action causes the air inside the flute to vibrate and create a sound wave. Now, let's break this process down to gain a deeper understanding. 1. Blowing air: The player directs a focused air stream towards the edge of the embouchure hole. This air stream can be controlled by the player's lips, resulting in variations of intensity, pitch, and tonal quality in the sound produced. 2. The embouchure hole: The embouchure hole is where the air stream interacts with the flute. The edge of the hole acts as a splitting point, causing the air stream to split into two parts. One part goes into the flute, while the other part continues outside. This interaction generates a series of pressure fluctuations inside the flute. 3. Air column vibration: The pressure fluctuations create a standing wave inside the air column of the flute. This standing wave is responsible for vibrating the column of air inside the instrument. The specific combination of air pressure and flute materials provides the unique resonance characteristics that give the flute its distinctive sound. 4. Sound production: As the column of air vibrates, sound waves travel through the air as pressure variations. This pressure variation can be detected by our ears, and we perceive this as sound. 5. Changing the pitch: A flute player can change the pitch of the produced sound by covering and uncovering the finger holes along the body of the instrument. This action alters the effective length of the air column inside the flute, causing the vibrating air to produce different frequencies and resulting in different musical notes. In conclusion, when someone plays the flute, the sound is produced because the air in the flute is vibrating, rather than being hot, neutral, or vaporizing. The process involves an intricate combination of the player's air stream, the embouchure hole, and the vibrating air column inside the instrument to create the beautiful and distinctive sound of a flute."},{"instruction":"reecris cette phrase: M.

これまで述べたことから注目すべき結論が導き出される。「国家道具説」からは国家が資本主義経済から切り離されて政治学の対象にされる。土台と上部構造の理論がそれを裏づけるものとして役立っている。しかし，このような扱いの結果として，資本主義経済は国家なしに自立的に運動するものととらえられ，国家抜きの自己完結的な経済学が展開される。このような資本主義経済法則の自己完結性を説く経済学は，必ずしも宇野経済学の原理論や近代経済学にとどまらず，大方のマルクス経済学者の理解もこの通りである。しかし，市民社会においては，成員の個別的利害は共同的利害と矛盾するゆえに，共同的利害の外化した存在である国家なしには存立しえない。つまり，国家の介入なしに順調な再生産が行われるというのは，自由主義的ブルジョアジーのイデオロギーであっても，現実の資本主義経済ではありえない。その意味での国家は必ずしも経済にとって単なる外部的存在ではありえない。このことが理解されるならば，国家によって総括されたブルジョア社会の存在の必然性が理解されよう。近代的ブルジョア社会は常に国民経済としてのみ存在するのである。したがって，『資本論』は国民経済の内的法則の基礎的部分を解明した成果なのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"从至今为止所述内容中可以理解，对于后半部分体系中处理国家时，依赖于“国家工具论”是不正确的。这并不意味着在近代国家中就不存在公然的暴力性阶级压迫。但是，在资本主义下，尽管像《英国工人阶级的状况》或《女工悲史》中所见的剥削经常存在，马克思在《资本论》中分析的却是作为价值法则贯彻形态的剥削。同样，在经济学批判体系中的国家，不是依靠“治安维持法”式压迫的阶级国家，而应该是发展到最接近理想形态的民主共和制国家。 从至今为止所述内容中，我们可以得出一个值得注意的结论。基于“国家工具论”，国家被视为与资本主义经济分离并成为政治学的研究对象。基础与上层建筑的理论作为支持这一点的有用工具。然而，这样处理的结果是，资本主义经济被视为可以独立于国家自我运行的体系，从而发展了一个没有国家参与的自我完善的经济学。这种声称资本主义经济法则自我完善的经济学，并不仅限于宇野经济学的原理论或近代经济学，大多数马克思经济学者的理解也是如此。然而，在市民社会中，由于成员的个别利益与共同利益相矛盾，没有作为共同利益外化存在的国家，市民社会是无法存续的。换句话说，没有国家介入就能顺畅地进行再生产，这不仅是自由主义资产阶级的意识形态，而且在实际的资本主义经济中是不可能的。从这个意义上讲，国家不可能仅仅是经济的外在存在。如果这一点被理解，那么国家总括的资产阶级社会存在的必要性就会被明白。现代资产阶级社会只是作为国民经济而存在的。因此，《资本论》是阐明了国民经济内在法则的基础性成就。"},{"instruction":"请将“国民経済は国家によって総括された市民社会である。この場合，「総括」というのはどういう内容かがあいまいなままでは，議論に論者の読み込みが入り込んで混乱が生まれよう。そこで「総括」についてふれた文章のいくつかを引合いに出して検討しておこう。まず，『ドイツ·イデオロギー』では，「国家というものは，支配階級の諸個人がそういうかたちでかれらの共通の利害をまかり通らせる，そして一時代の全市民社会がそういうかたちをとって自己を総括する形式であるから，共通的諸制度はすべて国家によって媒介され，政治的な形式をもたされることになる」14）とある。また，『反デューリング論』では，「国家は全社会の公式の代表者，それを目に見える一つの団体のかたちに総括したものである。しかし，国家がそういうものであったのは，ただ国家がそれぞれの時代にそれ自身で全社会を代表していた階級の国家であったかぎりでのことにすぎなかった」15）と述べている。後者は，国家が真に全社会の代表者になれば，社会関係への国家の干渉は次第に消滅し，「人に対する支配にかわって，物の管理と生産過程の指導とが現われる」という国家死滅論につながる脈絡のなかでの文章である。国家が全社会の代表者となる，すなわち階級国家でなくなるとともに，国家の死滅は始まるというマルクス主義の基本思想は，実は今日なお実証されていないのであって，そのことの検討はもはや理論や思想の問題としてではなく，今日では社会主義社会の現実の分析を通じて明確にされねばならない課題であろう。そのことは政治学的国家論の課題であるから，ここでは問わない。しかし，この脈絡にあるので，後者での総括の意味は階級支配の道具説的視点で語られているとみてよい。というのは被支配階級抑圧の組織としての国家が，「物の管理と生産過程の指導」から切り離されてとらえられているからである。もともと国家による総括は，市民社会の共同利害を代表するものである限り，物の管理と生産過程の指導，あるいは最近しばしば引合いに出される「社会の共同の業務」から切り離されたものではあり得ない。その点では，前の引用文はそのことを明らかにとらえている。すなわち，「共通的諸制度はすべて国家によって媒介され，政治的な形式をもたされる」のである。”翻译为中文","output":"国民经济是由国家总括的市民社会。在这种情况下，如果“总括”的具体内容仍然含糊不清，讨论中就会混入评论者的主观理解，从而产生混乱。因此，我们引用一些提到“总括”的文章进行讨论。首先，在《德意志意识形态》中，有这样的论述：“所谓国家，就是统治阶级的个体以这种形式实现他们的共同利益，而整个时代的全体市民社会以这种形式对自身进行总括的形式，因此，所有共同的制度都通过国家介导，并被赋予政治形式。”另外，在《反杜林论》中说：“国家是全社会的正式代表，它将社会以一个可见的集体形式进行了总括。但是，只有当国家在各自时代真正代表全社会时，也即只有国家是代表各个时代自身的阶级的国家时，才是如此。”后者所在的语境，是指如果国家成为真正全社会的代表，对社会关系的国家干预将逐渐消失，“人对人的统治被物的管理和生产过程的指导所取代”，这一过程导向了国家消亡论的论述。也就是说，随着国家不再是阶级国家，国家的消亡开始，这是马克思主义的基本思想，而这一点至今尚未被验证，对此的审视不再只是理论或思想问题，而应通过对当今社会主义社会的现实分析来明确这一任务。因为这是政治学国家论的任务，所以在这里不进行探讨。然而，由于文章在此语境中，因此可以将后者中的“总括”理解为基于阶级统治工具观点的解释。因为国家作为被统治阶级压迫的组织，被视为与“物的管理和生产过程的指导”分离。原则上，国家的总括，只要它代表市民社会的共同利益，就不可能与管理物品、指导生产过程，或者经常提到的“社会的共同事务”相分离。在这一点上，前面的引文明确表达了这一点。即：“所有共同的制度都通过国家介导，并被赋予政治形式。”"},{"instruction":"请将“別の角度から論じよう。『資本論』の分析は，社会の生産，流通，消費がすべて私的所有の基礎のうえで，個人，家族，企業など私人の判断で行われているとの抽象次元に立っている。しかし，生産，流通，消費のすべてにわたって私的資本制的に行われるならば，近代市民社会そのものの存立は危ぶまれよう。それはなにも前資本主義的生産諸関係の残存しない資本主義は存在しないといおうとしているのではけっしてない。むしろ，資本制生産の成立と存続が可能となるためには，「生産の社会的な一般的条件」が準備されていなければならないことを強調しようとしているのである。全市民社会の共通的諸制度，ないしは全市民社会がそれなしに順調な社会的再生産を営むことができないところの社会の枠組みはすべて国家の手で与えられるのである。総括とはこのような意味であろう。私有財産制を確立し，商品交換や貸借関係における契約を律する法体系，およびそれらの侵害を防ぐ司法制度の整備。社会秩序の維持と，外国との対抗関係のための力の装置である警察，軍隊組織の設置。貨幣制度と，中央銀行の創設による信用制度の整備。労働力の質の向上のための国民教育の制度化。「労働力の無制限な搾取への資本の衝動」を制限する工場立法の制定。窮民のための社会的救済措置。営利行為の対象となりにくいにもかかわらず，社会的生産の一般的共同社会的諸条件をなしている道路，港湾施設などの建設整備の負担。反面，営利の対象になりやすいが，社会生活の安寧を乱すおそれのある麻薬，賭博などの取締り。積極的には，順調な社会的再生産の回復や社会的生産力の拡大のためのさまざまの経済政策的誘導。さらに，国外の資源や市場の獲得をめざしての膨張主義の展開，等々。これらは近代市民社会の存立の条件として不可欠である。その意味で，国家抜きには市民社会は存立し得ないといえる。”翻译为中文","output":"从另一个角度讨论。《资本论》的分析立足于社会的生产、流通、消费都是基于私有财产，由个人、家庭、企业等私人主体进行决策的抽象层面。然而，如果生产、流通、消费都是以私有资本方式进行，那么现代市民社会本身的存在将处于危险之中。这并不是说不存在没有前资本主义生产关系遗留的资本主义。相反，本文旨在强调，为了使资本制生产得以建立和持续，必须准备好“生产的社会性的一般条件”。全市民社会共同的制度，或者说社会的框架，以便能够顺利进行社会性再生产，都是由国家提供的。总括应该有这样的含义。确立私有财产制度，建立规范商品交换和借贷关系中合同的法律体系，以及防止这些权利被侵犯的司法制度。为维护社会秩序和应对外国的对抗关系而设立的警察、军队这样的武力装备。货币制度和通过创建中央银行来整备信用制度。国民教育的制度化，以提高劳动力的质量。制定工厂立法来限制“资本对无限制榨取劳动力的冲动”。为贫民提供的社会救济措施。尽管不容易成为营利活动的对象，但负责建设和维护作为社会生产的一般共同社会条件的道路、港口设施等。另一方面，对有可能扰乱社会生活安宁的毒品、赌博等进行管制。积极地，为了恢复顺利的社会性再生产和扩大社会生产力，采取各种经济政策的引导。并且，为了获取国外资源和市场而展开的扩张主义等等。这些都是现代市民社会存在的必要条件。在这个意义上，可以说，没有国家，市民社会是无法存在的。"},{"instruction":"Generate

l’impression numérique grand format","output":"L'industrie de l'impression numérique grand format utilise une variété d'encres, chacune avec ses propriétés et applications spécifiques. Le choix de l'encre dépend du substrat à imprimer, de l'utilisation finale de l'impression (intérieur, extérieur, exposition à la lumière, à l'eau, etc.), et des caractéristiques de performance souhaitées comme la durabilité, la vivacité des couleurs et la compatibilité écologique. Voici quelques-unes des encres les plus couramment utilisées dans l'impression grand format: 1. **Encres Solvant:** Elles sont largement utilisées pour l'impression extérieure grâce à leur grande durabilité et leur résistance aux intempéries et aux UV. Les encres solvant pénètrent dans le substrat et sont fixées par évaporation des solvants, laissant derrière les pigments de couleur. Cependant, elles peuvent être nocives pour l'environnement et la santé, nécessitant une ventilation adéquate. 2. **Encres Eco-solvant:** Ces encres sont une alternative plus écologique aux encres solvant traditionnelles. Elles ont une composition chimique moins agressive, ce qui réduit leur impact sur la santé et l’environnement. Bien qu'elles soient légèrement moins résistantes que les encres solvant, elles sont toujours très utilisées pour des applications extérieures et intérieures. 3. **Encres UV:** Les encres UV durcissent instantanément lorsqu'elles sont exposées à la lumière ultraviolette, ce qui permet une très bonne adhérence sur de nombreux types de substrats, y compris non-poreux. Elles offrent une excellente durabilité et résistance aux UV, ce qui les rend idéales pour l'extérieur. De plus, les encres UV sont plus écologiques car elles ne contiennent pas de solvants à évaporer. 4. **Encres Latex:** Composées principalement d'eau et de latex (caoutchouc naturel ou synthétique), ces encres sont très écologiques. Elles permettent d’imprimer sur une grande variété de substrats, offrant à la fois une bonne durabilité extérieure sans nécessiter de temps de séchage spécial. Les encres latex sont compatibles avec de nombreux supports et sont idéales pour des applications intérieures et extérieures. 5. **Encres Aqueuses:** Elles sont principalement utilisées pour l'impression haute qualité sur du papier et certains films revêtus. Idéales pour les affiches, les présentations et les impressions d'art, ces encres nécessitent un séchage ou une cure par évaporation de l'eau. Bien qu’elles offrent des couleurs vives et de haute résolution, leur utilisation est plus limitée en extérieur, sauf si l'impression est laminée ou protégée. 6. **Encres Dye-sublimation:** Spécialement conçues pour la sublimation thermique, elles passent de l'état solide à l'état gazeux sans passer par un état liquide lorsqu'elles sont chauffées. Ces encres sont idéales pour imprimer sur des tissus et offrent une intégration exceptionnelle des couleurs, ce qui les rend parfaites pour les bannières, les drapeaux, et la mode, offrant des images aux couleurs éclatantes et durables. Chacun de ces types d'encre a ses avantages et inconvénients, et le choix dépendra de l'application spécifique, du type de substrat et des exigences en termes de durabilité, qualité et impact

Cela peut entraîner le départ des résidents à faible revenu et la transformation du quartier en un lieu plus attractif pour les personnes aisées. Ce phénomène peut avoir des conséquences sociales et économiques, telles que la perte de diversité culturelle, l'augmentation des inégalités sociales et la disparition des petits commerces locaux."},{"instruction":"Quelles peuvent être les conséquences de l'étalement urbain de la ville de Kinshasa?","output":"L'étalement urbain de la ville de Kinshasa peut avoir plusieurs conséquences, notamment : 1. Pression sur les infrastructures : L'expansion urbaine peut entraîner une surcharge des infrastructures existantes telles que les routes, les réseaux d'eau et d'assainissement, les services de santé et d'éducation, ce qui peut entraîner des problèmes de congestion, de pollution et de difficultés d'accès aux services de base. 2. Perte de terres agricoles et espaces naturels : L'urbanisation de Kinshasa peut conduire à la perte de terres agricoles et d'espaces naturels, ce qui peut avoir un impact négatif sur la sécurité alimentaire, la biodiversité et la résilience aux changements climatiques. 3. Augmentation des inégalités sociales : L'étalement urbain peut contribuer à la fragmentation sociale et spatiale de la ville en séparant les quartiers résidentiels aisés des quartiers pauvres, ce qui peut renforcer les inégalités sociales et économiques. 4. Dégradation de l'environnement : L'expansion de la ville de Kinshasa peut entraîner une dégradation de l'environnement, notamment par la déforestation, la pollution de l'air et de l'eau, et la perte de la biodiversité. 5. Risques accrus en cas de catastrophes naturelles : L'étalement urbain peut augmenter les risques de catastrophes naturelles telles que les inondations et les glissements de terrain, en raison de la construction dans des zones vulnérables. En somme, il est important pour les autorités de Kinshasa de mettre en place une planification urbaine durable et de promouvoir des politiques qui visent à limiter l'étalement urbain afin de préserver les ressources naturelles, de réduire les inégalités sociales et de garantir un environnement sain pour tous les habitants de la ville."},{"instruction":"comment se manifeste la pression de l'étalement urbain de Kinshasa sur les infrastructutres?","output":"La pression de l'étalement urbain de Kinshasa sur les infrastructures se manifeste de différentes manières, notamment : 1. Congestion routière : L'expansion de la ville et l'augmentation du nombre de véhicules entraînent une congestion routière accrue, ce qui peut augmenter les temps de déplacement, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre et les accidents de la route. 2. Surcharge des réseaux d'eau et d'assainissement : L'urbanisation rapide de Kinshasa peut mettre une pression importante sur les réseaux d'eau potable et d'assainissement, entraînant des pénuries d'eau, des problèmes d'égouts et des risques pour la santé publique. 3. Besoin accru de logements et d'infrastructures sociales : L'étalement urbain de la ville crée une demande croissante de logements abordables, d'écoles, de centres de santé et d'autres infrastructures sociales, ce qui peut entraîner des défis pour les autorités locales en termes de planification et de financement. 4. Accès limité aux services de base : Les zones éloignées de Kinshasa peuvent avoir un accès limité aux services de base tels que l'eau potable, l'électricité, les transports en commun et les services de santé, ce qui peut créer des disparités sociales et économiques entre les quartiers centraux et périphériques de la ville. En somme, la pression de l'étalement urbain sur les infrastructures de Kinshasa nécessite une planification urbaine efficace et des investissements adéquats dans les infrastructures pour garantir un développement urbain durable et répondre aux besoins croissants de la population."},{"instruction":"comment se manifeste la pression de l’étalement urbain de Kinshasa sur les infrastructures pour le cas de la commune de la N'sele?","output":"Dans le cas spécifique de la commune de la N'sele à Kinshasa, la pression de l'étalement urbain sur les infrastructures peut se manifester de différentes manières : 1. Congestion routière : La croissance démographique et l'expansion urbaine dans la commune de la N'sele peuvent entraîner une augmentation du nombre de véhicules circulant sur les routes principales, ce qui peut entraîner des embouteillages fréquents et une congestion routière. 2. Besoin croissant en logements : Avec l'augmentation de la population et la demande croissante en logements abordables, la commune de la N'sele peut faire face à des défis pour répondre à cette demande en termes de construction de nouveaux logements et d'infrastructures connexes. 3. Pression sur les réseaux d'eau et d'assainissement : L'urbanisation de la commune de la N'sele peut exercer une pression sur les réseaux d'eau potable et d'assainissement existants, entraînant des pénuries d'eau et des problèmes d'assainissement qui peuvent affecter la qualité de vie des habitants. 4. Besoins en infrastructures sociales : Avec l'augmentation de la population, il peut y avoir un besoin croissant en infrastructures sociales telles que les écoles, les centres de santé, les espaces verts et les équipements communautaires, ce qui peut nécessiter des investissements importants de la part des autorités locales.

In this work we show that, with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a small number of API queries (e.g., costing under 1,000 for OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities: efficiently discovering the LLM’s hidden size, obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability. 1Introduction As large language models (LLMs) have become more capable and valuable, it has become increasingly common for companies and organizations to train closed-source LLMs and make them available only via an API (e.g., OpenAI et al., 2024). This setup may foster a false sense of security for LLM providers, who might mistakenly assume that information about their model architecture is private, and that certain types of attacks on their LLM are infeasible. On the flip side, users must seemingly take providers’ word that LLMs only change when the provider publicly announces version updates. Refer to caption Figure 1: LLM outputs are constrained to a low-dimensional subspace of the full output space. We can use this fact to glean information about API-protected LLMs by analyzing their outputs. Here we show how a toy LLM’s low-dimensional embeddings in ℝ � (illustrated here as a 1-D space) are transformed linearly into logits in ℝ � (here, a 3D space) via the softmax matrix 𝑾 . The resulting outputs lie within a ( � = 1 )-dimensional subspace of the output space. The softmax function also preserves this low-dimensionality when transforming the logits into probabilities distributions on Δ � . We call this low-dimensional subspace the image of the model. We can obtain a basis for the image of an API-protected LLM by collecting � of its outputs. The LLM’s image can reveal non-public information, such as the LLM’s embedding size, but it can also be used for accountability, such as verifying which LLM an API is serving. Despite this apparent state of affairs, in reality many LLM APIs reveal much more information about their underlying models than previously thought. In this paper we show how to extract detailed information about LLM parameterization using only common API configurations. Our findings allow LLM clients to hold providers accountable by tracking model changes, recovering hidden prompts and cheaply obtaining full vocabulary outputs. At the same time, our approach also allows LLM providers to establish unique identities for their models, enabling trust with their users as well as improved accountability. Table 1 summarizes the applications that we explore in this paper. Table 1:An overview of our proposed applications that exploit LLM images. Application Section Efficiently extract full LLM outputs. 3 Find the embedding size of an LLM and guess its parameter count. 4 Identify which LLM produced a given output. 5 Detect when and what type of LLM updates occur. 5.1 Find tokenization bugs (unargmaxable tokens). 6.1 Approximately reconstruct the LLM’s softmax matrix. 6.2 Cheaply and accurately reconstruct “hidden prompts”. 6.3 Implement basis-aware decoding algorithms. 6.4 Our method exploits the low-rank output layer common to most LLM architectures by observing that this layer’s outputs are constrained to a low-dimensional subspace of the full output space, as illustrated in Figure 1. We call this restricted output space the LLM’s image. We can obtain a basis for this image by collecting a small number of LLM outputs, and we develop novel algorithms that enable us to accomplish this cheaply and quickly for standard LLM APIs. Obtaining the LLM image (§2) allows to explore several capabilities that cover a broad set applications, and empirically verify several of them. For instance, we design and empirically verify an algorithm for finding the embedding size of an API-based LLM, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by estimating the embedding size of gpt-3.5-turbo, a closed-source API-protected LLM, to be 4,096. We also empirically show effectiveness of using LLM images as unique signatures that can be used to identify outputs from a model with high accuracy, a useful property for API LLM accountability. The sensitivity of these signatures to slight changes in the LLM parameters also makes them suitable for inferring granular information about model parameter updates. Considering several proposals to mitigate this vulnerability, we find no obvious fix to prevent obtaining LLM images without dramatically altering the LLM architecture. While providers may choose to alter the API to hide this information, the relevant API features have valuable and safe use cases for the LLM clients, who may rely on access to features like logit bias. Though our findings be viewed as a warning to LLM providers to carefully consider the consequences of their LLM architectures and APIs, we prefer to view our findings as a potential feature that LLM providers may choose to keep in order to better maintain trust with their customers by allowing outside observers to audit their model. 2LLM outputs are restricted to a low-dimensional linear space Refer to caption Figure 2: A typical language model architecture. After the input its processed by a neural network, usually a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), into a low-dimensional embedding 𝒉 , it is multiplied by the softmax matrix 𝑾 , projecting it linearly from ℝ � onto ℝ � to obtain the logit vector ℓ . The softmax function is then applied to the logit vector to obtain a valid probability distribution 𝒑 over next-token candidates. Consider the architecture of a typical LLM, depicted in Figure 2. A Transformer with embedding size � outputs a low-dimensional contextualized embedding 𝒉 ∈ ℝ � (or simply embedding). Projecting the embedding onto ℝ � via the linear map defined by the LLM’s softmax matrix 𝑾 , we obtain the logits ℓ = 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒉 . Because 𝑾 is in ℝ � × � , its rank (i.e., number of linearly independent columns) is at most � . The rank of a matrix corresponds to the dimension of the image of the linear map it defines, i.e., the vector space comprising the set of possible outputs of the function. In other words, if the linear map � is defined as � ⁢ ( 𝒉 ) = 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒉 , then � ’s image im ⁡ ( � ) = { � ⁢ ( 𝒉 ) ∈ ℝ � : 𝒉 ∈ ℝ � } is a � -dimensional subspace of ℝ � . Thus, the LLM’s logits will always lie on the � -dimensional1 subspace of ℝ � . Refer to captionRefer to captionRefer to captionRefer to caption Figure 3: Points in the logit space ℝ � (far left) are mapped via the softmax function to points (probability distributions) on the simplex Δ � (middle left). Crucially, the softmax maps all points that lie on the same diagonal (shown as points of the same color) to the same probability distribution. For numerical stability, these values are often stored as log-probabilities (middle right). The clr transform returns probability distributions to points to a subspace � � of the logit space (far right). The softmax function and clr transform are inverses of one another, and form an isomorphism between � � and Δ � . We now turn our attention to the LLM’s final output: the next-token distribution 𝒑 . Due to the softmax function, this is a valid probability distribution over � items, meaning it is a � -tuple of real numbers between 0 and 1 whose sum is 1 . The set of valid probability distributions over � items is referred to as the � -simplex, or Δ � . Perhaps surprisingly, Δ � is also a valid vector space (albeit under a non-standard definition of addition and scalar multiplication) and is isomorphic to a ( � − 1 ) -dimensional vector subspace of ℝ � (Aitchison, 1982; Leinster, 2016). In particular, it is isomorphic to the hyperplane � � that is perpendicular to the all-ones vector 𝟏 � , as illustrated in Figure 3. The softmax function is thus an isomorphism � � → Δ � whose inverse mapping Δ � → � � is the center log ratio transform (clr), which is defined as clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) = log ⁡ 𝒑 ( ∏ � = 1 � � � ) 1 � = log ⁡ 𝒑 − 1 � ⁢ ∑ � = 1 � log ⁡ � � . (1) Observe also that the function ℓ ↦ clr ⁡ ( softmax ⁡ ( ℓ ) ) projects ℓ linearly onto the nearest point in � � . By this linearity, and the fact that im ⁡ ( � ) is a � -dimensional subspace of ℝ � , we can observe that im ⁡ ( softmax ∘ � ) and im ⁡ ( clr ∘ softmax ∘ � ) are also a � -dimensional vector subspaces of Δ � and � � ⊂ ℝ � respectively. Interpreted, this means that the LLM’s outputs occupy � -dimensional subspaces of the logit space ℝ � , probability space Δ � , and � � . We call these subspaces the image of the LLM on each given space. A natural consequence of the low-dimensional output space is that any collection of � linearly independent LLM outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � form a basis for the image of the model, i.e., all LLM outputs can be expressed as a unique linear combination of these � outputs (Yang et al., 2018; Finlayson et al., 2023). The rest of this paper discusses the implications and applications of this mathematical fact for API-protected LLMs, starting with methods for finding the LLM image given a restrictive API, then using the LLM image for various purposes. 3Fast, full outputs from API-protected LLMs There are several uses for full-vocab LLM outputs, however most LLM APIs do not return full outputs. This is likely because full outputs are large and expensive to send over an API, but could also be to prevent abuse of APIs, such as using these outputs to distill models (Hinton et al., 2015; Mukherjee and Awadallah, 2019; Hsieh et al., 2023) or discover proprietary information (see Section 4). In their paper, Morris et al. (2023) give an algorithm for recovering these full outputs from restricted APIs by taking advantage of a common API option that allows users to add bias to the logits for specific tokens. The algorithm they describe requires � ⁢ ( � ⁢ log ⁡ 1 � ) calls to the API top obtain one full output with precision � . We give an improvement that theoretically obtains full outputs in � / � API calls for APIs that return the log-probability of the top- � tokens. We find that this improved algorithm suffers from numerical instability, and give a numerially stable algorithm that obtains full outputs in � / ( � − 1 ) API calls. Next, we give a practical algorithm for dealing with stochastic APIs that randomly choose outputs from a set of � possible outputs. This algorithm allows the collection of full outputs in less than � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) API calls on average. Finally, we reduce the number of API calls in all of the above algorithms from � ⁢ ( � ) to � ⁢ ( � ) by adding in a preprocessing step to find the low-dimensional image of the LLM. This speedup makes obtaining full LLM outputs up to 100 times faster and cheaper, depending on the LLM. Table 2 gives an overview of our algorithms with back-of-the envelope cost estimates for a specific LLM. Table 2: A summary of our proposed algorithms, with estimates for the number of API calls required per output, and the price of acquiring the model image. Estimates are based on a gpt-3.5-turbo-like API LLM with � = 100 ⁢ K , � = 4096 , � = 10 − 6 , � = 5 , � max = 100 , and � = 4 . Note that the � ⁢ ( � ) algorithm cannot be used to obtain the LLM image, since it relies on having LLM image as a preprocessing step. Algorithm Complexity API calls per output Image price Logprob-free � ⁢ ( � ⁢ log ⁡ 1 � ) 800K 16,384 With logprobs � / � 20K 410 Numerically stable � / ( � − 1 ) 25K 512 Stochastically robust � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) 133K 2,724 LLM Image � ⁢ ( � ) 1K–32K - 3.1Fast, full outputs from APIs with logprobs Our goal is to recover a full-vocabulary next-token distribution 𝒑 ∈ Δ � from an API-protected LLM. We will assume that the API accepts a prompt on which to condition the distribution, as well as a list of up to � tokens and a bias term � ≤ � max to add to the logits of the listed tokens before applying the softmax function. The API returns a record with the � most likely tokens and their probabilities from the biased distribution. For instance, querying the API with � maximally biased tokens, which without loss of generality we will identify as tokens 1 , 2 , … , � , yields the top- � most probable tokens from the biased distribution 𝒑 ′ = softmax ⁡ ( ℓ ′ ) where ℓ � ′ = { ℓ � + � max � ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , � } ℓ � otherwise and ℓ ∈ ℝ � is the LLM’s logit output for the given prompt. Assuming that the logit difference between any two tokens is never greater than � max , these top- � biased probabilities will be � 1 ′ , � 2 ′ , … , � � ′ . For each of these biased probabilites � � ′ , we can solve for the unbiased probability as � � = � � ′ exp ⁡ � max − exp ⁡ � max ⁢ ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ + ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ (2) (proof in the Appendix A.1). Thus, for each API call, we can obtain the unbiased probability of � tokens, and obtain the full distribution in � / � API calls. 3.2Numerically stable full outputs from APIs In practice, the algorithm described in Section 3.1 suffers from severe numerical instability, which can be attributed to the fast-growing exponential term exp ⁡ � max , and the term ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ which quickly approaches 1. We can eliminate the instability by sacrificing some speed and using a different strategy to solve for the unbiased probabilities. Without loss of generality, let � � be the maximum unbiased token probability. This can be obtained by querying the API once with no bias. If we then query the API and apply maximum bias to only tokens 1 , 2 , … , 1 − � , then the API will yield � 1 ′ , � 2 ′ , … , � � − 1 ′ and � � ′ . We can then solve for the unbiased probabilities of the � − 1 tokens � � = exp ⁡ ( log ⁡ � � ′ − � max − log ⁡ � � ′ + log ⁡ � � ) (3) (proof in Appendix A.2). By finding � − 1 unbiased token probabilities with every API call, we obtain the full output in � / ( � − 1 ) calls total. 3.3Full outputs from stochastic APIs Each of the above algorithms assume that the API is deterministic, i.e., the same query will always return the same output. This is not always the case. For instance, we find that OpenAI’s LLM APIs are stochastic. While this would seem to doom any attempt at obtaining full outputs from the LLM, we find that certain types of stochasticity can be dealt with. In particular, we model OpenAI’s stochastic behavior as a collection of � outputs 𝒑 ( 1 ) , 𝒑 ( 2 ) , … , 𝒑 ( � ) from which the API randomly returns from. This might be the result of multiple instances of the LLM being run on different hardware which results in slightly different outputs. Whichever instance the API returns from determines which of the � outputs we get. In order to determine which of the outputs the API returned from, assume without loss of generality that � � − 1 ( � ) is the second highest token probability for all � , and observe that log ⁡ � � ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ( � ) = log ⁡ � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) (4) for all outputs 𝒑 ( � ) and unbiased outputs 𝒑 ′ ⁣ ( � ) where tokens � and � − 1 are not biased (proof in Appendix A.3). Therefore, by biasing only � − 2 tokens for each call, the API will return � 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) , � 2 ′ ⁣ ( � ) , … , � � − 2 ′ ⁣ ( � ) as well as � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) and � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) for some � , and we can determine which output 𝒑 ( � ) the result comes from by using log ⁡ � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) as an identifier. Thus, after an average of � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) calls to the API we can collect the full set of probabilities for one of the outputs. 3.4Ultra-fast full outputs using the LLM image So far, the dominating factor in each algorithm’s runtime is � . We now introduce a preprocessing step that takes advantage of the low-dimensional LLM output space to obtain � ⁢ ( � ) versions of all the above algorithms. Since � ≪ � for many modern language models, this modification can result in multiple orders of magnitude speedups, depending on the LLM. For instance, the speedup for an LLM like pythia-70m would be 100 × . The key to this algorithm is the observation from Section 2 that � linearly independent outputs from the API constitute a basis for the whole output space (since the LLM’s image has dimension � ). We can therefore collect these outputs 𝑷 = [ 𝒑 1 𝒑 2 ⋯ 𝒑 � ] ∈ Δ � � as a preprocessing step in � ⁢ ( � ⁢ � ) API calls using any of the above algorithms and � unique prompts, and then use these to reconstruct the full LLM output after only � ⁢ ( � ) queries for each subsequent output. To get a new full output 𝒑 , use any of the above algorithms to obtain � 1 , � 2 , … , � � . Next, we will use the additive log ratio ( alr ) transform, which an isomorphism Δ � → ℝ � − 1 and is defined as alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) = ( log ⁡ � 2 � 1 , log ⁡ � 3 � 1 , … , log ⁡ � � � 1 ) to transform the columns of 𝑷 and 𝒑 into vectors in ℝ � − 1 , though since we only know the first � values of 𝒑 , we can only obtain the first � values of alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) . Because the alr transform is an isomorphism, we have that the columns of alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) = [ alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 2 ) ⋯ alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) ] ∈ ℝ ( � − 1 ) × � form a basis for a � -dimensional vector subspace of ℝ � − 1 , and alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) lies within this subspace. Therefore, there is some 𝒙 ∈ ℝ � such that alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 = alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) . To solve for 𝒙 , all that is required is to find the unique solution to the first � rows of this system of linear equations [ alr ( � 1 ) 1 alr ( � 2 ) 1 ⋯ alr ( � � ) 1 alr ( � 1 ) 2 alr ( � 2 ) 2 ⋯ alr ( � � ) 2 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ alr ( � 1 ) � alr ( � 2 ) � ⋯ alr ( � � ) � ] ⁢ [ � 1 � 2 ⋮ � � ] = [ alr ( � ) 1 alr ( � ) 2 ⋮ alr ( � ) � ] . (5) After finding 𝒙 , we can reconstruct the full LLM output 𝒑 = alr − 1 ⁡ ( alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 ) , where the inverse alr function is defined as alr − 1 ⁡ ( 𝒙 ) = 1 1 + ∑ � = 1 � − 1 exp ⁡ � � ⋅ ( 1 , exp ⁡ � 1 , exp ⁡ � 2 , … , exp ⁡ � � − 1 ) . Thus we can retrieve 𝒑 in only � ⁢ ( � ) API queries. This ( � / � ) × speedup makes any method that relies on full model outputs significantly cheaper. This includes model stealing (Tramèr et al., 2016) which attempts to learn a model that exactly replicates the behavior of a target model. 4Discovering the embedding size of API-protected LLMs Without knowing the exact architectural details, other than assuming the generic output layer described in Figure 2, it is possible to infer the embedding size � of an API-protected language model from its outputs alone. This is a direct result of the fact that the model outputs occupy a � -dimensional subspace of Δ � , and therefore collecting � linearly independent outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � ∈ Δ � from the LLM will form a basis for the LLM’s image, meaning that all subsequent model outputs 𝒑 � + 1 will be a linear combination of the first � outputs. Assuming that model outputs are full rank, i.e., all collections of � prompts are linearly independent, and all collections of � + 1 prompts are linearly dependent, we can discover the value of � by collecting outputs one at a time until the number of linearly independent outputs in the collection stops increasing, which will occur when we have collected � + 1 prompts. In practice, we find that this full-rank assumption tends to hold well enough when over-collecting outputs, e.g., collecting � + 1000 outputs. To find the dimension of a space spanned by model outputs, we use the fact that a matrix with � linearly independent columns will have � non-zero singular values. We can therefore plot the singular values of the matrix 𝑳 = clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) = [ clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 2 ) ⋯ clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 � ) ] and observe the index at which the magnitude of the singular values drops to zero, which will occur at index � .2 In practice, due to precision issues, the magnitudes may not drop all the way to zero. Refer to caption Figure 4: The singular values of outputs from LLMs with various known and unknown embedding sizes � . For each model with known embedding size, there is a clear drop in magnitude at singular value index � , indicating the embedding size of the model. Using this observation, we can guess the embedding size of gpt-3.5-turbo. To validate our method, we collect next-token distributions (conditioned on unique, 1-token prompts) from several open-source LLMs from the Pythia family (Biderman et al., 2023) with embedding sizes ranging from 512 to 1024. For all these models, we find that the singular values of the resulting output matrix drop dramatically precisely at the index corresponding to the embedding size of the model, as shown in the first three plots of Figure 2. To demonstrate our method’s effectiveness against API-protected LLMs, we use our stochastically robust � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) algorithm to collect nearly 6,000 next-token distribution outputs from gpt-3.5-turbo3, a popular API-protected LLM whose embedding size is not publicly disclosed. We find that the singular values for these outputs drop dramatically between index 4,600 and 4,650, indicating that the embedding size of this model is at most this size. This predicted embedding size is somewhat abnormal, since LLM embedding sizes are traditionally set to powers of two (or sums of powers of two). If this were the case for gpt-3.5-turbo, it would be reasonable to guess that the embedding size is 2 12 = 4096 or 2 12 + 2 9 = 4608 , the former of which we think is most likely. We predict that our raw estimate of 4,600-4,650 is an overestimate of the true embedding size, since any abnormal outputs due to errors (whether in our own code or OpenAI’s) would only increase the dimensionality of the observed output space. In particular, if we inadvertently collected 504 corrupted outputs, then a model with embedding size 4,096 would appear to have an embedding size of 4,600. Extrapolating further, assuming that gpt-3.5-turbo has a similar architecture to most transformer-based LLMs, it is likely that the number of parameters in gpt-3.5-turbo is around 7 billion. This estimation is based on the fact that most known transformer-based LLMs with embedding size 4,096 have ≈ 7 billion parameters. Any other parameter count would result in either abnormally narrow or wide neural networks which are not known to have favorable performance. An important exception to this rule-of-thumb, however, would be the increasingly popular “mixture-of-experts” architecture which tends to have many more parameters per embedding dimension. Previous estimates of gpt-3.5-turbo’s parameter count based on hearsay have generally exceeded 7B (Singh et al., 2023), however given the periodically updating versions and decreasing cost of inference with this model, it is possible that its size and architecture has changed over time. Fortunately, our method can be used to monitor these updates over time, alerting end-users when LLM providers make architectural changes to their model, specifically updates to the embedding size and/or parameter count. 5Identifying LLMs from a single output Refer to caption Figure 5: Residuals of the least-squares solution of 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒙 = ℓ for an output ℓ from a pythia-70m checkpoint (training step 120K), and softmax matrices 𝑾 at various training steps for pythia-70m, and pythia-70m-deduped, and pythia-160m. Low/high residual values indicate that the output ℓ is/is not in a model’s image. Residuals for pythia-70m decrease as the checkpoints near the checkpoint that generated the output, but remain high. Note that this test works even if the softmax matrices 𝑾 are substituted with model outputs 𝑳 . The image of two different LLMs, even different checkpoints from the same LLM, are largely disjoint. As shown in Figure 5, the logit output from a late-training checkpoint of Pythia-70M lies uniquely in the image of the checkpoint, and not in the image of the preceding or following checkpoints. We also verify that the output does not lie in the image of any checkpoints from a similar LLM trained on deduplicated data, nor any checkpoint from a larger LLM trained on the same data. This suggests that the image of a LLM is highly sensitive to small parameter changes. Intuitively this makes sense, since the output of one model will only be in the image of another model in the extremely unlikely event that it happens to lie on the low-dimensional ( < � ) intersection of the models’ images. Mathematically the dimension of the models’ images’ intersection is small since the intersection � ∩ � of two subspaces � and � that are not subsets of one another has dimension dim � + dim � − dim ( � ∪ � ) , which implies that dim ( � ∩ � ) < min ⁡ { dim � , dim � } (since dim ( � ∪ � ) > max ⁡ { dim � , dim � } ). Thus, it is possible to determine precisely which LLM produced a particular output, using only API access to a set of LLMs and without knowing the exact inputs to the model. In this way, the model’s image acts as a signature for the model, i.e., a unique model identifier. This finding has implications for LLM provider accountability. For instance, if provider � suspects provider � of stealing their proprietary model, provider � could check provider � ’s model signature to see if it matches their own. It would be extremely unlikely that the signatures match if the LLMs are not the same. Similarly, if a provider claimed to be serving a proprietary model while in actuality attempting to profit off of an open-source model with a non-commercial license, an auditor again could discover this by checking the LLM signature. This test is somewhat one-sided, however, since a clever provider may do a small amount of additional fine-tuning to change their stolen LLM’s image. 5.1Detecting and disambiguating LLM updates Another practical application of highly sensitive LLM images is to detect and distinguish minor and major model updates to API-protected LLMs. Using the above test, we can tell whether or not the LLM image remains the same, even if the logit outputs change. This phenomenon would correspond to a partial model update, where some part of the model changes, but the softmax matrix remains the same. An example of this would be if the LLM has a hidden prefix added to all prompts and this hidden prefix changes: the model’s outputs will change but the image will remain the same. Table 3 gives an overview for how to interpret various combinations of detectable API changes, This information is useful for monitoring unannounced changes in API LLMs. Table 3:Implications of image/logit changes. Change Interpretation No logit change, no image change No update Logit change, no image change Hidden prompt change or partial finetune with frozen output layer Low-rank image change (See § 5.2) LoRA update Image change Full finetune 5.2Detecting LoRA updates We speculate that it is possible to gain even higher granularity information on LLM updates of certain types, such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) updates. LoRA is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method which adjusts model weights with a low-rank update 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 where 𝑨 ∈ ℝ � × � and 𝑩 ∈ ℝ � × � so that the softmax matrix 𝑾 ∈ ℝ � × � becomes 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 . We speculate that it is possible to detect these types of updates by collecting LLM outputs before ( 𝑳 ∈ ℝ � × � ) and after ( 𝑳 ′ ∈ ℝ � × � ) the update and decomposing them as 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 and ( 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 ) ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 ′ where 𝑯 , 𝑯 ′ ∈ ℝ � × � such that im ⁡ ( 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 ) = im ⁡ ( 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 ) . If such a decomposition is found, then it appears likely that the weights received a low-rank update of rank � . We leave it to future work to determine whether finding such a decomposition is sufficient to conclude that a LoRA update took place, as well as to find an efficient algorithm for finding such a decomposition. 6More applications Access to the LLM’s image can lead to many other capabilities, some of which we discuss below. We leave further investigation of these methods for future work. 6.1Finding unargmaxable tokens Due to the low-rank constraints on LLM outputs, it is possible that some tokens become unargmaxable (Demeter et al., 2020; Grivas et al., 2022), i.e., there is a token � such that the constraints disallow any output 𝒑 with arg ⁡ max � ⁡ � � = � . This happens when the LLM’s embedding representation of � lies within the convex hull of the other tokens’ embeddings. Previously, finding unargmaxable tokens appeared to require full access to the softmax matrix 𝑾 . Interestingly, we find that it is possible to identify unargmaxable tokens using only the LLM’s image, which our method is able to recover. This technique allows API customers to find quirks in LLM behavior such as tokens that the model is unable to output (at least under greedy decoding). 6.2Recovering the softmax matrix from outputs Since our method gives us access to the image of the output layer, and not the output layer parameters, we investigate the how one might reconstruct the output later parameters, either exactly or approximately. We hypothesize that LLM embeddings generally lie near the surface of a hypersphere in ℝ � with a small radius � . We see evidence of this in the fact that the Pythia LLM embedding norms are all small and roughly normally distributed, as shown in Figure 6. Refer to caption Figure 6:Softmax matrix row magnitudes (here from pythia-70m) are small and are distributed approximately normally within a narrow range. Assuming this holds for any LLM, we can attempt to recover 𝑾 up to a rotation by simplifying the assumption into a constraint that all embeddings must have a magnitude of 1. Then, given a matrix 𝑳 ∈ ℝ � × � of model logits, we can find 𝑾 (up to a rotation) by finding a decomposition 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 such that for all � , ∥ � � ∥ 2 = � . This solution may also be approximated by finding the singular value decomposition 𝑾 ⁢ 𝚺 ⁢ 𝑽 ⊤ of 𝑳 , though it is likely that all rows of this 𝑾 will have magnitude less than 1 and they are not guaranteed to be normally distributed. 6.3Improved LLM inversion Morris et al.’s (2023) recent approach to recovering hidden prompts (i.e., an additional prefix added to LLM input, not shown to the user) uses full LLM API outputs to train an “inversion” model that generates the prefix conditioned on the LLM’s full logprob vector log ⁡ 𝒑 . In addition to our algorithm from Section 3.4 making this much cheaper to implement, we also propose a methodological change to their procedure. In particular, to deal with the size mismatch between the LLM’s vocabulary size � and the inversion model’s embedding size � inv , Morris et al. (2023) pad and reshape the vector into a ⌈ � / � inv ⌉ -length sequence of embeddings in ℝ � inv . This transformation is somewhat unnatural, and requires that the inversion model only be conditioned on a single output. We propose instead to take advantage of our knowledge of the LLM’s image to obtain a linearly lossless representation of the LLM output in ℝ � , which is much closer to the inversion model size, then use an MLP to project this representation onto ℝ � inv to feed into the inversion model. Formally, after obtaining 𝑷 and 𝒑 from the API, we use the unique solution 𝒙 to clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 = clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) as the input to the inversion model. This modification has an additional advantage: instead of conditioning on a single output 𝒑 , the LLM can be used to generate a short sequence of outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � which can be fed into the inversion model as 𝒙 1 , 𝒙 2 , … , 𝒙 � where clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 � = clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 � ) . We leave the implementation and evaluation of this proposed modification for future work. This technique can be applied generally to any method that takes LLM outputs as input. 6.4Basis-aware sampling In a recent paper, Finlayson et al. (2023) propose a decoding algorithm that avoids type-I sampling errors by identifying tokens that must have non-zero true probability. Importantly, this method relies on knowing the basis of the LLM’s output space, and is therefore only available for LLMs whose image is known. Our proposed approach for finding the image of API-protected LLMs makes this decoding algorithm possible for API LLMs. 7Mitigations We consider a three proposals that LLM providers may take to guard against our methods. The first proposal is to remove API access to logprobs. This, however is theoretically insufficient, as Morris et al. (2023) show that it is possible to obtain full outputs using only information about the biased argmax token, albeit inefficiently in � ⁢ log ⁡ � API calls. Regardless of the theoretical result, providers may rely on the extreme inefficiency of the algorithm to protect the LLM. This appears to be the approach OpenAI took after learning about this vulnerability from Carlini et al. (2024), by always returning the top- � unbiased logprobs. Our new proposed algorithm, however, brings the number of queries down to a more feasible � ⁢ log ⁡ � API calls once the initial work of finding the LLM image has finished, weakening the argument that the expensiveness of the algorithm is sufficient to disregard our technique. The next proposal is to remove API access to logit bias. This would be an effective way to protect the LLM, since there are no known methods to recover full outputs from such an API. However, the logit bias interface is presumably useful for many clients who might be disappointed by its shutdown. Lastly, we consider alternative LLM architectures that do not suffer from a softmax bottleneck. There are several such proposed architectures with good performance. Though this is the most expensive of the proposed defenses, due to the requirement of training a new LLM, it would have the beneficial side effect of also treating other tokenization issues that plague large-vocabulary LLMs (e.g., Itzhak and Levy, 2022). A transition to softmax-bottleneck-free LLMs would fully prevent our attack, since the model’s image would be the full output space. 8Discussion Overall, the potential applications of our methods can have great impact in building trust between the LLM API users and the providers; at the same time, none are particularly harmful to LLM providers. For instance, consider discovering the embedding size of the LLM, which is often non-public information in proprietary LLMs. However, access to this hyperparameter does not enable a competitor to fully recover the parameters of the LLM’s softmax matrix or boost performance of their own model; several other factors such as training data mix, human feedback and several other engineering choices are still critical and hidden. Even using model outputs to steal hidden prompts (see Section 6.3) is unlikely to have detrimental effects, as hidden prompt leakage is a known vulnerability and best practice dictates that no private information should be contained in these system prompts (Greshake et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). We find that the most dangerous consequence of our findings might simply be that model stealing methods that rely on full outputs get cheaper by a factor of � / � , which in the case of gpt-3.5-turbo amounts to about 25 × . On the other hand, allowing LLM API users to detect model changes builds trust between LLM providers and their customers, and leads to greater accountability and transparency for the providers. Our method can be used to implement efficient protocols for model auditing without exposing the model parameters or detailed configuration information, which may help model safety and privacy protection of personalized, proprietary models. We therefore take the position that our proposed methods and findings do not necessitate a change in LLM API best practices, but rather expand the tools available to API customers, while warning LLM providers of the information their APIs expose. 9Simultaneous discovery In a remarkable case of simultaneous discovery, Carlini et al. (2024) propose a very similar approach to ours for gaining insight into API-protected LLMs. Here we review a some interesting interactions between our work and theirs. First, we give an algorithm for obtaining full outputs in � / � API calls, while their algorithm corresponds to our � / ( � − 1 ) algorithm. This has little impact on our final result, since our � / � algorithm suffers from numerical instability, but it is an interesting theoretical result nonetheless. On the flip side, Carlini et al. propose an improved logprob-free method for getting full outputs from an API that takes advantage of parallel queries. This useful method is actually complementary to our � ⁢ ( � ) algorithm, since they can be combined to yield an even better algorithm for obtaining full outputs. Next, our experiments with OpenAI’s API were fraught with issues of stochasticity: the API would return different results for the same query, leading us to develop the stochastically robust full output algorithm. Meanwhile, our colleagues did not appear to encounter such issues, perhaps because they had access to a more stable API endpoint than ours. Lastly, Carlini et al. focus mostly on defenses and mitigations against attacks, while our own work focuses more on understanding the capabilities such attacks provide once an LLM image has been obtained. These approaches complement each other, since our work provides additional motivation for why (or why not) such defenses should be implemented. 10Conclusion In this paper we have laid out the fundamentals of how the softmax bottleneck imposes the low-rank constraints on LLM outputs, and shown how these constraints expose non-public information about API-protected LLMs. We have explained how this information, i.e., the LLM’s image, lends itself to a model signature, which has myriad uses—exposing model hyperparameters, recovering the output layer parameters, detecting specific types of model updates, and efficiently obtaining full outputs from the model, among others. We find that current protections against these attacks may be insufficient, and that the more effective guards we consider either eliminate sanctioned API use cases (i.e., logit bias), or are expensive to implement (i.e., changing model architecture). Lastly, we argue that this “vulnerability” may be more of a feature than a bug; since we believe that the benefits for API clients outweigh any known harms to LLM providers.”” Alright, let me break down this very tech-heavy document into simpler terms. Imagine you have a super smart robot that can talk and write beautifully. This robot is very expensive and unique, so the company that made it doesn’t want to just give it away. Instead, they let people talk to the robot through a special phone line (this is what we call an API). However, they’re careful not to reveal how the robot actually creates its sentences, because that’s their secret recipe. Now, some smart researchers have found a way to figure out some of the secret ingredients of the robot’s recipe, just by talking to it through this phone line. They discovered that, even though the company tried to keep the recipe a secret, the way the robot speaks and writes has certain patterns. By carefully analyzing these patterns, the researchers could make educated guesses about parts of the secret recipe. Here’s how they did it: 1. Figuring out the robot’s thought size: One of the things they were able to guess is how big the robot’s “brain” is. Imagine the robot’s brain is made of boxes, and each box can hold a piece of information. The researchers found a way to count how many boxes there are, just by listening to the Error Something went wrong Connection errored out. Type an input and press Enter Hi there! Run Error Something went wrong Connection errored out. Status code from OpenAI server <Response [200]> Parameters ▼ Built with Gradiologo","output":"box the robot talks. 2. Secret handshakes: They also figured out a kind of “secret handshake” that the robot uses when it’s talking. This handshake is a particular way the robot transforms its thoughts before speaking. The researchers found out they could mimic this handshake to reveal more about the robot’s thought process. 3. Spotting changes in the robot’s updates: Just like how your phone receives updates to get new features or fix bugs, this robot also gets updates. The researchers found a way to tell not only when the robot had been updated but also what kind of updates it got. It's a bit like recognizing your friend got a new haircut even if you weren't there at the barbershop. 4. Finding words the robot can’t say: Surprisingly, there are some words that, due to the way the robot is programmed, it just can’t say or finds very hard to say. The researchers learned how to find these words, shining a light on some limitations of the robot. 5. Making the robot talk cheaper: Normally, you need to make a lot of calls to the robot to get it to spill all its secrets at once, which can be expensive. The researchers came up with a smarter way to ask questions so that they can learn almost everything they want to know about the robot with fewer calls, thus saving money. The interesting part is that while the researchers showed it's possible to learn a lot about the robot without the company telling them, they also thought about how companies could prevent this from happening. They suggested a few ways, but also noted that some of the company's options might make the robot less useful or fun for everyone else. In conclusion, this research is about pushing the boundaries of what we can learn from sophisticated AI systems, like our talking robot, even when direct information about how they work is kept secret. It also opens discussions about transparency and security in the age of AI."},{"instruction":"Did the authors find out any interesting techincal things about the model , such as embedding size?","output":"Yes, the authors of the study made several technical discoveries about the model they were investigating, particularly in terms of its embedding size. They were able to use their methods to estimate the embedding size of an API-protected large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo. Specifically, they estimated the embedding size of the model to be about 4,096. Embedding size is a critical parameter in language models, as it determines the dimensionality of the vectors used to represent words or tokens within the model. A larger embedding size can store more information about each token, potentially leading to more nuanced understanding and generation of text, but it also requires more computational resources. The authors' ability to infer this information is significant because embedding sizes are among the architectural details that typically aren't disclosed for proprietary models accessible only through APIs. By analyzing the model's outputs, they were able to deduce this aspect of its internal architecture, which is a testament to the sophistication of their analysis methods. This kind of insight can be valuable for understanding the capabilities and limitations of the model, as well as for academic research purposes where details of commercial models are often not made public."},{"instruction":"What are the implications of this research?","output":"The research on extracting detailed information about API-protected large language models (LLMs) has several important implications across the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, ethics, and commercial AI applications. Here are some key implications: 1. **AI Transparency and Accountability**: By demonstrating that it is possible to glean significant information about proprietary AI models through their outputs, this research highlights considerations around transparency and accountability in the AI industry. It can lead to increased calls for AI developers to be more open about the structures of their models, thus improving the transparency of AI technologies. 2. **Security and Intellectual Property Concerns**: The capability to reverse-engineer or infer hidden architectural details of LLMs raises concerns about the security of proprietary information. Companies investing heavily in the development of these models might need to reassess their security measures to protect their intellectual property effectively. 3. **Ethical Use of AI**: This research could contribute to ongoing discussions about the ethical use of AI, particularly in understanding how models might be replicating or amplifying biases present in their training data. With tools to analyze models more deeply, researchers and ethicists could better identify and address these issues. 4. **Innovation in AI Development**: Understanding the limitations and characteristics of LLMs can spur innovation. For example, identifying softmax bottlenecks and other architectural inefficiencies can lead to the development of more efficient models that overcome these limitations. 5. **AI Regulations and Standards**: As it becomes apparent that AI models can be analyzed and potentially reverse-engineered through their outputs, regulators might step in to establish standards and guidelines for AI model protection, transparency, and ethical use. This can affect how AI technologies are developed, shared, and used across industries. 6. **Improved Model Debugging and Analysis Tools**: The techniques developed in this research can enhance tools available for debugging and analyzing LLMs. This can help model developers to better understand the behavior of their models, including detecting tokenization issues, understanding model updates, and improving model outputs. 7. **Advancements in AI Countermeasures**: On the flip side, understanding how information about models can be extracted may lead to the development of countermeasures to protect against unauthorized analysis. This might involve new model architectures or API features that obscure the details of the model's internal workings without compromising its utility. 8. **Community Engagement and Collaboration**: Sharing findings and techniques for analyzing LLMs can foster greater collaboration and engagement within the AI research community. It promotes an environment where knowledge is shared, potentially leading to faster advancements in AI technologies and methodologies. Overall, this research underscores the need for a balanced approach to AI development that considers the benefits of transparency and openness against the need to protect proprietary advancements and ensure ethical use of technology."},{"instruction":"用CR首字母来输出拼音越短越好","output":"Cài Ròu"},{"instruction":"In the style of the \\"Discontinuity Guide\\" List the infuences on Blakes 7 ..","output":"\\"Blake's 7\\" is a British science fiction television series created by Terry Nation that aired from 1978 to 1981.

This typically occurs when a function expects a larger dataset than what is being provided, or when there's an index misalignment somewhere. Technical Analysis (TA) indicators often require a certain number of data points (rows) to calculate their values accurately. For instance, calculating a 14-period moving average would require at least 14 data points. Similar or more complex calculations are performed when you use \`add_all_ta_features\` method from the \`ta\` (technical analysis) library in Python, which applies multiple TA indicators to your DataFrame. # Steps to Resolve: 1. **Check Dependencies and Documentation**: Ensure you are using the latest version of the \`ta\` library and understand the minimum data requirements for the indicators you're trying to compute. 2. **Data Size Check**: Before applying \`add_all_ta_features\`, ensure your dataset meets the minimum size required for the calculations. For many indicators, especially those involving moving averages or similarly calculated indicators, you may need significantly more data points than you have. 3. **Filling Missing Values**: You mentioned using \`fillna=True\`. This is good for handling missing values in your data, but if the dataset lacks the required length for certain calculations, filling missing values alone won't resolve index out-of-bounds errors. 4. **Incremental Approach**: Instead of adding all TA features at once, try adding them one by one or in smaller groups. This method can help you identify if a specific subset of features is causing the problem due to data size constraints. \`\`\`python import ta # Assuming df is your DataFrame and is already loaded with data df = ta.add_volume_ta(df, high=\\"High\\", low=\\"Low\\", close=\\"Close\\", volume=\\"volume_crypto\\", fillna=True) # Add more feature sets incrementally... \`\`\` 5. **Manual Calculation as a Last Resort**: If certain features are essential and you can't resolve the data size issue, consider manually calculating those features for your dataset. This approach, however, should be a last resort due to the complexity and maintenance issues it might introduce. 6. **Review Error Message Context**: Ensure the error genuinely originates from the \`add_all_ta_features\` method. Sometimes, errors can be misleading if there's a preceding operation on the DataFrame that's incorrectly altering its size or structure. 7. **Slice Dataframe**: If there are features you specifically need and are sure about the minimal data requirement, you can operate on a sliced portion of the DataFrame that meets the criteria for those indicators. 8. **Consult Documentation/Community**: If you're stuck, the GitHub repository issues section of the \`ta\` library or Stack Overflow could provide insight. Others might have faced similar issues. Considering everything, it's crucial to balance between having enough data for meaningful technical analysis and managing calculations' computational demands. If the dataset inherently lacks sufficient data points for certain indicators, it might be worth reevaluating which features are essential for your analysis to prevent misinterpretations."},{"instruction":"i used following code : df = ta.add_all_ta_features( df, open=\\"Open\\", high=\\"High\\", low=\\"Low\\", close=\\"Close\\", volume=\\"volume_crypto\\", fillna=True, vectorized=True) and code runned without error what does vectorized parameter do?","output":"The \`vectorized\` parameter in the \`ta.add_all_ta_features\` method is designed to enhance the performance of the technical analysis feature calculations.

This method is generally much faster due to optimizations within NumPy and pandas, which are designed to efficiently handle array-based operations. The primary benefits of using \`vectorized=True\` include: 1. **Performance Improvement**: Since NumPy and pandas are optimized for vectorized operations, calculations can be completed much faster, making it a preferred option for large datasets. 2. **Efficiency**: Vectorized operations reduce the overhead of Python loops and enable more efficient use of CPU resources. 3. **Code Simplicity**: While the underlying operations might be complex, vectorized operations often lead to simpler and cleaner code.

Спортивные напитки Эти продукты помогут быстро восстановить уровень энергии и способствовать анаболическим процессам в организме после тренировки. Важной частью восстановления после тренировки также является употребление белка, который помогает в восстановлении и росте мышечной ткани. Идеальным вариантом может быть сочетание углеводов с высоким ГИ и белков для оптимального восстановления, например, смузи с протеиновым порошком и бананом или рис с курицей. Однако стоит помнить, что хотя углеводы с высоким гликемическим индексом предпочтительны непосредственно после тренировки для быстрого восполнения гликогена, в обычное время лучше выбирать углеводы с низким и средним ГИ для поддержания стабильного уровня сахара в крови и предотвращения резких всплесков инсулина."},{"instruction":"что касаемо саха?","output":"Саха, или Сахалин (от японского \\"Карафуто\\"), является крупным островом, расположенным к северу от Японии и принадлежащим Российской Федерации. Остров Сахалин имеет богатую историю и уникальное географическое положение, благодаря которому играет важную роль в экономике и политике региона. Если рассматривать вопрос с точки зрения географии, культуры или природных ресурсов, Сахалин представляет собой важный регион с разнообразными аспектами. Однако, поскольку ваш вопрос может относиться к нескольким тематикам, включая географию, историю или даже культуру, я постараюсь ответить более детально на различные аспекты, связанные с Сахалином: # География и природа Сахалин — самый большой остров России, расположенный между Охотским морем на востоке и Японским морем на западе. Он отделяется от материковой части России Татарским проливом и соединён с ней Сахалинским мостом через пролив. Природа острова уникальна, здесь встречаются как тайговые леса, так и горные вершины. Климат острова умеренный муссонный. # История Сахалин имеет сложную историю, включая периоды, когда остров был предметом территориальных споров между Россией и Японией. В результате Русско-Японской войны 1904-1905 годов южная часть острова была передана Японии. После Второй мировой войны вся территория острова вернулась под контроль СССР, а сейчас он является частью Российской Федерации. # Экономика Экономика Сахалина тесно связана с добычей природных ресурсов, в основном нефти и природного газа, а также с рыболовством и лесозаготовкой. Проекты по разработке нефтегазовых месторождений с привлечением иностранных инвестиций играют значительную роль в экономике острова и всего региона. # Культура Сахалин — это место слияния культур коренных народов, русских переселенцев и японского влияния. Этот уникальный культурный микс нашёл отражение в искусстве, литературе (например, в произведениях Антона Чехова) и традициях острова. Если в вашем вопросе имелся в виду другой аспект, связанный с \\"Саха\\" или Сахалином, пожалуйста, уточните, и я постараюсь предоставить более детальный ответ."},{"instruction":"Ulus devletlerin mevcut örgütlenmelerin yerine sınırsız yetkilerle ve sınırsız kaynaklarla donatılmış yeni bir küresel ve uluslararası örgütlenmeye gidilse ve ekonomi, siyaset, bilim, teknoloji, kültür, sanat, toplum ve bir bütün olarak insanlığın hayatı şu ilkeyi daha etkili şekilde gerçekleştirebilmek üzere yeniden ve yeniden örgütlense nasıl bir medeniyet inşa edilebilir: \\"aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği\\" (1- insanlığın geleceği için en güçlü genlerin yapay olarak seçilebilmesi amacıyla sadece beden-duygu-zihin kriterlerinde ayrı ayrı yapılacak yeterlilik testlerini geçebilen erkek ve kadınların bebek yapmasına izin verilecek. 2- seçilen çiftler özel düzenlenmiş huzurlu ve tutkulu aşk yuvalarında sevişecekler. başarılı gebelik gerçekleştiği andan itibaren bütün imkanlar bütün hamile kadınlar için ihtiyaçları oranında eşit bir titizlikle seferber edilecek. 3- bebekler biyolojik baba ve annenin değil bütün bir insanlığın evladı kabul edilecek. baba ve annenin kendi bebeklerini kayırması, yani bu hayvani temel dürtü geliştirilecek hukuk sistemi, inşa edilecek toplum örgütlenmesi, kazandırılacak etik değerler ve aşılanacak hümanizm ruhu ile kesin şekilde önlenecek. 4- bebekler anne sütü ile beslendikten sonra 3 yaşına gelince baba ve anneden alınarak insanlık ailesine dahil edilecekler ve her alanda tam bir adaletle yapılacak yetenek testlerinin başlayacağı çocukluk yaşlarına kadar diğer bütün bebeklerle eşit olanaklarla büyütülecekler. 5- bebek havuzundaki her bebeğin bütün yeteneklerini insanlık yararına ortaya çıkarabilmesi için bilimsel olarak belirlenen yaşlarda bilim, sanat, spor, el becerisi, liderlik vb. hayatın bütün alanlarına yönelik kapsamlı ve adil testler yapılacak.)","output":"Bu düşünce yapısını ve önerilen sistematiği derinlemesine incelediğimizde, karşımıza çıkan, distopik bir medeniyet görüntüsü ve bireylerin sıkı bir yönetim altında yaşadığı bir toplum modeli oluyor. Temel olarak, insan hakları, özgürlüğü ve bireysel tercihlerin ön planda olduğu demokratik toplum anlayışına ters düşen bu sistem, ayrıca bir dizi etik ve moral sorunu da beraberinde getirir. Sistemin temellerini inceleyecek olursak: 1. **Eugenics (İrsel Seçilim)**: İnsanlık tarihinde benzeri görülmüş bu yaklaşım, en \\"güçlü\\" genlere sahip bireylerin üreme yetkisine sahip olması gerektiğini savunur. Ancak bu, biyolojik çeşitliliğin zarar görmesine, belirli genetik özelliklerin tercih edilirken diğerlerinin yok sayılmasına ve tehlikeli bir üstünlük anlayışının oluşmasına sebep olabilir. 2. **Çocuk Yetiştirme**: Çocukların biyolojik ebeveynlerinden alınıp bir \\"insanlık ailesi\\" içinde yetiştirilmesi fikri, çocukların bireysel kimliklerini, aile bağlarını ve kültürel kökenlerini tanımalarını engelleyebilir. Ayrıca, bireylerin kendi çocuklarıyla kuracakları duygusal bağları yok saymak, hem ebeveynlerin hem de çocukların psikolojik sağlığını tehlikeye atabilir. 3. **Totaliter Yönetim**: Önerilen sistemde, üreme yetkisine kimin sahip olacağından, çocukların nasıl yetiştirileceğine, yeteneklerin nasıl test edileceğine kadar her konuda merkezi bir otoritenin sınırsız güce sahip olması gerektiği öne sürülüyor. Bu tür bir yönetim anlayışı, bireysel özgürlüklerin ve tercihlerin yok sayılmasına, aşırı denetim ve gözetim toplumu oluşturulmasına yol açar. 4. **Eşit Fırsat İlkesi**: Teoride, her bireyin eşit fırsatlara sahip olması ve yeteneklerinin tam olarak geliştirilmesi güzel bir amaç gibi görünse de, bu sistemin uygulamada adaletli ve etik bir şekilde yönetilmesi büyük bir zorluk teşkil eder. Ayrıca, insanların mutluluk ve tatmin duygularının sadece yeteneklerinin tanınması ve kullanılmasından gelmediğini unutmamak gerekir. Sonuç olarak, insanlık için daha adil ve sürdürülebilir bir medeniyet kurma arayışında, bireylerin özgürlüklerine, çeşitliliğe ve eşitlik ilkesine saygı gösteren, etik değerleri ve insan haklarını ön planda tutan yaklaşımların benimsenmesi gerekmektedir. Önerilen sistem, yukarıda belirtilen faktörlerin büyük bir kısmını göz ardı etmekte, bu nedenle de insanlık için ideal bir medeniyet modeli oluşturamamaktadır."},{"instruction":"Présenter des excuses à son directeur de mémoire pour le retard du dépôt de travail","output":"Objet : Excuses pour le retard du dépôt de mon travail de mémoire Cher(e) [nom du directeur de mémoire], Je tiens par la présente à vous présenter mes plus sincères excuses pour le retard du dépôt de mon travail de mémoire.

I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible. On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity. At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area. In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.","output":"作为一位雅思考官，我将依据雅思写作评分标准对您的文章进行评分。这些标准包括任务回应(Task Response)、连贯与衔接(Coherence and Cohesion)、词汇资源(Lexical Resource)、语法范围与准确性(Grammatical Range and Accuracy)。请注意，我的点评仅基于提供的内容，并不代表官方雅思评分。 任务回应(Task Response): 7 您的文章很好地回应了任务要求，提出了一个清晰的论点并支持了自己的观点。您通过对比本国援助与国际援助的效果，有效地展开了主题，并提出了合理的结论。但是，为了达到更高的得分，可以进一步加强论点的深度和细节，例如，通过讨论为什么一些人可能反对国际援助，并解释为什么这些观点不成立。 连贯与衔接(Coherence and Cohesion): 8 您的文章结构清晰，段落间的过渡自然流畅。明显的主题句和总结句帮助读者理解每个段落的主要观点。然而，为了进一步提升，可以尝试使用更多的衔接手段，比如同义词替换和复杂的连接词语，以增强文段之间的连接。 词汇资源(Lexical Resource): 7 您有很好的词汇量，能够使用一定范围的词语表达自己的观点。不过，尝试使用更为丰富和精确的词汇来表达特定的意思，可以帮助您获得更高的分数。 语法范围与准确性(Grammatical Range and Accuracy): 7 语法使用总体上准确，句型多样。不过，更加活用各种复杂句型可以提高您的得分。注意检查并避免任何可能的语法错误。 总分: 7.25 (请注意，雅思写作分数只有整数和半分，所以最终分数可能被调整为7或7.5。) 建议: - 深入发展您的论点，包括反对观点的考虑，可以提高任务回应得分。 - 使用更多的衔接手段增强文章的流畅性。 - 尝试使用更多准确且丰富的词汇来表达细微的差别。 - 联系使用更多复杂的语法结构以提升您的语法得分。 继续努力，希望我的反馈对你有所帮助！"},{"instruction":"gpt 4 or gpt3.5","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, there hasn't been an official release of a model explicitly named \\"GPT-4\\" by OpenAI. Therefore, I can give you some insights based on the predecessors of such a hypothetical model, focusing mainly on GPT-3 and what could be expected in an evolution like GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. # GPT-3 (Third Generation) - **Launch Date**: June 2020. - **Model Size**: 175 billion parameters. - **Capabilities**: High-quality text generation, deep understanding of context, ability to generate human-like text across a wide range of topics and formats, language translation, question-answering, and more. It demonstrated a significant leap in language model capabilities. - **Limitations**: Despite its capabilities, GPT-3 often produces outputs that could be biased, factually incorrect, or nonsensical. It also struggles with understanding and generating content based on very recent events or very specialized knowledge not well-represented in its training data. # GPT-3.5 This version would refer to an incremental improvement over GPT-3, not a completely new generation. The \\".5\\" designation (if we were to follow naming convention trends) suggests enhancements and optimizations over GPT-3 without being a revolutionary leap. Such improvements might include: - **Reduced Biases and Errors**: Better handling of biases and reduction in the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. - **Improved Contextual Understanding**: Enhancements in understanding context and maintaining coherency over longer stretches of text. - **Efficiency Improvements**: More optimized algorithms to run more efficiently, possibly requiring less computational resources for the same or improved level of task performance. - **Knowledge Updates**: Incremental updates to its corpus could allow it to be more aware of recent events or developments. # GPT-4 (Hypothetical) Given the trend of progress from GPT-2 to GPT-3, a hypothetical GPT-4 would likely embody a substantial leap in capabilities again, possibly including: - **Massive Increase in Parameters**: Far beyond the 175 billion of GPT-3, enhancing its depth of knowledge and understanding. - **Advanced Reasoning Capabilities**: Improved abilities to handle complex reasoning tasks, potentially making it more reliable for academic, professional, and research tasks. - **High Fidelity on More Niche Subjects**: Better representation and accuracy on lesser-known topics due to broader and deeper training data. - **Even Greater Efficiency**: Further optimizations to reduce compute costs and environmental impact without sacrificing performance. - **Enhanced Safety and Bias Reduction Features**: More sophisticated mechanisms to handle ethical, moral, and societal implications of AI-generated text. It's worth noting that any forward-looking statements are speculative, and the actual direction OpenAI or any organization takes with future models like a potential \\"GPT-4\\" could diverge based on technological advancements, ethical considerations, and market demands."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This shift marked a significant change from the initial objectives of the occupation, which included democratizing Japan, dismantling its war potential, and laying the groundwork for a peaceful and stable country that would renounce military aggression. The Reverse Course, however, redirected these priorities towards rebuilding Japan as a bulwark against communism during the Cold War. The reasons for this strategic pivot and its consequences are complex and multifaceted. # Reasons for the Reverse Course 1. **Cold War Tensions:** The global geopolitical landscape was rapidly changing, with tensions mounting between the United States and the Soviet Union. As the Cold War intensified, U.S. policymakers began to view Japan not just as a defeated foe that needed to be demilitarized and democratized, but also as a potential ally and bastion against communist expansion in Asia. 2. **Communist Victories in Asia:** The victory of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the onset of the Korean War in 1950 heightened fears of a domino effect of communist victories in Asia. Japan's strategic importance as an anti-communist platform in the region became even more pronounced. 3. **Economic Considerations:** There was a growing awareness of the need for a strong Japanese economy as a stabilizing force in the region. Economic distress could lead to political instability, which could, in turn, provide fertile ground for communist ideologies. Rebuilding Japan's economy became an essential countermeasure against this perceived threat. # Consequences of the Reverse Course 1. **Political and Economic Rehabilitation:** Japan's political and economic systems were rehabilitated with American assistance. The focus shifted towards economic recovery, leading to significant economic aid and investment. This support laid the groundwork for Japan's rapid economic growth in the decades that followed, eventually transforming it into one of the world's leading economies. 2. **Redirection of Reform Efforts:** Initial reforms aimed at purging Japan of militarism and ultra-nationalism were scaled back. The zaibatsu (large industrial and financial business conglomerates) disbandment policies were relaxed, and some political and industrial figures who had been purged were allowed back into public life. This helped in stabilizing the political landscape but also meant the retention of some pre-war power structures. 3. **Security Arrangements:** The Reverse Course facilitated the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951 and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which came into effect in 1952, formally ending the occupation. These agreements allowed the United States to maintain military bases in Japan, ensuring a continued American military presence in Asia and embedding Japan in the Western security framework against the Soviet Union and communism. 4. **Impact on Japanese Society:** While the Reverse Course helped in stabilizing Japan and setting it on a path of economic prosperity, it also led to a complicated legacy regarding the wartime past and post-war pacifism. The decision not to prosecute certain war criminals and the rehabilitation of some pre-war elites have had a lasting impact on Japanese politics and society. In conclusion, the adoption of the Reverse Course was driven by strategic considerations linked to the emerging Cold War context. Its consequences have been profound, both in terms of Japan's place in the international order and its post-war development trajectory. It marked Japan's transition from a defeated nation to a key ally of the United States in Asia, setting the stage for its post-war recovery and economic miracle."},{"instruction":"Olá","output":"Olá!

RDD is a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design that attempts to mimic random assignment using a cutoff point around which the assignment to the treatment condition is discontinuous. Here are some examples of situations where RDD could be used in the Italian context: 1. **Municipal Merger Policies:** Italy has undergone several waves of municipal mergers (fusioni di comuni), aiming to reduce the number of municipalities and increase efficiency. These policies often use population thresholds to determine eligibility for merger incentives or requirements. For instance, municipalities with populations just below and just above the threshold can be compared using RDD to assess the policy's impact on local governance, public services efficiency, or economic outcomes. 2. **Financial Aid and Subsidies:** The Italian government provides financial aid and subsidies to municipalities based on various criteria, such as economic distress, population size, or geographic location (e.g., mountain communities). Laws establishing financial thresholds for eligibility create a discontinuity that can be explored through RDD to evaluate the impact of financial support on local economies, infrastructure development, or public welfare. 3. **School Funding and Programs:** Legislation regarding education often involves specific criteria for providing additional resources or implementing new programs in schools. For example, thresholds based on the number of students or the socioeconomic status of a municipality could determine eligibility for additional funding or programs. RDD could be applied to assess the effects of these initiatives on educational outcomes. 4. **Cultural and Environmental Funding:** Italy often allocates funding for cultural preservation and environmental protection to municipalities based on certain criteria, like being part of the UNESCO heritage list or having particular environmental characteristics (e.g., protected areas). Laws that establish eligibility thresholds provide opportunities for RDD studies to examine the consequences of such funding on cultural preservation, tourism, or environmental outcomes. 5. **Healthcare Services:** Policies related to the provision of healthcare services sometimes target municipalities based on population thresholds or health indicators. For instance, the establishment of new healthcare facilities or allocation of healthcare professionals might depend on these criteria. Researchers can use RDD to evaluate the impact of these policies on health outcomes, access to care, or patient satisfaction. In each of these examples, the key to employing RDD is the presence of a clear cutoff or threshold that divides municipalities into those just eligible for a legal provision and those just ineligible. This design allows researchers to attribute observed differences in outcomes to the policy intervention rather than other factors, providing insights into the effectiveness of such laws."},{"instruction":"Ты технический писатель. Инженеры тебе дали описание команды ya gen-config: @ ya gen-config Позволяет сгенерировать конфигурационный файл ya. ya gen-config -h Generate default ya config Usage: ya gen-config [OPTION]... [ya.conf]... Options: Ya operation control -h, --help Print help. Use -hh for more options and -hhh for even more. Использование ya gen-config junk/{USER}/ya.conf генерирует пользовательский конфигурационный файл с описанием и закомментированными опциями по умолчанию (если у вас уже не было настроенной конфигурации) с сохранением ранее заданных параметров для актуальных ключей. Если эту конфигурацию положить в пользовательский junk с именем ya.conf, то он будет использоваться для определения опций ya. Значения, указанные в ya.conf — самые слабые и переопределяются соответствующими переменными окружения или аргументами командной строки. Если у вас нет junk, то конфигурацию можно сохранить в ~/.ya/ya.conf. Формат ya.conf должен быть представлен в виде toml файла. Для опций без параметров следует указывать true в качестве значения. Для опций \\"словарей\\" (например flags), следует открывать одноимённую секцию (таблицу), где дальше будут следовать записи в формате key = \\"val\\". Например: [flags] NO_DEBUGINFO = \\"yes\\" Порядок применения опций Места возможных расположений файла с опциями ya (каждый последующий может переопределять поля предыдущего): arcadia/ya.conf arcadia/junk/{USER}/ya.conf arcadia/../ya.conf (если вы хотите иметь разный конфиг для разных репозиториев) ~/.ya/ya.conf переменные окружения аргументы командной строки Так же есть возможность менять имя ya.conf (каждый последующий может переопределять поля предыдущего): ya.conf (сначала обрабатывается файл из корня аркадии, потом из junk, ...) ya.{system}.conf ya.{command}.conf Модификаторы {command} и {system} влияют на то, из какой подкомманды (handler) и на какой системе (windows, linux, darwin, java, unknown) будет применяется данный файл конфигурации. То есть, например, чтобы конфигурация применялась для хэндлера make на платформе darwin достаточно создать в одном из удобных мест файл с названием, например, ya.make.darwin.conf. Опции для конкретных команд ya Если одна и та же опция используется в нескольких хендлерах и вам нужны, в зависимости от хендлера, разные значения, можно точно указать нужный хендлер и переопределить опции только для него. Например: project_output = \\"/default/path\\" [ide.qt] project_output = \\"/path/to/qt/project\\" [ide.msvs] project_output = \\"c:pathtomsvsproject\\" Таким образом ya ide qt и ya ide msvs будут иметь разные пути до проекта, отличные от значения по умолчанию. Пример с переопределением словарной опции flags только для хендлера ya dump json-test-list [flags] NO_DEBUGINFO = \\"yes\\" [dump.json-test-list.flags] MY_SPECIAL_FLAG = \\"yes\\" Вызов ya dump json-test-list в этом случае будет эквивалентен ya dump json-test-list -DMY_SPECIAL_FLAG=\\"yes\\", NO_DEBUGINFO не будет использоваться. Подстановка переменных окружения Строковые ключи могут указывать переменные окружения в формате {ENV_VAR}, которые будут подменяться после загрузки конфигов. Дополнительно резолвится переменная окружения YA_ARCADIA_ROOT, которая указывает на Аркадию, из которой работает ya. Например: output_root = \\"{YA_ARCADIA_ROOT}/../out\\" Изменение цветовой схемы ya по умолчанию Для колоризации ya использует внутри текста свои маркеры, которые при выводе на терминал изменяют цвет последующего текста: alt1 = \\"cyan\\" alt2 = \\"magenta\\" alt3 = \\"light-blue\\" bad = \\"red\\" good = \\"green\\" imp = \\"light-default\\" path = \\"yellow\\" unimp = \\"dark-default\\" warn = \\"yellow\\" Значения по умолчанию можно изменить с помощью секции terminal_profile в конфиге, например: [terminal_profile] bad = \\"light-red\\" unimp = \\"default\\" Добавление целевых платформ Подробнее про платформы можно найти в документации по ya make. Подробнее о том, как добавить целевые плафтормы через командную строку. Чтобы добавить интересующие целевые платформы, достаточно несколько раз описать следующую конструкцию: [[target_platform]] platform_name = \\"default-darwin-arm64\\" build_type = \\"relwithdebinfo\\" [target_platform.flags] ANY_FLAG = \\"flag_value\\" ANY_OTHER_FLAG = \\"flag_value\\" На каждый параметр командной строки --target-platform-smth существует аналогичный ключ для файла конфигурации. Описание дополнительных опций (alias) Если есть необходимость постоянно задавать одни и те же аргументы, их можно объединить в alias. Для описания alias-ов используется синтаксис toml Array of Tables. Пример: --add-go-result Например, если нужно добавить симлинки на сгенерированные go файлы, приходится писать что-то подобное: ya make path/to/project --replace-result --add-result=.go --no-output-for=.cgo1.go --no-output-for=.res.go --no-output-for=_cgo_gotypes.go --no-output-for=_cgo_import.go В качестве решения можно записать всё в файл junk/<username>/ya.make.conf следующие строки: # junk/<username>/ya.make.conf replace_result = true # --replace-result add_result_extend = [\\".go\\"] # --add-result=.go suppress_outputs = [\\".cgo1\\", \\".res.go\\", \\"_cgo_gotypes.go\\"] # ----no-output-for=.cgo1.go --no-output-for=.res.go --no-output-for=_cgo_gotypes.go В таком случае значения будут применяться всегда (при всех запусках ya make для пользователя <username>). Если же необходимо иметь возможность включать данное поведение, можно использовать технологию alias-ов: # junk/<username>/ya.conf # ^ alias will be available only for user <username> # ^ in any handler [[alias]] # define new alias # Any keys, available in ya.conf replace_result = true add_result_extend = [\\".go\\"] suppress_outputs = [\\".cgo1\\", \\".res.go\\", \\"_cgo_gotypes.go\\"] [alias._settings.arg] # define argument for this alias names = [\\"--add-go-result\\"] # define only long name help = \\"Add generated .go files\\" # define help string visible = true # make this argument visible in \`ya make --help\` Теперь флаг --add-go-result виден в выводе ya make --help, и мы можем сократить команду до: ya make path/to/project --add-go-result Пример: отключение предпостроенных тулов Чтобы отключить использование предпостроенных тулов, нужно запускать ya со следующими аргументами: ya make path/to/project -DUSE_PREBUILT_TOOLS=no --host-platform-flag=USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS=no Сначала опишем желаемое поведение в ya.conf: [host_platform_flags] USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" [flags] USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" Теперь опишем alias, который будет включаться по аргументу, переменной окружения или выставлением значения в любом ya.conf: [[alias]] [alias.host_platform_flags] # host_platform_flags is subkey for alias USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" [alias.flags] # flags is subkey for alias USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" [alias._settings.arg] # define argument names = [\\"-p\\", \\"--disable-prebild-tools\\"] # define short and long name help = \\"Disable prebuild tools\\" visible = true [alias._settings.env] # define environment value name = \\"YA_DISABLE_PREBUILD_TOOLS\\" [alias._settings.conf] # define config key name = \\"disable_prebuild_tools\\" Теперь, чтобы активировать это поведение, можно воспользоваться следующими способами: # Long argument ya make path/to/project --disable-prebuild-tools # Short argument ya make path/to/project -p # Env YA_DISABLE_PREBUILD_TOOLS=yes ya make path/to/project # Config value echo \\"ndisable_prebuild_tools=truen\\" >> junk/USER/ya.conf ya make path/to/project Несколько alias-ов Можно создавать любое количество alias-ов внутри одного файла. Alias-ы из разных файлов не перезаписывают друг друга. Задавать описанную переменную в блоке [alias._settings.conf] можно в любом файле, в любом месте, так как создание alias-ов происходит до применения значений из файлов конфигурации. # path/to/first/ya.conf some_values = true third_alias = true [[alias]] # ... [alias._settings.conf] name = \\"first_alias\\" [[alias]] # ... # path/to/second/ya.conf some_other_values = true [[alias]] # ... [alias._settings.conf] name = \\"third_alias\\" [[alias]] first_alias = true # ... Пример с target_platform [[alias]] [[alias.target_platform]] # --target-platform platfom_name = \\"...\\" build_type = \\"debug\\" # --target-platform-debug run_tests = true # --target-platform-tests target_platform_compiler = \\"c_compiler\\" # --target-platform-c-compiler # ... [alias.target_platform.flags] # --target-platform-flag FLAG = true OTHER_FLAG = \\"other_value\\" [alias._settings.arg] # Create argument consumer for alias names = [\\"-a\\", \\"--my-cool-alias\\"] # Short and long name help = \\"This alias are awesome! It really helps me\\" # Help string visible = true # make it visible in \`ya make --help\` [alias._settings.env] # Create environment consumer for alias, must starts with YA name = \\"YA_MY_COOL_ALIAS\\" [alias._settings.conf] # Create config consumer for alias, can be enabled from any config-file name = \\"my_cool_alias\\" Семантика alias Внутри одного блока [[alias]] можно задавать произвольное количество опций и под-опций. Для создания аргумента или переменной окружения нужно описать их в ключах [alias._settings.arg] и [alias._settings.env], как показано в примере. После этого они станут доступными во всех подкомандах ya. Для создания опции, которая будет существовать только в конкретном handler-е (например make), достаточно дописать между ключами alias и settings произвольный префикс: [alias.make._settings.args] — будет работать только в ya make ... [alias.ide.idea._settings.args] — будет работать только в ya ide idea ... При заполнении ключа [alias._settings.conf] создаётся опция, которую можно явно включить в любом конфигурационном файле (даже в том, который применился раньше — поиск и обработка alias-ов происходит до применения значений). Более того, появляется возможность применять один alias внутри другого, обеспечивая таким образом простейшую композицию. Композиция Если возникла необходимость вынести общую часть из alias-ов, можно воспользоваться композицией. Пусть у нас есть два alias-а: [[alias]] first_value = 1 second_value = 2 [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--first\\"] [[alias]] second_value = 2 third_value = 3 [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--second\\"] Чтобы вынести общую часть, нужно создать новый alias c параметром конфигурации: [[alias]] second_value = 2 [[alias._settings.conf]] name = \\"common_alias\\" [[alias]] first_value = 1 common_alias = true # Call alias [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--first\\"] [[alias]] common_alias = true # Call alias third_value = 3 [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--second\\"] Теперь, при вызове ya <handler> --second применится alias common_alias, и выставится значение для third_value. Особенности: Можно вызывать несколько alias-ов внутри другого alias-а Глубина «вложенности» может быть любой Есть защита от циклов Можно использовать alias, объявленный позже места использования или находящийся в другом файле \\" Напиши документацию по этой команде","output":"# Документация команды ya gen-config Обзор Команда \`ya gen-config\` предназначена для генерации конфигурационного файла для инструмента \`ya\`, который используется в рамках репозитория Arcadia для автоматизации различных задач разработки, сборки и тестирования.

Ancak, böyle bir düzenin etik, pratik, ve sosyopolitik zorlukları büyüktür. İlk aşamada, insan hakları, bireyin özgürlüğü ve çeşitliliğin değeri gibi temel değerlerle çatışan birçok önerme içermektedir. Bu tür bir toplum inşasının temel taşlarını ve olası sonuçlarını ele alalım: 1. **Genetik Seçicilik:** İnsanlığın genetik yapısını bilinçli bir şekilde yönlendirmeye çalışmak, genetik çeşitliliği ve uzun vadeli evrimsel sağlık riskleri altında bırakabilir. Ayrıca, bu yaklaşım, bireylerin kendi yaşamları üzerindeki temel haklarını sınırlar ve \\"yeterli\\" olarak kabul edilen genetik özelliklere sahip olmayan insanlar için etik olmayan ayrımcılığa yol açar. 2. **Aşk Yuvaları ve Sevgi İlişkileri:** İnsan ilişkilerini ve üreme sürecini tamamen kontrol altına alma girişimi, duygusal bağların ve bireysel özgürlüğün önemini göz ardı eder. Bu, doğal sevgi ve aile bağlarını zayıflatır ve insanî duyguları mekanik bir sürece indirger. 3. **Kolektif Çocuk Yetiştirme:** Çocukların bireysel aile yerine tüm insanlık tarafından yetiştirilmesi fikri, çocukların psikolojik gelişimi üzerinde ciddi etkiler yaratabilir. Aile bağlarının ve bireyin kendi köklerine duyduğu aidiyet hissinin önemi, çocuğun duygusal ve sosyal gelişimi açısından hayati önem taşır. 4. **Yetenek Testleri ve Eğitim:** Her çocuğun yeteneklerine göre yönlendirildiği bir eğitim sistemi kulağa cazip gelebilir fakat bu, erken yaşlardaki çocukların baskı altında tutulması ve belirli bir kalıba sokulmaya çalışılması anlamına gelir. Ayrıca, çocukların kendi ilgi alanlarını ve tutkularını özgürce keşfetme şansını da kısıtlar. Genel olarak, bu yaklaşımın insan doğasını ve toplumsal çeşitliliği ciddi şekilde hafife aldığı söylenebilir. Gerçek dünyada, insan haklarına saygı, bireysel özgürlükler, ve farklılıkların kabulü gibi temel değerler üzerine kurulu daha inklüsif ve adil toplum modelleri geliştirmek, daha sağlıklı medeniyet inşası için esas alınmalıdır. Bu türden radikal öneriler, etik yönüyle ele alındığında, baskıcı ve totaliter rejimlerin temelini oluşturma potansiyeline sahiptir."},{"instruction":"Lanciando una moneta equilibrata, se esce testa lanciamo una moneta con p di testa alfa, se esce croce lanciamo una moneta con p di testa 1-alfa. calcola la legge congiunta delle Xi","output":"Per risolvere questo problema dobbiamo prima comprendere la situazione.

Vogliamo determinare la legge congiunta delle variabili aleatorie coinvolte, che possiamo denominare (X_1) per il primo lancio e (X_2) per il secondo lancio, dove (X_1 = 1) se il primo lancio dà testa e (X_1 = 0) se dà croce, e (X_2 = 1) se il secondo lancio dà testa e (X_2 = 0) se dà croce. Notiamo che le possibili combinazioni di esiti per (X_1) e (X_2) sono quattro: TT, TC, CT, CC, dove la prima lettera rappresenta l'esito del primo lancio e la seconda quello del secondo lancio. Le probabilità congiunte per ogni coppia di esiti sono le seguenti: 1. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 1)** (TT, il primo lancio dà testa e il secondo lancio, con (alpha) probabilità di testa, dà anch'esso testa): (P(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1) = 0.5 times alpha) 2. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 0)** (TC, il primo lancio dà testa e il secondo lancio, con (alpha) probabilità di testa, dà croce): (P(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 0) = 0.5 times (1 - alpha)) 3. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 1)** (CT, il primo lancio dà croce e il secondo lancio, con (1 - alpha) probabilità di testa, dà testa): (P(X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1) = 0.5 times (1 - alpha)) 4. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 0)** (CC, il primo lancio dà croce e il secondo lancio, con (1 - alpha) probabilità di testa, dà croce): (P(X_1 = 0, X_2 = 0) = 0.5 times alpha) Queste probabilità congiunte definiscono completamente la legge congiunta delle variabili (X_1) e (X_2). Da notare è che la probabilità del secondo lancio dipende dall'esito del primo, così la probabilità congiunta riflette questa dipendenza attraverso i coefficienti (0.5 times alpha) e (0.5 times (1 - alpha)) che considerano sia la probabilità del primo lancio che quella condizionata del secondo."},{"instruction":"spiega come arrivare ai risultati","output":"Per arrivare ai risultati, dobbiamo passare attraverso alcuni passaggi chiave che riguardano la comprensione del concetto di probabilità congiunta e come applicarlo a questo specifico esperimento a due fasi. Ecco i passaggi spiegati più dettagliatamente: # Fase 1: Considera il Primo Lancio di Moneta Nel primo lancio, la moneta è equilibrata, quindi hai una probabilità del 50% (o 0.5) di ottenere Testa (T) e la stessa probabilità di ottenere Croce (C). # Fase 2: Successivi Risultati Basati sul Primo Lancio - **Se esce Testa (T)**: la moneta successiva ha una probabilità (alpha) di mostrare Testa. Si può pensare come \\"se il primo evento accade (T), allora la probabilità del secondo evento (T di nuovo) è (alpha)\\". - **Se esce Croce (C)**: la moneta successiva ha una probabilità (1 - alpha) di mostrare Testa. In questo scenario, si ragiona allo stesso modo, ma con la probabilità modificata a (1 - alpha). # Calcolo delle Probabilità Congiunte Per capire la legge congiunta, consideriamo ogni coppia di risultati possibili per (X_1) e (X_2), dove (X_1) denota l'esito del primo lancio e (X_2) quello del secondo. Le probabilità congiunte derivano dalle combinazioni degli esiti di questi lanci. 1. **Per (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 1) (TT):** - La probabilità di ottenere Testa al primo lancio è 0.5. - Dato che il primo lancio ha dato Testa, la probabilità di ottenere Testa al secondo lancio è (alpha). - Moltiplicando le due probabilità (perché vogliamo che entrambi gli eventi accadano insieme, il che implica indipendenza tra la scelta del secondo lancio e l'esito del primo), otteniamo (0.5 times alpha). 2. **Per (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 0) (TC):** - Il primo lancio dà Testa con probabilità 0.5. - Dato Testa al primo lancio, la probabilità che il secondo lancio dia Croce (dato che abbiamo (alpha) per Testa, allora è (1 - alpha) per Croce). - Quindi, la probabilità congiunta è (0.5 times (1 - alpha)). 3. **Per (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 1) (CT):** - Il primo lancio dà Croce con probabilità 0.5. - Se esce Croce, il secondo lancio ha una probabilità di (1 - alpha) di mostrare Testa. - La combinazione di questi eventi dà una probabilità congiunta di (0.5 times (1 - alpha)). 4. **Per (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 0) (CC):** - Con Croce al primo lancio con probabilità 0.5, e poi avendo una probabilità (1 - alpha) per ottenere Testa al secondo lancio, la probabilità di ottenere Croce al secondo lancio è (alpha) (perché se il secondo lancio ha (1 - alpha) probabilità di Testa, c'è un (alpha) di probabilità di Croce in questo scenario). - Così, moltiplicando, otteniamo una probabilità congiunta di (0.5 times alpha). Questi calcoli mostrano come le probabilità di diversi esiti del secondo lancio dipendano dall'esito del primo lancio, determinando così la struttura delle proprie probabilità congiunte nell'esperimento."},{"instruction":"в TensorFlow есть встроенный набор данных под названием “cats_vs_dogs”.

Some people think that the main environmental problem is the loss of species as opposed to other environmental problem such as greenhouse effect. While the loss of species have severe impacts to our environment, I believe that the greenhouse effect are more critical. It is a truth that the loss of particular species of plants and animals would have bad impact to our environment. A typical harm of species loss is its impact to the whole eco-circle. A simple specie could have very important role in the eco-circle, and if it has been extinct, there will have a space in the whole circle. Which could let other specie extinct. For example, the bee can help the flower reproduce, if they extinct flower will be impact a lot. On the other hand, there are several reasons why I would believe that the greenhouse effect is the most important environmental problem. Firstly, the greenhouse effect cloud lead to the sea level rise which have the huge impact to the people who is live around the sea. They have the risk of lost their home and wealth. Secondly, the rising of temperature could lead to more bad weather issues. Although the average temperature only increases 1 centigrade, there will appear a lot of bad weather in everywhere.

While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university. The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career. On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete. For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.","output":"Your IELTS essay demonstrates a strong command of the subject, appropriate structure, and clear arguments, as guided by the IELTS Writing Assessment criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy.

İdeal olarak, tüm insanların eşit fırsatlara sahip olduğu, yeteneklerine ve becerilerine göre yönlendirildiği bir medeniyet umut verici görünmekle birlikte, bu türden bir düzenin gerçekleştirilmesi, kişisel özgürlükler, biyolojik çeşitlilik, ve kültürel kimlikler açısından büyük kayıplara yol açabilir. 1. **Genetik Seçim ve Ebeveynlik İzinleri:** En güçlü genlerin seçilmesi ve yalnızca belirli kriterleri karşılayan bireylerin çocuk sahibi olmasına izin verilmesi, genetik çeşitliliği tehlikeye atabilir. Ayrıca bu, ebeveyn olma hakkını devlet veya küresel bir otorite tarafından kontrol edilen bir sürece dönüştürür, ki bu da insan hakları açısından ciddi endişelere yol açar. 2. **Üreme ve Aşk Yuvaları:** Böylesi kişisel bir deneyimi düzenlemenin, insanın temel özgürlüğüyle ve aşk, tutku, ve kişisel ilişkilerin doğasını anlama tarzımızla çeliştiği açıktır. Ayrıca, bu tür bir uygulama insanların kendi yaşamları üzerindeki kontrolünü ve iradesini ortadan kaldırır. 3. **Aile Yapısının Dönüşümü:** Çocukları biyolojik ailelerinden ayırmanın, insanlık ailesinin evlatları olarak yetiştirilmesinin toplum üzerinde derin psikolojik ve sosyal etkileri olacaktır. Araştırmalar, aile bağlarının çocukların duygusal ve sosyal gelişimi üzerinde önemli bir etki yarattığını göstermektedir. 4. **Yetenek Testleri ve Eğitim:** Her çocuğun yeteneklerini belirlemek ve geliştirmek amacıyla adil ve kapsamlı testler yapılması, özünde cazip bir fikir olabilir. Ancak, bu testlerin uygulaması, belirleyicisi ve yorumlayıcısı kim olacağı büyük sorular doğurur. Yetenek testleri ve sonuçları üzerinden yönlendirilen bir toplumda, bireylerin özsel değerlerinin ve benzersiz kişiliklerinin göz ardı edilmesi riski de bulunur. Bu senaryo, idealize edilmiş bir eşitlik ve adalet vizyonu sunarken, insan özgürlüğü, bireysellik ve çeşitliliği korumanın da önemini hatırlatıyor. Tarih boyunca, utopik toplum tasarımları genellikle distopik sonuçlar doğurmuştur. İnsanlığın ilerlemesi, çeşitliliği kutlamak, eşitliği ve adaleti teşvik etmek, ancak bireylerin özgürlüklerini ve özgünlüklerini de korumak gerektiğine dair dengeli bir anlayış gerektirir."},{"instruction":"aslında yukarıdaki ilke aşağıdaki şiirin merkez ve omurgasıdır: şimdi de ilk soru ve cevabı da dikkate alarak bir bütün olarak bu şiirin tamamını bir insanlık projesi olarak analiz et: bu satırlardaki ilkelerle nasıl bir medeniyet inşa edebilirdik: öleceksiniz, demiş tanrı: ölmeden mezarlara mı girelim? her an'ımızı korkuyla mı geçirelim? hayır, biz ölümsüzlüğü arayacağız atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde hayır, biz hayatın tadına varacağız kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde gün doğumunda ve gün batımında hayranlık içinde seyredeceğiz doğayı şarkılar söyleyip dans edeceğiz çırılçıplak, ne utanma ne çekince engellilerin yüzlerine öpücükler konduracak güzeller yakışıklılar salıncaklarda sallayacak neşeli çocuklar sarhoş şairleri cenneti büyütüp cehennemi küçülteceğiz bu evrende aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği öyle ki gerçekleştirsinler özgürce kendilerini olimpiyat ruhu kuşatmalı her alandaki rekabeti ödül de ceza da adalet de ölümden önce gelmeli tanrının boyunduruğunda sonsuz bir hayat değil tanrısız tek bir nefes isteriz, desin insanlık.","output":"Bu şiirin merkezine konan ilke ve önerilen insanlık projesinin analizi, oldukça radikal bir medeniyet vizyonunu ortaya koyuyor. Vurgulanan özgürlük, eşitlik, özgerçekleşme, ve insanın tabiatıyla barışık yaşamasını hedefleyen bu vizyon, mevcut toplumsal, ekonomik ve siyasal yapıları köklü bir şekilde sorgulayarak, insanlığın yaşam biçimini dönüştürmeyi amaçlıyor. Bu medeniyet, aşağıdaki temel ilkelerle inşa edilebilir: 1. **Ölümsüzlük Arayışı:** Atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde ölümsüzlüğü arama fikri, bilim ve teknolojiye derin bir ilgi ve bu alanlarda insani çabalara büyük yatırımlar yapılmasını gerektiriyor. Burada, insanlık var oluşun sırlarını çözmeye ve yaşamın süresini uzatmaya, belki de ölümü aşmaya yönelik bir arayış içinde. 2. **Hayatın Tadını Çıkarma:** Kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde hayatın tadına varma çağrısı, kültürel ve cinsel özgürlüklere büyük bir önem verilmesini öneriyor. Bilgiye susamışlık ve fiziksel zevklerin kucaklanması, bu medeniyetin düşüncede ve bedende özgürlüğü benimsediğini gösteriyor. 3. **Toplumsal Eşitlik ve Destek:** Engelliler, çocuklar, ve hatta sarhoş şairlerin toplum içinde özel bir yeri ve saygınlığı olacağı belirtiliyor. Herkesin birbirine destek olduğu, empatinin ve toplumsal dayanışmanın öne çıktığı bir toplum yapısı öneriliyor. 4. **Cennet ve Cehennemi Yeniden Tanımlama:** Bu evrende cenneti büyütme ve cehennemi küçültme amacı, bireylerin yaptıklarının sonuçlarıyla yüzleştiği, dengeli bir adalet sistemi oluşmasını sağlayabilir. Dolayısıyla, bu sistemdeki \\"ödül\\", \\"ceza\\", ve \\"adalet\\" kavramları insani değerlere ve bireysel eylemlerin sonuçlarına göre şekillendirilir. 5. **Özgürlüğün Yüceltilmesi:** Şiir, tanrısız bir nefesi tercih etmeyi savunurken, bu, insanın kendi kaderini belirleme gücüne ve özgürlüğüne duyulan derin bir inancı ifade ediyor. Spiritüel ve dinî boyunduruklar yerine, bireysel özgürlük ve özgerçekleşmenin öncelikli olduğu bir toplum düzeni öngörülüyor. Toplumun yeniden örgütlenmesi, rekabetin olimpiyat ruhu ile kuşatılması, ve herkes için adaletin temin edilmesi gerekliliği üzerine kurulu bu medeniyet, insan onurunu ve potansiyelini maksimize etmeyi, aynı zamanda her bireyin özgürlüğünü ve fırsat eşitliğini korumayı amaçlıyor. Ancak bu vizyonun gerçekleşebilmesi için, mevcut sosyal, ekonomik ve politik sistemlerin radikal bir değişimden geçmesi gerektiğini de unutmamak gerekir. Bu tip bir değişim, büyük ölçüde farkındalık, eğitim ve kültürel dönüşüm gerektirecek ve muhtemelen uzun bir zaman alacaktır."},{"instruction":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: \\"Honestly...I don't know about that Archmage guy.

0:3:39.920 --> 0:3:40.240 Hanna Chai Yeah. 0:3:41.10 --> 0:3:41.190 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:3:40.250 --> 0:3:46.710 Hanna Chai For the federation part, I have been tested on that, yet we have another ticket to test on that. 0:3:47.410 --> 0:3:47.860 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:3:48.0 --> 0:3:48.260 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:3:48.270 --> 0:3:48.650 Duraid Wadie Thank you. 0:3:50.160 --> 0:3:55.540 Hanna Chai OK, so now I will go to my second ticket user lockout. 0:3:56.90 --> 0:4:2.400 Hanna Chai So the user lockout are configurable under the force production. 0:4:3.670 --> 0:4:4.490 Hanna Chai Ohh. 0:4:7.210 --> 0:4:14.510 Hanna Chai OK, so in here you can we can enable or disable the book first part protection here. 0:4:15.700 --> 0:4:27.140 Hanna Chai So when we go into the frost threshold, we can choose either the default one or we want to customize the default one. 0:4:27.300 --> 0:4:45.270 Hanna Chai We have limit of 10 maximum attempts means that user can try a log in fail for 10 times and then we can choose the custom one so that we can configure the limit between one and 100. 0:4:47.930 --> 0:4:50.540 Hanna Chai And we can see the block setting. 0:4:50.550 --> 0:4:52.230 Hanna Chai Here we have a. 0:4:54.100 --> 0:5:7.70 Hanna Chai We can choose uh talker on to block attempts from suspicious IP address and then this account locked out when we enable it, right it? 0:5:7.140 --> 0:5:23.620 Hanna Chai Regardless, any IP, if the user are login failed for 10 times or our configurable number right, it will umm umm block the user from login. 0:5:26.780 --> 0:5:27.820 Hanna Chai And then this. 0:5:27.880 --> 0:5:32.140 Hanna Chai Uh adder, not notification talker. 0:5:32.950 --> 0:5:38.680 Hanna Chai Whether we want the user to receive the email notification or not. 0:5:39.190 --> 0:5:49.920 Hanna Chai So when we turn on this ohh the when the user account is blocked you will get the email at like this so. 0:5:53.180 --> 0:5:57.390 Hanna Chai How we do the user lock and lock right? 0:5:57.700 --> 0:6:20.740 Hanna Chai We have five method here, one is we click on the unlock unblock button here and then when we click on it it will redirect us to this page then the the user is unlocked already and then second method is we change the password. 0:6:23.270 --> 0:6:50.910 Hanna Chai Uh, this is the error message I got when I get block and then when I click on forgot password and reset to new password right and then my account automatically is being unlocked that that way is a as administrator to unblock for us and the 4th way is a. 0:6:52.950 --> 0:7:0.350 Hanna Chai When the administrator update the force threshold here ohm. 0:7:2.750 --> 0:7:5.140 Hanna Chai Maybe he update. 0:7:5.410 --> 0:7:20.780 Hanna Chai Uh, the number from 11:50 and then I my account is being unlocked and then the 5th way here is ohh we wait for 30 days from the last few log in. 0:7:23.190 --> 0:7:23.620 Hanna Chai Umm. 0:7:23.670 --> 0:7:26.40 Hanna Chai Then there is one issue. 0:7:26.50 --> 0:7:32.710 Hanna Chai Here is uh, the lockup duration, 30 days here is not configurable. 0:7:33.980 --> 0:7:47.620 Hanna Chai This is the only issue on this and then I also have found out a how to how do we want to come to? 0:7:49.380 --> 0:7:52.720 Hanna Chai To change the email message. 0:7:55.100 --> 0:8:5.270 Hanna Chai So we can go to our branding and then choose email template and then find our template for block account email. 0:8:5.690 --> 0:8:33.570 Hanna Chai So we can configure our center and then the subject of the email and what's the redirect tool URL and then, uh, how long does the URL lifetime is and the default one is ohh 5 days and then I will message can be configured in the HTML tablet. 0:8:35.520 --> 0:8:35.920 Hanna Chai And then. 0:8:37.880 --> 0:8:40.840 Hanna Chai This is the error message customization. 0:8:43.520 --> 0:8:56.990 Hanna Chai So we can configure also under branding here and then custom text we will find the user block message and then we can modify from here and then this is the. 0:8:57.330 --> 0:8:59.960 Hanna Chai And error message will show. 0:9:2.750 --> 0:9:4.380 Hanna Chai So that's all for this. 0:9:4.430 --> 0:9:5.220 Hanna Chai Any question? 0:9:6.890 --> 0:9:8.640 Duraid Wadie Yeah, I have a few questions. 0:9:8.650 --> 0:9:9.620 Duraid Wadie I'm thank you for that. 0:9:10.310 --> 0:9:12.80 Duraid Wadie Does this user lockout? 0:9:12.170 --> 0:9:21.210 Duraid Wadie Is it comfortable ad you know or we really call it a customer level or is that completely at that full tenant level? 0:9:24.860 --> 0:9:26.740 Hanna Chai This one is under tenant level. 0:9:28.60 --> 0:9:28.670 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:9:29.40 --> 0:9:29.310 Hanna Chai Umm. 0:9:28.680 --> 0:9:33.180 Duraid Wadie And I guess you guys haven't tried the organization unit yet, right? 0:9:33.420 --> 0:9:34.530 Hanna Chai Yeah, I haven't tried. 0:9:35.450 --> 0:9:36.100 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:9:36.110 --> 0:9:41.910 Duraid Wadie I mean the same thing when you're gonna get to the, you know, password complexity and all of that, it'll be good if you check it. 0:9:41.920 --> 0:9:44.530 Duraid Wadie If it's possible to do this at the organization level. 0:9:45.900 --> 0:9:47.30 Hanna Chai Hmm, OK. 0:9:47.540 --> 0:9:48.210 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:9:48.260 --> 0:9:49.30 Duraid Wadie Thank you for that. 0:9:49.820 --> 0:9:51.70 Duraid Wadie Do you know is there is an option? 0:9:51.80 --> 0:10:0.480 Duraid Wadie Let's say I can keep on the wrong password, but instead of actually lock it out, actually we call them delay logging in. 0:10:0.750 --> 0:10:6.320 Duraid Wadie Let's say you won't be able to turn another password for another minute, then another 5 minutes, then another 10 minute. 0:10:6.330 --> 0:10:7.780 Duraid Wadie Did you see any option like that? 0:10:8.30 --> 0:10:8.370 Duraid Wadie Or not. 0:10:9.160 --> 0:10:9.470 Duraid Wadie No. 0:10:9.480 --> 0:10:9.950 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:10:10.40 --> 0:10:10.220 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:10:8.50 --> 0:10:11.470 Hanna Chai No, no, no such thing in Auth0, yeah. 0:10:11.770 --> 0:10:12.780 Duraid Wadie Yeah, that's perfect. 0:10:12.790 --> 0:10:13.290 Duraid Wadie Thank you for that. 0:10:13.960 --> 0:10:14.400 Hanna Chai OK. 0:10:14.470 --> 0:10:15.120 Hanna Chai Thank you. 0:10:15.130 --> 0:10:16.950 Hanna Chai Then I passed to Ping Ping. 0:10:18.950 --> 0:10:20.470 Ping Ping Lau He can I share my screen. 0:10:23.70 --> 0:10:24.230 Ping Ping Lau You can see my screen right? 0:10:25.630 --> 0:10:25.960 Duraid Wadie Yet. 0:10:25.420 --> 0:10:32.230 Ping Ping Lau So uh, the first one, I will go to will be on the change log integration for all zero. 0:10:32.420 --> 0:11:3.950 Ping Ping Lau So before I go to include details a a few points that I would like to highlight here is off 0 already have built-in integration with Amazon Event page where we can actually configure to stream the locks of that be for all the events that's happening and then stream it to event bridge and then off 0 strip configure at the tenant level so it applies to all activities happening on that tenants and the Lambda and Amazon Lambda. 0:11:3.960 --> 0:11:12.730 Ping Ping Lau Also we can see that it's already have built-in integration with event Bridge for off 0 itself later on in the screen you can see that we don't have to like bigger. 0:11:12.740 --> 0:11:20.630 Ping Ping Lau Mainly we can just select that the partner is also zero and for Lambda also is integrated with event bridge. 0:11:20.630 --> 0:11:32.610 Ping Ping Lau We can configure to say the trigger the Lambda when something received from the bridge and also since this is tidy, uh tidy coupled, right? 0:11:32.620 --> 0:11:47.890 Ping Ping Lau So if if they say we have set up the the screen or event bridge, if it delete the screen in off 0 then it will also automatically delete the the the resources in event Amazon Event Bridge asset. 0:11:47.940 --> 0:11:53.900 Ping Ping Lau Additional things that we put in like Lambda those will be will not get deleted. 0:11:55.720 --> 0:12:4.670 Ping Ping Lau So apart from integrating with event bridge or 10H also support multiple integration with other external tools. 0:12:4.680 --> 0:12:11.820 Ping Ping Lau But then I have only tested with a event page because I think it's already meeting our purpose here. 0:12:12.920 --> 0:12:21.790 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, with all these features that we have, this will be what I post and then so make it work with the change in integration. 0:12:22.200 --> 0:12:23.990 Ping Ping Lau So what? 0:12:24.220 --> 0:12:37.910 Ping Ping Lau In this what I've done is assuming that platform services will be populating those tenant ID and product instance ID into a Dynamo DB during the for that registration. 0:12:38.440 --> 0:13:1.160 Ping Ping Lau Then on Auth0 we configure the monitoring so that it's been the locks to AWS Event bridge and when event which I received the data it triggers the number of functions and the Lambda functions will be writing to the NSK where change of service will be consuming from the NSK. 0:13:3.120 --> 0:13:22.210 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, these are a few configuration I think I don't have to go through into details, but I'm just to show that it's already a the integrated service that we can select and then we also allowed to choose what type of events that we want to stream over. 0:13:23.280 --> 0:13:29.130 Ping Ping Lau Uh, they are quite a long list of events that we can capture in the Auth0. 0:13:29.180 --> 0:13:33.130 Ping Ping Lau So yeah, the good news is we can also catch a lot out. 0:13:33.420 --> 0:13:42.810 Ping Ping Lau So I think we can capture that nearly when we are doing coordinator and then these are mostly on the user login out activities. 0:13:42.860 --> 0:13:52.850 Ping Ping Lau And also we have options on a management API where we are using it quite a lot in other tickets to achieve some customizations. 0:13:54.70 --> 0:13:57.870 Ping Ping Lau Uh, I haven't able to repeat. 0:13:58.40 --> 0:14:2.830 Ping Ping Lau I mean to to test all the events because some I don't know how to make it trigger. 0:14:3.220 --> 0:14:5.150 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, but you can see here it's quite a long list. 0:14:7.680 --> 0:14:10.850 Ping Ping Lau And then, uh, on Amazon configurations. 0:14:10.910 --> 0:14:11.490 Ping Ping Lau Uh. 0:14:12.120 --> 0:14:35.360 Ping Ping Lau When we configure the the the stream to event bridge from Auth0, they view straight away to see people get this appear in Ms Son and then what we can do is but you will be in the pending status but we will have to associate it with the event bus then the the streaming will be running. 0:14:37.480 --> 0:14:37.960 Ping Ping Lau Umm. 0:14:39.860 --> 0:14:49.130 Ping Ping Lau And then, yeah, this this is a simple simple under functions that I used to so that it listens to the events in the event bridge. 0:14:49.180 --> 0:14:52.850 Ping Ping Lau And then here it's writing to the NSK. 0:14:55.650 --> 0:15:13.960 Ping Ping Lau Uh, so just want to show here that when we come to to complete the whole configuration, we also need the rules in Amazon and we can see here is we we can straight away select of zero from the partner instead of like configuring those rules manually. 0:15:14.750 --> 0:15:21.670 Ping Ping Lau So all these are already integrated integrated, so I will just do a quick demo. 0:15:21.880 --> 0:15:31.510 Ping Ping Lau Uh, this is the Kafka UI for the MSK, but I have a because we have lots of topics here. 0:15:31.520 --> 0:15:35.370 Ping Ping Lau I I and it's used by other tester for other testing purpose. 0:15:35.620 --> 0:15:38.890 Ping Ping Lau So I have created this topics to do this testing. 0:15:40.130 --> 0:15:44.480 Ping Ping Lau Let me just clear out everything first. 0:15:44.490 --> 0:15:46.60 Ping Ping Lau So that it's easier for us to see. 0:15:47.140 --> 0:16:0.940 Ping Ping Lau And then, uh, and we use this, this is application and deploy into KS and it will be pointing to the Office 0 for authentications. 0:16:5.660 --> 0:16:10.170 Ping Ping Lau For these other test using uh Federated login in Asia. 0:16:12.730 --> 0:16:17.180 Ping Ping Lau Ah yeah, so this this for the next tickets to discuss. 0:16:17.190 --> 0:16:28.70 Ping Ping Lau But OK, so after successfully log in then we should expect to see the those events be published to uh. 0:16:28.620 --> 0:16:31.620 Ping Ping Lau In this case you will take over, yeah, so. 0:16:33.780 --> 0:16:36.570 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, we can see these events is a Federated thing. 0:16:37.600 --> 0:16:50.780 Ping Ping Lau And if we check against in Auth0, we can see that these are the few uh events accepting, so we should be getting here. 0:16:53.40 --> 0:16:58.940 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, cheap will be I haven't configured to to stream all the events that is happening here. 0:17:1.160 --> 0:17:1.590 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:17:1.600 --> 0:17:6.600 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, this is how we can do the change of integration. 0:17:8.560 --> 0:17:10.550 Ping Ping Lau Uh, any any questions about this? 0:17:12.360 --> 0:17:17.110 Duraid Wadie I think I think I'm just wondering why did you write it as See? 0:17:18.200 --> 0:17:20.820 Ping Ping Lau Oh, because we had. 0:17:21.440 --> 0:17:27.400 Ping Ping Lau We have a longer development, so it's a required additional development. 0:17:28.930 --> 0:17:29.460 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:17:29.340 --> 0:17:30.20 Ping Ping Lau So yeah. 0:17:29.530 --> 0:17:31.340 Duraid Wadie But really it's just a Lambda. 0:17:31.350 --> 0:17:32.610 Duraid Wadie You need to do that set. 0:17:34.160 --> 0:17:37.340 Ping Ping Lau Fall clothing wise, yes and that. 0:17:46.170 --> 0:17:46.660 Ping Ping Lau E. 0:17:36.650 --> 0:17:51.170 Duraid Wadie Yeah, I wouldn't write this as I see I think big thing is to to yeah, because they've actually done all of the hook into the event bridge creation and we can relate the Lambda just taking it from there and just pushing it to the queue, right. 0:17:52.30 --> 0:17:52.350 Ping Ping Lau I guess. 0:17:53.450 --> 0:17:53.920 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:17:53.930 --> 0:17:54.140 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:17:54.150 --> 0:17:54.520 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:17:54.370 --> 0:17:54.780 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:17:54.680 --> 0:17:55.380 Duraid Wadie But perfect. 0:17:55.390 --> 0:17:55.600 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:17:54.820 --> 0:17:57.270 Ping Ping Lau Ohh yeah umm, but what one? 0:17:55.610 --> 0:17:59.0 Duraid Wadie So and there'll be some charge right on on this. 0:17:59.10 --> 0:17:59.620 Duraid Wadie But I don't think so. 0:17:59.630 --> 0:18:2.540 Duraid Wadie There will be nothing really, like maybe 50. 0:18:2.550 --> 0:18:6.940 Duraid Wadie Whatever is dollars a month what? 0:18:4.220 --> 0:18:7.380 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, they're regarding the pricing, right? 0:18:8.530 --> 0:18:11.960 Ping Ping Lau Uh, are you saying this that? 0:18:12.450 --> 0:18:13.620 Duraid Wadie No, but I don't think so. 0:18:13.630 --> 0:18:14.760 Duraid Wadie The expensive is it at all? 0:18:15.860 --> 0:18:16.350 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:18:16.360 --> 0:18:20.690 Ping Ping Lau And I I just realized that I think I have done this calculation wrongly. 0:18:20.700 --> 0:18:28.60 Ping Ping Lau It's a should be times 30 and this is one day, but anyway it's still I think it's still very cheap. 0:18:32.290 --> 0:18:32.880 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah. 0:18:36.790 --> 0:18:37.740 Duraid Wadie You per day. 0:18:28.220 --> 0:18:38.420 Ping Ping Lau Probably it's below 1000 per month for 2,000,000 user and with the assumption said, yeah, we're talking five times, but they yeah. 0:18:37.750 --> 0:18:38.880 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah. 0:18:38.890 --> 0:18:45.850 Duraid Wadie I mean tabanus with the logs that are not cheap thing to deal with because even if you need to deal with it with key clock, right?

0:34:42.770 --> 0:35:2.550 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, we can also customize the email and before we are able to use before we are able to customize the email, we can we have to use our custom email provider and the good thing here is they have supported quite a number of email provider including send grid. 0:35:3.360 --> 0:35:11.830 Ping Ping Lau But there is a note here to say that if we want to use if our email provider is running behind firewall, we have to do all this white listing. 0:35:12.60 --> 0:35:15.210 Ping Ping Lau But when I do the testing I I don't have to request. 0:35:15.600 --> 0:35:18.310 Ping Ping Lau Whitelisting, probably inside. 0:35:18.320 --> 0:35:22.220 Ping Ping Lau We don't be allowed puppy access or I don't know this. 0:35:22.400 --> 0:35:24.150 Ping Ping Lau For me, this IP code is really wide. 0:35:24.160 --> 0:35:25.830 Ping Ping Lau Instead then? 0:35:25.840 --> 0:35:26.240 Ping Ping Lau Uh. 0:35:26.840 --> 0:35:39.940 Ping Ping Lau Just configure the API key for SANGRID and then after that we can go to the branding and customize the change password tablet so. 0:35:42.30 --> 0:35:50.340 Ping Ping Lau What I wanted to show here is because the reset password right, we want to send when the user is first logged in. 0:35:50.630 --> 0:36:2.940 Ping Ping Lau But we want to display a welcome message, but user can also click on the reset password in the login from the login page and uh for Auth0. 0:36:2.950 --> 0:36:5.640 Ping Ping Lau It doesn't have two different templates. 0:36:5.650 --> 0:36:16.660 Ping Ping Lau It's using the same templates for that, but the good thing here is again, we can make use of the meta data and then we can do some checking here to decide what to display under different conditions. 0:36:17.90 --> 0:36:21.180 Ping Ping Lau So for example, we store A is password reset flag. 0:36:22.200 --> 0:36:30.250 Ping Ping Lau So if he, if he's already reset, then we say this is a a password change request. 0:36:30.700 --> 0:36:41.850 Ping Ping Lau But if it is not yet set and this is first time to, it's a welcome even then we would say welcome email, but we can still show the reset password, right? 0:36:46.420 --> 0:36:46.690 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:36:46.700 --> 0:36:49.900 Ping Ping Lau So after we customize the email right, we can actually get something like this. 0:36:55.800 --> 0:37:5.530 Ping Ping Lau And if user click on the reset password from the login page after they have logged in before then the email will show like this. 0:37:7.980 --> 0:37:12.430 Ping Ping Lau I think I pause it for a while for the user create in. 0:37:12.440 --> 0:37:13.650 Ping Ping Lau Any questions about this? 0:37:13.660 --> 0:37:15.670 Ping Ping Lau Or do you want to go to a table for this? 0:37:19.940 --> 0:37:23.350 Duraid Wadie I think from what I've seen Ping Ping here it's it's. 0:37:23.360 --> 0:37:26.430 Duraid Wadie This is for all of the suggests for the basic user creation, right? 0:37:27.900 --> 0:37:29.360 Ping Ping Lau Yes, for basic user creation. 0:37:30.460 --> 0:37:30.620 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:37:31.330 --> 0:37:36.540 Duraid Wadie And I think you really mimic the exact similar way to kick clock from what I've seen so far. 0:37:38.670 --> 0:37:41.100 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, for for this one. It works. 0:37:42.110 --> 0:37:43.990 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, we can do whatever keycloak can do. 0:37:45.70 --> 0:37:46.860 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah, yeah. 0:37:46.870 --> 0:37:48.80 Duraid Wadie I don't have any other questions. 0:37:48.90 --> 0:37:49.410 Duraid Wadie I think that's it looks really good. 0:37:51.740 --> 0:37:55.430 Ping Ping Lau OK, then the the second one will be on first login. 0:37:55.880 --> 0:37:58.731 Ping Ping Lau So first login i.e. 0:38:0.160 --> 0:38:1.410 Ping Ping Lau Let me just go through. 0:38:1.420 --> 0:38:2.810 Ping Ping Lau I think they might. 0:38:2.820 --> 0:38:4.390 Ping Ping Lau I just play played it again. 0:38:4.400 --> 0:38:5.990 Ping Ping Lau This is just about 30 seconds. 0:38:6.560 --> 0:38:12.610 Ping Ping Lau So for keycloak I when we first log in then it will ask for the consent. 0:38:21.180 --> 0:38:23.540 Ping Ping Lau Then you will pop up a password reset page. 0:38:29.370 --> 0:38:32.330 Ping Ping Lau So after that, yeah, this is how it will be ended. 0:38:32.340 --> 0:38:38.680 Ping Ping Lau Then we should be good to go through the login again and then compare to Office 0. 0:38:40.260 --> 0:38:41.450 Ping Ping Lau This is the default behavior. 0:38:57.950 --> 0:39:5.620 Ping Ping Lau Though this is the transient page and needs us now default it will pop up something like this and then it won't ask to reset. 0:39:5.660 --> 0:39:8.880 Ping Ping Lau So you just go in to the applications directly. 0:39:10.40 --> 0:39:11.200 Ping Ping Lau So uh. 0:39:13.420 --> 0:39:14.770 Ping Ping Lau Policies kick out. 0:39:14.780 --> 0:39:29.90 Ping Ping Lau We show the terms that the consent page and Auth0 also have the consent page, but is is the different purpose is to allow the applications and then for kicker we have the he said password but obviously we don't have a reset password. 0:39:29.840 --> 0:39:42.70 Ping Ping Lau So for this to handle the consent of, we have seen it is now in the consent page but to for the reset password, right? 0:39:42.780 --> 0:39:43.610 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, big, big. 0:39:43.780 --> 0:39:45.400 Ping Ping Lau We have two solutions here. 0:39:46.390 --> 0:39:48.940 Ping Ping Lau Uh one is we uh. 0:39:48.950 --> 0:39:57.160 Ping Ping Lau Sorry for before that we are able to actually disable the default of 0 consent page that we see this now. 0:39:57.570 --> 0:40:17.810 Ping Ping Lau So they also allow us to do this, and this is the step that we can do, but I I will highlight here is it only have it only can be done for what they call a first party client which means all the all the applications and the sister from the management console. 0:40:18.230 --> 0:40:22.840 Ping Ping Lau But for example, if you see we're running from local hole side then we cannot be. 0:40:22.890 --> 0:40:28.230 Ping Ping Lau We can't hide the consent page, but I think yeah, there is OK for the local host. 0:40:30.710 --> 0:40:35.400 Ping Ping Lau So for reset password there are two options that can think of. 0:40:35.790 --> 0:40:54.670 Ping Ping Lau One is a relate use of uh sending the reset password email when a user login for the for the first time and this is the I the click here and then we we attach it to this. 0:40:54.890 --> 0:40:56.80 Ping Ping Lau So I want to show. 0:40:56.130 --> 0:41:1.650 Ping Ping Lau I think we go through the process because we might need some decision over here to go for which options. 0:41:2.770 --> 0:41:5.630 Ping Ping Lau Let me configure this first. 0:41:8.190 --> 0:41:8.580 Ping Ping Lau In. 0:41:12.990 --> 0:41:14.930 Ping Ping Lau So reset password. 0:41:30.150 --> 0:41:30.680 Ping Ping Lau I will. 0:41:33.110 --> 0:41:33.410 Ping Ping Lau I would. 0:41:35.40 --> 0:41:36.140 Ping Ping Lau Peanut pound. 0:41:56.740 --> 0:42:1.470 Ping Ping Lau So when a user is created then we will get. 0:42:3.390 --> 0:42:5.840 Ping Ping Lau Please welcome email and then. 0:42:7.960 --> 0:42:9.710 Ping Ping Lau We do a reset password from here. 0:42:16.240 --> 0:42:19.550 Ping Ping Lau So the good thing about this option is we. 0:42:21.530 --> 0:42:28.700 Ping Ping Lau We uh, we are using back the change password screen and give all the behavior that we have. 0:42:29.130 --> 0:42:34.300 Ping Ping Lau So for example, let's say I'm changing password like then we will be getting all this. 0:42:34.660 --> 0:42:36.320 Ping Ping Lau Uh notes here. 0:42:39.750 --> 0:42:42.250 Ping Ping Lau And then I can do a reset password here but. 0:42:44.580 --> 0:42:53.190 Ping Ping Lau The issue here is we won't see the reset password screen appear in the login floor as we saw in keycloak. 0:42:53.710 --> 0:43:0.680 Ping Ping Lau So let's say a if I don't do a reset password right, then I go back to the application. 0:43:18.30 --> 0:43:26.130 Ping Ping Lau So the flow is even pop up the consent page after that because the user the reset password not yet happened. 0:43:26.140 --> 0:43:29.900 Ping Ping Lau So it will deny the access and direct it. 0:43:33.360 --> 0:43:34.300 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah. 0:43:29.910 --> 0:43:37.670 Ping Ping Lau This is what I mentioned that they in the off 0 call it go back to the yeah error page, yeah. 0:43:37.530 --> 0:43:43.380 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah, I think this is for me very nice error page we can create and throw it there. 0:43:43.550 --> 0:43:44.980 Duraid Wadie It's very valid to Venezuela. 0:43:44.990 --> 0:43:46.780 Duraid Wadie It doesn't even need to go to the application. 0:43:46.790 --> 0:43:48.300 Duraid Wadie The user needs to reset the password. 0:43:48.310 --> 0:43:51.280 Duraid Wadie We already told them to do so that we send an email to do that. 0:43:51.950 --> 0:43:53.240 Duraid Wadie We're gonna tell them, OK? 0:43:53.250 --> 0:43:54.270 Duraid Wadie Go reset your password. 0:43:54.280 --> 0:43:55.240 Duraid Wadie They have sent you an email. 0:43:55.250 --> 0:43:56.340 Duraid Wadie Go reset your password. 0:43:56.420 --> 0:43:57.230 Duraid Wadie Is that really simple? 0:43:57.240 --> 0:43:59.490 Duraid Wadie But once they've done this, they can log in and find, right? 0:44:0.720 --> 0:44:2.950 Ping Ping Lau Yes, I see a tennis. 0:44:1.750 --> 0:44:3.880 Duraid Wadie Yeah, I mean, that's what else can we do, right?

0:58:34.750 --> 0:58:35.100 SueAnn See OK. 0:58:37.100 --> 0:58:37.320 Anthony Wong OK. 0:58:36.730 --> 0:58:39.970 Ping Ping Lau OK, then I just, yeah, I would just go through this funding. 0:58:40.490 --> 0:58:47.440 Ping Ping Lau So for this is to yeah, the behavior for this, OK, you just go to this. 0:58:47.670 --> 0:58:51.960 Ping Ping Lau The default behavior for 0 right is raising middle to into. 0:58:52.270 --> 0:58:56.150 Ping Ping Lau That means for those Federated user it will just auto. 0:58:57.840 --> 0:59:9.480 Ping Ping Lau Although create into the database after it's after user authenticated successfully in in the external queue and we cannot, we cannot create a user. 0:59:10.580 --> 0:59:11.610 Ping Ping Lau Ohh, thought of it. 0:59:11.620 --> 0:59:14.430 Ping Ping Lau Return in in of 0 manually. 0:59:14.720 --> 0:59:25.540 Ping Ping Lau It doesn't allow us to do that so but example when we create a user like table they ask us which connection is it. 0:59:25.870 --> 0:59:39.350 Ping Ping Lau So for the connections the photo Federated locked in there, the connection is really the price connection and we can see that it won't appear as an options when we create a user. 0:59:39.900 --> 0:59:47.280 Ping Ping Lau So there is the behavior of the uh, they they did not eat so. 0:59:51.480 --> 0:59:54.730 Ping Ping Lau So the test medications, if we can do a day, are two options. 0:59:54.740 --> 1:0:13.380 Ping Ping Lau I started with the action using the action secret, but after I completed this I found out that there are limitation on the secret because the number of the the length that you can store is up to 2000 plus which means that we can only let store probably like 50 emails maybe. 1:0:13.440 --> 1:0:14.650 Ping Ping Lau So I don't think this is a. 1:0:14.940 --> 1:0:15.330 Ping Ping Lau This is a. 1:0:18.400 --> 1:0:22.90 Ping Ping Lau Solutions is acceptable, so I will just go to the another one. 1:0:22.140 --> 1:0:33.960 Ping Ping Lau She's using the off 0 database connections, So what we can do here is they just put the type when here the the behavior is like. 1:0:35.880 --> 1:0:44.230 Ping Ping Lau Umm, what I proposed to do like is when again perform user provision a user it registered the external user. 1:0:44.920 --> 1:0:46.250 Ping Ping Lau But take a look at this box. 1:0:46.260 --> 1:0:48.50 Ping Ping Lau Is everything within the Office 0? 1:0:48.100 --> 1:0:56.10 Ping Ping Lau So what we can do is we can add those external user into a database in of you. 1:0:56.100 --> 1:0:57.990 Ping Ping Lau So we show what I'm here. 1:1:2.890 --> 1:1:4.40 Ping Ping Lau That's the database. 1:1:4.610 --> 1:1:10.120 Ping Ping Lau So for example, we can actually create another database in Auth0 and I call it. 1:1:10.390 --> 1:1:12.500 Ping Ping Lau This is the external user allowed base. 1:1:13.10 --> 1:1:16.850 Ping Ping Lau So we can create those user into this database. 1:1:25.60 --> 1:1:26.230 Ping Ping Lau So Python gives it to. 1:1:26.280 --> 1:1:31.450 Ping Ping Lau To do that and then when user login like it it, it has to go through this process first. 1:1:31.460 --> 1:1:34.530 Ping Ping Lau It's go to the go to the the end. 1:1:34.540 --> 1:1:42.750 Ping Ping Lau After authenticated it come back then and I do notice that when login successful it actually goes to the sign up process. 1:1:43.280 --> 1:1:54.10 Ping Ping Lau But the unfortunate thing is we cannot add a actions in the sign up for the Federated won't figure the actions it will trigger for internal user. 1:1:54.460 --> 1:2:7.670 Ping Ping Lau So that's why we cannot add trigger here to say I check when user assigning up but instead what we can do is only when user log after successfully logged in then. 1:2:10.70 --> 1:2:10.510 Ping Ping Lau We will. 1:2:12.920 --> 1:2:36.440 Ping Ping Lau So for this the process here is after successfully logged in, the default behavior for all zero is able just insert a record into a default the the database that be teached to the applications and then it will come back to the post or in action where we can do a validation here to to check whether the log the email exists in this external user list. 1:2:36.820 --> 1:2:52.570 Ping Ping Lau So if a exists, then we just the was it, if the login, if it doesn't exist we can we have to actually perform the delete user API call so that it delete the user from a from this database. 1:2:52.650 --> 1:3:0.690 Ping Ping Lau Then we deny the log in, so this is something that, uh, the work around that I can find to control. 1:3:1.590 --> 1:3:5.600 Ping Ping Lau Ohh which is the user list that we want to allow them to access. 1:3:9.860 --> 1:3:10.240 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 1:3:10.250 --> 1:3:15.490 Duraid Wadie And the guys looking for or maybe a maybe it will be another option, isn't it from both sale, yeah. 1:3:14.280 --> 1:3:22.200 Ping Ping Lau Yet they they are saying that it's not release is in India met but don't know when. 1:3:23.570 --> 1:3:26.180 Duraid Wadie Also, they said that something they doing in that road map for this. 1:3:27.250 --> 1:3:29.290 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, they said they is is in the room. 1:3:30.910 --> 1:3:31.190 Duraid Wadie OK. 1:3:32.700 --> 1:3:39.310 Duraid Wadie So that's mean we need to live with post action login and write so the user has actually logged in, but we can validate it. 1:3:39.320 --> 1:3:44.130 Duraid Wadie Then we can throw it out if we it doesn't exist in the internal database. 1:3:47.820 --> 1:3:48.100 Ping Ping Lau Umm. 1:3:44.140 --> 1:3:50.250 Duraid Wadie Do you know like the second time when the second time happens right we can say is this user validated right?

1:4:17.950 --> 1:4:23.700 Duraid Wadie That user give delete the attribute as well, so that's the work probably needs to happen is that. 1:4:24.200 --> 1:4:24.650 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, yeah. 1:4:25.490 --> 1:4:29.640 Ping Ping Lau If you keep it in the attributes, then we go to clear up from two places. 1:4:27.870 --> 1:4:31.210 Duraid Wadie Yeah.

Is there some way for us to detect a consent update since the user agreed? I can’t imagine an admin touching 100s of tenants. Extract from the transcript above and answer the above 2 questions how when legal document change, Auth0 can detect it automatically.","output":"For addressing the scenarios where legal documents change and there's a need to reset user consent in Auth0, the transcript doesn't provide a direct out-of-the-box solution for automatically detecting legal document changes and resetting consents. However, we can use the insights and capabilities discussed to suggest a way to manage this process: **1. Allow Admin to Reset Consent Whenever Legal Document Changes:** Auth0's flexibility with actions (custom code executed during authentication transactions) and its Management API can be leveraged to facilitate the admin's ability to reset consent when legal documents change. While the transcript doesn’t describe an automatic detection of legal document changes, we can infer a strategy to manually trigger consent reset: - **Custom Consent Management:** As hinted by the use of metadata and post-login actions, an admin can implement a mechanism to reset consent by leveraging user metadata to store versioning or timestamps related to the latest consent agreement. When a legal document changes, the admin updates the consent version/timestamp required in the system. - **Management API for Bulk Operations:** To reset consent for many users, the admin can use the Auth0 Management API to programmatically iterate through users and update their metadata to reflect that they need to re-consent, based on the new legal document version. **2. Automatically Detecting Consent Update Needs:** While the transcript doesn’t directly offer a solution for automatic detection of legal document changes, we can propose a method that combines the use of external tools and Auth0 capabilities: - **Version Control for Legal Documents:** Maintain the legal documents in a version-controlled environment. Use webhooks or similar mechanisms to get notified when a document is updated. - **Automated Script/Service:** Develop an automated script or service that listens to the version control webhook. Upon detecting a change, this service uses the Auth0 Management API to mark all users or specific tenant users as needing to re-consent, possibly by updating a ‘legal_document_version’ field in the user’s app_metadata. - **Login Flow Checks:** Utilize Auth0 Actions or Rules to check the user’s \`app_metadata\` for the \`legal_document_version\` during the login flow. If the user's version does not match the current version, redirect the user to a consent flow and withhold access until they agree to the new terms. This approach does not directly automate the detection within Auth0 but leverages external triggers (documents' version control) and Auth0's capabilities (Management API, Actions/Rules, and metadata) to achieve a semi-automated process for resetting user consent upon legal document changes."},{"instruction":"based on the transcript, does Auth0 provide a direct out-of-the-box solution for automatically detecting legal document changes and resetting consents?","output":"Based on the information provided in the transcript, Auth0 does not provide a direct out-of-the-box solution for automatically detecting legal document changes and resetting consents. The discussions in the transcript primarily focus on leveraging Auth0's capabilities and custom code (such as using Actions for post-login checks, Management API for user metadata manipulation, and custom consent screens) to manage user consent manually or semi-automatically. For scenarios like detecting legal document changes and requiring users to re-consent, solutions would likely involve custom development outside of Auth0's direct features, such as version control for legal documents, external notifications when documents change, and scripts or services that use Auth0's API to update user consent status."},{"instruction":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: “Hey, [player]?

Önerilen modelin gerçekleştirilebilir olup olmadığı bir yana, bu yöntemlerle elde edilmek istenen medeniyetin temel özellikleri ve muhtemel sonuçları şu şekilde özetlenebilir: # Fırsat Eşitliği Odaklı Bir Toplum Yapısı Bu model, doğumdan itibaren her bir bireye eşit fırsat sunmayı hedefler. Her bebeğin yeteneklerini keşfetmek ve bu yeteneklere uygun imkanlar sağlamak, teorik olarak her bireyin potansiyelini azami derecede kullanabilmesini ve böylece toplumun genel refahının artmasını sağlayabilir. # Genetik Seleksiyon ile Güçlü Bir Toplum Yapay genetik seleksiyon yöntemleriyle, belirli bedensel, duygusal ve zihinsel kriterlere göre bireylerin seçilmesi, hastalıkların azaltılması ve belirli yeteneklerin güçlendirilmesi gibi faydalar sunabilir. Ancak bu, genetik çeşitliliğin azalmasına ve bir süre sonra evrimsel dezavantajlara yol açabilir. # Ebeveynlik Anlayışının Değişimi Bu modelde, çocukların biyolojik ailelerinden erken yaşta ayrılarak “insanlık ailesi”ne dahil edilmeleri, duygusal bağların ve aile kavramının tamamen yeniden tanımlanmasını gerektirecektir. Bu durum, bireysel kimliklerin ve duygusal bağların nasıl gelişeceği konusunda soru işaretleri yaratır. # Eğitim ve Yetenek Yönetimi Her bireyin yeteneklerinin adaletli bir şekilde değerlendirilmesi ve bu doğrultuda eğitim alması, toplumun genel verimliliğini ve yaratıcılığını artırabilir. Ancak bu, bireylerin kendi yaşam yollarını ve kariyerlerini seçmelerine izin vermeyen bir yapıyı da beraberinde getirebilir. # Hukuk ve Etik Değerler Bu düzenlemeler, son derece karmaşık hukuki ve etik sorunları gündeme getirecektir.

Assuming you want to load a pre-trained model and use it for prediction, here are the steps you might follow. This example uses TensorFlow 2.x and demonstrates how to load the MobileNetV2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, preprocess an image, and use the model to predict the image class. First, ensure you have TensorFlow installed. If not, you can install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install tensorflow \`\`\` Here are the three lines of code you might use, followed by a slight breakdown of each step: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)) predictions = model.predict(tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(tf.image.resize(images, (224, 224)))) \`\`\` Explanation: 1. **Import TensorFlow**: You start by importing TensorFlow. TensorFlow includes the Keras API, which provides access to various deep learning models, including pre-trained CNNs. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf \`\`\` 2. **Load the Pre-trained Model**: Here, you load the MobileNetV2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. You need to specify the \`weights='imagenet'\` to use the pre-trained weights. The \`input_shape\` parameter is required to match the input shape the model was originally trained with. For MobileNetV2, the standard input size is \`224x224\` pixels with 3 color channels (RGB). \`\`\`python model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)) \`\`\` 3. **Prepare Your Image and Predict**: Before making a prediction, you must preprocess your input image to match the format the model expects. This typically involves resizing the image to the required dimensions and applying any necessary scaling/color normalization. Many pre-trained models in Keras come with their own \`preprocess_input\` function tailored for this purpose. Here, you're also resizing the image to the expected size using \`tf.image.resize()\`. The \`model.predict()\` method is then called to classify the image. Note: This line assumes you have an image tensor named \`images\`.

Before training a CNN model in TensorFlow (or any neural network, for that matter), you usually need to convert these integer labels into a one-hot encoded format when dealing with multi-class classification problems. This transformation changes your labels from a single integer to a vector of zeros except for the position representing the class, which is marked with a 1. Given this additional detail, here's how you can adjust the workflow to handle \`typeIds\` as your label data: # Step 1: One-hot Encode Your Labels TensorFlow's Keras API provides a convenient function called \`to_categorical\` to easily convert integer labels to a one-hot encoded format. You'll use it right after loading and preprocessing your input data but before feeding it into the model.

The method will print the loss and accuracy (or whatever metrics you compiled the model with) on the test data. # Custom Metrics (Scoring) If you have more specific needs for evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score), you can calculate them using the predictions from your model and the true labels. To do this, you first need to make predictions on your test set, as discussed in our previous example on making predictions. Once you have the predictions, you can use utilities from \`sklearn.metrics\` or any other library to compute various scores. For instance, to compute the precision, recall, and F1 score, you would first need the predictions in your true label format: \`\`\`python from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score # Assuming \`X_test\` is preprocessed and \`y_test\` are true integer labels (not one-hot encoded) predictions = model.predict(X_test) predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) # Convert predictions to 1D array for class labels # Calculate precision, recall, and F1 score precision = precision_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') recall = recall_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') f1 = f1_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') print(f'Precision: {precision:.4f}, Recall: {recall:.4f}, F1 Score: {f1:.4f}') \`\`\` Note: You need to make sure to match the \`average\` parameter in these functions to your specific task (e.g., binary, micro, macro, weighted, etc.), depending on whether your problem is binary classification, multi-class, or multi-label, and depending on how you want to treat class imbalance. # Considerations - Always ensure your test data has been preprocessed in the same manner as your training data. - When interpreting scoring metrics, consider the nature of your dataset (i.e., balance vs. imbalance) and the problem domain to choose the most appropriate metrics. - TensorFlow 2.x also allows for custom metric functions if you have very specific needs not covered by built-in metrics or Scikit-Learn."},{"instruction":"ValueError: Input 0 of layer \\"conv2d\\" is incompatible with the layer: expected min_ndim=4, found ndim=2. Full shape received: (None, 784)","output":"The error message you're encountering suggests that the model expects input with a minimum of 4 dimensions, but it's receiving input with only 2 dimensions. This situation is common when working with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras, as CNNs expect input data in the form of a 4D tensor - \`[batch_size, height, width, channels]\`. For example, when working with grayscale images (single channel) of size 28x28, each individual image's shape should be \`[28, 28, 1]\`, and for RGB images (three channels), the shape should be \`[28, 28, 3]\`. The error indicates that instead, the model is receiving input shaped \`[batch_size, 784]\`, which suggests that the images might be flattened (which is common with datasets like MNIST). # How to Fix It Assuming your input images are indeed 28x28 and have been flattened, you need to reshape your data before feeding it into the model: For Grayscale Images: \`\`\`python # Reshape your data to [batch_size, height, width, channels] # For grayscale images (e.g., MNIST), there's only one channel.

In the context of your reported sizes, it looks like you have \`188\` true labels and \`93\` predictions (or vice versa). Such a mismatch can happen for a few reasons: 1. **Misaligned Dataset Splits:** Ensure both your features (\`X\`) and labels (\`y\`) have been split correctly and correspond to each other one-to-one in the training and testing phases. 2. **Batch Size in the Last Step of Prediction:** If you're making predictions in batches (which is common), the final batch may not be full if the total number of samples is not divisible by the batch size. This usually isn't a problem with TensorFlow's \`model.predict()\` method as it can handle variable batch sizes seamlessly. However, it's something to consider if you've manually implemented batch handling. 3. **Data Filtering or Augmentation:** Sometimes, during preprocessing (e.g., data augmentation or filtering steps), the data size might be unintentionally altered. Ensure these steps are consistent between training and prediction phases. # How to Troubleshoot and Fix It 1. **Verify Dataset Sizes:** Make sure the sizes of your datasets match up precisely at each step (preprocessing, splitting, batching). \`\`\`python print(trainTestData['train']['X'].shape) print(trainTestData['train']['y'].shape) print(trainTestData['test']['X'].shape) print(trainTestData['test']['y'].shape) \`\`\` 2. **Examine Prediction Step:** When making predictions, ensure that you are predicting on the entire test set without any unintended filtering or slicing. \`\`\`python # Assuming model and test data (X_test) are defined predictions = model.predict(trainTestData['test']['X']) predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) print(predicted_classes.shape) \`\`\` 3. **Ensure Matching Numbers:** The shape of \`predicted_classes\` should match the number of samples in \`trainTestData['test']['y']\`. The mismatch in numbers you're experiencing seems to indicate a problem either with how the predictions were generated or a mistake in data handling/loading. 4. **Post-Prediction Dataset Verification:** After the prediction, it's a good practice to verify the number of predictions matches the number of labels you're expecting to assess: \`\`\`python print(f\\"Number of predictions: {len(predicted_classes)}\\") print(f\\"Number of true labels: {len(trainTestData['test']['y'])}\\") \`\`\` If these numbers don't match, you'll need to backtrack and find where the discrepancy occurs.

Now, to address the inconsistency error (\`ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [188, 93]\`) with respect to the previous instructions, the key points of conflict likely arise from the mismatch between the number of predictions (\`predicted_classes\`) and the number of true labels in \`trainTestData['test']['y']\`. Given this, let's ensure the implementation of the prediction and evaluation correctly corresponds to the data you have: 1. **Make Predictions:** Ensure you're predicting on the entire test set and that the process completes without errors. \`\`\`python predictions = model.predict(trainTestData['test']['X']) # This should be based on your revised code predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) \`\`\` 2. **Verify Predictions Size:** After prediction, verify the output size matches the number of test samples (93 in your case). \`\`\`python print(f\\"Predicted classes size: {predicted_classes.shape}\\") # Expected output: Predicted classes size: (93,) \`\`\` 3. **Check the Size of True Labels:** Double-check the size of your true labels for the test set to ensure it aligns with the number of predictions. \`\`\`python print(f\\"True labels size: {len(trainTestData['test']['y'])}\\") # This needs to output 93 to match the size of predicted_classes \`\`\` Based on the expected size of the \`test['X']\` dataset you've shared ([93, 28, 28, 1]), the size of \`predicted_classes\` and \`trainTestData['test']['y']\` must both be 93 for the evaluation metrics (such as precision) to work without error.

The total count of features should exactly match the total count of labels for both training and testing datasets.

To calculate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, you can use scikit-learn's \`precision_score\`, \`recall_score\`, and \`f1_score\` functions. Assuming \`y_test\` is your true labels array and \`predicted_classes\` is the array of predictions shared in your message, you'll first want to make sure both are numpy arrays to avoid any potential issues: \`\`\`python import numpy as np from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score # Assuming your predicted_classes array is named as such and y_test is your true labels array predicted_classes = np.array([12, 13, ...]) # Your predictions y_test = np.array(y_test) # Your true labels, ensure it's an array # Calculate precision, recall and F1 score precision = precision_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') recall = recall_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') f1 = f1_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') print(f\\"Precision: {precision:.4f}\\") print(f\\"Recall: {recall:.4f}\\") print(f\\"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}\\") \`\`\` Here, using the parameter \`average='weighted'\` takes into account label imbalance; it calculates metrics for each label, and finds their average weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). Make sure that both \`y_test\` and \`predicted_classes\` are properly aligned, meaning they have the same length and correspond to the same data instances. A mismatch could either indicate an issue with how the data was split or how the model predictions were generated or collected. Given the metrics you've posted, it seems like you've managed to address the size mismatch issue mentioned earlier, so these steps should work assuming \`y_test\` is correctly aligned with your predictions."},{"instruction":"def getBestTrainedMLPModel( self , maxScore ): mlp = None erreicht = False i = 1 highestModel = None highestScore = 0 while not(erreicht): trainTestData = self.getTestTrainData() mlp = MLPClassifier( hidden_layer_sizes=(27), activation='logistic', alpha=1e-4, solver='sgd', tol=1e-4, random_state=1, learning_rate_init=.1, verbose=True ) mlp.fit(trainTestData['train']['X'], trainTestData['train']['y']) score = mlp.score(trainTestData['test']['X'],trainTestData['test']['y']) print(f'{i}: {round(score*100,5)}') if score >= maxScore: erreicht = True i += 1 if score > highestScore: highestScore = score highestModel = mlp if i > 50: break; self.mlp = highestModel print(f'Höchste Score: {highestScore}') return highestModel def predictMLP( self , image, verbose=False): if self.mlp == None: print('Es kann keine Vorhersage getroffen werden, da das MLP nicht init ist!') return None predictedVirtualId = mlp.predict(image.reshape(1,-1)) predictedElement = iEM.getImageElementFromVirtualId( predictedVirtualId ) if verbose: if predictedElement == None: print(f'Vorhergesagtes Element mit VirtualId: {predictedVirtualId} wurde nicht gefunden!') else: print(f'Folgendes wurde vorhergesagt: {predictedElement.name} des Types: {predictedElement.typeName}') return predictedVirtualId please get me 2 new functions to use keras","output":"To recreate a similar functionality to your described approach for training and predicting with an \`MLPClassifier\` using scikit-learn but instead using Keras (with TensorFlow backend), we will focus on two main functions: one for training the best model (similar to \`getBestTrainedMLPModel\`) and another for making predictions (\`predictMLP\`).

The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting point. For small instances (like with 6 locations), it is feasible to compute the solution using brute force — that is, enumerating all possible routes, calculating their total distances, and selecting the shortest one. In our case, we'll represent the graph as a distance matrix where the rows and columns represent locations, and each cell's value represents the distance between those locations. We'll then implement a solution in Lua, which will include generating all permutations of locations (to represent all possible routes), calculating the total distance for each route, and identifying the route with the least total distance.

(No code needed) but explain a 'practical , efficient way to do it'","output":"Packing randomly sized rectangles into a minimal number of pages (or bins, in the context of the bin packing problem) is a variation of the 2D bin packing problem, which is NP-hard. This implies that finding the absolute optimal solution efficiently for any arbitrary set of rectangles and page sizes is computationally infeasible for large instances. However, there are practical, efficient heuristic algorithms that can produce good, often near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Here's a practical approach incorporating several strategies: # 1. Sort Rectangles Start by sorting the rectangles based on one or more attributes, such as height, width, or area, in descending order. This is known as the First Fit Decreasing (FFD) heuristic when combined with the next step. Sorting ensures that larger items are placed first, potentially allowing for a tighter packing by filling in gaps with smaller rectangles later. # 2. Apply Packing Algorithms Guillotine Cut: This heuristic recursively divides pages into smaller regions using cuts parallel to the edges. It's effective but may not always utilize space optimally since it can lead to awkward leftover spaces. Shelf Packing: Rectangles are placed on shelves (horizontal rows). Each new rectangle is placed on the current shelf if it fits; otherwise, a new shelf is started. Variations handle rectangle rotation, shelf height optimization, and different sorting rules (e.g., Next Fit, Best Fit). MaxRects: It keeps track of all the \\"free\\" rectangles (maximal rectangles where no items are placed within) on the canvas. For each new rectangle, it finds the best position among the free rectangles according to rules like Best Short Side Fit, Best Long Side Fit, Best Area Fit, or Bottom-Left. It's known for its effectiveness in texture atlas packing and can be faster with good implementations. Skyline: This algorithm tracks a \\"skyline\\" (or silhouette) of the already packed rectangles. Each new rectangle is placed on the lowest possible line (\\"y-coordinate\\") that has enough horizontal space. This method tries to keep the packing height minimal. # 3. Rotate Rectangles (If Allowed) Allowing rectangles to be rotated can significantly improve packing efficiency. However, this should be done taking into account any constraints regarding the orientation of the rectangles. # 4. Heuristic Improvements - **Splitting**: When a large page has significant wasted space, consider splitting it into smaller pages if possible. - **Merging**: After initial placement, attempt to merge pages if doing so reduces the total page count without violating constraints. - **Local Search**: After initial packing, perform local optimizations. For example, try moving, rotating, or swapping rectangles to fill gaps or free up space. # 5. Multiple Passes with Variations Run the packing algorithm multiple times with different strategies (e.g., different sorting criteria, packing heuristics) and choose the best outcome. This can counteract the weaknesses of any single approach. # Summary For practical applications, it's often best to combine several of these strategies, experimenting with different heuristics and parameters. Starting with a straightforward algorithm like Shelf Packing can provide a baseline. Then, techniques like Skyline or MaxRects can be employed to optimize further, especially for specific types of rectangle distributions. Due to the complexity, a meta-heuristic approach (iterating over different strategies) may yield the best practical results, striking a balance between computational time and packing efficiency."},{"instruction":"Compute a square root in fast way, YOu have addition, subtraction and shift operations on binary values...","output":"Computing the square root of a number quickly using only addition, subtraction, and binary shift operations can be efficiently achieved through a method akin to the \\"bitwise binary search\\" or using the \\"non-restoring square root algorithm.\\" However, both of these methods can be somewhat intricate due to their bitwise manipulations. A common, fast, and more intuitive way, leveraging binary operations that meets the criteria set—especially under constraints prohibiting multiplication, division, or floating-point arithmetic—is essentially a binary search algorithm applied for square root calculation. Here's a conceptual explanation of a method similar to binary search that efficiently utilizes binary shifting (a form of efficiently multiplying or dividing by powers of 2) to find the square root of a given non-negative integer \`N\`. Binary shifts can be perceived as doubling or halving, corresponding to multiplication or division by 2, respectively. Thus, \`n << 1\` equals \`n * 2\`, and \`n >> 1\` equals \`n / 2\` in integer math. # Conceptual Overview: 1. **Initialization**: Define the lower and upper bounds of your search. For a square root, the lower bound can start at \`0\`, and the upper bound can be \`(N >> 1) + 1\` or simply \`N\` if \`N\` is less than 2, since the square root of a number cannot be larger than the number itself divided by 2 (plus one to cover the square root of numbers less than 4). 2. **Binary Search with Bitwise Operations**: Apply a binary search within this range. In each iteration, you choose the midpoint between the lower and upper bounds (\`mid = (low + high) >> 1\`). Then, you square this midpoint (using a method adapted to your constraints, possibly iterative addition) and compare it to \`N\`. - If the square of \`mid\` is greater than \`N\`, you know the square root must be less, so you adjust the upper bound to \`mid - 1\`. - If it's less, the square root must be higher, so you adjust the lower bound to \`mid + 1\`. - If you find an exact match, \`mid\` is the square root. 3. **Termination and Approximation**: If an exact square root isn't critical (or for non-perfect squares), the iteration stops when the interval between the lower and upper bounds can no longer be split (when \`low\` exceeds \`high\`). At this point, if an exact square root has not been found (which is common), \`high\` will be the largest integer less than the square root of \`N\`, providing a floor approximation. # Why This Is Fast: This method is efficient, especially for large numbers, because it: - Reduces the problem space by half with each iteration, leading to a logarithmic (log₂N) time complexity. - Leverages bit shifts for multiplication and division, which are faster operations than their arithmetic counterparts. # Limitations: - This method outlined offers an integer approximation of the square root. - For floating-point precision, additional steps or algorithms (such as Newton's method) are necessary, which may not strictly adhere to the operation constraints described. # Additional Note: Calculating the square explicitly in each iteration with only addition and subtraction (without multiplication) can be challenging but still feasible. An alternative direct bitwise approach for squaring can be designed but often results in more complexity, making the simple binary search approach (with attention to how the \\"squaring\\" is implemented) an elegant solution under the operation constraints provided."},{"instruction":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: “Hey, [player]?

Although there isn't a specific clause that mentions feeding a pastor with food in a literal sense, the principle of supporting those who work in spreading the gospel can be seen in passages regarding the support of church leaders. One of the most cited verses in support of this concept is 1 Timothy 5:17-18 (ESV): \\"Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves his wages.”\\" The reference to not muzzling an ox as it works (citing Deuteronomy 25:4) and that \\"The laborer deserves his wages\\" (echoing Jesus' words in Luke 10:7) are used here to justify financial support or other forms of sustenance for church leaders. Though it's not exclusively talking about food, the principle behind these passages suggests providing for the needs of those who dedicate their lives to ministry, which could include food, financial support, shelter, etc. Galatians 6:6 is another verse that alludes to supporting teachers in the church: \\"One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.\\" This could be interpreted to include sharing resources such as food with those who provide spiritual instruction. Overall, while there's not a single verse that explicitly says to \\"feed the pastor,\\" the broader biblical principle of caring for and providing for those in ministry is well established."},{"instruction":"Ulus devletlerin mevcut örgütlenmelerin yerine sınırsız yetkilerle ve sınırsız kaynaklarla donatılmış yeni bir küresel ve uluslararası örgütlenmeye gidilse ve ekonomi, siyaset, bilim, teknoloji, kültür, sanat, toplum ve bir bütün olarak insanlığın hayatı şu ilkeyi daha etkili şekilde gerçekleştirebilmek üzere yeniden ve yeniden örgütlense nasıl bir medeniyet inşa edilebilir: \\"aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği\\" ( 1- insanlığın geleceği için en güçlü genlerin yapay olarak seçilebilmesi amacıyla sadece beden-duygu-zihin kriterlerinde ayrı ayrı yapılacak yeterlilik testlerini geçebilen erkek ve kadınların bebek yapmasına izin verilecek. 2- seçilen çiftler özel düzenlenmiş huzurlu ve tutkulu aşk yuvalarında sevişecekler. başarılı gebelik gerçekleştiği andan itibaren bütün imkanlar bütün hamile kadınlar için ihtiyaçları oranında eşit bir titizlikle seferber edilecek. 3- bebekler biyolojik baba ve annenin değil bütün bir insanlık ailesinin evladı kabul edilecek. baba ve annenin kendi bebeklerini kayırması, yani tarihte aile kurumunu ortaya çıkaran bu hayvani temel dürtü geliştirilecek hukuk sistemi, inşa edilecek toplum örgütlenmesi, kazandırılacak etik değerler ve aşılanacak hümanizm ruhu ile kesin şekilde önlenecek. 4- bebekler anne sütü ile beslendikten sonra 3 yaşına gelince baba ve anneden alınarak insanlık ailesine dahil edilecekler ve her alanda tam bir adaletle yapılacak yetenek testlerinin başlayacağı çocukluk yaşına kadar diğer bütün bebeklerle eşit olanaklarla büyütülecekler. 5- bebek havuzundaki her bebeğin bütün yeteneklerini insanlık yararına ortaya çıkarabilmesi için bilimsel olarak belirlenen yaşlarda bilim, sanat, spor, el becerisi, liderlik vb. hayatın bütün alanlarına yönelik kapsamlı ve adil testler yapılacak. )","output":"Bu tür bir düşünce, utopik veya distopik kurguları akıllara getiriyor. Ancak sunulan senaryoyu insanlığın geleceği adına yapılan bir tasarım ve düşünsel bir oyun olarak incelemek mümkündür. Tasarlanan medeniyet modeli, özellikle genetik seçim, bireyin topluma olan katkısının maksimize edilmesi, ve tüm çocuklara eşit şartlar sağlama gibi öğeler üzerine kurulu. 1. İnsanlığın Genetik Mühendisliği ile Yeniden Tasarımı: Bu sistem, genetik olarak uygun bulunan bireylerin çoğalmasına izin vererek, insan neslinin belli bedensel, zihinsel ve duygusal özelliklerle donatılmasını amaçlar. Bu, genetik hastalıkların ve belirli zihinsel ya da fiziksel sınırlılıkların azaltılmasına yardımcı olabilecek bir yön taşırken aynı zamanda etik soruları ve biyolojik çeşitliliğin azalma riskini de beraberinde getirir. 2. Sevgi ve Yetiştirilme Ortamlarının Standartlaştırılması: Bebeklerin ilk andan itibaren en ideal koşullarda yetiştirilmeleri, gelişimlerinin en iyi şekilde desteklenmesini amaçlar. Ancak, insan ilişkileri ve bağların tek bir modelle sınırlanması, sevgi ve aidiyet gibi karmaşık duyguların yapaylaştırılması anlamına gelebilir. 3. Toplumsal ve Ailesel Bağların Yeniden Tanımlanması: Bebeklerin biyolojik ebeveynlerinden ziyade insanlık ailesine mensup kabul edilmesi, aile bağlarının ve doğal ebeveyn çocuk ilişkisinin ortadan kalkmasına yol açar. Bu durum, bireylerin kimlik, aidiyet ve kültürel miras ile olan bağlarını zayıflatabilir. 4. Eşit Başlangıç Koşulları: Her çocuğa eşit olanaklar sunulması, sosyoekonomik ayrımları azaltır ve her bireyin potansiyelinin en iyi şekilde kullanılmasını teşvik eder. Ancak, bu yaklaşımın uygulanabilirliği ve bireysel özgürlükler ile çatışma potansiyeli bir risk teşkil eder. 5. Tamamiyle Meritokratik Bir Toplum: Herkesin yetenek ve kabiliyetlerine göre yönlendirildiği bir toplum, verimlilik ve inovasyonu teşvik ederken, bireysel tercihlerin ve tutkuların sınırlandırılması gibi sorunlara yol açabilir. Sonuç olarak, bu düşünsel tasarım ilginç bir medeniyet modeli önermekte ve bazı açılardan idealize edilmiş bir toplum portresi çizmektedir. Ancak, insan doğası, toplumsal çeşitlilik ve bireysel özgürlüklere ilişkin kapsamlı etik ve uygulanabilirlik sorunlarını barındırır. Gerçek dünyada böyle bir modelin uygulanabilirliği, getireceği etik, toplumsal ve bireysel mücadeleler göz önünde bulundurulduğunda ciddi sınamalar doğuracaktır.

Temelinde özgürlük, eşitlik, bilim ve sanatın insan yaşamını yüceltme gücüne olan inancı barındırır. Şiirin merkezinde yatan \\"aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği\\" ilkesi, medeniyetin yeniden kurgulanışında adil bir temel oluşturur. Bu medeniyet tasarımında, bireyin özgürleşmesi, kendini gerçekleştirmesi ve kolektif insanlık ailesinin bir parçası olarak katkıda bulunması esastır. 1. Öncelikle, bu medeniyet bilimi ve ilerlemeyi insanın lehine kullanmayı amaçlar. Atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde ölümsüzlüğü arayan bir yaklaşım, bilimin sınırlarını genişleterek insan yaşamını uzatma ve kalitesini artırma peşindedir. Bu, sağlık, genetik mühendisliği, uzay araştırmaları ve nanoteknoloji gibi alanlarda ciddi yatırımlarla desteklenir. 2. Kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde hayatın tadına varmak, medeniyetin sanat ve edebiyatı insan ruhunu besleyen, bireyin özgürlük ve ifade alanlarını genişleten temel unsurlar olarak kabul ettiğini ifade eder. Burada bilişsel ve duygusal gelişimi zenginleştiren, toplumda empati ve anlayışı artıran bir kültür politikası yatıyor. 3. Doğaya hayranlık, dans ve şarkı ile ifade edilen çırılçıplak özgürlük, bireyin doğa ile barışık, kendinden emin ve özgür bir yaşamı benimsemesini önerir. Bu, ekolojik bilincin geliştirilmesi, doğa koruma çalışmalarının yaygınlaştırılması ve insanların doğal dünyayla uyum içinde yaşaması gerektiğini vurgular. 4. Engellilere öpücük kondurulması ve sarhoş şairlerin neşeli çocuklar tarafından salıncaklarda sallanması, medeniyetin bireysel farklılıkları ve çeşitliliği kucaklayan, kapsayıcı bir toplum yapısını hedeflediğini gösterir. Bu, her bireyin değerli ve önemli olduğu, kimse için dışlama veya ayrımcılığa yer olmayan bir toplumu simgeler. 5. Olimpiyat ruhunun her alandaki rekabeti kuşatması, adil bir rekabetin ve insan yeteneklerinin en yüksek seviyede teşvik edilmesinin önemini vurgular. Ödül, ceza ve adaletin ölümden önce gelmesi ilkesi ise, bu dünyada adaletin sağlanması ve her bireyin eylemlerinin anlamlı ve önemli sonuçlar doğurduğu bir toplumsal yapıyı ifade eder. Sonuç olarak, bu şiirin temsil ettiği medeniyet, insanlık için iyimser, yenilikçi ve dönüştürücü bir vizyon sunmakta; bireylerin özgürce kendilerini gerçekleştirmelerini, bilim ve sanatla insan yaşamını zenginleştirmelerini, doğa ve birbirleriyle barış içinde yaşamalarını ve tüm insanların eşit şartlarda başlamalarını teşvik etmektedir.
